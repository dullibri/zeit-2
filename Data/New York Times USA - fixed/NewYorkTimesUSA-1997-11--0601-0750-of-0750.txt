HEADLINE: Shaky Asia, New Shivers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
For nearly a quarter-century, Washington has usually assumed that its main allies in Asia, who are also some of America's leading economic rivals, would grow ever stronger.
That supposition has influenced scores of policy debates, from contingency planning for a collapse of North Korea to assessing counterweights to China's growing might, to measuring when to threaten sanctions in trade disputes. 
 Now the economic crisis that has swept through the region -- first in Southeast Asia, now in South Korea, where a team from the International Monetary Fund arrived today to make arrangements for a painful economic bailout -- raises the question of whether America's Asian partners may be weakened for several years.
As President Clinton begins a series of meetings in Vancouver with leaders from Asia and North and South America, his aides acknowledge that there is a risk that the economic turmoil could translate into political fragility.
There is talk for the first time of a new "domino theory" in Asia -- not one in which country after country falls to Communism, but one in which a cycle of currency devaluations, bankruptcies and austerity measures saps political strength.
"This is a region where the political power has grown directly out of economic success," one of Mr. Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers said as the President left for Vancouver to attend the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. "If Korea is going to be under the strictures of the I.M.F. for the next few years and Japan is consumed with cleaning up its own act, we have a lot of thinking to do."
One longtime veteran of the older dominoes, Donald Gregg, put it differently this weekend. Mr. Gregg, a former Ambassador to South Korea and for years one of the top Central Intelligence Agency operatives in Asia, said in an interview: "The equation has definitely been changed. Clearly it's time for President Clinton to readjust. But it is very hard to say right now how long this will last, how far it will resonate around the world or which way it could go."
Today President Clinton described Asia's problems as "a few little glitches in the road" rather than a full-blown crisis, apparently heeding the counsel of his economic aides that any deeper public ruminations about bailouts and bankruptcies could further unnerve investors around the world.
Even in private, the President's advisers are determined to sound upbeat, talking about the opportunities the economic reckoning creates for the United States to help itself by helping its major trading partners.
"There's an understanding that economic growth is not a static process," Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said today after meeting with Asian trade and foreign ministers. "The fundamentals are there to return to very high levels of growth."
Of course, economic fortunes and political influence rarely rise and fall in neatly synchronized patterns. Japan's emergence as an economic superpower in the 1980's, when it was buying Hollywood studios, the Seattle Mariners and New York skyscrapers, prompted endless debate of its impending political dominance.
But Japan never made the leap from building car plants around the world to exercising diplomatic clout. Conversely, Britain and France retain a political heft in world affairs these days that far outweighs their economic impact in the world.
But over time, economic strength counts. And the Korean Peninsula may be the first test of how money and political influence intersect.
For most of this decade, Pentagon and State Department planners drawing up scenarios for responding to a potential collapse of North Korea assumed that South Korea and Japan would be standing by with billions of dollars to invest in the North, much as West Germany invested in the East.
Without question, North Korea will need roads and manufacturing equipment, billions of dollars in new ports, a telephone system that works and a safety net for a population that periodically veers toward starvation. Whenever the North Koreans cracked open the door to foreign visits, South Korean and Japanese business executives would board the country's 1930's-era trains and, after bouncing over a bone-jarring track bed, take copious notes about where they could put their first investments.
But it is increasingly clear that far less cash will be available if the collapse happens while South Korea and Japan are working through extraordinary economic strains.
And the North has clearly sensed that, for once, South Korea is hardly in a position to use its economic power as a weapon. That may explain why the North agreed last week to head into long-delayed talks about negotiating a peace treaty that would formally end the Korean War.
"The effects are subtle, but what is happening to the South Korean economy definitely hurts," said Han Sung Joo, who was South Korea's Foreign Minister during the 1994 nuclear inspection standoff with North Korea, when the United States and South Korea came perilously close to renewed military confrontation with North Korea.
"Any linkage of their concessions to our willingness to provide economic assistance will clearly ring hollow to the North Koreans," he added.
But Mr. Han insists that any weakness on South Korea's part will be temporary.
"This was a preventable crisis, one that arose from a real absence of leadership," he said. "There are a lot of people, though, who are secretly hopeful that having an outside force begin to regulate things will result in reforms happening a lot faster than they would have."
Korea will not be the only test case of how economic and political power converge.
As the Southeast Asian countries have grown richer in recent years, they have also begun a significant military buildup -- politely called a "modernization," so as not to cause alarm among neighbors -- that was clearly aimed at dissuading China from extending its influence.
"We are going to see a significant slowdown in arms procurement, and that will almost certainly lead to a rise in fears about China," Masashi Nishihara, one of Japan's leading defense experts, said in a telephone interview.
In Japan, Professor Nishihara said, pressure will grow to pare back the billions of dollars that the Japanese Government spends each year to maintain America's huge military presence in Okinawa and the Japanese mainland.
"You can see the disagreements with the United States starting on this," he said. "And the political pressure to cut back in Japan could easily intersect with a lot of frustration in Washington as the trade deficit grows."
Just today, Japanese officials said, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley once again warned his Japanese counterparts against exporting their way out of their economic troubles.
That course, always a tempting one for Japanese companies encountering a stagnant economy at home, would cause cause Washington's politically sensitive trade deficit with Japan to surge, ending what has been two years of relative trade peace.
Should Japan's economic troubles worsen before they get better -- and most economists believe that they will, with more huge financial failures like the closing today of Yamaichi Securities, the country's oldest brokerage -- the effects may be seen around the world.
Japan emerged in the 1980's as the world's largest supplier of foreign aid. That budget has been slashed once in the last year, and it seems certain to be slashed again.
Of course, all of this creates opportunities for the United States as well. For years American companies have complained that it is too expensive to invest in Japan; now they can pick up companies on the cheap. By the same token, American companies that have long complained that Japan is cornering key growth markets, like Vietnam, now have a chance to move while the Japanese are distracted.
American officials say that it is still too early to assess which way the economic ripples will radiate.
"You can see a little piece here and a little piece there," Ms. Barshefsky said today, "and clearly in all the Asian countries, the immediate resources will be reduced.
"But you have to remember that all the attributes that made these countries the engines of Asia are still there, and they'll be back."

State Losing People To Land of Blue Skies

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
New Jersey is losing population and millions of tax dollars -- to states with more attractive weather and financial climates, Federal figures show.
About 144,000 more taxpaying families moved out of the state than moved in from 1992 to 1995, for a net earnings loss of $4.4 billion, according to Internal Revenue Service data. 
 Why the loss? Figures show that the states where most of the New Jerseyans have gone have warmer weather, lower taxes, cheaper housing and less congestion, The Press of Atlantic City reported yesterday.
Some experts say the state needs to pay careful attention to the effect of the loss on state finances. Donald Linky, of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey, said the loss was "a negative sign about confidence in New Jersey's future."
Others, however, say it is of little significance to the state's economy. James Hughes, an economist at Rutgers University, and the State Commerce Commissioner, Gil Medina, said the loss was less than 1 percent of New Jersey's $2.9 trillion income base.
The decline indicated in the most recent figures is no cause for alarm, Mr. Hughes said. Except for a period in the 1950's and 60's when the population shifted rapidly to the suburbs, in recent decades New Jersey has more typically lost population rather than gained, regardless of the state economy or taxes, he said.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she had done just about all she could to make the state an attractive place to live, including cutting income taxes and creating jobs.
Still, she said, "The Northeast is very expensive. There's no two ways about it."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
A Victorian Skinflint Who's Liberal at Heart

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
In some parts of this county and abroad, Ebenezer Scrooge, as played by Roddy McDowall in this year's version of "A Christmas Carol" at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, could get himself elected to high office.
After all, the man is firmly opposed to the welfare state handouts that are troubling so many economies. He favors prisons and workhouses over crime and begging. He believes in hard work and thrift. He worries about uncontained population growth and therefore looks upon death (when it comes to others, of course) as a blessing. 
 Sure, he's a bit blunt in expressing his ideas, but that flaw is nothing that a good spinmeister couldn't fix in a jiffy.
So it's something of a tribute to Mr. McDowall, who is alternating with Hal Linden in the role of Scrooge this year, that he makes such a forceful case for the old skinflint before an assault by apparitions turns him into a sentimental old liberal for the grand finale.
Mr. McDowall's performance restores some much-needed balance to a show that all but subsumes Charles Dickens's classic Christmas tale beneath soulless spectacle. And that is welcome news for those who make their way into a theater whose antechambers intersect Victoriana of the 1880's with the bottom line of the 1990's. Buskers, bobbies and carolers line the passageways where peddlers are hawking everything from costumed teddy bears to that least Victorian of refreshments, the egg cream.
Scrooge of Scrooge & Marley would be amused.
Anyway, Mr. McDowall may not be a Pavarotti when it comes to carrying a tune or a Schwarzenegger when it comes to hoisting Tiny Tim on his shoulder, but as they say in school, he works and plays well with others and makes the most of the rare comic line.
The Tony Walton sets are still impressive, the Alan Menken music and Lynn Ahrens lyrics are serviceable if unmemorable; the cast, with its ghosts, ghouls, Cratchits and old Londoners from beadles to butchers and bankers, goes about its tasks with good will, and the show, playing through Jan. 4 and directed by Mike Ockrent, moves along at a brisk pace.
This "Christmas Carol" may not be all Dickens, but it's all right.
 
A CHRISTMAS CAROL
 
Based on the story by Charles Dickens; music by Alan Menken; lyrics by Lynn Ahrens; book by Mike Ockrent and Ms. Ahrens; directed by Mr. Ockrent; choreography by Susan Stroman; sets by Tony Walton; costumes by William Ivey Long; lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer; sound by Tony Meola; projections, Wendall K.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against the Yen After the Failure of Yamaichi

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished slightly higher against the Japanese yen yesterday and edged lower against the German mark in subdued trading after the failure of a major Japanese brokerage firm.
The Japanese financial markets were closed yesterday for a national holiday. That and the coming Thanksgiving break kept dealings quiet after Yamaichi Securities became the biggest Japanese company to collapse since World War II and the third Japanese financial company to fail in less than a month. 
 The dollar's gains were also limited because the currency has already risen sharply against the yen in the last month while Japan's economic troubles worsened amid a slump in Asia's financial markets.
"I think people are getting a bit numb to Japanese companies closing up shop," said John Hazelton, chief currency trader at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company.
The dollar peaked at 127.23 yen when European trading began, but retreated later to settle at 126.80 yen in New York, up from 126.40 late Friday. The dollar cost 1.7375 marks, down from 1.7384. The British pound was quoted at $1.6906, down from $1.6932. The dollar ended mixed in other dealings.
Mr. Hazelton said many traders hesitated to make major moves before seeing how Japan's stock market reacted to Yamaichi's failure.
The dollar's climb against the yen was partly contained by concern about the Bank of Japan's possible intervention to buy yen for dollars if the United States currency's advance was deemed excessive. Many traders regard the intervention threshold as 127.45 yen, the nearly five-year high reached by the dollar last May.
The Yamaichi collapse pushed the yen lower against the mark as well, which indirectly helped the German currency strengthen a bit against the dollar despite a sign that Germany's economy was not growing fast enough to merit a rise in interest rates. The German Government reported yesterday that producer prices fell by a tenth of a percent in October, confounding expectations of a rise and suggesting that Germany's central bank would not have to raise rates to repress inflation. Higher interest rates tend to raise demand for a country's currency.

HEADLINE: What the Fed Can't Do

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bob Herbert (column, Nov. 20) says "it is national policy to keep the unemployment rate artificially high" and that "Alan Greenspan's purpose in life is to protect the assets of the very wealthy." Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, does not simply wake up in the morning and choose the unemployment rate. All the Federal Reserve can do is print money and lend it. 
 It is widely accepted that, in the short term, if the Fed prints too much it can bring down unemployment and accelerate inflation. But does Mr. Herbert really imagine that the Fed can permanently lower unemployment? While it is true that unexpected inflation hurts lenders and helps borrowers, inflation itself is hardly regarded as a plus by most Americans.

HEADLINE: A Small Start To U.S. Deficit

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The 1998 fiscal year has barely begun and already the Government's budget deficit is running below 1997, which had the smallest deficit in 23 years.
The deficit in October -- the first month of the 1998 budget year -- totaled $35.6 billion, down 11 percent from $39.8 billion the previous October, the Government reported today. Federal revenue for the month totaled $114.9 billion and spending was $150.5 billion. 
 Even with the good start, few analysts predict that the current year will beat the $22.3 billion deficit for all of the 1997 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. That was the smallest budget gap since 1974.
The Clinton Administration is predicting a $58.3 billion deficit in 1998.
Legislation promising a balanced budget by 2002 has been enacted. But the deficit is forecast to be higher for several years because tax cuts are taking effect before most of the spending cuts.
In addition, most economists expect the economy to slow in 1998. Thus the rapid growth of tax revenue, which helped reduce the 1997 shortfall, should slow as well.

HEADLINE: Nabisco Offers to Buy $1.23 Billion in Notes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PARSIPPANY, N.J., Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Nabisco Holdings Corporation offered today to purchase $1.23 billion of Nabisco Inc. notes due in 1999 and 2000, as it seeks to secure lower interest rates on its debt.
The company, based in Parsip pany, said it planned to finance the transaction with short-term debt, saving $1 million to $1.5 million in interest payments in 1998 for each $100 million in bonds tendered. 
 The company said the move, which would leave it with about 45 percent of its total debt in floating-rate notes, was aimed at taking advantage of lower interest rates. The company may refinance the debt with longer-term borrowings at a later time.
Fred Taylor, a Salomon Brothers analyst, said the bonds were "going to come due relatively soon anyway. The company will consider long-term debt at the appropriate time."
Mr. Taylor said that might occur after Nabisco was spun off from the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, which owns 80.5 percent of Nabisco's shares and which has said it will seek a spinoff before the end of 1998.
Also, Nabisco, which last week named James Kilts, a former Kraft executive, as its chief executive effective Jan. 1, might sell off some assets to focus on making Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, giving it advantageous borrowing rates later.

HEADLINE: Thunder Over Asia

 BODY:
As President Clinton meets with leaders of the Asia-Pacific rim in Vancouver this week, financial turmoil threatens the Asian economic "miracle" on which their partnership is based. The paradox of the summit meeting, however, is that the bailouts in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, not to mention the failure of some big banks and securities firms in Japan, are driving home lessons of fiscal discipline better than the Clinton Administration ever could. The turbulence might tempt some countries to back away from harsh measures, but they should realize that the markets are demanding long-postponed moves to open financial systems to scrutiny and competition, lower trade barriers and reduce government economic regulation.
The economic problems in Asia could also send a signal to the world's other "big emerging markets," as Administration officials call them. While the Asian successes were all built partly on healthy habits of education, saving and shrewd investment, too much corruption and cronyism was involved. The South Korean economy, for example, has long been anchored by large, secretive family-run business groups known as chaebols, which government regulators allowed to incur excessive debt without disclosure to regulators or investors. 
 Exacting discipline in Asian countries will be painful, especially if it leads to widespread job losses or wage reductions. But the United States needs to reiterate the importance of full transparency by companies and financial institutions. In South Korea, for example, leading businesses want to repeal one of the most important reforms of President Kim Young Sam, the rule requiring bank depositors to maintain accounts in their own names. The rule, instituted to reduce corruption, must be kept if Korean companies are to regain credibility in the international markets. Similar vigilance against corruption must be pressed in Indonesia, where relatives of President Suharto are trying to prevent the closing of banks they control.
In recent decades, the Asian "tigers" have looked to Japan for leadership, and in the current crisis Japan can show the way with its own reforms. The postwar boom in Japan was built on an elaborate system of government support, much of it undisclosed, including favorable loans and lax regulation. Collusive practices were not only tolerated, they were encouraged. Over the weekend, in an action that would have been unthinkable until recently, Japan allowed the shutdown of its fourth-largest brokerage firm, Yamaichi Securities, which has now revealed $2 billion in previously undisclosed off-the-book debts.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has long talked about the need for Japan to open its financial system to more scrutiny. The first step for any country toward regaining financial credibility in the world markets is to acknowledge the extent of its problems candidly, to itself and its own people.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. to Open Phone Market To Foreigners

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Federal regulators plan to take a major step today to open America's $200 billion telecommunications market to foreign competition, hoping to lower international calling rates for consumers and bolster opportunities for American communications companies elsewhere in the world.
The five-member Federal Communications Commission will vote today to approve rules carrying out February's World Trade Organization agreement to liberalize international telecommunications, commission officials said yesterday. The ruling will make it much easier for foreign carriers to offer service in the United States, increasing competition and potentially driving down prices. 
 The commission also plans to increase to 49 percent from 25 percent the limit on how much of an American communications carrier can be owned by foreign entities without passing a difficult Federal review.
"I'm very confident that we'll be able to approve this unanimously," William E. Kennard, the commission's new chairman, said yesterday. "It is a significant step toward bringing competition to worldwide telecommunications markets and it will be particularly good for American companies, who are well poised to take advantage of these market-opening opportunities."
For years, the F.C.C. has forced foreign carriers that want to offer service between the United States and their home markets to demonstrate that their native territory is open to American companies. So far only Britain, Sweden and New Zealand have passed that test.
Under the new rules, the commission will normally allow companies from all 132 W.T.O. nations to market to American customers and deliver services to America's shores, Mr. Kennard said.
But the commission has apparently decided not to extend tough international pricing rules it adopted in August to foreign carriers that resell services from other telephone companies. The rules affect settlement rates, the payments phone companies make to each other to complete calls. MCI Communications and AT&T had lobbied the commission to extend the rules, which would place a greater burden on their foreign competitors.
Mr. Kennard declined to comment on whether the commission would vote today on extending the August pricing rules.
In February, 69 countries representing more than 90 percent of the global $600 billion telecommunications market signed an agreement in Geneva to open their communications arenas to foreign companies. The agreement, which does not require Congressional approval, is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1.
Today's rulings by the F.C.C. are expected to be the last official actions required to bring the United States into line with the Geneva accord.
"It's an enormous step forward," said Scott Blake Harris, a former chief of the F.C.C.'s international bureau who is now a partner at the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
"You'll see far more foreign capital available for investment in our infrastructure," he said. "You'll also see foreign carriers seeking to compete in the international services market and you will start to see a drop in international calling rates. And through the next few years you will see the same thing rolling across the globe."
Big American long-distance companies like AT&T and the MCI could see their share of the nation's $12 billion international calling market fall as foreign communications giants like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom start offering service directly to American businesses and consumers.
But Mr. Kennard and some analysts expect American companies to more than recoup that loss as they take advantage of newly opened markets in other parts of the world. Because the United States is by far the world's largest telecommunications market, today's action is expected to spur other countries to fulfill their responsibilities under the W.T.O accord to open their markets.
"The rest of the world will be watching to see how completely we implement the W.T.O., and we are implementing it completely," Mr. Harris said. "That will persuade many others to do the right thing in their countries."
Mr. Kennard said, "American companies are going to be the prime beneficiaries because as competition spreads internationally they are in the best position to take advantage of these opportunities."
In August the commission issued an unprecedented ruling that would have the effect of forcing foreign carriers to lower the prices they charge American carriers for terminating international calls.
The pricing "benchmarks," as the F.C.C. calls them, normally would not take effect until 1999. But foreign carriers that apply to offer service in the United States under the W.T.O. agreement using their own equipment would have to comply immediately.
AT&T and MCI lobbied the commission extensively, seeking to have the commission extend the immediate-compliance rule to foreign companies that buy calling time in bulk from other carriers and resell it at a profit, instead of using their own equipment.
Resale is usually an easier option for entering new markets than building new telecommunications systems. It is usually more popular as well.
"We want the F.C.C. to use all means at its disposal to bring accounting rates closer to costs," Sheila Blackwell, an MCI spokeswoman, said yesterday. "The W.T.O. agreement rests on the principle that foreign dominant carriers will not be permitted to distort competition in the U.S. market."
AT&T declined to comment yesterday.
Foreign carriers, including Cable and Wireless P.L.C. and Kokusai Denshin Denwa, the dominant Japanese international telephone company, had pushed for the August rules not to be extended. The two Virginia Senators, John W. Warner, a Republican, and Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, also sent letters to the commission urging it not to expand the pricing rules, according to people close to the commission.
The offices of the two Senators said they could not confirm that yesterday.
As put by Scott Cleland, an analyst in Washington for the Legg Mason Precursor Group: "This is a microcosm of the traditional free trade versus protectionist debate. AT&T and MCI are worried that if they play fair and their foreign counterparts don't that the imbalance will skew to their disadvantage."
But according to people close to the commission, the F.C.C. intends to deny the requests from the American carriers under the theory that extending the pricing rules would hamper competition in the American market.

HEADLINE: For White Goods, A World Beckons;
But New Markets Are Tough Going

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
In 1994, the Harvard Business Review featured a long interview with David R. Whitwam, the chief executive of the Whirlpool Corporation, entitled "The Right Way to Go Global."
In case anyone doubted the value of Mr. Whitwam's wisdom, a chart accompanied the article, showing how Whirlpool's returns to shareholders in the 1990's were far outdistancing those of the stock market in general. 
 Shortly thereafter, though, Mr. Whitwam went from hero to goat on Wall Street. Whirlpool, the maker of major home appliances, or "white goods," that is based in Benton Harbor, Mich., stumbled in Europe, sending its stock tumbling from a peak of $74 a share to less than $50 in a matter of months. And two months ago, with continuing European problems compounded by heavy losses from more recent investments in China, Whirlpool told shareholders it needed to set aside $350 million -- more than its projected earnings for all of 1997 -- to retrench.
It's not easy going global. Companies typically dream that breaking into foreign markets will provide hordes of new customers. But for all the benefits, the reality all too often is also overexposure to volatile currencies and troubled relationships with foreign partners. In developing countries like China, vague and shifting laws governing taxation and commerce add to the riskiness of big investments. And in developed markets like the United States and Europe, the rules may be clearer but there are often so many entrenched players that newcomers pay heavily for the slightest tactical slip-up.
It is hard enough for the leaders of high-technology industries like Intel in semiconductors or Boeing in aerospace to conquer new territory. Nor have icons of American culture like Coca-Cola, Disney or McDonald's been able to simply waltz into foreign markets after laying down barrages of advertising.
But the business Whirlpool is in may well be among the toughest for corporations with global ambitions. The marketer's home run -- a truly global brand name like Coke or Marlboro that is capable of capturing both mass markets and premium prices -- may be beyond anyone's reach in the $80 billion white goods industry. Not only are there countless variations in what consumers in different countries want from cooking, washing and refrigeration products based on how they live, but in most countries there are already well-established local competitors that cater to those preferences.
"The home is the most culture-bound part of one's life," said John A. Quelch, a Harvard Business School professor who studies globalization issues. "Consumers in Paris don't care what kind of refrigerator they are using in New York."
That condemns multinational appliance companies to nation-by-nation trench warfare. "This is the most competitive of all G.E.'s businesses," said David Cote, head of the General Electric Company's appliance operations, which are based in Louisville, Ky., and had revenues last year of $6.5 billion.
Virtually every company Whirlpool competes with also has globalization bruises. Its latest bad news came just months after Electrolux, based in Sweden, announced a $320 million write-off to pay for shedding 12,000 workers and closing 25 plants in several countries. It is just two years since the Maytag Corporation sold its Hoover subsidiaries overseas, giving up on a six-year effort to penetrate Europe that cost it several hundred million dollars. And G.E. fled Brazil in the 1980's after incurring heavy losses there.
Overcapacity is particularly endemic in Europe, the biggest foreign market. Unlike the United States, where the top four manufacturers account for 90 percent of sales and Whirlpool, G.E. and Maytag all have enjoy double-digit operating margins, the top four in Europe have just 55 percent of sales and face off against more than 300 local manufacturers. Many of these smaller rivals are willing to initiate price wars and other scorched-earth tactics to increase or at least preserve their market share.
"They know that Europe is going to end up consolidating like the United States and that the companies that might buy them are not looking for last year's profits but space on the retail shelf," said Susan Anthony, an analyst at Schroder Securities in London, said of the small companies.
Market saturation is also a problem in China, where the number of local and foreign manufacturers plunging into the appliance business has outstripped the spending power of the Chinese consumer.
So why not stay home? Though globalization has become a bit of a corporate cliche -- with endless talk of the global economy, global markets, global competitiveness, global forces, global imperatives and even global citizens in a global village -- even skeptics see attractions for those who stayed focused.
Developing countries are the only places in the world where major appliance sales are growing at double-digit percentage rates. Even as it suffered in Europe, Whirlpool had sales growing at a 25 percent to 30 percent rate in Brazil in recent years.
There's also the potential cost savings in global procurement and manufacturing; the opportunity to profit from being the first to transfer new technology between continents, and the benefits in recruiting management talent from a bigger, more diverse pool.
For all the difficulties, most of the big appliance makers have concluded they must remain engaged in the globalization fray. The issues are how to dodge setbacks where possible and try, try again where necessary. Thus, G.E. last year reversed direction and bought a Brazilian stove maker in an effort to return to Latin America's biggest market. Whirlpool contends its European business is growing and will be back in the black by 1998, and Mr. Whitwam calls its decision to sell two of its four ventures in China a "temporary retreat." Maytag, although still sour on Europe, has a $35 million year-old joint venture producing washing machines in China and plans to invest a similar amount to expand into refrigerators.
At the moment, Mr. Cote of G.E. would be more likely to get a call than Mr. Whitwam if the Harvard Business Review wanted to revisit its 1994 subject. His cautious tactics have emphasized preserving G.E.'s industry-leading operating margins. While all its major rivals have invested in manufacturing capacity in China, for example, G.E. bought 80 percent of a Chinese distribution company and has used that venture to find Chinese companies to make G.E.-designed products under contract. Total sales this year will not amount to much more than $20 million but, with very little money invested, they will generate a positive return on assets.
Similarly, though G.E. has a strong base in Britain through Hotpoint, which it operates as a joint venture with Britain's General Electric Company (the two namesakes are unrelated), it has chosen to nibble at the luxury end of rest of the European market. It courts noted kitchen designers and wealthy customers familiar with its name by importing products rather than pay a premium price to acquire a European manufacturer big enough to allow it to fight an all-out war with leaders like Electrolux, Bosch-Siemens and Whirlpool. And it licenses some European manufacturers to sell their products under the G.E. name.
"Our goal is to be the most profitable appliance company," Mr. Cote said. "We don't necessarily have to manufacture."
But other international giants are going all out to make G.E.'s current strategy look short-sighted.
Electrolux, the world's largest appliance maker, may face the biggest struggle. It has made itself the European leader through acquisitions, but has produced disappointing earnings as it struggled to integrate them better. In the United States, it acquired big-name brands -- notably Frigidaire in 1986 -- but underestimated how much investment was needed to rebuild them.
The challenge of sorting Electrolux out fell early this year to Michael Treschow, a 53-year-old executive who had been running Atlas Copco, a Swedish mining and metals multinational that like Electrolux is part of the constellation of public companies controlled by the Wallenberg family. Within a month of switching jobs, Mr. Treschow delighted analysts by announcing Electrolux's huge streamlining program.
"We are trying to get margins, which are now under 4 percent, back up above 6.5 percent in the next two years," Mr. Treschow said. One aim is to develop more products like the new Euro-oven, which attempts to address the varied product preferences of Europe's fragmented markets with 46 minor variations on a single platform. The goal is to simplify everything from procurement and manufacturing to customer service.
Also on the move is Bosch-Siemens, a joint venture of two of Germany's biggest companies, Robert A. Bosch G.m.b.H. and Siemens A.G. Three years ago, Bosch-Siemens acquired Brazil's largest maker of cooking appliances, and has since built factories to make refrigerators and washing and drying machines in that country, and started construction of a refrigerator factory in Peru. Its newer ventures have begun taking share from both Whirlpool, the market leader through its majority control of Brasmotor S.A., and Electrolux, according to Roger Wright, an industry analyst at Garantia, a Brazilian investment bank.
Whirlpool stepped up its investment in Latin America recently but is also committed to recovering from its international missteps. It has the most on the line in Europe, where it became a big player overnight in 1989 by acquiring the appliance arm of Philips N.V., the Dutch conglomerate. Part of the $2 billion deal, which was completed in stages, required Whirlpool to replace the famous Philips brand with its own within five years, thus imposing a huge marketing burden that helped drive the business into the red after a promising start.
But such challenges have neither dampened Mr. Whitwam's optimism nor caused him to recant much of what he said in 1994 when Whirlpool was riding high. "Everything we based our strategic plans on has happened and we are further along than I envisioned," he said in a recent interview at Whirlpool's headquarters in Benton Harbor.
"We have probably realized no more than a third of the benefits of creating an integrated global company so far," he said. "We never expected this industry to get there in the 90's."

When it comes to appliances, what sells in Peoria may be a bust in Paris, as manufacturers learned in the early 1990's when they tried to build global brands. Some of those companies, chastened but convinced they have no other choice, are again venturing abroad -- this time more cautiously. Graphs look at the sales of some industry leaders, 1993-96.
 
It will spend $350 million to streamline its struggling European and Chinese units, but Whirlpool foresees profits for both in the near future. Its Mexican affiliate fell into the red in 1995 after the currency crisis.
 
The company sold its overseas Hoover subsidiaries two years ago, pulling out of Europe and Australia. Now it has entered Asia by buying a small Chinese manufacturing company.
 
Earlier this year it announced a $320 million charge to close factories and lay off workers in Europe, its home base. In the United States it has lost money and had little success lifting its market share.
 
It fled Brazil in the 1980's after heavy losses. Now it is trying to come back by buying a Brazilian stove maker. In Europe and China, it has moved slowly with small investments.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Pleased With U.S. Economy

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The United States economy looks well balanced in its seventh year of growth, with surprisingly low inflation despite tight labor markets, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report today.
"The United States has enjoyed a year of exceptionally good economic performance," the Paris-based group of 29 industrial countries said in its annual review. "This is all the more remarkable in this, the seventh year of economic expansion." 
 The O.E.C.D. forecast that gross domestic product in the United States in 1997 would grow by 3.8 percent, the fastest rate among the group's seven largest members and the highest since 1988.
The annual review, whose content was approved on Oct. 8, predicted that above-trend growth would continue through spring and said the inflation rate could increase to around 3 percent from its current level of just above 2 percent.
The O.E.C.D. said that keeping prices in check would probably require the Federal Reserve to raise short-term borrowing costs by as much as three-quarters of a percentage point "to curb some interest-sensitive demand."
The Fed last changed monetary policy on March 25, when it lifted the Federal funds overnight lending rate by a quarter-percentage point, to 5.5 percent. Despite the tightening, long-term interest rates and other market rates are lower since the spring. "As a result, all of the restrictive effect of the March tightening has since been undone in the interim," the O.E.C.D. said. The group saw the biggest inflation risk coming from the labor market.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
President Using Fund-Raising Speeches to Test Campaign Themes for '98

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
He gives the speeches late at night, after the sorbet has puddled and most reporters are past their deadlines. Working from sketchy notes after long days, President Clinton often rambles, and he sometimes wanders off on tangents, as when he recently called the Internet "the fastest growing human organism in all of history."
But as he delivers speech after speech at fund-raisers, President Clinton can be heard these days puzzling through the proposals and starting to develop a message that his aides say he hopes will, in final form, carry Democrats to a majority in Congress next year. 
 No two speeches are identical, but almost all fit a rough template: Mr. Clinton presents a starkly partisan review of his record in office, crediting himself and the Democrats with deeds like cutting the budget deficit and and humanely changing the welfare system but skipping right past the Democrats' deep internal rift over trade. He mixes that political message with a sweeping analysis of American history and a philosophical, searching look at how the country should grapple with technological and economic change.
"He's noodling," one of Mr. Clinton's senior aides said. "He's in noodle mode. He's asking questions that are on his mind."
The President's recent defeat on legislation that would have increased his authority in trade negotiations has persuaded Mr. Clinton that he needs to do a better job of articulating his economic goals, aides said. As Mr. Clinton himself put it at a recent fund-raiser here, "We have to have a new definition of security in a more dynamic world."
Sometimes, that notion prompts the President to fire questions at the silent guests, as he did on Saturday at a dinner near Seattle. How can the United States benefit from "this huge technological and information revolution" while preserving "some sort of coherent life for ourselves, our families, our communities, and our nation?" he asked. "How do we preserve the common good as we break down the old bureaucracies, the old established ways of doing things and all of that?"
Such questioning can lead Mr. Clinton down vague, theoretical byways, as it did that night. "There are a lot of very brilliant people who believe that the nation-state is fast becoming a relic of the past," he said.
But it can also prompt an enumeration of policies that he says were meant to address people's anxieties. Many times, he cites his tax credits for education and his efforts to protect pensions. And he sketches other policies he hopes to enact.
"The next big challenge is child care," Mr. Clinton said at a recent fund-raiser here, noting the tensions between work and home life. "And I think we are really going to have to work hard to find the way -- and the Government can't afford all this -- we've got to find a way to have a quality child care network in America that's safe and affordable."
As that statement indicates, Mr. Clinton is still formulating his ideas, and, aides said, pushing his staff to develop specific policies. But as he races between fund-raisers, he leaves no doubt which party he thinks will do the better job of salving economic fears.
"I believe history will record that at this moment in time our views were right and that we prepared the world -- prepared America -- for a totally new world," Mr. Clinton said on Saturday at a lunch in Denver.
In contrast to his cheery bipartisanship at most events in Washington, the President's comments at fund-raisers can be brutally partisan. He repeatedly conjures images of Republican hit men by attacking the "Contract on America."
Mr. Clinton often argues that Republicans won votes in 1994 by scaring people about his economic package and stance on gun control. Now, he says, enough time has passed to show the rightness of his positions.
"Sooner or later," he said at a reception in Las Vegas, Nev., "people should be held accountable."
Repeatedly saying that the United States is better off than it was when he came into office, Mr. Clinton credits Democrats with caring about the environment and with reducing crime. "If you talk to the police officers of the country, they believe it's because of the ideas advanced by the Democratic Party," Mr. Clinton assured donors at one event.
Just in the last 11 days, Mr. Clinton has spoken at 13 fund-raisers for his party, for individual candidates and for a nonprofit group. The Democrats are more than $14 million in debt, largely because of legal bills incurred because of investigations into how the Clinton team raised money for the 1996 Presidential campaign. These dinners regularly raise $300,000 or more.
One senior White House aide that Mr. Clinton was just beginning to formulate next year's political message.
"We're in an interlude now," this aide said, adding that Mr. Clinton would practice with these speeches, "shadow-boxing, and then we'll get the first real crack in the State of the Union."
Mr. Clinton is said to prefer small events, with 75 or so people, to what one aide called "2,000-people cattle calls." He stands up with notes on a long, narrow card to guide him. He thanks his hosts, compliments their inevitably vast home, tells a reminiscence or a joke about the city or someone at one of the circular tables.
Often, Mr. Clinton lays out a grand theme. "Now that I have been President for five years," he said at a dinner two weeks ago in Las Vegas, "I tend to have a little bit of detachment and see a lot of the specific struggles and contests and efforts we're making as part of the broad sweep of American history."
In general, Mr. Clinton devotes the first section of his speeches to reviewing his efforts to reposition his party ideologically, to achieve what he called at one event "a new politics for a new era."
At times, he can sound defensive.
"I get so tired of hearing our friends in the Republican Party and some of our friends in the press say, 'Oh, the President caved in and signed the Republicans' welfare bill,' " Mr. Clinton said at an event on Tuesday evening. "It's a load of bull." After reviewing his record, Mr. Clinton looks ahead to the rest of his term, usually in less detail.
Mr. Clinton never fails to thank his donors, routinely, if a bit incongruously, pairing his thanks with a call for tighter campaign finance laws. He assures them of the "direct connection" between their contributions and the success of his policies.
"I think our country is better because of what you have done," Mr. Clinton said at a dinner here recently. "This is an act of high citizenship, what you're doing."

HEADLINE: A Withering Little Town Sees Its Salvation in an Old Asylum

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WESTON, W.Va.

 BODY:
Like the center of many other towns in West Virginia, downtown Weston is a sad-looking place, made almost obsolete by the strip malls closer to the Interstate. Only a handful of shops remain open for business on Main Avenue, the central thoroughfare, and pedestrians are rare.
But these are hardly mournful souls, the 4,994 who live here in Lewis County's largest community: many believe rejuvenation may be only a handshake away. Just across the West Fork River, which ambles through town, stands the silver bullet that local leaders hope will profoundly change the character of Weston, the county, maybe all of central West Virginia. 
 "I don't even think it has sunk in yet -- we'll be a whole different town," said Patricia Minehardt, president of the county's Economic Development Authority.
In 1994, the Weston State Hospital, a massive sandstone complex that served as West Virginia's largest mental institution, closed after 130 years. The hospital, sitting at the front of 300 acres, was built during the Civil War as the Lunatic Asylum West of the Alleghenys and continued operating, under various names, until a new psychiatric hospital opened at the western edge of Weston three years ago. Along the way, the old hospital gained designation as a national historic landmark.
Now Tennessee developers intrigued by Weston's central location -- the town is easily accessible by Interstate highway, and a new state park is opening nearby -- want to transform the old hospital and its grounds into Weston Grande Resort, with a luxury hotel, a golf course, restaurants, an office complex, a convention center, condominiums and 165 single-family houses that would sell for as much as $200,000 each, nearly five times the current median value of a Lewis County home.
"There will be nothing second class about this proposal," said Charles W. Wilson, a lawyer working closely with local officials who sought proposals on what use to make of the old place and then chose the idea submitted by the Archidesign Group of Pigeon Forge, Tenn., a company that helped design Dollywood, the Pigeon Forge theme park named for Dolly Parton. (Other bidders for the Weston project had proposed a prison, a health care center or a museum.)
The developers, required to submit their formal plans to the state by early December, could wait months for approval. But Alan E. Dillow, Archidesign's president, says that he envisions no problems and that the $90 million complex could open as early as mid-2000, drawing tourists from the Middle Atlantic region.
Robin S. Poling, executive director of the Economic Development Authority, says that the old hospital's past is "part of the aura that attracts the developers" and that construction of a national museum on mental health is being contemplated as part of the project.
As its original admissions logs show, the old asylum treated all manner of problems, among them "religious excitement," "parents were cousins," "fever and loss of lawsuit" and "desertion by husband." Originally designed to accommodate 250 patients, through expansion it served almost 2,400 by the 1950's, and not just the mentally ill: tuberculosis patients were ultimately housed in one building, the criminally insane in another.
As for the planned resort, many here can hardly contain their enthusiasm, confident that a deal will create several hundred permanent jobs and spur the kind of economic development not seen in these parts since mid-century, when three manufacturing plants made Weston a major center of glass-blown products. Only one plant remains, and Weston's unemployment, hovering around 7.8 percent, is well above the national rate of 4.7.
"I hope to heaven this happens," Ruth Bragg, a 77-year-old lifelong Weston resident, said as she waited to have her hair done at the New Image beauty shop, one of the few thriving businesses in town. "I don't care if they put in girlie joints. It'll be good for the town."
The shop's owner, Sheila Sayre, agreed. "It'll bring a lot more business here," Ms. Sayre said. "I have three grown kids, and they all went out of town to find jobs."
Given the potential for job creation and economic rebirth, and the prestige a lavish resort would bring, it is almost impossible to find anyone in town who opposes the project outright, although some are leery.
Beyond the southwest corner of the hospital grounds is a working-class neighborhood of old single-family homes on narrow streets, where residents confess that they know little of the town's revitalization plans and that what they do know is based on rumor.
Robert Blake, 62, a disabled heavy-equipment operator who has lived in Weston for 50 years, says he has heard that the developers intend to buy all the houses in the area and move people out. William F. Buckhannon, a retired state employee, says he understands that the resort will have gambling, which he opposes.
Actually the purchase of existing private homes is not part of the deal, and the developers have no plans to offer gambling. But other residents express concern that so massive an undertaking will overwhelm the neighborhood, shattering its quiet. Carol Cowger, a mother of four children who like to play outside, says she worries about traffic.
And Laura Ashford, a 17-year-old high school senior, says she has heard that the plans call for "golf courses, indoor pools and horse stables," leading her to wonder how that kind of luxury can exist beside homes that are decidedly frayed.
"I wouldn't want to go to a five-star hotel and look at my backyard," Ms. Ashford said.
Local leaders insist that they have studied all aspects of the project and cannot identify a single negative consequence. Their only fear, they say, is some unforeseen glitch that could stall or even cancel the project, forcing them to reconsider other ideas.
"I feel in my heart that this community will not throw up its hands and quit," Ms. Poling said. "We will persevere. We will be pro-active. This is too important not to be."

HEADLINE: Study Casts Doubt On Wisdon Of Mandatory Terms for Drugs

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Among drug offenders sentenced to long, mandatory terms in Massachusetts state prisons, nearly half have no record of violent crime, according to a study of the state's prison population released today.
"Mandatory sentencing laws are wasting prison resources on nonviolent, low-level offenders and reducing resources available to lock up violent offenders," said William N. Brownsberger, the study's principal investigator and an assistant attorney general, who conducted the study at Harvard Medical School while he was on leave.
Drug policy experts say the study will add valuable facts to the growing debate around the country over the efficacy of tough minimum sentences for drug crimes.
"We have to respond to drug dealing forcibly and incarceration is often an appropriate response," Mr. Brownsberger said, "but today we are going too far."
The study of 1,175 inmates in the Massachusetts prison system also found that 82.9 percent of the drug offenders were black or Hispanic, though they make up just over 9 percent of the state's population.
And when researchers looked closely at the criminal records of a sample of 151 inmates, Mr. Brownsberger said, they found that nearly half had never been charged with a violent crime in Massachusetts, only one-third had ever been convicted of a violent crime and only 1 in 12 had been convicted of a serious violent crime like assault with intent to kill.
That data can be expected to be used by one particular corner of the drug-policy debate where some who back tough mandatory sentences contend that even if drug use and dealing is arguably a victimless crime, the sentences serve to put away mainly dangerous criminals who belong in jail.
However, Mr. Brownsberger's findings appear to indicate that a significant percentage of inmates in state prison for drug convictions would not be there otherwise.
The study "is quite important because it's state-specific, and it's quantitative, and in particular, it's grounded in data," said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Mr. Caulkins was the principal researcher on a Rand Corporation study released in May that also harshly criticized mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. The study argued that incarceration is so expensive, $20,000 to $30,000 a year for each inmate, that it would be more efficient to shift the emphasis to old-fashioned law enforcement and traditional prison sentences, or to spend more money on drug abuse treatment and prevention.
Mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders became popular during the crack-related crime scares of the 1980's. Supporters said the laws took criminals out of circulation and sent a tough message to the streets.
The rules differ significantly from state to state. In Massachusetts, they concern mainly cocaine and heroin, and include provisions that anyone convicted of dealing within 1,000 feet of a school must serve at least two years and anyone convicted a second time of dealing cocaine serve at least five years. They are also based on the quantity of drugs involved: anyone convicted of selling 100 grams of cocaine, for example, must serve at least 10 years in prison, even if it is their first offense.
Researchers say mandatory drug sentences are also seen as a major cause of prison overcrowding, budget overruns and, in some cases, simple injustice -- as when a nonviolent drug offender ends up serving more time than someone convicted of manslaughter or armed robbery.
The Massachusetts Sentencing Commission, a panel of judges, prosecutors and other criminal justice experts appointed in 1994, has recommended that judges be allowed to depart from tough mandatory sentences when a defendant does not have a serious criminal record. The state Legislature is expected to take up its plan next year and it is expected to be hotly debated.

HEADLINE: Stew Leonard's Plans Big Store in Yonkers, Singing Cows Included

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Stew Leonard's, the carnival-style dairy store in Connecticut, isn't letting a tussle with the law interfere with its success.
With megastores in Norwalk and Danbury, Conn., the company is expected to announce plans today for the opening of a new Stew Leonard's in Yonkers, marking its first foray into New York State. 
 The announcement comes only five months after Stew Leonard Sr., the store's founder, was released from a Federal prison in Pennsylvania where he served almost four years for tax evasion, and one month before his son Thomas is to be sentenced on similar charges.
"In the long run, everything that happens makes you stronger," Stew Leonard Jr., the company president and the founder's other son, said yesterday. "You just have to keep your chin up and keep moving forward and you get through it."
Taxes are playing a part in the deal to be announced today, but this time the tax savings will be legal. The Yonkers store is to occupy part of a state economic development zone on Austin Avenue, off exit 6A of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. In September, the state agreed to expand the zone to include the 12-acre Stew Leonard's site, allowing the store to qualify for as much as $3 million in tax credits.
The $25 million store will sprawl across 110,000 square feet and employ 700 people when it opens in the spring of 1999, Stew Leonard Jr. said.
Like the Connecticut stores, which he said draw a total of 13 million shoppers a year, the Stew Leonard's in Yonkers will also try to raise the dull chore of grocery shopping to the level of family entertainment, with mechanized singing cows and free food samples inside and a petting zoo outside. At the entrance will be company Rule No. 1, literally etched in stone: The customer is always right. (Rule No. 2 says that if the customer is wrong, reread Rule No. 1.)
That deference to customers, along with the folksy atmosphere and emphasis on fresh foods at low prices, made Stew Leonard's a national icon in American retailing during the 1980's. The store was praised in the 1982 book "In Search of Excellence" by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman Jr., the management experts, and the Reagan Administration gave the elder Mr. Leonard the Presidential Award for Entrepreneurial Achievement.
But the good times came to an abrupt end in 1993 when Mr. Leonard, who is now 68, and three company executives pleaded guilty to skimming more than $17 million from sales at the Norwalk store. (Two of the executives were Mr. Leonard's brothers-in-law.) The scheme involved customized computer programs, destruction of records and bags of money smuggled to the Caribbean. It was the largest criminal tax case in state history.
Stew Leonard Jr., 43, had also participated in the scheme, but had received immunity from prosecution as part of the plea agreement, according to Government documents.
At the same time, Connecticut's Consumer Protection Commissioner accused Stew Leonard's of having its thumb on the scale, short-weighing packaged food. Those charges were settled last year when the company paid a civil penalty without admitting wrongdoing.
Just last month, Thomas Leonard, who was president of the Danbury store, pleaded guilty to two counts of aiding and assisting the preparation of false tax returns. The Federal charges stemmed from wrongdoing that occurred after the elder Mr. Leonard went to prison. Asked yesterday about his brother's activities, Stew Leonard Jr. simply said, "I have a colorful family."
While the criminal charges did have an impact on business at first, things have since bounced back, with sales at the Danbury and Norwalk stores this year expected to reach $160 million, Stew Leonard Jr. said. "Now we're ahead of where we were in 1993," he said.
The company suffered a setback in April, however, when zoning officials in Orange, Conn., rejected plans to build a dairy store on a 50-acre parcel the company already owns there.

HEADLINE: Children of Working Poor Are Day Care's Forgotten

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
At 5 the other morning, Marlene Garrett had her 11-month-old baby in her arms and was guiding her other two sleep-dazed children, ages 3 and 4, through the darkness to the baby sitter's.
"Mama has to go to work so she can buy you shoes," Mrs. Garrett told them. She had just that day moved up the economic ladder, from a job selling sneakers for $5.25 an hour to a job behind the counter at a bagel cafe for $6 an hour. Her shift started at 6, and she did not want to be late. 
 Seven blocks on foot, and then she was hugging her children and handing them over to Vivienne, a Bahamian woman who works nights at the self-service laundry where Mrs. Garrett does her wash.
Vivienne's small apartment was clean but sparsely furnished. There were no toys or books in sight, just a television that the children spent most of the next 10 hours watching. For this, Mrs. Garrett scrapes together $50 a week -- a little less than half the cost for just one child in most licensed day care centers here.
Mrs. Garrett hurried down the stairs and set off for work, three miles away. The family car died a month ago.
"It breaks my heart, leaving them there," said Mrs. Garrett, who arrived in Florida from Jamaica in 1989. "I want them in a learning environment. This is the best I can do right now. It's an emergency situation."
The experts agree: for Mrs. Garrett and tens of thousands of other low-income working parents nationwide, child care is a perpetual emergency.
Low-income working families are, in many ways, the forgotten class in the national debate over child care. They make too little to afford the choices of professional women -- whether to use a nanny or an au pair, to work part time or full time. And many make too much to qualify for government programs. Others make little enough to qualify, but are low on long waiting lists while priority is given to women leaving the welfare rolls for jobs.
Florida offers a good illustration of this squeeze on the working class. More Federal money is available for child care here because of the new welfare law: Florida added over $100 million to its child care budget this year. And the state has a program to provide assistance to nonwelfare families whose income is below 150 percent of the poverty level ($17,775 for a family of three).
But like other states under pressure to meet the work requirements of the new law or risk severe penalities, Florida has budgeted the bulk of its child care money to welfare recipients moving to jobs.
There are 25,000 children of low-income families receiving no welfare benefits who are on the waiting list for assistance in Florida, and an additional 39,000 who are eligible, according to Susan Muenchow, executive director of the Florida Children's Forum, a statewide nonprofit child care resource and referral agency. Marlene Garrett's children are among those waiting.
"From a child-care standpoint," Ms. Muenchow said, "you're better off on welfare."
 
When Staying Home Is Not an Option
The lives of women like Mrs. Garrett are ruled by hard economic facts. "If my finances permitted, I'd love to stay home," said Mrs. Garrett, whose husband, Rod, works in a factory making hospital curtains. "Who's a better caretaker than Mom?"
But staying home is not an option. Her husband takes home about $250 a week. Her own $200 a week helps put food on the table and pay the $400 monthly rent. Mrs. Garrett, who keeps a folder with her expenses neatly itemized, says she owes nearly $5,000 in medical bills. The family does not have health insurance.
Welfare is not an option. "I don't want to plant that seed in my children," she said. "I want to work."
When it comes to child care, Mrs. Garrett, who is 36, has almost no choices. She would like to put her children, Hasia, 11 months; Angelique, 4; and Scherrod, 3, in her church day care center and preschool, Holy Temple Christian Academy, but at $180 a week -- about $90 less than what most licensed day care centers in Fort Lauderdale charge for three children -- it is beyond her reach.
The church day care center had seemed possible back in September, when Mrs. Garrett was earning $8 an hour as a home health aide for the elderly. (It helped that she was often able to bring her children to work.) She took her children for their shots and put money down on school uniforms, at $32 apiece. But then her car gave out, and with her hours long and unpredictable, and bus service irregular, she had to give up the work she says she was born to do. There was no money for another car. Overnight, her family was downwardly mobile.
"I took back the uniforms," she said. "They credited me for them."
Mrs. Garrett has to make do with the child care she can afford, and Vivienne is what she can afford.
Mothers like her improvise fragile arrangements that inevitably break down. The friend, neighbor or relative who was looking after their children gets sick, or goes to work, or moves away, or simply becomes unavailable, and they have to find someone else to take their children.
"How can you get a job if you don't have day care?" said Christina Burdhimo, 26, a waitress who is raising two children, ages 2 and 4, alone. But without a subsidy -- she is also on a waiting list for one -- she cannot afford day care. A lot of places want $94 per week per child," said Ms. Burdhimo, who is divorced.
Her father and her mother-in-law have been alternating baby-sitting duties. "My mother-in-law will do it a couple more months," she said.
Regulated child care in Florida costs $4,000 a year or more, and many families are doing without other essentials in order to pay for it. Kelly McKnight, who earns $8 an hour monitoring burglar alarms, moved her two daughters, ages 3 and 4, into her father's mobile home, in Hollywood, after her husband left her. It was the only way she could afford the $135 a week for a licensed day care center, she said.
Her father, a retired correctional officer, helps with the child care, but the situation is far from ideal: the mobile home is in an adults-only community. Ms. McKnight's children can be there only temporarily.
After two years on the waiting list, Ms. McKnight began receiving her subsidy six months ago.
In rural areas, where people are spread out, and with public transportation often nonexistent, makeshift arrangements with friends and family can become even more difficult.
Wendi Slay has a 3-month-old baby and works for $7.20 an hour as a collections clerk for a credit union in Pensacola, in northern Florida. Ms. Slay, who is not married, drives 100 miles a day to take her baby, Chandler, to either her aunt's house or her father's, and then to work -- and back again to pick up Chandler, and head home. "I sing to him all the way home," she said.
Ms. Slay's aunt takes Chandler on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Her father takes him on Thursdays and Fridays, his days off from his job as a landfill supervisor.
"I don't know how much longer my aunt is going to be able to do it," Ms. Slay said in a telephone interview. What will she do for child care when her aunt stops helping? "Wing it, I suppose," she said.
 
Quality Bows To Availability
In all this scrambling, many experts say, low-income women do not have the luxury to worry about quality. "They're desperate," said Helen Blank, director of the child-care division of the Children's Defense Fund. "They miss a day of work, and they lose their job."
Recent research on rapid brain development shows that an enriching, nurturing environment is important for infants and toddlers. Studies show that children in low-quality care can have delayed cognitive and language development, behave more aggressively toward others and react poorly to stress.
Mrs. Garrett, who keeps on a shelf in her children's bedroom a set of 1961 World Book Encyclopedias that was a gift from the family of an elderly man she was caring for, does not need experts to tell her that her children need stimulation. That is what her church offers.
"The children play games," she said. "They go on field trips. They teach them, they train them. My children are bright. You would be amazed at what they would acquire in a year."
But for her, and for many other low-income parents, it is all they can do simply to find a safe place for their children.
Two years ago, state social service inspectors in Pensacola found a woman running an illegal day care center in her trailer for 20 children under age 4. According to their report, the children were hungry, and watching soap operas and game shows. Two of the children had chicken pox. "There appeared to be a total lack of stimulation for the children indicated by the abnormal inactivity of all the children," the report stated.
The parents, who had no other day care they could afford, were angry that the operation was shut down, according to Becky Kirsch, the executive director of the Children's Service Center, Pensacola's child resource and referral agency.
 
Waiting for Help, Not Likely to Get It
The Florida Legislature has recently passed two budget amendments, transferring some surplus child-care money for welfare recipients to low-income working families. But there is still a freeze on helping low-income families on the waiting list, and advocates fear that as increasing numbers of welfare recipients go to work, they will need more money for child care -- leaving even less for low-income working families who have not been on welfare.
"We're pitting one group of poor people against another," Ms. Muenchow said. "Many of these parents have no choice but to leave their children in substandard arrangements that are rotting their brains, and jeopardizing their futures."
She and other advocates say that states should base eligibility for child-care subsidies on income, not welfare status. Only a few states, including Illinois, Washington and Rhode Island, have taken that step.
"The country is focused on moving mothers from welfare to work," said Ms. Blank, of the Children's Defense Fund. "It's not nearly as focused on mothers who are already working to give them the support they need to stay independent, and to keep their children safe."
There are other sources of assistance: Florida has established a nationally recognized child-care partnership program that encourages businesses to help low-wage employees with child care. About 4,000 nonwelfare children are getting help.
Tammy McLamore, who works for $6.25 an hour as a reservations clerk for a transportation company in Fort Lauderdale, has watched the youngest of her five children, shy, 3-year-old Katie, blossom this fall. The reason: She began attending the highly regarded Jack and Jill Nursery School on a scholarship provided by the school. Last year, her mother says, Katie spent her days stuck in a baby sitter's crowded, dirty apartment, in front of a television with five or six other children.
At 7 one morning, Katie was eagerly boarding the school bus. "They sing and dance," Ms. McLamore said. "They do activities. Katie talks about all the teachers. She comes home from school and says, 'Want me to teach you a song?' "
One recent Sunday, Mrs. Garrett, who credits God and her Pentecostal religion with her relentlessly positive attitude, was near tears. "Vivienne told me she cannot keep my children so early," she said. "She has to take her little girl to school. Her husband's work schedule at the Laundromat is about to be changed. I have to try to find somebody else."
A day later, Mrs. Garrett said she had offered Vivienne an additional $25 a week. "She said she will keep my children," said Mrs. Garrett, who is still hoping to send her children to Holy Temple Christian Academy.
To that end, she had a promising interview the other day for a second job working room service nights at the local Marriott hotel. She says she will pay Vivienne another $15 to care for her children the extra hours. She hates it that she will have even less time with them, she said.
"It is temporary," she said. "I am doing what I have to do."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 113.15 Amid Concerns Over Asian Turmoil

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The tug-of-war continued in the stock market yesterday, with those worried about the economic fallout from Asia's financial turmoil winning this round.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 113.15 points, or 1.4 percent, to 7,767.92, while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 16.42 points, or 1.7 percent, to 946.67. While a sizable decline, the Dow is still up 8.5 percent since its record 554-point decline on Oct. 27, leaving the Asian optimists still in the lead. 
 But analysts expect the stock market to stay volatile as investors reassess the outlook almost daily because of new developments from Asia.
The stocks of companies exposed to Asia remained on their roller coaster as the sentiment about the outlook for Asia and its impact on growth, earnings and inflation here changed once again.
Down sharply yesterday were Citicorp, J. P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan. They all have exposure in Asia and rallied sharply last week as investors seemed to discount the Asian impact. The same was true for Applied Materials, the leading maker of semiconductor machinery, and Microsoft.
The apparent trigger for yesterday's selloff was the formal announcement of the closing of the Yamaichi Securities Company, the fourth-largest brokerage house in Japan. When the rumor of the closing was reported on Friday, the Dow managed a 54-point gain, although the technology-heavy Nasdaq index fell, as it did again yesterday, dropping 33.76, or 2.1 percent, to 1,586.99.
In Europe, the Yamaichi closing seemed to have a much more negative impact, with the Financial Times index in London down 1.8 percent, the CAC 40 index in Paris off 2.1 percent and the DAX index in Frankfurt declining 2.8 percent.
"Every now and then we get a reminder that there is this financial crisis going on in the Pacific Rim and it is extremely serious," said Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
Mr. Johnson is in the group of stock strategists expecting the fallout from Asia to have a significant drag on the American economy and corporate earnings. The Yamaichi announcement, he said, "is telling us that the crisis carries with it significant impact on U.S. companies going foreward."
He also said that the recent decline in long-term interest rates coupled with a rise in short-term interest rates is a signal that "the outlook for the U.S. economy is getting darker." This narrowing of the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates has occurred before previous slowdowns of the United States economy.
But Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company, is optimistic, making him and Mr. Johnson an example of how hard it is for individual investors to assess the outlook today.
Mr. Battipaglia said that the Yamaichi closing was raising concerns -- which he dismisses -- about the Japanese selling their holdings of American bonds, a move that could drive interest rates higher here. He also said he was not worried that the unwinding of Yamaichi's holdings in derivatives would lead to problems for American banks or investment banks.
Derivatives are securities that are based on the performance of an underlying asset, like a stock, bond or currency, and allow investors to make very large bets at relatively low costs. But because the positions taken can be large and involve many other firms, the chance that Yamaichi might not honor a deal is worrying to some.
"I don't think that we will have an unraveling of derivatives and I don't think the Japanese will be repatriating" by selling United States Treasury bonds, Mr. Battipaglia said. And he added that the impact from Asia would be mostly positive. The resulting drag on the United States economy from the slowdown of buying from Asia, he said, will help keep the American economy from overheating and inflationary pressures from growing. He is in the camp that thinks that the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates will not be up but down.
He said yesterday's concerns were temporary and that the market "would swing back into the mode it has been in -- bullish for the long term."
On the day, declining issues led advancers by almost 3 to 1 and volume on the New York stock exchange was just under 520 million shares, which is below the daily average.

HEADLINE: Russia and U.S. Square Off Over U.N. Sanctions on Iraq

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Russia stepped up pressure today to hasten the process of declaring Iraq free of banned weapons, prompting the United States to stiffen its resistance and raising questions about how far Moscow will go -- alone if necessary -- in what is now seen here as a determined campaign to help Baghdad escape from sanctions.
In the last few days, backstage diplomacy has turned to more open confrontation between Moscow and Washington, culminating tonight in a Russian attempt to block any Security Council action on the subject of Iraqi compliance unless Baghdad's progress in meeting disarmament requirements was emphasized. 
 At the same time, the United States is hardening its position against Iraq's persistent refusal to allow access for weapons inspectors to dozens of sites that Baghdad considers sensitive, including numerous presidential palaces and areas controlled by intelligence services or President Saddam Hussein's elite Special Republican Guard.
President Clinton said today in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he is attending an economic conference of Asian and Pacific nations, that Iraq cannot dictate what areas are open or closed to United Nations inspectors. Some of the disputed sites, he said, "actually encompass more land than Washington, D.C."
Mr. Clinton said that Mr. Hussein's palaces were not what the average American would imagine a palace to be but rather huge installations with enough space for weapons production or storage.
"There are 78 such palaces in Iraq," he said. "Many of them are huge compounds." Putting them off limits would undermine the entire disarmament effort, he said. United States officials over the weekend said that Mr. Hussein had 47 presidential palaces that he was seeking to exempt from inspections. A Government official said today that 47 was the number built since the Persian Gulf war, and 78 the total.
In Iraq today, United Nations inspection teams worked without hindrance for a third day after a three-week standoff, which began on Oct. 29 when Iraq ordered Americans barred from United Nations teams. Today's inspections apparently did not challenge Iraqi restrictions.
An American U-2 surveillance plane also flew unhindered in support of the commission. Iraqis had threatened to shoot at the planes, which Baghdad charges are spying for Washington.
At the United Nations, American and Russian attitudes have been hardening since Friday, when Russia failed to persuade an emergency session of the board of the commission charged with disarming Iraq that Baghdad had made enough progress to end intrusive inspections of nuclear and missile programs.
The board concluded instead that Iraq was not in full compliance in any area of the United Nations restrictions on its arms development, and that the fastest way to end sanctions was for Iraq to cooperate. The United Nations commission must be able to certify that Iraq has no prohibited nuclear, chemical or biological programs and no long-range missiles for sanctions to be lifted.
Today the Security Council planned to thank the commission board for its report and the recommendations it contained and urge that they be carried out. Some of these recommendations for hastening the inspectors' work and making it more efficient had been sought by Moscow. They included broadening the composition of inspection teams with more experts from countries other than the United States and adding surveillance flights from other countries.
But after a full day of talks today, Russia blocked the letter, demanding a longer statement enumerating Iraqi accomplishments and emphasizing board requests to the commission's chairman, Richard Butler, whose authority the Russians -- and to some extent the French -- would like to see curtailed.
The Russians want Mr. Butler to go to Iraq for talks immediately, as the board urged. The United States and Britain said today that he should make the decision when to go, depending on progress on the ground. The Americans would like to see an assessment of what damage might have been done to monitoring equipment in the absence of inspectors. Commission officials say this will take several weeks.
After hours of fruitless wrangling today, Britain's representative, Sir John Weston, emerged from the Council chamber visibly angry.
"I find it bizarre that anyone should have difficulty taking note with approval of the Special Commission's report and the recommendations contained therein, or with the expectations that those recommendations would be followed up promptly by those concerned," he said. "Why anybody should find that difficult to accept I cannot imagine."
Bill Richardson, the United States' representative, charged the Iraqis with violations of Security Council resolutions.
"How can you say that there are over 60 sites that can't be inspected?" he asked, speaking to reporters. "How can you say that there are 43 presidential palaces. What are they hiding? We think there should be full access to these sites."
Iraqi efforts to keep inspectors out of sites where prohibited arms may be stored or manufactured began almost as soon as the United Nations disarmament process began in 1991. By 1993, Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who was Mr. Butler's predecessor as executive chairman of the Special Commission, was in Baghdad urging more cooperation.
In 1996 Mr. Ekeus and Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister and spokesman on the issue of inspections, signed an agreement with Mr. Ekeus. In the accord, Iraq promised "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access" to all sites, and Mr. Ekeus pledged to be sensitive to the "sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence" of Iraq.
The Russians and French have argued that there is no need to reopen the access question now, since there is already an agreement in principle and on practices governing inspections.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Tokyo Squirms Over Questions About Hidden Losses at Yamaichi

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The collapse of the Yamaichi Securities Company was not a particular shock in Japan, where predictions had been building for months that the nation's oldest brokerage firm, saddled by debts and mismanagement, would go out of business.
The nasty surprise, however, came in the disclosure during the firm's final days that Yamaichi had hidden $2.06 billion in losses, much of it amassed under a practice outlawed six years ago. Moreover, the Government on Monday expressed a remarkable passivity over whether more such losses were lurking in a financial system already under enormous strain. 
 As Yamaichi began to unwind its business following a decision over the weekend to close, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka acknowledged on Monday that he did not know how many other firms might be hiding similar losses. He also struggled to answer questions over how the Government intended to find out.
"Unless a document is offered . . ." he told a news conference, his voice trailing off. "It is a limitation of the investigation. I hope you understand."
Such an explanation might have been accepted years ago, when the secret losses would have been regarded as just another example of financial impropriety in the world's second-largest economy.
But coming against a backdrop of alarm over Asia's growing financial crisis and the Government's own effort to make Japan Inc. more transparent, Mr. Mitsuzuka's statement reflected how entrenched the present system remains.
Worries that more such losses would emerge were underscored Monday in the global stock market reaction to the downfall of Yamaichi, Japan's fourth-largest brokerage firm and the third big Japanese financial institution to fail in less than a month. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday on Monday, but stocks fell sharply in Europe and in the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 113.15 points, or 1.4 percent. In early trading today, Japan's main stock index fell 4.7 percent.
The disclosure of the hidden losses also underscored what critics of Japan have long maintained: not only do companies regularly deceive the Finance Ministry and their own shareholders, but their past assertions that they had cleaned up these practices have proved fraudulent.
It was not lost on financial markets that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was reassuring President Clinton at an Asian Pacific summit meeting Monday that the Yamaichi problem would be addressed, was also the Finance Minister when similar hidden losses in 1991 caused a scandal that forced him to resign and cast doubt over his political future.
Japan's securities industry has historically not faced the kind of aggressive regulatory scrutiny found in the United States. The Finance Ministry does not have an equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal agency that has far-reaching powers to police Wall Street. Indeed, some Japanese market experts find it incongruous that Japan cannot monitor its securities firms when it is so adept at keeping close tabs on other major industries, down to such minute dealings as the inflow and outflow of tourists.
"The Government, in fact, has a long relationship with the brokerage houses," said Jeffrey Arpan, a Japan specialist and professor of international business at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. "It's easier for the Government to pass blame onto somebody else than to admit they made a mistake by not keeping a closer watch."
Yamaichi accrued its newly disclosed losses in the process of covering the trading losses of favored customers -- a practice supposedly rooted out in the 1991 scandal.
Such deals, called tobashi -- in which a firm temporarily shifts losses on investments from one client's account to another's to help clients avoid reporting losses -- were common then, when the Japanese stock market was falling as the air came out of the bubble economy.
Corporate clients had accumulated huge stock positions, using the money they had raised in the bubble economy's heady market to play the market in hopes of scoring quick profits. When the market came tumbling down, their brokers helped them hide their losses by arranging to have other willing customers buy shares at an inflated value.
The assumption among all participants in this game was that eventually the shares would regain their value and there would then be no need to hide any losses. Of course, the Nikkei stock index has dropped by more than half since then, and a lot of brokerage firms ended up absorbing the tobashi losses themselves.
In July 1991, when Japanese brokerage firms acknowledged extensive tobashi dealings, Yamaichi said it had paid some $330 million to reimburse customers. But, somehow, the firm managed to overlook at least $1.6 billion in tobashi losses that were recently uncovered, according to Mitsue Aizawa, Yamaichi's lawyer. The rest of the $2.06 billion in losses Yamaichi reported to the ministry on Nov. 17 resulted from foreign currency trading, Ms. Aizawa said
Mr. Mitsuzuka said Monday, "I want to believe there is no other situation," like Yamaichi's, voicing a widespread if probably vain hope shared by much of the Japanese business community.
There is growing concern here that at a time when Japan is desperately seeking to retain its stature as an economic superpower, foreign investors are coming to regard it as a hotbed of scandal and cozy deals that favor Japanese clients.
"You're seeing a pattern here of the chief executives at securities firms saying they will cover their clients' losses because of some trouble and then resigning," said Lawrence Harris, a finance professor at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. "Since this keeps happening, there are some fundamental control problems that haven't been solved."
This year's version of what is becoming an annual disclosure of questionable activities centered on the Japanese practice of paying off racketeers, known as sokaiya, to keep them from disclosing the peccadilloes of senior executives at annual meetings and threatening harm to other employees and their families Yamaichi was one of the first companies forced to purge its senior ranks because of sokaiya payments, but a string of blue-chip names including Toshiba, Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Electric and Hitachi are also under investigation.
As for the latest disclosures, Mr. Mitsuzuka said on Monday, "For the time being, I have not received any other report that there is loss-transferring taking place at other companies." He said the first time he heard of such losses at Yamaichi was on Nov. 17, when the firm reported them to the ministry. Asked whether the ministry had any responsibility for the firm's collapse, he said, "I don't recognize that."
Indeed, Yamaichi's off-the-books transactions were not what precipitated its end. The firm and its troubles have been discussed endlessly in the press in the last few months, and its stock price collapsed at one point last week to 58 yen, or about 46 cents. The bad news had made it increasingly difficult for the firm to borrow money, and when it became clear that its longtime ally, Fuji Bank, would not help, the funds dried up.
Yamaichi is closing with $24 billion in liabilities, but officials of the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan have said they believe that the firm has nearly that amount in assets and that no customers will lose money. The central bank said Monday that it would reimburse customers for any losses.

Pleas in Payoff Case
 TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 25 (Reuters) -- The Nomura Securities Company, its former president and two other former senior executives pleaded guilty today to charges of giving 369 million yen, or about $2.9 million, to a corporate racketeer.
A senior Nomura executive representing the firm told a Tokyo court that the company itself had paid money to the racketeer in 1995. Hideo Sakamaki, a former Nomura president; Nobutaka Fujikura, a former managing director, and Shinpei Matsuki, another former senior executive, also pleaded guilty to charges of making payoffs.

Fallout from Yamaichi Weighs on Markets
The formal announcement of the failure of Yamaichi Securities heightened the concerns about Asia's financial turmoil that have weighed on global stock markets for nearly a month. Following drops on European markets, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 113.15 points, or 1.4 percent, to 7,767.92, while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 16.42 points, or 1.7 percent, to 946.67. 
 The stocks of some companies that have exposure to Asia fell, including Citicorp, J. P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Applied Materials and Microsoft. Those stocks rallied sharply last week as investors seemed to discount the Asian impact. Page D10.
 
Treasury prices fell on concerns over how Japanese investors will react to the failure of Yamaichi. Some investors were concerned yesterday that Japanese banks and brokerage firms would need to sell United States securities to bolster their finances. D20.

HEADLINE: Hanging Out With the Mall;
Stamford Youths Get Jobs, Advice and Respect

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 24

 BODY:
It is a law of nature that things end up, if at all possible, in places where they are not wanted. Ants invade picnics, popcorn slips between the teeth and teen-agers converge on shopping malls.
And so it is that mall managers deal each day with squadrons of giggling, shouting and sometimes menacing adolescents on the prowl. 
 But here at the Stamford Town Center, things are oddly peaceful, in large part because of the gentle intercessions of two social workers hired by the mall. They approach loitering or misbehaving teen-agers and help them find something to do -- something other than hanging around the mall.
The pair, who patrol the mall after school and on weekends, offer teen-agers an opportunity to enroll in a course on how to get a job at the mall, if that appeals to them. Or the teen-agers may be offered lists of sports and other activities available to them around Stamford, as well as help in enrolling.
On a recent afternoon, an exuberant curse burst from a 15-year-old boy, provoking a whispered but firm reprimand from Ronald A. Miller, one of the workers and by now a familiar presence to local teen-agers. "Oh. Sorry, man," the boy said, and he seemed to mean it.
Three years after the mall began its unusual effort to deal with constant, unruly mobs of teen-agers, the profanity was the toughest problem of the day.
"If you treat young people as if they have brains and they're honorable, they will react accordingly," said Al Messer, the mall's manager. "They see through baloney and they see through smoke and mirrors. I think they really see us as being on their side."
That was clearly not the case three years ago, he said, when both the city and the mall were searching for ways to reduce the high rate of crimes by teen-agers.
"If you acted up in the center, we just kicked you out," he said. "It was us against you and, 'In your face!' "
When Mr. Miller made his first foray into the society of mall adolescents, his mission was simple: find out what they wanted. But the teen-agers quickly sized him up and told him how things were going to be, he recalled.
"The kids thought it was their mall," Mr. Miller said. "They controlled it."
The presence of a vast number of aimless teen-agers was both incongruous and intimidating to the high-end shoppers the mall hoped to attract with stores like Saks, Brooks Brothers and Burberrys.
"You didn't have the luxury of sitting in peace because the kids were always yelling, and older people felt unsafe," Mr. Miller said as he looked down on the amphitheater at the center of the vertical mall, where a handful of shoppers rested peacefully on the steps.
"The first day, I got hammered," he said.
Mr. Miller, 37, who in addition to his part-time job at the mall works as an inspector for the city's Health Department, persisted. He had grown up in Stamford with children just like that. "I listened to what they wanted," he said. "They wanted a place to go and they wanted jobs."
But they did not trust adults and they did not believe that he would help them, Mr. Miller said. The turning point came after several long months during which he and his former partner, Marcia McNeil-Major, were generally rebuffed.
The key was winning over one tough-talking teen-ager who "gave us hell from Day One," Mr. Miller said. If Mr. Miller approached, he recalled, the boy would stalk off, muttering, "I don't want to hear that."
But after learning that the boy liked to lift weights, Mr. Miller and his partner arranged to take a group of teen-agers to the local Gold's Gym once a week for free. The boy signed on.
"We went every Thursday, rain or shine," Mr. Miller said. A year later, the boy was working in the mall and had two jobs, Mr. Miller said.
It is difficult to measure the program's results precisely, but logs kept by the two social workers indicate that they are having some success. In 1995, they recorded 409 disturbances caused by teen-agers, but only 134 in 1996, a 67 percent drop. Statistics for 1997 have not yet been compiled.
The workers broke up only 113 large groups of teen-agers in 1996, down from 421 in 1995. Each time, the teen-agers are reminded of the mall's first rule: "Shop, eat, look for a job or leave the mall."
The harshness of the edict is softened, however, by the list of options offered outside the mall. Information and frequently transportation are provided regarding city programs, jobs, careers, teen-age parties, social services and even an Explorer Scout program.
But while the numbers indicate fewer problems with teen-agers, those who do come are not necessarily happy about their plight.
"Just because we're young and in a group, they treat us like we're not customers," said Diana Gonzalez, 16. "They're always kicking us out of everywhere."
Perhaps because the mall works with the Urban League, it has avoided accusations of racism that have been leveled against other malls' attempts to deal with teen-agers.
Two years ago, a black teen-ager from Buffalo was killed crossing a highway to get to a mall in a nearby suburb that barred inner-city buses from entering its property. Buses from suburban towns and from Canada were allowed in. Officials of the mall, the Walden Galleria, said they had been trying to prevent inner-city crime from reaching the mall.
The furor caused by the death of the teen-ager, Cynthia Wiggins, 17, forced the Walden Galleria and two other suburban malls to allow access for city buses.
And in Trumbull, Conn., which borders economically troubled Bridgeport, officials of the Trumbull Shopping Park fought a three-year battle with the Greater Bridgeport Transit District to stop buses from discharging passengers near the mall on Friday and Saturday nights. An arbitrator ruled in 1995 that the mall had the right to limit bus service. Mall managers had argued that they were trying to deal with the security problems created by hordes of teen-agers congregating on weekend nights.
At the Stamford Town Center, it was Mr. Messer, the mall's manager, along with Andrew D. McBride, the director of Stamford's Heath Department, who came up the idea of hiring social workers to help teen-agers who hang out at the mall. It was part of a grant proposal the city made to the state in 1994 to cut down on teen-age violence and delinquency.
The city did not get the grant, but Mr. Messer liked the mall's part of the project so much that he hired two "youth outreach workers" anyway. It costs the mall about $40,000 a year. The mall job-training program, run in conjunction with the Urban League, costs $45,000 more. About 200 teen-agers have been steered into the job program, and many have gone to work at the mall.
And over the years, all the mall's security guards have been instructed to deal with teen-agers respectfully. "We don't want them to precipitate something themselves, just by their attitude," said Roy Schiffer, the director of security. "We don't want people just hassled out of here. It's officer friendly, but officer resolute."
Mr. Miller's current partner on teen patrol is Lorie Miller (no relation), a 37-year-old social worker and artist with a friendly, quiet manner. "Our approach is always respectful," she said as she moved toward a group of girls hanging out just beyond the glass doors that lead to the parking deck, a popular spot to try to sneak a cigarette.
"Are you smoking? That's so bad for you," she said with half a smile and then asked the girls why they were there. The complaint reflected teen-age frustration: "There's nowhere else to go in this town!"
Ms Miller was sympathetic, and she told the girls that if anyone treated them unfairly, they could go to her and she would intercede. But for now, they had to break up into smaller groups and move on. "I know that right behind me is security," she confided to them. "If you don't leave, they're going to kick you out."
Later, Diana Gonzalez pronounced herself satisfied. "I think that was nice," she said. "She understands."
Ms. Miller said she knew she would run into the girls again and would remember them. And she hopes they will remember her.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT PRESSES ASIANS AT SUMMIT ON FISCAL TURMOIL

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia Nov. 24

 BODY:
A day after describing the spreading economic turmoil in Asia as a mere glitch, President Clinton met today with leaders of the region's largest countries to deliver a tougher message, telling them that while the United States and international organizations could help, they would have to take painful steps on their own to recover.
Mr. Clinton held back-to-back meetings with the leaders of Indonesia, China, Japan and South Korea, four nations that represent the full range of economic, geopolitical and human rights issues driving American policy in Asia. 
 Against a backdrop of escalating trouble in Japan's financial system, continuing jitters in stock and currency markets worldwide and the likelihood that Asia's woes will slow global economic growth, Mr. Clinton emphasized to his counterparts that the solution to the region's economic problems had to start with more prudent policies at home, White House officials said.
In particular, Mr. Clinton told Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that Japan needed to deregulate its economy, strengthen its ailing banking system and pursue an economic recovery built on domestic demand and not cheaper exports. Mr. Clinton emphasized that strengthening Japan economically was crucial to restoring stability across Asia.
"We just want to be in a position to be supportive when we can," Mr. Clinton said. "But I think Japan can lead Asia out of this difficulty with the strength of its economy."
He said all the leaders should work with the United States in pressing developing countries to take part in plans to curb emissions of pollutants and reduce the dangers to the environment from global warming.
To President Jiang Zemin of China and to President Suharto of Indonesia, Mr. Clinton again raised longstanding American concerns about human rights. He welcomed the release last week by Beijing of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, and pressed for further releases. And he raised with Mr. Suharto American unhappiness about the treatment of ethnic minorities in East Timor and about the repressive nature of the Indonesian Government.
Mr. Clinton spoke about "the need for countries like Indonesia to deal with how to accommodate order and liberty and to create the correct balance as they develop," said Samuel R. Berger, his national security adviser. "In the new information world, provisions need to be made for people who move to the beat of a different drummer."
Asked how Mr. Suharto responded, Mr. Berger said he "did not respond to that directly."
The sessions dominated the first of two days of meetings among the leaders of the 18 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. While Mr. Clinton and his counterparts from other nations continued to stress the region's resiliency and underlying strengths, their conversations here were tinged by deep concern that the financial turmoil had not yet been brought under control and could still permanently tarnish its standing as a driving force in the global economy.
Administration officials dismissed concerns that Japan could follow South Korea as the next country to need an international financial bailout. But they said the situation warranted acute international attention to prevent a further spread of instability. They said finance ministers from many of the affected nations would meet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next week and again in Japan in January.
"My view is that we should approach this with determination, but with confidence," Mr. Clinton said.
Administration officials said the Asian leaders Mr. Clinton met with all endorsed the American-backed strategy for dealing with the crisis.
The strategy calls for the International Monetary Fund to take the lead role in dealing with any countries that need international financial assistance. It also allows countries in a region to put together backup pools of financial help if I.M.F. assistance proves insufficient. And it calls on nations to enact more prudent economic policies in return for receiving international assistance.
Hanging heavy over today's proceedings was the failure of Japan's fourth-largest securities firm, Yamaichi Securities Company. It was the second failure of a major financial institution in Japan in recent weeks, and it heightened concerns that Asia's spreading woes could lead to further failures among Japan's beleaguered banks and set back Japan's already faltering efforts to spur its economy.
American officials said Mr. Hashimoto did not provide Mr. Clinton with any details of his plans to deal with the banking crisis beyond emphasizing protection of depositors rather than financial institutions. But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the United States was satisfied with the Japanese Government's statement that it would take the "necessary steps to contain the effects" of the Yamaichi collapse.
American officials also reported progress on another of the economic issues facing them in the region, negotiating the terms under which China would join the World Trade Organization, the body that sets the rules for international commerce.
Administration officials said China had made a "significant" new offer to the United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, in the last several days, and that Presidents Clinton and Jiang had directed their trade ministries to follow up with further talks. The officials did not provide any details of the new offer.

Clinton Tells Asians They Must Fix Economies
President Clinton told the leaders of East Asia's largest nations that they would have to take painful steps of their own to recover from recent economic turmoil. A1 

Troubling Figures From Korea
The head of South Korea's central bank contended that "the worst of the situation" was almost over for his country's troubled economy, but statistics he released suggested that the $20 billion bailout South Korea sought last week from the International Monetary Fund would not be enough. He blamed South Korea's own financial institutions for excessive lending to conglomerates. A10
 
Chinese Dissident Disunity
A prominent dissident in Beijing criticized Wei Jingsheng, who was released from a Chinese jail a week ago after being held political prisoner for most of the past 18 years. The critic said Mr. Wei had demonstrated a lack of understanding of democracy by acting like a tyrant in his first few days of freedom. In an open letter, Xu Wenli accused Mr. Wei of being headstrong, arrogant and too soft on Deng Xiaoping. A12
 
Russia Presses on Iraq
Russia stepped up pressure to hasten the process of declaring Iraq free of prohibited weapons, seeking to block any Security Council action on the subject of Iraqi compliance with the United Nations unless emphasis was placed on progress. But the move has prompted the United States to stiffen its resistance. A6
 
 
United States military and intelligence officials said Iraq had spied on United Nations weapons inspectors, learning in advance of the team's targets and moving swiftly to hide suspected weapons caches. A1
 
Afghan Moves Against Heroin
Leaders of the Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan, have agreed to uproot poppy crops in part of the country and to destroy heroin laboratories. The Taliban also proposed eradicating all poppy cultivation within one year, but this schedule was rejected as too radical by the head of the United Nations drug control agency. A3
 
Tense South Africa Testimony
Witnesses testified about atrocities allegedly carried out by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the former wife of President Nelson Mandela, as part of a weeklong hearing before South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating apartheid-era crimes. Testimony addressed accusations that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela had a role in as many as a dozen murders. A9
 
Trial of Zimbabwe Politician
An opposition leader, Ndabaningi Sithole, went on trial in Zimbabwe, charged with trying to assassinate President Robert Mugabe and to overthrow his Government. While Mr. Sithole pleaded not guilty, two other men arrested in the case pleaded guilty and are expected to be the chief witnesses against him. Mr. Sithole pulled out of presidential elections last March, accusing Mr. Mugabe's Government of infiltrating his party in an effort to destroy him. (Reuters)
 
NATIONAL A14-23
 
U.S. and Teamsters Agree To Monitor Union Spending
The Justice Department and the teamsters' union reached an unusual agreement in which a Federal financial monitor would oversee the union's spending and keep an eye out for any improper expenditures. The agreement is an embarrassing setback for the union's efforts to show that the teamsters have rid themselves of corruption. A1
 
Astronauts Grab Satellite
An satellite that went out of control when it was released last week by the crew of the shuttle Columbia was pulled back aboard after two astronauts grabbed the slowly tumbling spacecraft with their hands. A16
 
1996 Elections Were Costliest
The 1996 elections were the most expensive in history, with $2.2 billion having been spent by the two major political parties, political action committees and political groups. A18
 
New Diet Drug Approved
The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first new obesity drug since a ban on two popular diet aids left many overweight Americans clamoring for help, but the new medicine also poses a risk. The drug, Meridia, is "moderately effective" at helping patients shed pounds, the agency said. But Meridia can cause increases in blood pressure and pulse rate that may endanger certain patients, the F.D.A. warned. A19
 
A Session-Ending Tradition
Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican, has made a small tradition of injecting debate about the contentious issue of abortion just as Congress prepares to end its sessions. This year he tried to cut off all Federal money for abortions abroad in a move clearly meant to mollify conservatives. A23
 
Mandatory Jail Terms Studied
A study in Massachusetts has shown that when long, mandatory jail terms are imposed on drug offenders, most of them tend to be black and Hispanic and nearly half have no record of violent crime. A14
 
NEW YORK/REGION B1-6
 
Manhattan Gets Closer To a 2d Area Code
The state's Public Service Commission is expected to approve a plan today adding a second area code, 646, for any new phone connections in Manhattan, beginning in 1998. People and businesses who now have the 212 codes will be able to keep them, ending fears among many Manhattanites that the borough would be divided geographically with those north of 42d Street keeping the 212 -- and the cachet that goes with it -- and everyone south getting the new code.

Speyer to Buy Chrysler Building
Jerry Speyer, an owner of Rockefeller Center, emerged as the winning bidder for another international landmark -- the Chrysler Building, the beautiful Art Deco skyscraper that sparked a fierce bidding war this year despite its long and troubled history. B1

Encore!
 
Since 1977, the pianist Emanuel Ax has been a frequent soloist with the New York Philharmonic. The 48-year-old Mr. Ax, who played Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in his Philharmonic debut, will celebrate its 20th anniversary by performing another of the composer's concertos, No. 22, in five concerts with the orchestra: tomorrow, Friday, Saturday and Monday evenings and Dec. 2. Zdenek Macal will conduct the program, which is to include works by Smetana and Schumann. 

Selecting a Gender Bender
 
Israel will be represented in next year's Eurovision song contest by a transsexual pop star named Dana International. An 11-member committee of the Israel Broadcasting Authority chose Ms. International to compete with 15 other singers in Birmingham, England, in May. The annual competition offers prizes and wide television exposure. The choice of the singer drew quick condemnation from the Orthodox religious establishment in Israel. The selection "proves that our battle against debauchery is justified," said Moshe Mimni, secretary general of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party. The party has demanded that the Government rescind the selection. Dana International, 29, who is known for her revealing outfits as well as her singing, underwent sex-change surgery five years ago. Since she started singing in 1994, her popularity has spilled beyond Israel's borders, becoming, well, international. Six million of her albums have been sold clandestinely in Egypt, despite a formal ban by the authorities.
 
Literary Late Bloomers
 
The novels of James A. Michener would overflow a good-size shelf, but he began his writing career relatively late in life. He was about 40 when his first book, "Tales of the South Pacific," was published in 1947, winning a Pulitzer Prize, inspiring a Broadway musical and leading to some 40 more works, many of them best sellers -- like "Hawaii," "Texas" and "Space" -- that blended history and histrionics. Mr. Michener died last month, and his longtime publisher, Random House, has established a fellowship to honor his memory while encouraging other midlife beginners. Each winner of the James A. Michener Memorial Prize, who must have published a first book at age 40 or later, will receive $10,000 a year for five years. The prize is to be administered by the Texas Center for Writers, which Mr. Michener and his wife, Mari, endowed at the University of Texas at Austin. Random House and the center will establish a group of nominators, who will submit names of deserving writers to a panel chosen by the Center for Writers, with the prizes announced annually on Mr. Michener's birthday, Feb. 3, beginning in 1999.
 
Budget Spying
 
Even James Bond may not be crafty enough to outfox the British economy. Sequences filmed in London for the latest 007 movie -- "Tomorrow Never Dies," due for release next month -- were too expensive, said the film's producer, Michael Wilson. He cited the strong pound and the country's "unfavorable" taxes, adding that MGM might urge that the next Bond thriller be shot elsewhere. "If there are other countries which are cheaper, it will be hard to remain here," Mr. Wilson told The Sunday Times of London. Shooting for the next and 19th Bond picture is to begin in December 1999.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Time for Repairs

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
President Clinton and the people he chose to help him steer American foreign policy have steered it straight into a collision that left it a near-wreck.
The collision was not as much between the U.S. and Iraq as between Mr. Clinton's policies and America's own best interests. 
 The question now is whether the Administration has the fortitude to see where it steered off the road and make repairs in time for Saddam Hussein's next challenge. He is preparing it now.
It was, and is, in American interests to keep Saddam in the "box," as Clintonians call the squeeze of sanctions, containment and world opinion against him. The box was hurting Saddam's regime so badly that he risked American military attack to try to get out of it.
He did, by showing the world that Mr. Clinton would exact no price, exercise no power against him during or after the three weeks he had ousted the U.N. inspection system and threatened its existence.
It was in the best interests of America to keep control of the struggle against Saddam in peace as it did in war. Instead, the Administration permitted Russia to make a deal with Saddam to weaken and then dismantle the inspections and the sanctions that kept him in the box.
It was in the best interests of America to keep Russia from again becoming a major player in the Middle East. Instead it handed Russia that role, free of price or protest.
It was in the best interests of the U.S. not to desert Israel, its one reliable Mideast ally over the past half-century, as it tries to reach a peace with the Palestinians that might protect Israel from attack by terrorists or hostile armies.
Instead, the Administration harasses, insults and pressures Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to force him to abandon insistence on a peace based on Israeli-Palestinian reciprocity of carrying out commitments.
The U.S. endorsed the concept of reciprocity in a letter to Mr. Netanyahu when Israel gave up control of Hebron. Now Martin Indyk, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East affairs, denounces Israel for insisting on it.
And from the sides of their mouths, Clinton people try to make Israel a world scapegoat. They imply that Israel -- not Iraq, not Russia or China or France, not the Arab states -- broke up the wartime coalition.
Nobody sane thinks Saddam will take the Iraqi people out of their troubles by suddenly doing what he promised his conquerors to do almost seven years ago -- turn over all plans, plants and stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.
But if inspections and sanctions are removed, within two years he could re-create the nuclear weapons capacity that U.N. inspectors needed seven years to discover and damage. And he would expand the stockpiles of biological and chemical weaponry he is utterly determined to keep.
Already, with inspection resumed only a few days, Bill Richardson, U.S. representative to the U.N., charges that Iraq is still preventing inspectors from getting into the 63 suspected weapon sites that Iraq calls presidential property.
At a moment he selects, Saddam will again try to destroy the whole inspection system. Russia is doing his advance work -- trying to close the nuclear and missile investigations and rush the germ and chemical warfare investigations to an end.
To keep Saddam boxed means the U.S. would have to tell him that rather than permit him to kill the inspection system it would go to war against him. It would have to tell Russia, France and China to choose now between bolstering Saddam or supporting the U.S; no double scoops.
Richard Butler, the Australian head of the investigation commission, calls Iraq the test case for arms control agreements, and the hope they will bring a world free of the danger of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
But the Iraqi case also shows how hard it is for inspectors to uncover and destroy those weapons, when they are hidden and protected by a killer regime, even after its defeat in war.
The American interest is to remember both realities. That means a new policy -- to carry on fiercely with international inspection and fight militarily for its survival the next time he jumps out of the box, to warn off Saddam's new allies, and stand ready to help Iraqis end Saddam and his regime. Repairs never come cheap.

HEADLINE: The Age of Indulgence;
Self-Denial Takes a Holiday

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
GET ready for the big one.
By tradition, Americans throw their diets right out the window on Thanksgiving Day, the starting line in a marathon of overeating that extends through New Year. By the time festive diners have worked their way through holiday dinners, office parties, celebratory lunches, spontaneous after-work cocktail fests and the obligatory year-end blowout, the citizens of the land of the free and the home of the brave have put on enough weight to tilt the earth. This year, the binge could set records. 
 After more than a decade defined by health consciousness, nutritional enlightenment and self-denial, the United States seems to be entering a new phase in its often tortured relationship with food. Many more Americans are just saying yes to brontosaurus-size steaks and high-fat ice cream, the big-finned Cadillacs of American cuisine. They jump into the deep end of crystal-clear martinis and, emerging refreshed, put their collective feet up and ignite large cigars. Perhaps most shocking of all, they are not suffering the pangs of guilt.
Peek in any evening at the goings-on in Churrascaria Plataforma, a Brazilian meat palace in the theater district. Waiters wheel slabs of beef from table to table, slicing as they go. They race between diners brandishing skewers stacked with sausages and roast-turkey chunks. One rolling cart, gaudy as a circus wagon, dispenses high-octane drinks called caipirinhas, while another digs grooves in the floor under the weight of a dozen desserts.
At table after table, large parties of men wear the determined expressions of athletes waiting for the starting gun to go off. Many of them, young and fit-looking, resolved to make a good showing, shed their jackets and throw their ties over their shoulders.
Across town at Maloney & Porcelli, where the offerings make Trimalchio's feast in "Satyricon" look like cuisine minceur, diners are doing their best to hoist five-pound lobsters, family-size pork shanks and giant ribs from an Amazonian fish that looks as if it came straight out of a horror film.
"I think the Dionysian element is taking hold in my life," said Robert Sawyer, a freelance creative director in the advertising business. Mr. Sawyer, 43, a former athlete, used to ride his Italian racing bike in Central Park three or four times a week. The bike has not been out in a long while.
"I'm no longer interested in having fun," he said. "I'm interested in pleasure."
The treadmill is losing its allure. The burn still beckons, but fewer people seem to be going for it. Self-denial does not feel as good as it used to. "The 'no pain, no gain' approach of the 80's and early 90's is now being seriously reviewed by people," said Barbara Caplan, a partner at Yankelovich Partners, a research and consulting company in Norwalk, Conn. Its most recent survey research suggests that Americans still care about nutrition and health. They believe in exercise. But they may be growing tired of the blood, sweat and tears approach to personal fulfillment.
"They're saying, 'I need pleasure, I want pleasure, and I deserve it, without apologies to myself or anybody else,' " Ms. Caplan said.
AN important cultural moment seems to have passed. Its spirit was expressed succinctly in the late 1980's when Michael Douglas snarled, "Lunch is for wimps," at Charlie Sheen in "Wall Street." Winners and beautiful people did not eat. A spartan ethic of self-denial, reflected in films, health magazines and fashion advertising, promoted the idea that food was little more than fuel for the perfectly tuned body, and in a world dripping with toxins, the fuel had to be closely monitored, filtered and purified. An unending flow of detailed information on health and nutrition explained how to do this.
Throughout the era of conspicuous consumption, the elite set a standard of conspicuous culinary denial, ostentatiously subsisting on a small rectangle of poached fish, steamed vegetables and Evian water. Is it any wonder that eating disorders emerged as the American disease par excellence?
After a while, the food not eaten began to look awfully enticing.
For the last 17 years, NPD, a food-research company in Rosemont, Ill., has asked members of 2,000 households whether they agree with the following statement: "The most important thing about food is that it look good, taste good and smell good." From 1985 to 1995, the number of "agree" answers remained stable, at 30 percent. In 1996, without warning, the figure jumped to 36 percent. This year, it went up to 40 percent.
"People are finally admitting something that has always been true," said Harry Balzer, a vice president of NPD. "No matter how nutritious something is, if it doesn't taste good, people are not going to eat it."
In its annual survey of 2,500 consumers nationwide, Yankelovich found a declining interest in nutrition and an increasing tendency to indulge. When subjects were asked whether they paid as much attention to nutrition when they ate out as when they ate at home, 40 percent answered yes in 1994. The figure has declined each year since, dipping to 36 percent a few months ago. The number of respondents who say that weight concerns them has dropped from 37 percent to 29 percent in the last two years. When subjects were asked to rank the things they most wanted to do in the coming year, "Have more fun" topped the list.
"People have decided that stress reduction is more important than an extra inch on your waist or a flabby bicep," said Michael DeLuca, the editor of Restaurant Hospitality, a trade magazine. "Also, a lot of people realized these low-fat products didn't taste very good."
At a recent food-industry conference in Manhattan, Barry Krantz, the president of Krantz Consulting, was asked a simple question: What sells at restaurants? "I'll tell you what sells," he shot back. "Fat, sugar and salt. That's it."
Robert Levithan, a Manhattan psychotherapist in his mid-40's, used to walk a straight and narrow dietary line. Very narrow. "I was the annoying person at a restaurant who would ask if there was sugar in the salad dressing," he said. Now, he shops at Balducci's and feels fine about it. "My diet was an area of discipline rather than indulgence in my life," he said.
The word "indulgence" puts nutritionists on guard. Cathy Nonas, the administrative director of the Van Itallie Center for Nutrition and Weight Management at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, has watched with some concern as Americans sit down to monster portions and high-fat feasts. "People say, 'I'm going out for a steak dinner,' but that seems to include a martini, and a cheesecake, and fried onion rings and a 16-ounce steak," she said. "It's not necessary, and it's not good for you."
Ms. Caplan, of Yankelovich, says that the shift in attitudes does not suggest a collapse of values, merely a relaxation. "There are times when a spartan approach to eating is something you want," she said. "We're not going to go back to a Roman orgy. But people are saying, 'I want to bring back the pleasure of food into my life.' "
Adding velocity to the pleasure backlash is confusion about the welter of health information. Who can truly claim to understand the intricacies of trans fatty acids? Cholesterol seems to be bad, except when it is good -- or is it the other way around?
"Nutrition has been so fluid," said L. Timothy Ryan, the senior vice president of the Culinary Institute of America. "To take just one example, about 10 years ago, salt was thought to be about as bad as saturated fat, but recent studies suggest that perhaps salt isn't so bad. A lot of people throw up their hands."
IT'S hard to listen, however, when an entire culinary culture looks as though it is being dismantled stone by stone. Like Roman Catholics watching the stained glass, the statues and the paintings being removed from their churches during the Reformation, Americans have seen a precious part of their heritage whittled away. "Some of the basic building blocks of American cooking -- eggs and milk and cheese and beef -- have been under attack for 20 years," said Clark Wolf, a New York restaurant consultant. "It's crazy. There actually are people who think that cheese is bad for you."
It doesn't help that the experts often seem to be scolds. When the public is told that there shall be no more cakes and ale, is it any wonder that they head straight for the bakery or the bar?
"When information is presented in a moralistic or authoritarian way, people resist," said Edward Deci, a psychologist at the University of Rochester. "A lot of the information that comes in is very controlling information."
Mr. Deci, who has studied human motivation for decades, finds that the word "should" usually produces bad results. In a well-known experiment, he had his subjects spend time performing tasks that they enjoyed. Then he began paying them for it. Gradually, they lost interest. A sense of obligation killed their feelings of pleasure.
If "should" can kill pleasure, it isn't going to give an unpleasant task much allure. No wonder the diet industry shows a rate of recidivism that makes the American prison system look like a model of efficiency.
Richard Klein, the author of "Cigarettes Are Sublime" and "Eat Fat," has some radical thoughts on American eating behavior. One of his pet theories is that dieting causes obesity, in part by stoking the fires of obsession. Mere desire grows into a craving and a torment. When willpower breaks down, as it must, the crazed dieter often goes berserk, binging shamelessly.
Janet Polivy and C. Peter Herman, psychologists at the University of Toronto, have studied this "blown-diet syndrome" and found that when nondieters overeat, they simply cut back their intake to normal levels. Dieters, by contrast, feel that an entire regulatory system has collapsed and, behaving like damned souls, eat excessively, in part because dieting has taught them to ignore the body's normal cues signaling hunger and satiety.
At any rate, Mr. Klein says, if people simply ate what they wanted, could things be worse? "If you stop obsessing compulsively about everything you put in your mouth, and eat for pleasure, as the French do, the chances are you will lose weight," he said. Just do it.
Tomorrow, Americans gathered around the dinner table will have a few extra reasons to give thanks. Unemployment is down. The stock market seems to be surviving the jitters. And from now until New Year's Day, the gourmand superhighway seems wide open, with no speed limit or police in sight.
"I'm ready to eat," said Mr. Sawyer, the creative director. "The parties start Thursday."

HEADLINE: A 2-Pound Truffle Takes Flight As a Chef Seizes the Moment

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
ABOUT two weeks ago, Alfredo Landucci, the head of Boscovivo Tartufi in Arezzo, Italy, was awakened at 3 A.M. by a telephone call. It was a truffle hunter who had just pried what seemed to be the mother of all white truffles loose from the damp soil around an oak tree in the hills of Alba, in the truffle-rich Piedmont region.
Was Mr. Landucci interested in buying it? 
 "Give me 20 minutes," Mr. Landucci recalled saying, hesitating just a bit. He called Massimo Vidoni, who heads the company's New York office, at 13 East 37th Street, to see if there might be a buyer in New York. It was 9 P.M. on the East Coast, but this being white truffle season, Mr. Vidoni was still at his desk. The first chef he reached was Rick Moonen at Oceana on East 54th Street.
Mr. Moonen did not hesitate. The truffle was his.
Why had Mr. Vidoni paused? This has been the most frenzied season anyone can remember, perhaps because the booming economy has led to freer spending. Of course there would be a buyer.
"I had to be sure," Mr. Vidoni said. Had it remained in Italy, Mr. Landucci would probably have put it into an auction, and it might have sold for even more than the $3,600 that Oceana paid. (Boscovivo is donating its profit, $300, to a fund for victims of the recent earthquakes in Italy.)
The truffle, once cleaned, looked more like a geologic specimen than a fungus. Intensely fragrant and somewhat gnarled, it weighed in at exactly one kilogram, 2.2 pounds.
A heavyweight champ? Though no truffles, white or black, are listed in the Guinness Book of World Records or industry archives, most experts say that one this large is a true rarity. Mr. Landucci had not seen a truffle approaching this size in more than four years, and it is believed to be almost as large as a white truffle can get.
And when it comes to truffles, bigger is not only more impressive, but probably better, yielding broad, attractive swaths that no normal truffle can match.
White truffles, which are eaten uncooked, have a shelf life of no more than about three weeks. Larger ones often hold up a little longer than smaller ones, especially when they are as hard and dense as this one.
"I find bigger truffles to be more pungent," Mr. Moonen said. This one had an especially rich aroma.
Mr. Landucci, who personally escorted the truffle to New York (imagine the aroma from across the aisle on the eight-hour flight), formally presented it to Mr. Moonen last week at the James Beard House. He said the truffle probably took two to three months to reach full growth.
And though this season started with a sparse initial crop because the weather was dry, some truffle hunters have been finding big ones. About three weeks ago, Boscovivo sold a 1.4-pound truffle to Circo, on West 55th Street, for $1,700.
The season for white truffles ends with the frost, usually by December, which kills any still in the ground.
For four days, Mr. Moonen glorified raw Nantucket bay scallops and risotto with mottled light brown shards that filled the mouth with a taste and perfume both garlicky and nutty. By Saturday, at $20 a portion for an appetizer or $40 for a main course, the truffle was no more.
Mr. Landucci would not reveal the name of the lucky truffle hunter, whose take for an evening's work was 5.5 million lire, about $3,300, any more than the truffle hunter would pinpoint the location of the beneficent oak tree.

Dollar Reaches a 5-Year High Vs. Yen on Japan's Problems

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed to a five-year high against the yen yesterday after Japanese traders, returning from a national holiday on Monday, reacted to the closing of the Yamaichi Securities Company, the oldest securities firm in Japan. The dollar rose against the mark after a Bundesbank official suggested German rates would remain steady.
The failure of Yamaichi, although not totally unexpected in Japan, drove home the point that the major financial institutions could no longer expect to be automatically bailed out by the Bank of Japan. 
 In New York trading, a steady flow of rumors that other major Japanese banks were in a dire financial state kept the dollar on a strong footing against the Japanese currency.
"It is a confusing time to trade the Japanese yen," said Jeff Yu, senior dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. "On one hand, the weakness of the Japanese financial systems warrants a weaker yen; on the other hand, a weaker yen would hurt the U.S. trade deficit even further.
"Since the U.S. stock market is still one of the only stable markets right now, and the U.S. market is still growing under low inflation conditions, I believe that the dollar will gain further against the Japanese yen."
The dollar peaked at 127.96 yen -- its highest level since August 1992. In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 127.07 yen, up from 126.80 late Monday, still finishing at a seven-month high despite its retreat. The dollar was also changing hands at 1.7485 marks, up from 1.7375.
The German mark weakened against the dollar and the Swiss franc after Franz-Christoph Zeitler, a German central bank official, said German monetary policy could remain on hold. The Swiss franc, which is the traditional safe-haven currency, climbed to a fresh 15-month high against the German mark.
The British pound weakened to $1.6772 from $1.6898. The currency accelerated its recent decline after Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tied the growth of the economy to the success of wage restraint and the welfare-to-work programs.

Gold Prices Hit 12 1/2-Year Low On British Official's Remarks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Gold fell to a 12 1/2-year low yesterday after Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said that a new European central bank would not need much gold in its reserves.
In other markets, orange juice plunged as Florida weather warmed and grains tumbled. 
 Unlike cash or securities, gold does not pay interest or dividends, the main reason Mr. George, speaking in Brussels Monday, said he would be "surprised" if the European central bank would hold much gold as Europe prepares for economic and monetary union in 1999.
"The comments from George were enough to knock prices down a few dollars," said Bridget Fraser, vice president of commodity-based derivatives at the Bankers Trust Company in New York.
Gold for December delivery fell $3.40 an ounce, or 1.1 percent, to $300.50, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest since March 1985.
Central banks of the 15-member European Union hold more than 10,000 tons of gold, 10 percent of government reserves worldwide.
Mr. George's comments were another blow for gold prices, which have fallen 19 percent this year as some central banks unloaded part of their reserves.
Mr. George would not be involved in setting the new European central bank's gold policy because Britain is not initially joining the economic and currency union.
Orange juice plunged 3.6 percent as temperatures warmed in Florida, reducing concern that the state's groves could be damaged by frost.
A cold air mass that settled last week on central Florida, the state's major orange-growing region, has moved out and temperatures are expected to be mild for the next two weeks, said Mike Palmerino, a meteorologist at the Weather Services Corporation in Lexington, Mass.
The mild weather raises the likelihood that farmers will pick a crop forecast by the Department of Agriculture at 254 million 90-pound boxes, which would be a record and up 12 percent from last season.
Orange juice for January delivery fell 2.95 cents, to 79.8 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Corn dropped and wheat reached a four-month low as slow demand prompted traders to sell contracts.
Corn for December delivery fell 3 cents a bushel, or 1.1 percent, to $2.7025 on the Chicago Board of Trade. December wheat slid 5.25 cents a bushel, or 1.5 percent, to $3.35 a bushel, the lowest since July 21.

HEADLINE: Gain Reported In Confidence Of Consumers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Consumer confidence increased in November, while home resales rose in October, suggesting that the economy could end the year on an unexpected high note.
The last two months have seen sharp movements in stock prices in the United States, Asia and elsewhere, and turmoil in Asian economies. But "confidence has barely been dented by the drop in stock prices and the events in Asia," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at HSBC Securities in New York. "The housing market is responding in textbook fashion to lower mortgage rates." 
 The Conference Board, a business research group in New York, said today that its index of consumer confidence rose to 128.3 in November, the third-highest reading this year. October's index was revised upward to 123.4 from 123.3. A separate index of consumer confidence, calculated by the University of Michigan, also increased this month, rising to 107.2 from 105.6 in October.
A second economic report showed that home resales climbed in October for the third consecutive month, rising 2.1 percent, to a record annual rate of 4.4 million units.
With unemployment at its lowest level in a quarter century, "consumers are feeling pretty flush as the holiday season approaches," said Bill Cheney, an economist at John Hancock in Boston. "The Fed must be feeling increasing pressure to stay ahead of the curve, but they also don't want to play the Grinch before Christmas."
If the Federal Reserve's policy makers fear that the economy is growing fast enough to cause an acceleration in inflation, they might consider raising interest rates.
In its report, the Conference Board also said an index gauging consumer expectations for the next six months rose to 107.9 in November from 107.3 in October. An index tracking consumers' assessment of present conditions increased to 158.9 from 147.5, the highest reading since 1969.
Lynn Franco, a Conference Board researcher, said: "Recent turmoil on Wall Street and world financial markets, along with continuing layoff announcements, have not dampened consumer confidence. Consumers continue to express confidence about the health of the U.S. economy and expect these favorable conditions to continue well into 1998."
That could bode well for retailers. Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said sales during the holiday shopping season would probably rise a healthy 4.5 percent nationwide from last year. "I can't see anything on the economic horizon that would keep this shopping season from being a strong one," he said.
Consumer confidence could falter, of course, if another bout of turmoil sweeps Wall Street or if fallout from Asia's economic crisis spills into this country's economy. "Common sense almost dictates a decline in confidence," said Nick Perna, chief economist at the Fleet Financial Group in Hartford.
In the report on home resales during October, the National Association of Realtors said that resales rose 6.6 percent in the Midwest and 6.5 percent in the West. They were unchanged in the South and fell 4.5 percent in the Northeast. The figures represent actual closings, which lag behind contract signings by a few months.
"We have been surprised at the strength of the housing market all year, and with record levels over the last two months, sales were expected to ease slightly," said the association's president, Layne Morrill. "Clearly, the high level of consumer confidence in a strong economy with low interest rates is bringing more people into the market than many expected."

HEADLINE: Subway Crime, on the Rise

 BODY:
Crime may be falling in New York City, but it is rising in the city's subways. It is still nearly 70 percent below the 1990 level, and crimes that occur on subways and buses constitute a mere 2.5 percent of all crime committed in the populous five boroughs. But whatever level of comfort one derives from those realities, this is a problem that needs to be squelched before it undermines the public's rebounding confidence in mass transit.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir's decision to boost transit patrol strength from 2,200 to 2,500 last month was a prudent response. That effort ought to be sustained, particularly since the police cannot yet say definitively that these recent upticks are just transient blips. 
 What catches the eye in comparisons of January-through-October figures for 1996 and 1997 is not homicide. There were three in that period last year and four this year. No reasonable person would consider that 33 percent increase statistically meaningful. But the spikes in robbery (up 4.3 percent), pickpocketing and related acts of larceny (up 23 percent) are worrisome. These increases, which hit this summer and have lasted about four months, come at a time when the city's overall crime rate has continued to decline and when riders are turning in great numbers to rapid transit.
The Giuliani administration has not been bashful about claiming credit for bringing the crime rate down. That gives it an obligation to also be forthcoming in explaining the latest rises in crime. Beyond that, the administration should provide more useful data about transit crime, not just aggregate numbers but data about crime on specific lines and stations at particular times of day. Such information, distributed frequently, ought to be as easy to scan as stock tables and box scores.
With more than three million rides a day, rapid transit is more than a service that moves people to and from work, school and play. The subway system is perhaps the most underrated democratic space in the city, where people, regardless of culture and economic circumstance, mingle. Protecting the 468 stations and 722 miles of passenger track not only increases ridership but also safeguards the social experiment called New York.

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: THE U.S. INVESTORS;
Government Bond Funds Receiving Influx of Cash

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Mutual fund investors turned their backs on overseas stock funds in October and instead sought the shelter of United States Government bond funds, which received new cash for the first time in four years.
Fund shareholders continue, of course, to favor funds that invest in American stocks. So far this month, money has poured into those funds at Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, the two largest fund companies, as well as at Charles Schwab & Company, which sells mutual funds from hundreds of smaller companies. 
 The money entering funds has slowed somewhat from last month, but "that's not surprising," said Brian Mattes, a Vanguard vice president, given the recent volatility in the domestic and foreign stock markets. In addition, he said, "investors usually hesitate to buy until after most funds have paid out distributions" of capital gains and dividends, which for most fund companies occurs in early to mid-December.
Until last month, investors had remained similarly steadfast in their love for international and global stock funds, despite their having been battered for months by Asian currency devaluations and unstable equity markets that stretched from the Pacific Rim through Latin America to Eastern Europe.
Tutored by fund companies and investment advisers to diversify by sending money to the far corners of the globe, Americans this year added an average of $4 billion a month to international stock funds, which invest only outside the United States, and global funds, which can also buy American stocks.
In October, however, only $1.3 million trickled into international and global funds, according to figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group. Not since December 1990, when $55.9 million flowed out of the group, have overseas stock funds suffered a worse month.
Meanwhile, Government bond funds, once the largest category of fixed-income mutual funds, received $187 million in net new cash in October, the trade group reported. That ended a string of months in which money flowed out of the Government funds that stretched back to October 1993, shortly before the Federal Reserve moved to raise interest rates.
As money dribbled out of Government bond funds over the last four years, and as the returns from fixed-income investments have lagged behind those of equities, other categories of bond funds have become more popular with investors, particularly those specializing in high-yield or junk bonds and municipal bonds.
Funds investing in fixed-income securities with high current yields accounted for the biggest portion of the cash flows to fixed-income funds all year, including in October, when all bond funds received $3.7 billion, about even with the previous month.
Those latest developments overseas and at home apparently did little to dampen investors' enthusiasm for American stock funds, which received a revised $18.2 billion in new investments last month, the fourth-highest total so far in 1997.
Previously, the trade group had estimated that stock funds of all types had added $21 billion last month, which would have been the third-highest inflow of the year. While the revised figure is down from September's intake of $25.7 billion, it remained above the October 1996 figure of $13.5 billion.
As expected, the October cash flows left the total collected by stock funds so far in 1997 ahead of last year's record pace. In the first 10 months of 1997, investors added $195.6 billion to their stock fund investments, bringing the total assets of the funds to $2.3 trillion. In the period last year, stock funds took in $192.5 billion, on their way to a record 12-month total of $221.4 billion.
The two largest fund companies reported that the cash has continued to flow this month, although at slower rates than before the stock market's late-October slump.
Fidelity and Vanguard each expect their stock funds to receive $1.5 billion in new investments in November, officials at those companies said yesterday. At Vanguard, that is about half the level recorded in October, said Mr. Mattes.
But T. Rowe Price reported that domestic stock funds are attracting more new money this month than last, while international funds continue to lose money.
At Schwab, whose Mutual Fund Marketplace serves as a primary distributor for the funds of hundreds of companies, net flows into all stock funds measured about $330 million so far in November, about half the level of last month, with the largest flows into the most conservative stock funds like growth and income funds, which invest in blue-chip stocks that typically pay dividends.
Bond funds, however, have added to their take, gaining $291 million in net new cash so far in November, up from $170 million for all of October.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Risks New Sanctions Or Even an Attack, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said today that Iraq "continues to evade and to deceive" United Nations weapons inspectors and that its defiance could lead to still-tighter sanctions or a military attack.
He called the confrontation over Iraq's suspected caches of biological and chemical weaponry "a long-term problem," one that will last "as long as Saddam Hussein adopts the attitude that he's going to try to inhibit or restrict" the inspectors. 
 Until that resistance ends, Mr. Cohen said, the Iraqi leader "cannot expect any light at the end of the tunnel" in his quest to end the political and economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The United States wants those sanctions kept in force until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has been effectively disarmed.
Iraq must let the weapons inspectors into 63 sites it has defined as Presidential palaces and declared off-limits, Mr. Cohen warned. If it does not, he said, Iraq may face punishment.
This might include even stricter sanctions, he said. The United Nations might tell President Hussein: "There'll be no relief at any time in the future,"' he said, or, as a last resort, Iraq might face a military attack. "I think you can be reasonably assured it will not be a pinprick," the Secretary said.
"At this point, there's no need to put Iraq under any sort of a deadline," he said. "I think it'll become clear in the coming weeks as to whether or not Saddam Hussein is going to continue to deny access to the palaces. The proof we will find either in the palaces or in the pudding or in the poisons."
Mr. Cohen, releasing an annual report on the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, said Iraq's hidden arsenal exemplify a "clear and present danger today, one that's only going to grow with time." He said more than 25 countries possess or are working on such weapons.
The report detailed the capabilities of 12 nations: Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Libya, Syria and three former Soviet states -- Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. It did not list the capabilities of old allies like Britain or Israel.
The United States and Russia still possess the world's largest nuclear arsenals. Russia has "the world's largest stockpile of chemical agents: 40,000 metric tons" or more, the report said, and parts of the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program remain intact, though the Russian Government has said it will be eliminated.
The United States formally abandoned its biological weapons program in 1969 and is slowly destroying its formidable chemical-weapons stockpile. Mr. Cohen has added $1 billion to the defense budget requested from Congress for defenses against biological and chemical weapons. He said Pentagon planners assume that biological and chemical attacks are likely in wars to come.
The report released today said the post-cold war world posed "a paradox" for those planners: "American military superiority actually increases the threat of nuclear, biological and chemical attack against us."
Nor is Iraq the sole threat.
For example, if war came to the Korean peninsula, the report said, North Korea, outgunned by South Korean and United States forces, would be likely to use chemical weapons. Such weapons "may have become an integral part of North Korea's war-fighting strategy," the report said.
China, a nuclear power, poses a potential threat to United States interests in its role as "an important supplier of equipment, materials, and technology for Iran's chemical warfare and ballistic missile programs," the report said.
Iran renewed its efforts to build nuclear weapons when it learned that its rival, Iraq, had a well-advanced program under way before the gulf war, the report said. Iran also has biological and chemical weapons programs.
Libya has a mismanaged and perhaps moribund nuclear weapons program but is also building a huge underground chemical weapons factory. Syria is vigorously developing chemical weapons and ballistic missiles, which it believes will serve "as deterrents against Israeli attacks."
And India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers, also have the potential to use chemical and biological weapons if their 50-year rivalry flares for a fourth time into war, the report said.
Assessing the threat posed by outlaw groups, the report said: "Most terrorist organizations have shown little proclivity to develop and use nuclear, chemical and biological weapons." And while plutonium and enriched uranium suitable for weapons may have been diverted from Russian nuclear facilities, the amount is "insufficient to make a single nuclear weapon," the report said.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Those headed for the Middle East and South Asia are warned to be extra cautious these days.

BYLINE: By Paul Burnham Finney 

 BODY:
THE Middle East and South Asia are hot spots for business travelers these days because of Muslim terrorist attacks in Egypt and Pakistan, along with the still- simmering confrontations between the United States and Iraq.
"It's a time to go into a country, do your business and get out," said E. C. Ackerman, managing director of the Ackerman Group, an executive-security firm based in Miami with a large ex-C.I.A. staff and many multinational company clients. 
 The Middle East is an especially proceed-with-caution place, Mr. Ackerman said. "Anti-American sentiment is currently running high throughout the Muslim world," the Ackerman Group wrote in a memo to its clients earlier this month. "If Mir Aimal Kansi, recently convicted of the 1993 murders of two C.I.A. employees, is sentenced to death, personnel have every reason to remain cautious." A Virginia jury recommended the death penalty on Nov. 14; formal sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 23.
The most dangerous countries in the Middle East and South Asia, according to the Ackerman Group, are Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. In the second tier -- with less risk -- are Bahrain, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.
Mr. Ackerman's advice: "Don't go to the first-tier countries if you can avoid it. Stay away from mosques and tourist sites. It's not a time to visit St. Sophia in Istanbul or the pyramids in Egypt. Limit your circulation on Friday during midday prayers. I probably wouldn't go into souks. That's where fundamentalists feel comfortable. I think if I absolutely had to go shopping, I'd stick to hotels or malls associated with hotels."
Mr. Ackerman added: "Vary your route to work. Keep away from the watering holes of the expatriate community -- they're a potential target. Have meals in your hotel restaurant -- or to be really safe, order from room service."
Scanning the globe, the security company notes that two Muslim countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, are an exception to the threat of violence. "The problem may be different in Southeast Asia," Mr. Ackerman said. "It's traditionally a fairly safe area for travelers on the beaten track. But with their economies in turmoil, we'll probably see an uptick in street and other types of crime."
Beyond maintaining a low profile and keeping alert, can a corporate traveler do more to be safe? "Security devices are improving a lot," Mr. Ackerman said. "For instance, good locks for train compartments have been around for a while, but the alarms are getting better."
When it comes to kidnapping executives for ransom -- a continuing threat in Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico -- criminals are using the latest technology.
"One of the things they now have are laptops," Mr. Ackerman said, citing a recent incident outside Bogota, Colombia. "The guerrillas run your name through a computer to see what you're worth. And they have pretty good financial data."
 
Keeping Track of Rates
In January, in a no-nonsense campaign to capture the lower air, car-rental and hotel rates they have negotiated for employees, the Siemens Corporation will equip some 2,000 of its North American travelers with smart cards provided by U.S. Bancorp. Siemens, a Germany company, says it is losing several million dollars on the $71 million it spends annually on travel booked in the United States. In a six-month pilot test, the smart cards will be checked by electronic readers in four cities where Siemens employees travel and will automatically compare rates to insure that Siemens is getting the deals it arranged.
 
A Roof for Returns
To keep drivers dry when dropping off cars in rainy or snowy weather, Hertz is putting steel roofs over its return centers. It will begin the $50 million project in January with canopies at airports in Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Miami, and San Antonio.
 
Smoke-Free Spa
After winning approval in a survey of its regular guests, Le Mirador Resort and Spa, a popular corporate retreat perched high above Vevey (where Nestle is based) on Switzerland's Lake Geneva, has decided to become what it says is the first smoke-free five-star hotel in Europe. But not entirely: there is a lounge, pub, meeting room -- all separately ventilated -- and a few guest rooms in an annex for smokers.
 
Travel Secrets
An evening out on a business trip to New York? There are funny sketches of the bittersweet life of frequent travelers in "Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know," a musical comedy revue at the Off Broadway Triad Theater. The show is based on a Fodor guide by Wendy Perrin, a writer for Conde Nast Traveler magazine.

HEADLINE: New U.N. Estimate Doubles Rate of Spread of AIDS Virus

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Medical experts working for the United Nations say they grossly underestimated the spread of the AIDS virus worldwide, and they now believe that new infections are occurring almost twice as fast as they thought a year ago. Instead of 8,200 new infections a day, they now believe there are 16,000.
The new data, which began circulating today among American officials here and will be issued on Wednesday in Paris, suggest that 30.6 million people around the world are now living with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The last estimate, for 1996, was that 22.6 million people had the virus. 
 Some of the increase results from actual spread of the virus, and some from new methods of collecting data and making estimates, which United Nations officials believe give a more accurate picture. The United Nations did not say how much of the increase was attributable to each factor.
The United Nations estimates that 2.3 million people around the world will die of AIDS this year, an increase of more than 50 percent from an estimate that 1.5 million people died of the disease in 1996.
United Nations experts said the new data suggested that the AIDS epidemic could have ruinous economic effects in some regions, of the world, because it strikes many people of working age. Businesses should join governments in more aggressive efforts to fight AIDS, they said.
Two-thirds of the people infected with H.I.V. live in sub-Saharan Africa, and the United Nations experts said the epidemic in that region had been badly underestimated even though it was known to be severe.
Asked about the new estimates, Sandra L. Thurman, director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, said: "These numbers are so overwhelming that they numb the mind. We knew the numbers would increase. But I was surprised to learn how far off the mark we were in our estimates of how the epidemic is progressing globally."
Gareth Jones, a spokesman for the United Nations Program on H.I.V./ AIDS, said: "New infections are occurring at an alarming rate. In addition, it does appear that previous calculations grossly underestimated the rate of transmission of H.I.V., particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the bulk of infections are concentrated."
In a telephone interview today from Geneva, Mr. Jones said: "The older estimates were based on data that came from a small number of countries. It was assumed that one could extrapolate similar rates of transmission for all countries in a particular region, assuming that regional factors would be pretty much the same. It turns out that that assumption was wrong."
For the new estimates, Mr. Jones said, "we replaced regional models with separate models constructed for each country."
The United Nations estimates that 1,600 children under 15 are infected with H.I.V. each day, up from last year's estimate of 1,000 children a day. Moreover, it says, 1,200 children die of AIDS each day, up from the prior estimate of 1,000.
Many developing countries have crude systems of tracking disease, keep inadequate statistics and have denied the seriousness of the AIDS epidemic, public health experts said.
In many of these countries, Ms. Thurman said, "cultural norms prevent people from looking realistically at the AIDS epidemic and taking preventive measures, which would require more open discussion of sexuality, homosexuality and drug use."
Mr. Jones said the new data accentuated the contrast between countries at different stages of economic development. "More than 90 percent of new infections occur in developing countries," he said. "The industrialized world is experiencing decreases in new infections and AIDS cases generally. Prevention has worked among certain target groups like homosexuals, and new drugs are coming on stream. But the picture for the rest of the world is very different."
New tables prepared by the World Health Organization show that of the 5.8 million people newly infected with the AIDS virus this year, 4 million are in sub-Saharan Africa, 1.3 million are in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and 30,000 are in Western Europe.
The estimated number of new infections in Caribbean countries (47,000 this year) slightly exceeds the number in North America (44,000).
About 10 percent of all the new infections are in children under 15, and more than half of the remainder are in people 15 to 24, the health organization said.
Worldwide, the United Nations estimates that 11.7 million people of all ages have died from AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic in the late 1970's and early 80's. This year's deaths account for one-fifth of all deaths ascribed to AIDS since the start of the epidemic.
The United Nations estimated that 9.7 million people in sub-Saharan Africa had died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, with a total of 740,000 deaths in South Asia and Southeast Asia, 420,000 in North America, 110,000 in Caribbean countries, 470,000 in Latin America and 190,000 in Western Europe.
Dr. Peter Piot of Belgium, executive director of the United Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS, said, "AIDS is increasingly a threat to the global market economy." The disease, he said, has already slowed Kenya's economic growth, and it is likely to affect other countries' output too.
The United Nations said China, India and Thailand, for instance, were "likely to replicate the experience of sub-Saharan Africa in a few years' time." New outbreaks of H.I.V. infection have erupted in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, China and elsewhere.

Treasury Prices Bolstered by 5-Year Note Sale

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices edged up yesterday, bolstered by strong demand at an auction of new five-year notes.
Optimism that Treasury securities will remain popular as a haven from turbulent world financial markets, particularly in Asia, also helped prices. 
 "There is an appetite right now for U.S. securities," said Patricia Larkin, who oversees the management of $35 billion of fixed-income securities at the Dreyfus Corporation. "People will fly into Treasuries" if Asian economic troubles flare again, she said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 4/32, to 100 31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 6.05 percent, from 6.06 percent on Tuesday. Traders paid little attention to private reports showing robust consumer confidence and rising home sales -- signs that the economy is still growing at a healthy clip.
The Conference Board said its November index of consumer confidence jumped to 128.3, the third-highest reading this year. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 2.1 percent, to a record annual rate of 4.4 million in October.
"The numbers don't offer a lot of useful information," because they offer little insight into how Asia's woes will affect the United States economy, said Ben Mayer, who manages $1.3 billion in fixed-income securities at AMR Investments in Fort Worth.
At its auction yesterday, the Treasury sold $11 billion in five-year notes at a yield of 5.769 percent, the lowest in almost two years. Demand was stronger than the average at the previous 10 five-year note sales, based on the dollar amount of bids received divided by securities sold. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.98, compared with an average of 2.61 at the 10 previous sales.
"Obviously it was well-bid for," said Rick Schwarz, head government bond trader at Zions First National Bank Capital Markets in Salt Lake City. "It might be some anticipation of more flight to quality."
To be sure, the firms that bought the notes from the Treasury are working to resell a total of $26 billion of notes sold this week. That could weigh on prices in the next few days, said Bill Edwards, a five-year note trader at the Nikko Securities Company International, "We have to work ourselves out" from under the new debt, he said. The Treasury also sold $35 billion in 15-day cash management bills yesterday at an average yield of 5.56 percent. On Monday, the Government sold $15 billion in two-year notes. In addition, some concern persists that Japan may sell Treasury securities to bolster ailing banks and brokerage firms.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auctions of new five-year notes and 15-day cash-management bills:

Idaho Helps Vietnam In Business Training

BYLINE: By STEPHEN STUEBNER 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

 BODY:
As Vietnam strives to expand its new market-oriented economy, a Hanoi university has linked with the state college here to develop educational opportunities for Vietnamese teachers and business leaders.
Boise State University received a $3.2 million contract from the Swedish International Development Authority this fall to help the National Economics University in Hanoi create its own school of business by 2000. 
 Boise's M.B.A. program is the only United States-accredited M.B.A. program in Vietnam, though institutions like Harvard, the Tuck School at Dartmouth and Georgetown are beginning to offer short courses and seminars to Vietnamese business leaders.
Nancy Napier, a Boise State professor of business management, is behind the endeavor. Professor Napier and her colleague in Hanoi, Suzanne Hosley, the project manager of SL Development Consultants, a private consulting firm working on the project, will try to give officials from the Hanoi institution the tools to develop a business school and will then fade into the background.
The relationship between the two institutions has been built over the last three years. With $4 million in assistance from Sweden, Boise State has granted master's degrees in business administration to 55 Vietnamese business and education leaders.
Vu Dinh Hien, 28, a graduate of the M.B.A. program in 1995, is teaching two undergraduate accounting classes at Boise State this semester. He said cultural differences abound. Written contracts may be essential in the West, but are meaningless in Vietnam, he said, adding, "If there's no trust, there's no business."
Professor Napier said her work in Vietnam had been refreshing. She recalled sitting in the canteen at the Hanoi institution when a student approached her to practice his English. He was studying American accounting on his own in hopes of becoming a university instructor, she said, to "do something good for his country."
"I sat there, chopsticks in hand, trying to remember when my students in the United States had ever talked about doing something good for their country," Professor Napier said.
"This is why I went into education," she said. "These people are fighting for their future. I'm teaching people who want to learn."

HEADLINE: No Storm In Pacific

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 25

 BODY:
To Clinton Administration officials, the meeting of leaders from the Pacific Rim that ended here today was a clear success, putting on display American political and economic influence over a vital and unsettled region.
The summit meeting brought no quick solutions to the financial turmoil that has left Asia's economies in disarray. And it brought some muted but passionate warnings from Asians that the United States should not overplay its hand at this delicate time, lest Washington find itself the object of a backlash from a region crucial to its security and economic interests. 
 Still, under prodding from the United States, the nations of Asia were willing to pledge themselves to adopting the kinds of prudent, market-pleasing policies that define the American brand of capitalism -- enduring whatever domestic political and economic pain it takes to stabilize their plummeting currencies, control inflation, strengthen their tottering banking systems, stem corruption and open their markets to world trade.
It remains an open question whether the developing countries of Asia will actually fulfill those goals.
Nothing done here irrevocably commits any nation to any specific policies, with the exception of trade deals. Other arrangements will be made between individual countries, like South Korea, and the International Monetary Fund, which dispenses financial aid only in return for reforms. Instead, officials here emphasized that in an atmosphere in which even a pillar like Japan seemed threatened by instability, the symbolic importance of the Asian countries stepping up with a promise to do what it takes should send a powerful message about lessons learned.
"This year, we proved that our community is for good times and for challenging ones as well," President Clinton said before leaving for Washington tonight. "Asia's financial difficulties would have made it tempting for some of our partners to turn inward, maybe even to stay home."
The gathering of the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum also underscored President Clinton's success in nurturing the once-obscure organization into an increasingly important pan-Asian diplomatic structure -- and one that gives the United States a seat at the head of the table while excluding the European Union, the primary rival to the United States for economic influence in the Asia Pacific region.
"Everyone wants to hear what the United States says," one senior Administration official here declared. "It's palpable."
Administration officials did not seem worried about possible resentment by the Asian countries that see themselves as rising economic powers.
But to varying degrees, Asian leaders expressed disquiet about the impact of American insistence on painful steps towards economic reform in Asia. There is little enthusiasm in many Asian nations for the philosophy that pleasing the forces of the global market must come first.
And for all the recognition throughout the region of the economic power of the United States, of the country's indispensable role in arranging bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and any other countries that might fall to the wave of financial turbulence, there is also a strain of anti-Americanism, or at least of anti-imperialism, that is being stoked by the current crisis.
Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad of Malaysia, long the most outspoken critic of the market-based solutions championed by the United States, was the leader most explicit in opposing a strategy that from his perspective amounts to granting currency traders control over his country.
Mr. Mahatir said an ideology based on the notion that "the market can do no wrong, is sacrosanct, is your benefactor, savior and the ticket to prosperity, is now as extreme as was the Communism and socialism of yesteryear."
While they put it more delicately, other Asian leaders also seemed to wonder whether the United States fully appreciated how it was viewed in countries facing new pressures for austerity. And they sometimes seemed to be questioning whether the United States appreciated the strains placed on their domestic political systems by the requirement that some nations surrender a portion of their sovereignty to institutions like the International Monetary Fund, which is often seen as an instrument of American policy.
In an interview in his hotel room here, President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines, which could see its hopes of "graduating" soon from its 30-year-long monetary fund program fade with the financial turmoil, said, "If you are here on this side of the Pacific, especially if you are inside the United States, as long as your numbers and your three meals a day are there, maybe you won't care too much." He added, "You might consider your position to have been enhanced."
But Mr. Ramos alluded to the dangers of developing countries in Asia feeling that they could be forced back into the colonial status they have worked so hard to shed.
From an Asian perspective, he said, the divide between the developed and developing worlds should not be allowed to widen, yet the poorer countries of the region have little choice but to swallow the medicine the United States is prescribing.
"Certainly if you are looking at it from the other side, you would not want to see an increase in the gap between the haves and the have-nots," Mr. Ramos said.
"I'm calling upon the sense of community spirit that we are so proud of in Apec to now operate," he said. "That's all we in the developing countries can ask for. We cannot impose anything, mandate anything."
It was left to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to address such concerns.
"Will we squander our energies on finger-pointing and blame-pinning, or will we focus on how to get back on track?" she said. "Will we put our faith in alleged panaceas that are quick, easy and wrong, or will we renew our commitment to the basic principles that underlay past accomplishments and are essential to our future hopes?"
Ms. Albright hammered home one of the Clinton Administration's main themes, that it was up to each country to adopt market-oriented policies to restore international confidence in its economy.
"This is true no matter how difficult or painful the choices may be," she said.

Leaders Agree on Ways To Contain Asian Crisis
President Clinton and other leaders at the Asia-Pacific economic summit declared that stringent domestic policies and closer international monitoring are the only ways to contain the financial emergencies that have crippled South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand recently and have endangered Japan. 
 The broad message of the gathering in Vancouver was that the fast-growing Asian "tigers" must accept a time of slower growth and narrower dreams. Page A1.
 
As the contagion in Asian markets has spread from Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea, the question of whether Japan might be next has lurked ominously in the background. But there are compelling reasons to believe Japan will not catch this flu and that it will not leap across the Pacific to the United States. A1.
 
Mutual fund investors avoided overseas funds last month because of the Asian crisis and sought the shelter of Government bond funds, which received new cash in October for the first time in four years. D6.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
In Brooklyn, New Allure For Old Office Buildings

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the real estate recession of the early 90's, new owners have emerged in downtown Brooklyn to instill vigor into older office buildings near Court Street.
Some of the buildings had been financed with mortgages that proved too generous for rent and occupancy levels in the 90's to sustain. Others lost big tenants and were no longer attractive investments for their owners. Whatever the cause, properties changed hands and new owners have been putting money into them to strengthen their competitive position in the improved market of the last two years. 
 One owner, the Treelines Companies, has purchased three buildings -- 188 and 189 Montague Street and 175 Remsen Street. Like other new owners, it is capturing tenants from neighboring buildings, strengthening the competitive position of Brooklyn's prewar downtown properties even as a new generation of buildings only blocks away is tempting larger tenants.
The principal in Treelines is Glenn Schor, who had a general law practice on Court Street for 20 years, but began investing in real estate with a client, the late Louis Markus, a fuel oil dealer and real estate owner. With the three acquisitions, Mr. Schor owns 10 buildings with 700,000 square feet of space, including a Manhattan property at 12 East 41st Street.
The Brooklyn properties were what real estate brokers would call Class C buildings. The term suggests a pre-World War II building of lesser market appeal, usually lacking recent upgrades of elevator service, security systems and lobby decor.
Treelines often captures tenants from nearby Class C properties by improving the buildings and offering favorable lease terms. "We rent to lawyers, doctors, court-related tenants," Mr. Schor said.
The typical tenant takes about 3,000 square feet, he said, and pays about $19 or $20 a square foot per year on a five-year lease, plus $2.75 a square foot for electricity. "Tenants from other buildings in the neighborhood come in looking for space," Mr. Schor said.
The newer Class A space is in Metrotech, with its 4.5 million square feet of offices, and Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza, a 32-story mixed-use building still in construction between Adams and Jay Streets diagonally across from Borough Hall.
Renaissance Plaza will give Brooklyn 820,000 square feet of new office space, plus a new luxury hotel, the New York Marriott Brooklyn, and an 1,100-car garage. The hotel, opening in May, will have 384 guest rooms and 27,000 square feet of meeting space in 19 rooms, including an 18,000-square-foot ballroom that can accommodate 2,900 people. There will also be a 15,000-square-foot health club with a 75-foot lap pool.
The Kings County District Attorney's office became the prime tenant with a 20-year lease of 400,000 square feet in Renaissance Plaza, giving up 130,000 square feet in the Municipal Building on Joralemon Street and also 43,700 square feet in two privately owned buildings, 16 Court Street and 200 Montague Street.
In another 20-year Renaissance Plaza lease, 280,000 square feet was taken by the Leucadia National Corporation, a Manhattan-based holding company, for itself and its Empire Insurance Company subsidiary. Most of the rest of the space, 140,000 square feet, is on the market.
Another departure from an older building occurred when the Legal Aid Society leased 61,500 square feet of space on three floors at 111 Livingston Street, the former Nynex building, for its juvenile rights and criminal defense divisions. The society gave up eight floors in 175 Remsen Street, which Treelines acquired in September.
At the northwest corner of Montague and Court Street, the 84,000-square-foot 205 Montague Street, built in the 1960's, is being renovated under the new ownership of Blumberg & Freilich Equities, based in Fort Lee, N.J., in partnership with ING Holdings, a Dutch financial company. It was bought mostly empty from Republic National Bank last year. Originally, Brooklyn Savings Bank had its headquarters there, as did its successor bank, Crossland Savings, which was taken over by Republic.
The new owner has already leased the ground floor to a bank -- EAB -- and the upgraded upper floors will probably go to Brooklyn-based insurance, financial and legal firms, and nonprofit organizations, said Robert F. Hebron of Ingram & Hebron Realty, the leasing agent. A $2 million renovation of public areas is under way, Mr. Freilich said.
And at 26 Court Street, a 30-story 1920's building on the corner of Remsen Street, 26 Court Associates, in which Jonah Zupnick is the principal, upgraded the elevators for $750,000 after taking over last year from an owner who had defaulted on a mortgage. The building has 160 tenants, mainly lawyers. "The elevators were the key to renewing leases," said Joseph Schachter, the manager.
"Once the owners make the decision to put money into the infrastructure, these properties will rent," said Glenn Markman, an executive managing director of Grubb & Ellis New York. The firm was the broker in the Legal Aid Society lease at 111 Livingston Street.

HEADLINE: New York City Now Expects an Additional $319 Million in Revenues

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration expects New York City to end the fiscal year with $319 million more in revenues than it had forecast, largely because of continued robust profits on Wall Street, and it is proposing that the city salt away much of that money for the future.
Administration officials said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wanted to put $240 million of the extra revenue into the city's so-called rainy day fund, which would bring the total in the fund to $740 million. The rest of the money would be allocated for a variety of programs, including the antidrug initiative the Mayor presented in October. 
 The officials said that if the city did not need to spend the money in the rainy day fund on emergencies in the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, then they would save it to help reduce a projected gap in next year's budget. The administration plans to hold a briefing today to discuss the proposals, most of which require City Council approval.
"While we are fortunate to have some additional revenue, the Mayor is going to do what he has done in the past, which is use the lion's share of that additional revenue for gap reduction," said Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations.
Though the administration defended its plan as prudent, the news of the potential windfall is nonetheless likely to touch off a debate over whether the city should spend more of it, particularly on agencies whose budgets were cut in the first three years of Mr. Giuliani's first term. To some extent, the city government is facing the situation confronting the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has more than $100 million in unexpected revenue and is under pressure to use the money to restore service cuts and roll back increases in transit fares.
The Giuliani administration, like senior officials at the transportation authority, is counseling caution, pointing out that just as revenues jumped unexpectedly, so too could they drop without warning, particularly if there is a downturn on Wall Street. If that happened, then the city might have trouble paying for the programs that it promised to finance when times were flush. The M.T.A. has made similar assertions.
Despite the tax windfall, New York still must contend with large projected budget gaps in the next few years, including one of $1.2 billion in the 1999 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The gaps in the two years after that are more than $2 billion annually. The city's budget is nearly $34 billion.
The Mayor is calling for $185 million in new spending, including $46 million for the antidrug initiative and the rest to be allocated in small amounts across an array of city agencies. He is getting some of that money from what is left over after he puts $240 million of the $319 million in extra revenue into the rainy day fund.
In addition to the extra tax revenues the city now expects, Mr. Giuliani is also gaining, and hopes to spend much of, $150 million that he had expected to lose to a proposed tax cut on inexpensive clothing. State officials have approved the cut, but not until the next fiscal year. The administration had anticipated that the cut would come sooner, so it has extra money in the current budget.
When the Mayor and the City Council agreed on the budget in June, they predicted that the stock market would have a mediocre year, an estimate that independent budget analysts called appropriate. But Wall Street is still producing strong earnings, so revenues from taxes on incomes and businesses, and from other taxes, are greater than projected, officials said.
The administration might have to raise its estimate of an extra $319 million in revenues even higher during the coming months if Wall Street profits remain high.
In fact, the leadership of the Democratic-controlled City Council, which has often called the administration's revenue estimates too conservative, said it believed that the additional revenue would be higher than $319 million, though it declined to give an exact projection.
The Council leadership noted that Speaker Peter F. Vallone had championed the rainy day fund, but was also interested in increasing money for social programs.
The administration's budget proposals are "consistent with Speaker Vallone's desire to increase the rainy day fund and to support the Mayor's drug initiative," said Thomas L. McMahon, the Council's finance director. "As we get the details, the Council will negotiate a number of items, like increased funding for food programs and expanding portions of the drug initiative."
This is the second year in a row that the city is benefiting from a surge in unexpected revenues, in sharp contrast to the beginning of Mr. Giuliani's term, when the economy soured and he had to grapple with large budget gaps. The city finished the 1997 fiscal year, which ended last June 30, with $1.4 billion in extra revenue.

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: THE JAPANESE INVESTORS;
In Tokyo, Taking a Collapse in Stride

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Tamio Shiraishi arrived at the Yamaichi Securities Company's branch in Otemachi, Tokyo's banking center, at 7 A.M. today with his newspaper and plans to withdraw his assets.
No, Mr. Shiraishi, a 76-year-old former liquor wholesaler, was not overly concerned that the failure of Yamaichi, one of Japan's "Big Four" brokerage firms, would hurt clients like him. 
 "I'm not too worried because the ministry said I shouldn't worry," Mr. Shiraishi said, referring to the Ministry of Finance, which has promised that Yamaichi's clients would walk away unscathed from the country's biggest financial debacle since World War II. "I just came early because I thought it would be better to get ahead of the crowds."
Indeed, since the announcement, Tokyo has gone even further to reassure the public. A senior Bank of Japan official said this evening that Japan's ruling party would move quickly to devise a plan, which could be announced on Dec. 10 in conjunction with a package of tax reforms, to use public funds to steady the country's deteriorating financial system. Page 6.
 On Wednesday, Tokuyo City Bank, a small regional bank burdened by bad loans and rising losses, became the fourth Japanese financial institution to fail this month.
For the 50 people lined up quietly outside the Yamaichi branch, panic seemed far from their minds. Like Mr. Shiraishi, most appeared reassured by the Government's statements.
Rather, several waiting to enter the Yamaichi branch seemed embarrassed. Some wore sunglasses, a fashion accessory far less common in Japan than in the United States. One woman took the extra measure of draping a large scarf over her head. Many buried their faces in books and newspapers, and others turned toward the wall when they saw reporters and photographers.
Their sheepishness may have partly reflected how the stock market is widely viewed in Japan: a sort of disreputable casino. Making money through shrewd investment, rather than hard work and industry, runs counter to Japanese ethics, a perception that shows up in statistics.
Of the universe of Japanese personal financial assets, only 6.1 percent are invested in securities, according to J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd., compared with 22.4 percent in the United States. The vast majority, 56.9 percent, are held as currency or deposits.
Indeed, the biggest beneficiary of Yamaichi's collapse will likely be the postal savings system, the $2 trillion pool of savings administered by the Post Office.
Hosoya Shinobu, a 49-year-old housewife waiting on the Yamaichi line, said that when her husband had dispatched her this morning to claim their assets he said "gambate," or persevere -- a Japanese way of saying "good luck."
"I'm very worried about the other assets," she said. "I feel I should withdraw all our assets from other institutions as well and put them in postal savings because it's a national institution and that makes me feel safe."
Mrs. Shinobu was not the only one worrying about the overall safety of the Japanese financial system after the collapse of Yamaichi.
Stocks plunged in the wake of the announcement. The Nikkei index of 225 issues dropped 5.11 percent on Tuesday -- the first day of trading this week -- pulled down by heavy selling of bank shares.
Japanese newspapers and television spent the weekend assessing the comparative strengths of various banks and brokerage firms. Most reports concluded that the biggest banks would not be allowed to fail, but that a range of weaker second-tier financial institutions would eventually go bust.
On Friday, Moody's Investors Service rated the financial strength of one Japanese insurer, the Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company, as "very poor" and four others as "poor."
Two banks, the Yasuda Trust and Banking Company and the Chuo Trust and Banking Company, have the ratings agency's lowest rating, and a third, the Long-Term Credit Bank, has its second-lowest rating.
The public's growing awareness of the depth of the problems that have festered in the financial system since the bubble economy burst here in the early 1990's also seems to have raised acceptance for the idea of using public funds to protect depositors. Many, though, seem wary of using the same money to prop up banks.
The Government is trying to find a way to use public funds without raising the angry outcry that accompanied a similar bailout of some housing lenders last year.
"I want them to protect my assets, that's all I want," said Masahiko Tada, a 26-year-old salaryman, or midlevel manager, who was waiting to retrieve stocks worth between 700,000 yen and 800,000 yen -- or between roughly $5,555 and $6,350 -- his entire savings. "I'm not worried about the system itself."
While Mr. Tada and others were not too concerned about the fate of their own assets, they worried that a financial meltdown would threaten Japan's stature internationally.
Shigeru Morii's 84-year-old mother not only had an account at Yamaichi, but also one at Hokkaido Takushoku, Japan's 20th-largest bank, which failed last week. Mr. Morii, a cab driver, said he was relieved the Government had in both cases protected her assets.
"But, you know," he said, "we are suddenly in a terrible world. I could not imagine this kind of thing happening even a year ago."

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: THE RESPONSE;
Could Japan Be Next?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Could Japan be next?
For months, as the contagion in the Asian markets spread from Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea, that question has lurked in the background at the White House, next door at the Treasury, behind the sealed doors of the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street. Few officials in the Clinton Administration will discuss the subject publicly, except to recite the reasons why Japan is different and will not succumb. The reasons are compelling: the Japanese have prodigious national savings, a war chest of $230 billion in United States Treasury bonds and industrial strength that is rivaled only by the United States. 
 So far, though, none of that has compensated for a series of huge miscalculations that has mired Tokyo in economic trouble since 1991. A sudden collapse of the kind that afflicted the smaller Asian economies seems highly unlikely. Nonetheless, with every bit of economic evidence suggesting that things in Japan could worsen before they improve, Washington and the markets are awash in gloomy visions in which a panic in Japan -- or even Japanese efforts to quell one -- could leap the Pacific.
It seems even less probable that the United States will catch Asia's flu -- indeed today Wall Street shrugged off a 5.1 percent drop in the Japanese stock market.
To a large extent, Asian markets are responding to the collapse of a huge speculative bubble that began in Japan and spread through Southeast Asia, fueled by cronyism and, it turns out, a good deal of old-fashioned fraud. But markets feed off one another in unpredictable ways, as Americans were reminded last month after a run in Hong Kong resounded here. As one senior Administration official put it the other day, "It's hard to imagine the world's second-largest economy going into a convulsion without affecting us."
That may explain why a series of letters from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, have taken on a more urgent tone in recent months, as American officials insisted the Japanese were deceiving themselves into thinking the worst was over. It also explains President Clinton's apparently toughly worded caution to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday in Vancouver, British Columbia, that the time had come to "move decisively" before Japan's financial problems become the world's. Mr. Hashimoto reportedly conceded that Japan had "miscalculated" when it dismissed the warnings earlier this year.
Details of that conversation were conveyed to reporters not by Mr. Clinton's aides but by Mr. Hashimoto's in a clear attempt to create the impression at home that the Prime Minister was under excruciating pressure to take unpopular actions -- starting with the use of public money to bail out the same Japanese institutions that a decade ago seemed ready to bury their American rivals.
"What's happened now is that every scenario for the next few months in Japan is filled with bad news," said Edward Lincoln, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as chief economic adviser to Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador in Tokyo until the end of 1996. "But that said, the theories about what will happen next -- and what their effect could be here -- are diametrically opposed."
The future that Japanese Government officials are peddling is that a new age has dawned -- one in which they will not let problems linger by propping up failing companies.
Finally, Japanese companies will sink or swim, this line of reasoning goes. The weakest -- even giant, venerable institutions like Yamaichi Securities, the century-old trading house that announced on Monday that it was liquidating -- will go out of business. Depositors will be protected, the Japanese say, but banned forever is the instinct to interfere with market forces whenever they threaten the established order.
It is an appealing pitch, a signal to the world that Japan is finally going to let market forces rule its economy, rather than insist that the country's bureaucrats bend the market forces. But it also seems to contradict the Government's gradual move toward injecting huge sums into the financial system to stabilize it.
Letting a large number of companies die would also lead to a time of extraordinary pain, one in which workers who thought they had jobs for life could be out on the street, investors in loss-plagued businesses could lose their money and the economy's growth could dwindle to zero.
"This is a reality that has been discussed more realistically in the United States than in Japan," a leading Japanese lawmaker said on a visit to the United States last week. "I think Japan is only now waking up to what this means."
Believe it or not, that's the optimistic outlook. It involves a lot of short-term agony, but, in the minds of American officials, it sets the Japanese economy on the path to growth.
No doubt American companies with heavy exports to Japan will suffer. Japan may also sell some of its huge holdings of Treasury securities to smooth over a rough patch, and depending on the magnitude of the sale, that could roil the American bond market, weaken the value of the dollar and in the worst case, lead to higher interest rates in this country. There is always the possibility, however, that Japan's Finance Ministry is telling something short of the full truth when it insists Japan is changing so quickly.
There is plenty of reason to be skeptical. Mr. Hashimoto has promised before that Japan's financial sector was cleaning up its act -- in 1991, when he served as Finance Minister. It was on his watch that the country faced the first of a series of financial scandals, in which the four biggest securities houses admitted they had compensated big customers for losses when the Japanese market began to turn down. They apologized and said it would never happen again. Mr. Hashimoto resigned. And the practices went on, leading to Yamaichi's admission on Monday that it hid more than $2 billion in off-the-books losses for years.
The fear in Washington is that Mr. Hashimoto will bend to pressure to funnel aid to companies that deserve to fail -- perhaps acting overtly or perhaps in the more cloaked, traditional manner of Japan.
"This would be the worst outcome because the banks and the securities houses would only weaken and the pain would go on much longer," Mr. Lincoln said. Japanese industry, despairing of selling more at home, would seek to let the yen weaken so that Japan's cars and computer chips remain competitive with goods made by South Korea, Taiwan and the Southeast Asian nations. That would be good for American consumers -- who would pay less for Japanese goods -- but the trade deficit with Japan would surge.
Eventually, a growing deficit could threaten American jobs, particularly in industries that compete directly with Japanese products. The stock prices of companies facing more intense price competition would undoubtedly drop. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Hashimoto quite explicitly on Monday that any effort by Japan to export its way out of trouble would lead the two countries into "political problems," Japanese officials say.
But Japan has been through plenty of political problems in Washington before, and may decide it is worth the risk -- and better than wallowing in whatever disease has swept through some of the world's most promising economies.

One Life To Give

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
I have met egomaniacal rich guys like Donald Trump, who thinks every woman wants him and every politician fears him.
I have met plain old maniacal rich guys like Ted Turner, who can promise to give away a billion bucks as spontaneously as he can brag about his love life with Jane Fonda. 
 But I had never met a billionaire who is shy and retiring, who doesn't own a house, a car or a Rolex, who likes to take the subway and fly economy, who goes to the supermarket with his wife and worries about the price of carrots, who gives away a lot of his money because, as he puts it, "you can only wear one pair of shoes at a time."
So I trotted over to the 21 Club, where Irish America Magazine was honoring Charles Feeney, a 66-year-old businessman who has given away $610 million in anonymous donations to universities, medical centers and others in need. Chuck Feeney's desire for anonymity is startling in an age when people stamp their names on every available surface.
Here was the real-life John Beresford Tipton on the old television show "The Millionaire," whose face was never seen as he instructed his personal secretary to give some unsuspecting person a check for $1 million, on the condition that the Samaritan never be revealed.
The American Benefactor magazine says Mr. Feeney may soon become the greatest American giver of all time. He is ahead of Ted Turner, says Randy Jones, The Benefactor's chairman, because Mr. Feeney has given "hard, cold cash, the check has cleared, the work is being done." By the standards of Charles Feeney, Bill Gates isn't even on the charts.
Michael Sovern, president emeritus of Columbia University, who is on the board of one of Mr. Feeney's charitable foundations based in Bermuda, compares him to St. Francis. "When we go to Bermuda, he makes the board fly coach," Mr. Sovern says. "And he won't go to a restaurant there anymore that tried to make him wear a tie."
Mr. Feeney does not act out of an aristocratic sense of noblesse oblige. He acts on the idea that our great pursuit of more stuff is silly, that quantity is the American vice, that people need only what they need.
Donald Keough, the chairman of Allen & Company, called it "mind-boggling" that this self-made billionaire from a working-class New Jersey family "will surpass the Mellons, the Rockefellers, the Du Ponts in his charitable giving."
Like Ted Turner, Mr. Feeney was angry that the richest Americans give such a small percentage of their incomes. He was thrilled to be dropped from Forbes's list of the richest Americans this year because he had given so much money away.
But unlike the Mouth from the South, this "raggedy-trousered philanthropist," as one friend calls him, would never scream that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were "ol' skinflints." He was reluctantly dragged into the spotlight last January, after the sale of the duty-free shops he helped found was about to make the information public. He was so little known that one network put up a photo of the wrong Feeney.
You would never pick him out in a room. He is a small man with a nondescript blue suit, a clipped Jersey accent and amused blue eyes.
I ask him if he's nervous at his first public appearance.
"Well, they promised me $20 to make the speech," he kids.
When someone tells me a bill is sticking out of my purse, I don't want Mr. Feeney to think I'm addled, so I assure him that it's only a dollar.
"It's still money," he chides me gently. "Money is money."
I want to ask him if relatives were angry that he'd scattered so many millions that could have been theirs. But I can see that he is surrounded by his proud family.
His speech is awkward and endearing, the halting effort of someone not used to the limelight.
He urges the Irish-American business community to give away more money, and talks about his role encouraging the cease-fires in Northern Ireland. He also finances Sinn Fein's Washington office.
He tells about how, as a student at Cornell, he got a pop quiz in a course on money and banking. "I got my paper back with a note from the professor: 'You have a flair for writing, but no knowledge of the subject matter. Consider journalism.' "
Afterward, the other corporate chieftains leave 21 and climb into waiting black limos. Mr. Feeney, in an old gray raincoat and Irish tweed cap, tramps off on foot.

HEADLINE: Fish Are Victorious Over Dam As U.S. Agency Orders Shutdown

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Handing a landmark victory to fish defenders and river enthusiasts, a Federal agency refused today for the first time to relicense a hydroelectric dam and, going even further, ordered the aging structure on Maine's Kennebec River demolished at the owner's expense.
The agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, ruled that the hindrance the Edwards Dam posed to migratory fish outweighed the benefit it provided in electric generation. 
 The 160-year-old dam, which produces one-tenth of 1 percent of Maine's electricity, largely blocks the passage of sturgeon, salmon and other fish that struggle upstream to spawn, the commission said.
"Today's order requiring the removal of the Edwards Dam reflects a balanced view of environmental as well as social and economic considerations," said James J. Hoecker, chairman of the commission, which oversees the nation's power industry.
Since a 1986 change in Federal law, the commission has been required to balance conservation, recreation and other environmental values with energy generation in deciding whether to renew licenses. But the Edwards Dam is the first case in which it has exercised the power to deny a license.
Mr. Hoecker emphasized that the decision to remove the dam, which is in Augusta, need not be viewed with trepidation by the hydroelectric industry, which provides 14 percent of the nation's electricity, because Edwards is a special case involving a tiny amount of generation and a great deal of environmental damage.
Nonetheless, the decision had been anxiously awaited, particularly in Western states with many large dams. About 550 dams will come up for relicensing in the next 15 years, and many hinder the spawning routes of salmon and other fish.
Though the 3.5-megawatt Edwards Dam may be a special case, its pending demise was hailed by environmentalists today as a major triumph. "This is the first time the commission has said no," said Pete Didisheim of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, which helped lead opposition to the dam.
The decision also brought warnings of peril from the Edison Electric Institute, representing investor-owned public utilities, which noted that hydropower provided more than 95 percent of America's renewable energy. "This is a dangerous precedent," said James Evans, the institute's manager of hydropower issues. "Declining to issue a new license for a dam, or going even further to order the owner to remove the dam, are precedent-setting steps that Congress has not authorized in the Federal Power Act."
For all of today's drama, however, the demise of the Edwards Dam does not look especially imminent. The Edwards Manufacturing Company, which owns the dam and holds its license together with the City of Augusta, plans to appeal the commission's decision, first before the panel itself and then, if need be, in court, said Mark Isaacson, the company's vice president.
Mr. Isaacson said that under the 1920 Federal law that governs dam licensing, if the Government wants to deny renewal to a licensee, it must compensate the company for its net investment in the project. That would amount to $6 million to $10 million for Edwards Manufacturing, he estimated. But the energy commission ruled that it was within its rights not only to deny that compensation but also to order the company to pay for the demolition, which is expected to cost more than $2 million, and to pay for any environmental damage the demolition causes.
"Why do they think they can get away with it?" Mr. Isaacson asked. "Because they're so much bigger than we are. We're a small private company with four employees."
Indeed, the forces in the fight over the dam have not been very evenly matched. A broad coalition of environmental groups, state agencies right up to Maine's Governor, and Federal agencies right up to the Secretary of the Interior all advocated the removal of the dam.
Since the change in law, the Federal commission has ordered the removal of seven other dams, but this was the first case involving a dam owner that wanted to continue its operations. It was also a case skewed heavily in favor of the fish.
Before the dam was built in 1837, the Kennebec River was extraordinarily rich in aquatic life, providing a migratory route and spawning grounds to virtually every species in the Northeast that struggles upstream to breed, from sturgeon to salmon. The dam devastated many of them, and fish ladders installed later did little to restore the stocks.
In more recent years, though, Maine worked to improve its water quality and help migrating fish return with fish lifts. In its application for relicensing, Edwards Manufacturing offered to install new and improved ways to help fish get upstream to spawn, and the Federal commission's staff at first offered tentative approval to the plans.
But environmentalists responded with 7,000 pages of rebuttal, arguing that some species, like the endangered shortnose sturgeon and the Atlantic sturgeon, could not effectively use "fish passages." Also, they said, returning the river to its natural state would restore 15 miles of river habitat that were favored spawning grounds of several species.
Recreation enthusiasts also argued that fishing and boating on the river would be vastly improved if the dam was eliminated, giving them an uninterrupted 60-mile stretch of river.
In its decision today, the commission noted that the dam did produce energy that would otherwise probably be produced by nonrenewable fossil fuels. And that is Mr. Isaacson's main argument as well: that hydroelectric power is clean and renewable, and provides additional side benefits like irrigation reserves.
But the commission decided that the benefits of the dam were definitively outweighed by its costs, saying, "We believe that the public interest in this proceeding lies in our denying the license application."
In a telephone interview today, Mr. Isaacson asserted that The New York Times Company co-owns two dams upstream on the Kennebec in connection with its paper interests in Maine; He would be happy to remove the Edwards dam at his own cost, he said in a challenge only partly in jest, if The Times would do the same with its dams.
(In fact, The New York Times Company has only a 40 percent equity interest -- and therefore not a controlling one -- in Madison Paper Industries, which owns and operates the two dams, said Nancy Nielsen, spokeswoman for The Times.)
The appeals process could go on for months or years, Mr. Isaacson said. In the meantime, he said, the dam's licensees must apply yearly for short-term licenses, as they have been doing since their long-term license ran out in 1993.

Asian Leaders Support Bailout for 3 Nations
The 18 leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum declared support for international rescue packages for the troubled economies of three member states and any others that might need it. A1 

Cohen Warns Iraq on Weapons
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said that Iraq is continuing to evade and deceive United Nations weapons inspectors, and that its defiance could lead to still-tighter sanctions or a military attack. Mr. Cohen said Saddam Hussein could not expect any lifting of the political and economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations until he allows inspection of suspected caches of biological and chemical weaponry, including 63 sites Iraq that has declared off-limits.

West Bank Pullback Proposal
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to be considering an Israeli withdrawal from another 6 to 8 percent of the West Bank. The proposal, widely leaked to the press, was promptly rejected as inadequate by the Palestinians. Far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu's coalition threatened to bring down his Government if he gave away any territory, and other members of the Government held intensive rounds of back-room talks.

Allegations in South Africa
A former member of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's entourage testified that he saw her stab and kill a young activist she had accused of being a police informer. In testimony before a commission investigating President Nelson Mandela's former wife and her bodyguards, the witness, Katiza Cebekhulu, said that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela also participated in several other assaults, including the beating of another man who is presumed dead.

AIDS Spread Underestimated
United Nations medical experts said they grossly underestimated the spread of the AIDS virus worldwide, and now believe there are almost twice as many new infections daily as they thought a year ago. The new data suggest that 30.6 million people around the world are now living with H.I.V., as opposed to last year's estimate of 22.6 million. A6
 
Postal Strike Grips Canada
A week-long postal strike is hurting some businesses and helping others across Canada. Pre-Christmas catalog orders have not been shipped, and direct marketing companies are losing millions of dollars a day and laying off employees. Meanwhile, Federal Express and other private delivery services are enjoying a surge in business, and United States post offices along the border have been flooded by Canadians trying to send mail.

Carey Steps Down As Teamsters President
Ron Carey stepped down as president of the teamsters' union, announcing that he would take a leave of absence, just hours before a federally appointed oversight board accused him of diverting union money to his own benefit. The latest charges could lead to Mr. Carey's expulsion from the union and represented a new blow to his struggle to maintain control of the teamsters. A1
 
No Decision From Reno
Attorney General Janet Reno departed for an official trip to Mexico without announcing whether she would ask for independent prosecutors to investigate fund-raising telephone calls by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Ms. Reno has until Dec. 2 to decide whether to refer the matter to outside counsels, although her senior advisers have recommended that she reject that option, Government officials said. The officials expressed doubt that she would overrule her staff. A18
 
2d Chance for Satellite
The astronauts on the space shuttle Columbia may be able to put the satellite they rescued in a dramatic space walk back into orbit right away, NASA officials said. That would enable the Spartan satellite to observe the sun's charged outer atmosphere, as planned before the satellite was accidentally sent into a slow spin last week. A17
 
Panel Urges Care on Diets
A Presidential commission has dropped an earlier recommendation to require makers of dietary supplements to show the Government evidence that their products work. Companies should use scientifically valid evidence to back their products, and responsible companies will make the evidence available, the Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels concluded on Monday. But the panel said potential consumers should do their own homework. A18
 
Kaczynski Reacts at Hearing
Theodore J. Kaczynski threw his pen across the defense table as lawyers debated his refusal to be examined by Government psychiatrists. The show of emotion was the most extreme yet from Mr. Kaczynski, who typically seems unmoved by even the most negative comments about him. Jury selection is under way in Sacramento, Calif., for Mr. Kaczynski's trial on charges that he was the Unabomber who was responsible for three deaths and more than two dozen injuries in an 18-year campaign of package-bomb attacks.

Newsweek Alters Cover Photo
Newsweek magazine ran a computer-enhanced cover picture of Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey, whose septuplets were born in Des Moines last week. Newsweek's cover shot shows Mrs. McCaughey leaning against her husband and smiling, revealing a set of small, white and even teeth, but Time ran a similar picture of the couple, and in its photograph Mrs. McCaughey's smile uncovers a set of teeth that are not quite white and not straight.

Unemployment Dips And Jobs Rise in City

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City's economy, fueled by business services, retailing and tourism, added 53,000 new jobs in the first 10 months of the year -- the best job-creation performance by the city for any comparable 10-month period since 1984, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday.
There was also encouraging news for New York City residents who have been trying to get those new jobs. 
 The New York State Department of Labor said the city's unemployment rate, while still among the highest in the nation, continued its four-month downward trend in October, falling to 9.1 percent, from 9.3 percent in September, after adjustments for seasonal variation.
There are now about 43,000 more city residents with jobs than was the case in June, when the city's unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, said James Brown, an analyst for the State Labor Department.
Mr. Brown said there was continued strength in construction employment and a variety of service jobs, like accountant, hotel cleaner and store clerk.
Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggested, in fact, that the local economy is continuing to gather steam. About 8,000 new jobs were added in October in the city's five boroughs, more than the 5,000-per-month average through the first nine months.
"With the unemployment rate inching down a bit, and strong job growth in October, the city is entering the fourth quarter with some momentum," said John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Statewide, New York's unemployment rate was unchanged in October, at 6.4 percent, where it has remained for four months, the state said. The national unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in October, down from 4.9 percent in the previous month. KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: Watchful Waiting on Japan;
For U.S. and European Markets, a Steady Course So Far

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Japanese stocks were higher today after a 5.1 percent tumble Tuesday, leaving investors debating whether the Asian turmoil will undermine United States and European stock markets or whether a rebound in both those markets will help bring some stability to Asia.
At the close of trading, the benchmark Tokyo index was up 178.02 points, or 1.12 percent, at 16,045.55. Hong Kong stocks surged, ending the morning session up 2.66 percent. But the South Korean market was trading mostly lower, down two-tenths of a percent late in the day, and Thai stocks were also down two-tenths of a percent. 
 After the American stock market rallied yesterday, ignoring Tuesday's decline in Tokyo stocks, some analysts were more confident that United States and European markets could distance themselves from the problems in Asia, as long as there were some signs that the problems there were being dealt with. But they also said they were not sure that stability here would be all that helpful to Asia and the world's other major emerging markets in Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe.
"We can't export our stability because they're facing real local problems," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company.
Desmond Lachman, head of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Brothers in New York, agreed. "There are things that are going on with Asia and Russia and Japan that have nothing to do with the United States," he said.
But both analysts agreed that a rout in the United States could cause foreign markets to suffer.
"The last thing that Asia needs is the U.S. to be weakening," Mr. Lachman cautioned.
On Wall Street yesterday, stocks finished mostly higher, with American companies buoyed by a round of so-called safe-haven buying and assumptions that Japanese officials will deal quickly with the country's unfolding banking crisis.
Telephone companies like BellSouth, Bell Atlantic and AT&T benefited from investors seeking safety, predictable earnings and relatively high dividend yields. In addition, positive news helped the Boeing Company's stock to rise, while stronger-than-expected earnings from Dell Computer pulled up technology shares, with companies like I.B.M. and Microsoft posting gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.03 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 7,808.95. Standard & Poor's 500-company stock index gained a modest 4.15 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 950.82.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 2.05 points, to 1,589.04, as smaller companies lagged, with the Russell index of 2,000 stocks dipping 92-hundredths of a point, to 426.91.
"Every once in a while, we take a sigh of relief that things are not as bad as they could have been," said Arthur Hogan, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover.
But Tom Galvin, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, warned that United States markets would continue to be volatile because the worse it became for Asia the more investors would worry about the impact on the United States economy and, more importantly, corporate earnings.
He also said that while bailout plans are being worked on for the most troubled countries, "it's a long road from identifying a problem to implementing a plan."
On Monday, the Dow fell 113.15 points, or 1.4 percent. The S.& P. 500 fell 16.42 points, or 1.7 percent. The drops followed the formal announcement that the Yamaichi Securities Company, the fourth-largest brokerage firm in Japan, had collapsed. Yamaichi's failure also caused fears that more Japanese financial institutions could follow suit.
Yesterday, investors seemed to gain confidence from news that Yamaichi would be allowed to close and that there were funds available to pay off depositors. In addition, Japanese and officials from the United States and the International Monetary Fund gave indications that quick action would be taken to make sure that additional closings would be orderly and "it was not going to be a free fall" in the Japanese markets, Mr. Pradilla of Cowen & Company said.
But the focus is still on what is occurring in emerging markets, Mr. Hogan said, adding that the stock market "really did not" focus at all on a report showing a sharp uptick in consumer confidence in November. While the report should have been positive for stocks, he said it was largely ignored because of the current focus on international issues.
Also, the fallout from Japan could affect emerging markets, like those in Latin America, as well as highlight structural and economic problems in other parts of the world, like Russia and India, analysts said.
"Japan is just so big that what's going on there is going to dictate the mood and sentiment of the other emerging markets," said Julie Wang, a vice president and portfolio manager at Bankers Trust Funds Management.
"Japan supplies a lot of liquidity to other markets," Ms. Wang added, with Japanese banks lending money to companies in Latin America.

HEADLINE: ASIA PACIFIC TALKS VOW TOUGH ACTION ON ECONOMIC CRISIS

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Leaders gathered for the annual Asia Pacific economic summit meeting declared today that stringent domestic economic policies and closer international monitoring are the only way to contain the financial emergencies that have crippled South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand in recent months and have endangered Japan's already weakened financial system.
While previous Asia Pacific summit talks have made traditional declarations about the importance of sound economic policies, the Asian financial crisis that hung over this meeting like a sullen cloud will put pressure on member nations to turn these platitudes into policy. Three of the 18 members of the Asian-Pacific Economic Community, South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand, have asked the International Monetary Fund for emergency loans, and they must follow I.M.F. conditions for austerity in order to get that money. 
 The conference, which ended tonight, was dominated by talk of the Asian crisis. In their session this morning, the leaders cast aside their agenda to focus on the financial situation and kept a wary eye on currency and stock markets throughout the region for new signs that the financial virus had spread. On Tuesday, Japanese stocks fell more than 5 percent while the yen plunged to a five-yearlow. The stocks recovered some lost ground on Wednesday, rising 1.1 percent.
The plan endorsed by the leaders was based on a document drafted last week in Manila by a group of finance officials from the United States and several countries in the region. Individual nations did not pledge financial help, but the United States and others did commit to make individual contributions if the I.M.F. package proved inadequate.
Instead, the arrangement calls on countries experiencing financial difficulties to take responsibility for solving them by adopting belt-tightening domestic economic policies, propping up their currencies, rooting out corruption and strengthening oversight of banks.
The broad message of the gathering was that the fast-growing Asian "tigers" would have to accept a time of slower growth and narrower dreams to insure a more stable and predictable future. The International Monetary Fund would hover nearby as a watchful nanny, ready to intervene at the first sign of trouble, backed up if necessary by further aid from countries in the region.
The summit meeting produced a public consensus that these remedies are the right way to rescue Asian economies, and that, officials argued, was the important accomplishment of what could easily have been a ritual gathering.
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand, whose country sparked the current crisis in July when it devalued its currency and sought emergency relief from the I.M.F., summarized the climate at this year's conference. "Confidence and optimism are out, and uncertainty and gloom are in," he declared as the two-day meeting opened.
But President Clinton emphasized the positive, repeatedly stating that prospects for strong growth in Asia remain good, that the gathering had agreed to continue dropping trade barriers in nine large industries and that it had endorsed a framework for addressing problems that arise.
"We also supported an action plan to meet the financial challenges that we all face in Asia," Mr. Clinton said. "We believe that the affected countries are doing the right thing in committing to take the right steps to remain strong, with the I.M.F. taking the lead for the international community, and with other advanced countries backing them up when it's appropriate."
Leaders of all the conference nations labored to convey a sense of determination even as they acknowledged the seriousness of the region's financial problems. In the communique released at the end of the meeting, the group said, "We believe it is critically important that we move quickly to enhance the capacity of the international system to prevent or, if necessary, to respond to financial crises of this kind."
The I.M.F. has already pledged $57 billion to underpin the shaky financial systems of Indonesia and Thailand. The Fund is certain to be called on for at least $20 billion more to assist South Korea, which appealed for aid last week as the depth of the crisis in its large conglomerates and financial system became clear.
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum includes not only major regional powers -- the United States, Japan, China -- but developing countries including Mexico, Singapore and Chile as well. The leaders voted to admit three new members -- Russia, Vietnam and Peru -- next year. They then declared a 10-year moratorium on new memberships.
The thrust of the Manila declaration last week and the discussions here is that miracles do not last forever and that a thriving middle class is the foundation of growth and democracy.
"During the past quarter-century, Asia Pacific economies have achieved miracles of expansion, job creation, poverty reduction and rising living standards," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said on Monday. "Today, they are undergoing a severe test. And so are we all."
She then delivered the international prescription for renewed expansion. "We must act with patience, persistence and principle to stabilize economies, promote good governance, bring down barriers to trade and engender a broad public conviction that open markets will open the door to prosperity not just for the lucky few, but for the hard-working many," Ms. Albright said.
The main session of the two-day meeting this morning, held at the Museum of Anthropology on the campus of the University of British Columbia, was consumed by a discussion of the economic malaise. President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico captured attention with an account of how his country confronted its currency crisis in 1994-95 and emerged with its economy strengthened.
He said the most important thing was to seek international help early and reassure investors that the country is moving aggressively to restore the economy and banking system to a sound footing.
Daniel Tarullo, a senior White House economic adviser, summarized Mr. Zedillo's words, saying, that "as a political matter, obviously this entails a good deal of problems in the short run." Mr. Tarullo added, "But he pointed out that the experience of Mexico demonstrates that the political situation can also turn back quickly in favor of the Government's programs and policies."
With the regional crisis threatening even the economic powerhouse of Japan, only the United States emerged from the meeting with its stature enhanced.
And American officials, fighting smugness, lectured Asia Pacific leaders on the need to take action now to prevent deeper problems.
"This is not a painless process," Mr. Tarullo said today. "Obviously some policies are going to change."

HEADLINE: To U.S. Workers, Trade Deficits Are a Threat

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson (Op-Ed, Nov. 24) offers several arguments to convince us that trade deficits need not concern us -- from the difficulties in defining them, to the impossibility of their elimination, to their relative unimportance to high-wage industries, to the current economic expansion.
These arguments, even if true, only obscure a more powerful truth: prices are set at the margin based on supply and demand. 
 Unions and American workers understand that competition from offshore labor paid minuscule wages reduces domestic demand for unskilled, semiskilled and blue-collar workers and depresses their share of national income. It is of no consequence to these workers that highly educated, high-tech workers have enough to do.
The recent debacle on President Clinton's fast-track negotiating authority ought to serve notice that this is an issue that is not going away. Until Ms. Tyson's party is willing to address it in a meaningful way, her arguments will ring hollow to the many left behind by the economic expansion.

HEADLINE: To U.S. Workers, Trade Deficits Are a Threat

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson (Op-Ed, Nov. 24) cites several supposedly benign reasons for our soaring trade deficits and one worrisome issue for the future -- the lack of "fast track" negotiating authority for the President.
Missing in her analysis was an important and damaging factor in our trade deficits -- the growing use of unilateral trade sanctions by the Federal Government, states and even cities. 
 An estimated 185 such sanctions have been in force or proposed since 1993. These sanctions are usually designed to punish our trading partners or to deter them from behavior we don't like.
A study by the Institute for International Economics showed that only one in five sanctions studied was effective, while at least 200,000 export jobs were lost.
In a survey I conducted this year, the chief executives of companies representing more than 10 percent of United States exports, when asked what Government action hurts their exports the most, overwhelmingly named trade sanctions.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Drop as Rise In OPEC Output Is Expected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, reflecting expectations that OPEC will raise its production output at a time of ample world supplies. Heating oil and gasoline futures also fell sharply.
On other markets, gold prices fell below $300 an ounce for the first time in 12 1/2 years amid continued fears that European nations might sell their gold reserves. 
 Crude prices fell on expectations that Saudi Arabia's proposal to increase oil output in coming months would be accepted by other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia. Total output could rise to 27.5 million barrels a day from the group's current ceiling of 25.033 million barrels a day.
The United Nations in the next few weeks is also expected to consider increasing the amount of crude Iraq is allowed to export as part of its oil-for-food program. Iraq has been barred from exporting oil freely since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The current export round in which Iraq can sell $2.1 billion in oil over six months ends on Dec. 5, and United Nations officials say that figure could rise to $3 billion.
The oil output rise would come at a time of ample stockpiles in the United States. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that crude inventories jumped unexpectedly last week by 3.6 million barrels, to 317.576 million.
Crude oil for January delivery fell 58 cents, to $19.15 a barrel. December unleaded gasoline fell 1.77 cents, to 57.31 cents a gallon, and December heating oil fell 2.39 cents, to 53.10 cents a gallon.
Gold futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile for the second consecutive session after the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, said the new European Union central bank was unlikely to hold large inventories of gold in its reserves. The central bank will be formed next year as Europe prepares for an economic and monetary union in 1999.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, December gold fell $3.60, to $296.90 an ounce, the lowest for the contract closest to delivery since March 1985. The more-active February contract fell $3.70, to $298.60 an ounce.

Dollar Falls vs. Yen as Tokyo Vows Aid to Banking System

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday as officials in Tokyo pledged to restore calm to a battered banking system. It rose against the mark, as traders saw no near-term rise in German interest rates.
Japanese stocks rebounded from Tuesday's sharp drop to end more than 1 percent higher after the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance promised to provide liquidity to stem any run on funds. 
 "We strongly urge the public not to pay heed to irresponsible rumors and act calmly," the two institutions said in a rare joint statement, adding they would provide funds "smoothly and without hesitation so that repayment of financial terms' deposits and other payments will not be hindered."
The comments, after the collapse in recent weeks of two banks and Japan's fourth-largest brokerage firm, helped buoy the yen. That, in turn prompted investors to stop buying marks, which had been seen a safer investment than the dollar.
In trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.7613 marks from 1.7485 marks on Tuesday -- highest level against the mark since Oct. 24, the last trading day before Asian markets plunged. The dollar slipped to 126.97 yen from 127.07 yen. The British pound fell to $1.6736 from $1.6770. But trading in New York was subdued ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Nearly all foreign markets will be open today.
Persistent talk that more Japanese banks could fail minimized the dollar's losses, traders said. "We are seeing the who-is-next syndrome," said Steve Flanagan, chief dealer at Erste Bank, describing market fears that official pledges of aid would not be sufficient to save more banks from collapsing.
The dollar also gained ground against the mark as investors remained convinced that Germany's central bank would not raise interest rates in the near term.
On Tuesday, a Bundesbank council member, Franz-Christoph Zeitler, said the central bank would likely be able to hold to its so-called steady-hand policy for some time.
In other trading, the Canadian dollar fell to 70.2 United States cents from 70.3 United States cents even though the Bank of Canada bought Canadian dollars to defend the Canadian currency.

HEADLINE: 3 Presidents Defend Bid To Belong To NATO

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The three Presidents of the Central European countries that have been invited to join NATO are unlikely to make an appearance in the Senate committee rooms in Washington where the debate over expanding the alliance will heat up early next year.
But in an "if you were there" exercise, Transitions magazine, a Prague-based monthly, asked the three leaders to imagine just such an encounter. 
 Their articles are to be read as the most persuasive rationales for these three former Soviet satellites to be embraced by the Western military alliance, the executive editor of Transitions, Michael T. Kaufman, said.
The three leaders, who are likely to send their foreign ministers and American boosters for the real debate, appear to understand well the counterarguments they face. They warned against American isolationism, stressed their ability to pay their way and played down the threat of Russian opposition to NATO expansion.
A two-thirds majority is required in the Senate for the expansion of NATO, the toughest hurdle before the three proposed members can formally join. The legislatures of the 15 other NATO members must also approve the move for it to take effect.
Poland's President, Aleksander Kwasniewski, called American isolationism an "anachronism."
"It is surely obvious today that the absence of the United States in European policy in the years preceding both world wars was not the best way to defend America's vital interests," he wrote.
At the same time, he said Poland did not expect a free ride in NATO. Poland had pledged to increase its military budget three percentage points faster than its economic growth rate, he said, adding, "We want to occupy a place in the civil and military structures of the alliance proportional to our contribution and our strategic position."
The Poles, suspicious of Russia after more than a century of occupation during czarist times, are by far the most enthusiastic supporters of joining NATO. Surveys say that more than 80 percent of Poland's nearly 40 million people consistently want their army to be part of NATO.
The Hungarian President, Arpad Goncz, a former dissident and playwright, urged American senators not to worry that United States soldiers might die in the defense of Budapest.
"Some people say that NATO enlargement means that in the case of a major conflict, American soldiers would die protecting Central European cities," he said. "I think those people are wrong. Under the bipolar world order, in the years of bitter enmity, not a single soldier of NATO died for a member state of the alliance."
Mr. Goncz acknowledged that for Hungary -- landlocked, with only 10 million people and coming out a Communist economy -- collective defense was the best option. "Being armed to the teeth is the privilege of rich countries; it is far too expensive and unsuitable for Hungary," he said.
Vaclav Havel, the President of the Czech Republic and also a former dissident and playwright, chose to dwell on the costs of American isolationism. "Some Americans still consider involvement in Central and Eastern Europe an unnecessarily costly, unneeded and untimely undertaking," he wrote. "Europe, however, is connected with America and through thousandfold links and bonds."

Citibank to Buy a Stake in Thai Bank

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Citibank signed an agreement today to buy at least 50.1 percent of the First Bangkok City Bank, becoming the first foreign bank to take a majority stake in a Thai bank.
First Bangkok said the New York-based bank had signed a memorandum of understanding for the purchase but would take 90 days to conduct a review and assess the value of its assets. 
 The price for the purchase has not yet been set, executives of the Thai bank said.
Thai banks have been crippled by the country's first recession in more than a decade. The country's 15 commercial banks have been so overwhelmed by problem loans that Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, has predicted as many as five will fail by the end of 1998.
Thailand's rescue plan for its troubled financial institutions has consisted primarily of attracting foreign money by dismantling longstanding barriers against foreign ownership.
The Government said last month that it would permit foreign investors to own 100 percent of Thai financial institutions for up to 10 years, after which their interests may be diluted. Previously, the limit for banks was 25 percent.
Since then, the ING Bank of the Netherlands has bought a 10 percent stake in the Siam City Bank. The Laem Thong Bank, the country's smallest bank, sold a 40 percent stake to a group of foreign investors. The Bangkok Metropolitan Bank has sought the aid of Taiwan's Government in persuading four Taiwan institutions to invest in the bank.

HEADLINE: A Healthy Economy Shows Some Signs of Taking It a Little Easier

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The economy remains strong but is cooling off, Government reports indicated today, showing lower orders for long-lasting goods in October and a little less total output over the summer than initially estimated.
Other statistics showed industrial conditions mixed in three metropolitan areas this month, and first-time claims for unemployment insurance suggested little softening of the job market. 
 "Over all, it looks like the economy is slowing down," said Elliott Platt, a senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "But I don't think it's any slower than 2 1/2 to 3 percent."
That kind of growth rate in gross domestic product for the current quarter would compare with the 3.3 percent for the July-to-September quarter reported today by the Commerce Department, a revision from its 3.5 percent estimate a month ago.
The reports contributed to mild rallies in the United States stock and bond markets, where investors viewed the signs of a slowdown as evidence that the economy would continue to grow without significant inflationary pressure.
Although the Dow Jones industrial average finished 14.17 points lower, broader market indicators gained. In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a barometer of interest-rate trends and inflation risk, fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent Tuesday.
The Federal Reserve, which has been concerned that overly rapid growth will revive inflation, has refrained from raising interest rates because of the absence of visible price pressures and because of economic turmoil in the Far East.
The latest available minutes of the Fed's Sept. 30 policy meeting showed several members of the Federal Open Market Committee "indicated that economic developments could well require a tightening of policy in the relatively near future."
Most analysts think the economy can only sustain a "speed limit" of 2.5 percent or less without reviving inflation. It has been growing at a rate of 3.3 percent or more for four straight quarters.
Growth is slowing, however. Orders for durable manufactured goods, a future indicator, fell three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the first decline since May. Orders would have tumbled 2.1 percent had it not been for a surge in transportation orders, mainly for airplanes.
The primary metals sector dropped 6.7 percent; electronic equipment dropped 3.3 percent, and industrial machinery dropped 1.9 percent, the Commerce Department's report showed.
Orders for capital goods other than aircraft and military hardware, a closely watched category, fell 4.2 percent, the second big drop in three months. Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis, told clients this decline suggested "some softening in production in the months ahead, which would be welcome news."
Shipments of durable goods, meanwhile, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, also the second decline in three months.
The main reasons for the Commerce Department's lowered estimate of third-quarter G.D.P. were slowdowns in nonresidential building construction, exports of goods and services and business inventories. These more than offset higher estimates for business equipment and personal spending on durable goods.
The chief surprise, analysts said, was that inventories did not show an increase. The decline suggested that production cutbacks may not be needed to keep inventories under control. Personal consumption spending was recalculated at a 5.8 percent rate, up from 5.7 percent a month ago.
The Labor Department's tally of initial jobless claims showed a drop of 31,000, to 303,000, for the week ended last Saturday, more than offsetting a 20,000 rise the week before. On a four-week average, however, claims increased to 316,500, suggesting that payroll growth will moderate, said Stan Shipley, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
Regionally, surveys of corporate purchasing managers showed a modest improvement in industrial activity in New York, a slowdown in Milwaukee and a large increase in Chicago.
Some economists regard the survey of Chicago-area purchasing managers a harbinger of a broader survey done by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which is released at the beginning of each month.
The Government's G.D.P. report also included its first tabulation of third-quarter corporate profits, a gauge watched by policy makers to see whether business continues to improve efficiency at a time when most companies have little power to raise prices.
Profits from current production climbed 2.7 percent for the period, compared with 2 percent in the second quarter, while after-tax profits rose 1.7 percent, the same increase as in the spring.

Treasury Prices Edge Up In Shortened Trading Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher in a quiet, shortened session yesterday.
Bonds received a lift from Government reports showing a surprise drop in orders for durable goods and slower-than-expected third-quarter growth. The data suggested the economy might be losing steam. 
 "Things are definitely starting to slow down," said Ken Anderson, who oversees about $7 billion in bonds for the Evergreen Asset Management Corporation in Purchase, N.Y. "There is room for bonds to rally."
Slower growth is good for bonds because it reduces the risk of inflation, which erodes the value of their fixed payments.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 6/32, to 101 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent on Tuesday. The difference in yield, or spread, between the 30-year bond and the two-year note is now 33 basis points -- the narrowest in almost three years. Investors' willingness to buy long-term securities at such a narrow risk premium suggests that they are confident that inflation will remain contained.
Trading in the Treasury market ended at 2 P.M. yesterday, and will also be abbreviated tomorrow. Today, the market is closed for Thanksgiving.
Bonds fell in overseas trading amid lingering concern that Japanese investors would sell United States securities to support Japan's banks and brokerage firms. But many bond traders and investors in the United States did not see that happening, noting the higher yield Treasuries offer compared with Japan's Government bonds.
"It doesn't make sense for them to remove their highest-yielding asset from their portfolios," said William Lloyd, head of market strategy at BZW Securities Inc.
At yesterday's yield of 5.84 percent, the 10-year United States Treasury note yields 389 basis points more than the 1.95 percent yield on the No. 197 10-year Japanese bond.
Demand for Treasuries has also been bolstered by investors looking to buy securities so their portfolios mirror several indexes that serve as benchmarks for performance.
"There is enough demand at month-end that the market welcomes any drop in prices," said John Spinello, head government bond trader at Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc.
The securities firms that provide the industry indexes usually revise their structure at month's end.

HEADLINE: Dismissal of Retarded Men Puts Hertz in Federal Suit

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The way the people at Hertz look at it, the Government is punishing them for an act of charity: creating make-work jobs for two men with mental retardation.
But the way the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sees it, the Hertz Corporation is an unfair employer that made no effort to meet the needs of its employees with disabilities, and instead dismissed the men, cavalierly, because of inappropriate behavior by the job coach assigned to help them do the job. 
 The commission has charged Hertz with violating the Americans With Disabilities Act in its dismissal of Donald Klem and Kenneth Miller, two men it hired to pick up litter four hours a day at the rental-car lot on the edge of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.
Since Hertz knew the men could not handle the work without a job coach, the E.E.O.C. said, the company had an obligation to try to arrange for a different job coach. In sending the two men away because of their job coach's behavior, it said, Hertz was blaming the victims, and trampling on their fundamental rights as employees.
The Hertz case is the commission's first action on behalf of retarded people and concerns one of the murkiest, most contentious areas of the Federal disabilities law: how far an employer must go to accommodate an employee with disabilities.
Thousands of people with disabilities like retardation, deafness or restricted mobility can hold jobs only with the help of another person who may coach them on how to perform their tasks, do sign-language interpreting or help with basic needs like getting to the bathroom. Such aides are usually paid by social-service agencies and have no direct relationship with the employer, occupying an ambiguous status in the workplace.
The Hertz case, both sides say, could help to define employers' obligations in dealing with such aides.
Hertz hired Mr. Klem and Mr. Miller in April 1994 after being approached by a job developer from an employment agency for people with retardation. The agency promised to send a job coach with the two men to teach and supervise them, at no cost to Hertz. The agency, Arkay Inc., has about 200 retarded clients, about half of whom are in such "supported employment," mostly minimum-wage work cleaning up fast-food restaurants or doing assembling and packaging in light industry.
The Hertz job was a new placement for the agency, and for nearly two months everything went smoothly enough that Hertz officials expanded the men's tasks to include stocking and cleaning the garage and began talking about upgrading the jobs from seasonal to something permanent. Although Mr. Klem, who is 41, sometimes stopped working to watch the airplanes, and once spat on the floor in the presence of customers, he and Mr. Miller, 57, became fixtures on the lot, exchanging waves with the bus drivers who shuttle passengers to the terminals.
But on June 7, the young woman serving as their job coach, Mary Ann Watson, was visited by Jeff Alred, another job coach from the same agency. Hertz said the two were "passionately kissing and fondling each other" in a car. According to the E.E.O.C., Ms. Watson gave Mr. Alred a birthday gift and the two "exchanged a friendly hug."
Whatever took place, it bothered the Hertz managers who saw it so much that they told the job coaches to leave and not return -- and in the process dismissed Mr. Klem and Mr. Miller. Both men live in group homes and are now unemployed.
Hertz said it would no longer allow Arkay job coaches on the premises and did not respond to a letter from Greg Sundell, the executive director of Arkay, asking for reconsideration.
Mr. Sundell then called the E.E.O.C., which filed suit against Hertz in Federal court in Detroit.
"This really upset us," said Joe Russo, a spokesman for Hertz. "We had made clear that we would be willing to have the guys back. We have nothing against supported employment. But we'd had gross misconduct by two job coaches from Arkay and we did not want to work with that agency again."
Deborah Barno, a lawyer for the commission, said the re-employment offer came only after litigation began, and was too little, too late.
Furthermore, she argues, Hertz failed its obligations to Mr. Miller and Mr. Klem by dismissing them for something they had nothing to do with. As a legal matter, when an employer knows a worker has a disability, the American with Disabilities Act requires that employer make a reasonable effort to accommodate the disability.
In this case, the Government says, if Hertz was no longer willing to work with Arkay, it should have tried to find a similar agency that would have provided a job coach.
Hertz, a division of the Ford Motor Company, said it did not have, and should not be expected to have, any knowledge of other agencies. If anyone should have suggested a different agency, Hertz said, it was Arkay.
Hertz has moved for dismissal, arguing that it had not discriminated against the two men but rather had been generous beyond all legal requirements in creating the jobs.
The case boils down to two axioms, the Hertz brief said: "First, no good deed goes unpunished. Second, do no more than the law requires, since any generosity beyond that may cause you adverse consequences."
The company warned that punishing Hertz would make other employers reluctant to hire anyone who needs a job coach.
"A contrary outcome would have a chilling effect on employers and forever dampen their interest in providing anything more than the minimum that the law requires for fear of being forever bound to do so in the future," its brief said.
Disability groups, too, say the Hertz case is important, but worry about a different message. In a friend-of-court brief filed on behalf of several groups concerned with retardation, Disability Rights Advocates, an Oakland, Calif., public-interest firm, argues that if Hertz is not found to have violated the law, other employers will be free to dismiss disabled employees for all kinds of problems unrelated to their job performance.
"Should a deaf person be terminated for the misconduct of his or her sign language interpreter?" the brief asks. "Will an employer be permitted to fire a wheelchair-using employee because a third party built a ramp incorrectly?
For thousands of people like Mr. Klem and Mr. Miller, the growing acceptance of supported employment has made a world of difference. The brief said supported-employment programs had provided job opportunities to more than 140,000 people with severe disabilities who had previously been excluded from the work force. While Mr. Russo, the Hertz spokesman, said he was unaware of any other place where the company had hired a retarded person accompanied by a coach, other large companies, including Marriott, Burger King and McDonald's routinely make such arrangements.
"The importance of this case cannot be overstated," the disability advocates' brief said. "Supported employment in this country has led people with mental retardation from the nightmare of state-funded institutionalization to the freedom and efficiency of the private-sector workplace. This transformation of people from tax burdens to taxpayers has resulted in dramatically enhancing the quality of life for people with mental retardation."
Mr. Sundell, the executive director of Arkay, is not happy that a small problem on the Hertz placement is turning into a big test case.
"Our job is to develop good relationships with the companies we work with," he said. "This was just two young job coaches kissing in a parking lot, and while it's turned into an interesting academic issue, I wish it could have been resolved in a polite conversation with Hertz."

HEADLINE: RUSSIA IS SEEKING MORE WESTERN AID FOR FINANCIAL ILLS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Worried that the global economic turmoil could overwhelm its financial system, Russia is quietly seeking American support for an expanded program of Western assistance, government officials and private bankers said.
The purpose of the aid would be to strengthen confidence in Russia's Central Bank, which has been using up its reserves in an anxious effort to prop up the ruble. 
 Prompted by the crisis that has rippled through Asia, foreign investors have been fleeing from emerging markets. They have already moved to withdraw some $4 billion from the Russian treasury bill market, Central Bank officials said.
Russian officials and private bankers fear that investors may unload billions more, putting further strain on the ruble and heightening concerns about Russia's financial system among Russians and foreigners.
That would not only be an economic setback. It could also deliver a powerful political blow to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin and its agenda of economic reform.
"The Central Bank's reserves are enough to take care of foreign investors," said Pavel Teplukhin, the chief economist for Troika Dialog, a Russian investment bank. "But I am afraid that if Russian investors start panicking and buying dollars, the Central Bank reserves will not be sufficient."
Mr. Teplukhin said the West could ease the crisis by promising to lend up to $5 billion to the Central Bank, though other experts said billions more might be needed.
Publicly, Central Bank officials have sought to reassure the Russian public by putting on a brave face. They have not talked about the possibility of additional assistance or said how much aid they would like to have available to them.
Russian officials estimated last week that their reserves were $21.5 billion, a healthy amount during normal times, but one that is shrinking as the global economic situation worsens.
Sergei Aleksashenko, the deputy head of the Central Bank and Sergei Vasilyev, the deputy head of the Presidential Administration, have been sent to Washington to meet with officials from the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund.
Their goal is to explore whether the West can make more aid available to bolster the credibility of Russia's financial system and discourage any perception that it may be too weak to cope with the crisis on the world markets. In effect, the Russians are seeking a kind of insurance policy.
American officials declined to comment on the sensitive discussions. But the United States has generally taken the stance that the Russian request should be handled by the International Monetary Fund, which would be a likely vehicle for any further assistance.
But Russia's relationship with the I.M.F. is complex. The Fund has suspended its $10 billion loan to Russia because of the Yeltsin Government's failure to crack down on tax evaders. The loan was given to Russia in 1996 to help it carry forward its free-market reforms.
Russian and I.M.F. officials have been engaged in intensive talks over steps Moscow can take so that the disbursements can be restarted. And the Central Bank's concern over the global economic turmoil adds a critical new dimension to the high-stakes deliberations.
This is not the way it was supposed to be. When the Yeltsin Government mapped out its economic strategy this year, it had a rather different scenario in mind.
The Government had already conquered soaring inflation. The aim of Yeltsin aides was to generate economic growth and put Russia's fiscal house in order.
The economic planning was part of a broader political strategy. The hope was that a growing economy would give a boost to pro-free market politicians during the next presidential election in 2000 and keep the hard-line nationalists and Communists at bay.
Toward this end, Mr. Yeltsin promised to overhaul Russia's antiquated tax system and undertake other reforms.
The Government also planned to reduce Russia's huge budget deficit and push down the interest rate on Russian treasury bills to 14 percent by the end of the year.
The Russian Government has financed much of the deficit by issuing treasury bills at high interest rates. But Russia's dependence on treasury bills has raised the Government's debt-serving costs, and high interest rates have hurt the chances for economic growth.
Then the Asian economies faltered, triggering a downturn in global stock markets.
Despite its success in stabilizing its economy, Russia discovered it was particularly vulnerable to the disarray in the global capital markets. Korean investors needed money to cover their losses in Asia and began selling their Russian Eurobonds, driving the price down.
As foreign investors reflexively began pulling their money out of emerging markets, the Russia stock market has falen about 40 percent since early October.
Foreign investors also moved to sell their Russian treasury bills. That was particularly worrisome because foreign investors owned an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion in treasury bills, about a third of the treasury market.
To prevent panic selling, the Central Bank has established a system that requires foreign investors to give a month's notice to sell the bills and convert the rubles they receive from the sales into dollars.
But now a month has almost elapsed since the onset of the crisis, prompting Sergei K. Dubinin, the Chairman of Russian's Central Bank, to call this a "decisive" period.
The Central Bank took one important step: It raised the interest rate of treasury bills to 28 percent from 21 percent to encourage foreign investors to stay in the treasury bill market.
There are other strains.
Russian banks lost money on the stock markets and in bonds. Many of them also have contracts with Western investors requiring them to convert rubles into dollars at agreed-on exchange rates. That makes Russian banks particularly vulnerable if Russia's currency is devalued.
Mr. Teplukhin of Troika Dialog said devaluation could also cause panic among ordinary Russians.
"The public does not feel the immediate effect of high interest rates," he said in an interview. "In Russia, we don't have mortgages. What the public looks at every single day is exchange rate policy."
So far, the Central Bank has been basically maintaining the exchange rate by dipping into its reserve to buy rubles. But the Central Bank's reserves are not unlimited, and include $4.8 billion in gold, which cannot be immediately spent.
Economists estimate that the bank is spending another $4 billion or so to cope with the withdrawal of foreigners from the treasury bill market. The Central Bank is spending still more to deal with Russian investors who are converting their rubles to dollars.
Some economists and investment bankers say more needs to be done. They say the Central Bank needs to hike interest rates once again to discourage the exodus of foreign investors.
The Government, they add, needs to reduce spending and step up revenue collection to shrink the deficit.
But some economists also say additional Western assistance may be needed to ease concern that the Central Bank's reserves are not adequate and to help Russia stabilize its currency.
Economists said Russia could gain some short-term relief by resolving its differences with the I.M.F. over fiscal policy, thus prompting the Fund to renew the disbursement of its loan.
The release a $700 million installment held up since October as well as the disbursement for the first part of 1998 would provide Russia with some $1.4 billion.
It would also unlock more than $1 billion in World Bank disbursements, which have also been delayed as the bank waits for the I.M.F. to give its seal of approval to the Russian economy.
In the meantime, the economic turmoil is threatening to take a political toll. Top Yeltsin aides say the Government may no longer be able to fulfill its much-ballyhooed promise to pay back wages.
The delay in paying wages is a politically explosive issue. Mr. Yeltsin has publicly insisted that the wages be paid, but financial aides say the money is just not there.
Compounding the problem in raising Government revenue, a major privatization was deferred this week when a prominent Russian bank could not come up with enough money to make a bid. Economists say the bank was forced to put off a bond issue because of the turmoil in the world financial markets.
Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based investment bank, noted that the situation is not entirely in Russia's hands. Much will depend on whether the crisis persists in the world capital markets.
"While not a source of the recent waves of emerging market anxiety, Russia could become a victim," it said in a report.

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
Broncos' Secret Is Out: Psst! It's Rod Smith

BYLINE: By Thomas George 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
It was a locker room filled with spirit, filled with joy, just the kind of emotion expected from one of pro football's top teams.
The Denver Broncos, 34-13 winners over the New England Patriots at Mile High Stadium last month, were absolutely ebullient then in what was their signature game of this season. And their emotion and style from it have endured. 
 "This is nothing new for me," boasted Tim McKyer, a Broncos cornerback and a two-time Super Bowl champion with San Francisco. "I know what this feels like. We mix experience with youth. And that team over there, we've got their number."
Denver (10-2) has soundly beaten New England twice in the last two years, and the Broncos' only losses this season have come on the road in their division at Oakland and Kansas City. Games remain at San Diego, Pittsburgh and San Francisco, and then Denver finishes the regular season at home against the Chargers.
The Broncos are the front-runners to claim home-field advantage throughout the American Football Conference playoffs. They would like to creep quietly there, but the rest of the conference, after watching them dismantle the Patriots, the defending A.F.C. champions, and then after seeing their 31-3 mauling of the Raiders on Monday night, well, the rest of the A.F.C. hears the Broncos' footsteps.
Broncos receiver Rod Smith is that way. He wants to quietly creep up on the enemy. But they already hear Smith's footsteps.
Entering this season, a question mark concerning the Broncos was whether they possessed a big-play receiver who could stretch defenses, a home run hitter. Anthony Miller has gone to Dallas, and was there anyone left who could fill the role?
Enter Smith.
With all of their talent and leadership, Denver's X-factor is Rod Smith. We do not know just how good he can be. He is 6 feet and 195 pounds, a striking figure at receiver, a guy who can block as well as he can catch. He is not afraid to get his uniform dirty. He is hungry.
"Nobody knows me," Smith said. "They don't know what I can do. The defensive backs haven't had time to study me. That keeps me a good part of the game plan. I don't want them to know me -- until the end."
Opponents are getting to know Smith quite well. He has 53 receptions for 899 yards and averages 17 yards a catch, best in the league. He has seven scoring passes, including a 78-yarder.
Football personnel experts knew little and cared little about Smith in 1994. He left Missouri Southern with three degrees (economics, marketing and business administration) and nice receiving numbers. But he was not drafted and signed with Denver as a free agent.
He spent 1994 on the practice squad and spent most of the last two seasons on special teams. He missed six games last season because of a broken collarbone. These were Smith's numbers entering this season: 26 games (2 starts), 22 catches, 3 touchdowns, 23 punt returns. Hardly anything to make a defense shiver.
"I looked over at Terry Glenn for New England, and he has it all," Smith said, referring to the Patriots' wide receiver. "First-round pick. Rookie of the year in a lot of people's books last year. A millionaire."
Don't you make a million, Smith was asked? "Not even close," he answered, laughing.
Smith, 27, is earning $400,000 this season. The Broncos have a steal. And now they have a deep threat that makes them complete, not only on offense, but also an edge that makes them favorites to get to the Super Bowl.
"He is very competitive; he just wants the ball," McKyer said of Smith. "Sometimes with him, there is nothing a defensive back can do."
Broncos back Vaughn Hebron said: "He is a trooper. Easygoing and so athletic. He has been overlooked. He was supposed to be one of our weak spots, but Rod has proved to be a special guy. He makes plays, his actions speak and he is stepping out into his own."
The veteran safety Steve Atwater added, "Rod is the man."
Smith is from Texarkana, Ark., also home of Willie Davis, the former Green Bay Packer and Hall of Famer. Nothing pleases him more than the accolades from his teammates. He is a model of perseverance. How many stars in this league languished on the practice squad and on special teams before reaching the level Smith has?
"I'm just doing my job," Smith said. "I tell my friends: 'There is no difference from me and you. I just have a job that is a little more famous.'
"But I have found in any job that if you follow the rules and work hard you can't lose. Coaches can sense players who are hungry. I never doubted my abilities. There was a time there where I doubted if I would get the chance."
Smith is active in charities and with youth organizations. His teammates say he has an innate giving nature. So, it is little wonder that he wants to share his success.
These Broncos realize that the finish is more important than the start. They were 13-3 last season and then were promptly kicked from the playoffs, at home, by Jacksonville. These Broncos are intent on persevering through this season. They need look no further than one of their own, at Smith, for a model.
"The whole thing is to take advantage of opportunities," Smith said. "Don't sit back and let it slip. Go day by day and get through until tomorrow. Every day I come to work, I say: 'Well, I got another day of work. Another day.'
"Even if the Broncos were to cut me today, how did I fail? I only fail if I quit. The hardest part for me now is to help more people get where I am. To help kids realize their dreams, whether it is football or not. I go out to the kids. I share with people. I want them to see me without my helmet on."

HEADLINE: American Negotiator Hedges Over Climate Treaty Talks

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Saying that criticisms by other countries of the United States' position on global warming are "ill-founded," the Clinton Administration's new chief negotiator on a climate treaty acknowledged today that it might not be possible to bridge the remaining differences with Europe and the developing world.
"We are not going in with the notion that we have to have an agreement at any cost," Under Secretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat said in a telephone conversation with journalists as he prepared to lead the American delegation to talks that will begin next week in Japan. 
 "We will go to Kyoto and make an all-out effort," Mr. Eizenstat said. But he added that he was "neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but realistic," about the difficulties.
"We must remember that nations remain quite far apart," he said, "and achieving agreement will be a challenge."
Whether his comments were meant to lower expectations and pave the way for possible failure or a weakened treaty, or to raise the pressure and persuade other countries to make concessions, Mr. Eizenstat's remarks were more guarded than those made recently by his predecessor as chief negotiator, Tim Wirth. Mr. Wirth had said that differences with Europe, especially, were not so great and were shrinking.
In contrast, Mr. Eizenstat said that the United States had "significant problems" with a central feature of Europe's position: that members of the European Union be considered as a unit in achieving reductions in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap the sun's heat like a greenhouse, rather than requiring each nation to achieve reductions. He called it "an artificial advantage, and one that no other country or set of countries has."
The United States, Mr. Eizenstat said, would insist that many developing countries agree to binding reductions in their emissions of those gases "over a reasonable period of time," but he added that these commitments need not be the same as the targets for developed countries.
The commitments must come from the wealthier developing countries, measured by per capita income, and from the developing countries that, because of their sheer size, emit large amounts of such greenhouse gases, Mr. Eizenstat said.
Those countries would probably include, among others, the top five sources of carbon dioxide emissions in the developing world: China, India, South Korea, South Africa and Mexico, which among them in 1996 gave off almost as much greenhouse gases as the United States. Their emissions have been growing much faster than American emissions, although emissions per person in the United States are much greater.
"We are talking about focusing on key developing countries," Mr. Eizenstat said. "They have to make a meaningful contribution."
Mr. Eizenstat said a provision in the current draft of the proposed treaty, allowing developing countries to sign up voluntarily for binding emissions targets, was a positive step toward what the Administration is seeking. But he said that a treaty, to be acceptable, also had to provide for international trading of emission control credits, which would let countries like the United States pay for reductions to be made in other countries instead of making domestic cuts at greater expense.

HEADLINE: Disney in Licensing Deal for Tokyo Park

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Nov. 26

 BODY:
Building on the success of Tokyo Disneyland, the Walt Disney Company said today that it had entered into a licensing agreement for a new ocean-theme park on Tokyo Bay.
The $2.6 billion Tokyo Disneysea, to be built on 167 acres of bay landfill, is expected to draw more than 10 million visitors a year, Disney said. 
 The park will be built, owned and operated by the Oriental Land Company, the owner of Tokyo Disneyland. Disney will license its names and characters and act as a consultant in the park's construction and operation, said Jim Cora, president of Disneyland International.
Tokyo Disneyland typically is the company's best-attended park, attracting more than 17 million visitors last year, Mr. Cora said. It also has the highest per-capital expenditures by visitors of any Disney park, said Steve Balgrosky, a theme park industry analyst with Economics Research Associates in Los Angeles.
The announcement was the latest in a series of expansions planned by Disney. The company is scheduled next year to open the 500-acre Disney Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida. The company also is starting Disney Quest, high-tech game centers that eventually will be in 20 or more United States cities, and the ESPN Grill, themed restaurants and game centers based on the ESPN sports network.
Disneysea will include seven areas, including one based on the stories of Jules Verne.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Mixed, With Dow Off 14.17

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Investors gained some solace from calmer markets in Asia yesterday, but uncertainty about the extent of the problems in the region and the fallout on corporate earnings of American multinationals left Wall Street stocks mixed.
While Japan's benchmark stock index rose 1.1 percent yesterday, changing gears after a 5.1 percent stumble Tuesday, multinational companies like Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down 14.17 points, to 7,794.78, as broader market indexes eked out small gains. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.82 point, to 951.64. 
 "I think it makes sense for investors to be wary of what's happening," said Barbara Marcin, senior portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management.
Although American multinational corporations receive only a small percentage of their earnings from Asia, Ms. Marcin believes that the downturn in that region could have a broader impact worldwide by damping demand for other countries' products as well.
Asian markets continued to steady early today. At the midday recess in trading, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks was ahead by 290.41 points, or 1.81 percent, at 16,335.96.
South Korean stocks ended their morning session down 2.32 points, or a half of 1 percent, at 436.38, while Hong Kong stocks were little changed in early trading.
Despite the calm in Asian stock markets, Japan's financial problems are worrying some strategists in the United States.
"This development can't be overlooked; it's not a transitory event," Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Smith Barney said of the recent bank and brokerage firm failures in Japan. But, investors and analysts are having a difficult time gauging the impact because "we don't know how much Asia is going to slow down and we don't know what industries and companies are going to be affected."
As a result, being wary of multinationals is an "appropriate first response," Mr. Acuff added.
And comments from Asian and American leaders at the Asia Pacific economic conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, did not totally reassure investors that the crisis was under control, said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City, Kan.
"The Canada conversations were mostly to say that the central banks are prepared to insure liquidity in the event of more problems," Mr. Herrmann said.
"It's good for depositors, but I don't know that that's all that reassuring" for investors, he added.
While the Asian crisis unfolds, Mr. Herrmann believes investors should avoid cyclical stocks, which would perform poorly if the Asian economic slowdown is a significant drag on American growth, and companies in the capital goods sector, such as heavy-equipment manufacturers.
Instead, they should focus on companies with more predictable earnings from domestic sources and little exposure to emerging markets.
"I think there are opportunities on a long-term basis, but I wouldn't want to be calling the bottom," he said. Clearer signs of the impact on United States companies may not come until first-quarter earnings reports in 1998, he said.
Some investors seem to be in Mr. Herrmann's camp. Alan Bond, chief investment officer for Bond Procope Capital Managagment which oversees $500 million, is reducing his exposure to technology shares like Applied Materials, the leading maker of semiconductor maufacturing equipment, and will not increase his holdings of money center banks with exposure to Asia.
Instead, he's buying retailers like Costco and regional banks like Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati, Sovereign Bancorp in Wyomissing, Pa. and Northern Trust Corporation in Chicago.
"We're not running for the hills, but it's certainly a run for cover," Mr. Bond said of his more domestic stance.
Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear, Stearns, said investors could consider multinational companies with limited exposure to Asia such as American Express and Hewlett-Packard. For Hewlett, "Europe is probably more important to them than Asia," she added.
Ms. Marcin of Citibank said she believed that some declines among multinationals may have been overdone and investors should consider picking up capital goods stocks like Deere, Boeing and Raytheon. Having exposure to overseas markets is still "an attractive long-term quality for a company to have," she said. And some investors believe that even as events unfold, it is safe to stick a toe or even wade into Asian waters.

Asia Lull Helps Markets, But Wall Street Is Still Wary
Calmer markets in Asia yesterday provided some solace to investors in the United States. Although the Dow Jones industrial average retreated for a 14.17-point loss, most stock indexes finished with small gains. 
 But the American markets remained unsettled by the unknown extent of the economic problems that have engulfed the so-called tiger economies of Southeast Asia and now appear to threaten Japan. D3.
 
The Pacific summit meeting in Vancouver produced a reassuring message that Asia's financial crisis will be contained. But there are reasons to doubt that the key players can prevent the crisis from worsening first. Peter Passell: Economic Scene. D2.
 
Japan's promises to restore calm in its banking system helped the yen gain slightly against the dollar, one day after the Japanese currency touched a five-year low. D11.
 
China Sees Danger Signs
China suffers from heavier external debt, more bad loans and a shakier banking system than any of its Asian neighbors. Still, the region's problems may give officials in Beijing -- in particular China's chief economic official, Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji -- the impetus they need to push through change in the financial system. News Analysis. A8.
 
Russia Unsettled by Asian Fallout
Worried about the global economic turmoil emanating from Asia, Russia is quietly seeking American support for an expanded program of Western assistance, primarily to strengthen confidence in its central bank, officials and private bankers said. A1.
 
Cancer Treatment Approved
The Food and Drug Administration approved a new genetically engineered drug for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The drug, Rituxan, will be made and marketed by Genentech Inc. A28.
 
$1 Billion Phone Deal
ACC, largely a long-distance company, agreed to be acquired by Teleport Communications Group, which provides local phone service, in a stock swap valued at $1 billion. D16.
 
Lauders to Pay I.R.S. $40 Million
Relatives of Estee Lauder, the octogenarian founder of the cosmetics company, closed out a stock transaction intended to defer capital gains, now far costlier under the new tax law that the Lauder family's tax-deferral strategy helped inspire. As a result, the Lauders will pay $40 million in taxes. D2.
 
Revolt Against Managed Care
The baby-boomer generation, which has set the national agenda for three decades, is increasingly balking at constraints imposed by H.M.O.'s, slowing the managed-care trend that seemed unstoppable a few years ago. A1.
 
Higher OPEC Production Seen
Emissaries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met in Jakarta, Indonesia, with the common aim of raising output, and it appeared they could reach an agreement by Saturday. D4.
 
Crude oil prices fell sharply in reaction to the likelihood of higher OPEC production quotas. The January-delivery contract for light sweet crude fell 58 cents, to $19.15 a barrel. Prices for refined petroleum also dropped. D11.
 
Eurotunnel Bankruptcy Averted
Eurotunnel's creditors approved a plan restructuring more than $14 billion in debt amassed by the undersea thoroughfare linking Britain and France. D4.
 
Meditrust Quits Hotel Talks
Meditrust withdrew from talks about buying Interstate Hotels, the nation's largest independent hotelier, for a reported $1.3 billion. Interstate is said to be close to a deal with Patriot American Hospitality. D2.
 
U.S. Markets Closed
Financial markets in the United States are closed today for Thanksgiving. Most overseas markets, however, are open. United States markets will reopen tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Tests on Mice Block a Defense by Cancer

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
Many drugs work well at first against cancer, but the tumor cells quickly develop resistance. A concept for getting around the resistance problem has now been proved, at least in laboratory mice, and may well prove relevant to the treatment of human cancer.
The idea is to attack the cells that build capillaries, a network of fine blood vessels that nurture fast-growing tumors. It exploits the fact that the capillary-making cells are normal, genetically stable cells and should therefore, unlike tumor cells, be incapable of developing resistance. 
 Researchers at Children's Hospital in Boston report that the capillary-making cells in mouse tumors did not develop resistance to repeated doses of a recently discovered agent that inhibits their activity. A second finding, both unexpected and unexplained, was that although the tumors at first grew back when the drug was withheld, they did not recur after two or more repetitions. The results are being published today in the journal Nature.
"For years, we thought you could hold tumors in check with angiogenesis inhibitors, but to actually cure them is amazing," said Dr. Noel Bouck, an expert on blood vessel formation, or angiogenesis, at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
Dr. Douglas Hanahan, a cancer biologist at the University of California at San Francisco, said that "the reality is not going to be as exciting as the response in these mice" but that he expected angiogenesis inhibitors in time to become a useful component of cancer therapy.
The idea of retarding tumors by attacking their blood supply system is not new. The first generation of angiogenesis-inhibiting drugs is now undergoing clinical trials. But at least some of these drugs attack the tumor cells themselves, by aiming at the chemical signals with which they trick the vessel-making cells into building a blood supply for them. The tumor cells can switch to other chemical signals and thus become resistant.
In January, researchers from Dr. Judah Folkman's laboratory at Children's Hospital reported their discovery of an agent that singles out active capillary-making cells and shuts them down. The researchers, led by Dr. Michael O'Reilly, named the substance endostatin. Unlike the first generation of angiogenesis inhibitors, which merely retard the growth of tumors in experimental mice, endostatin makes tumors shrink to microscopic size, as does another agent named angiostatin. A speck of angiostatin was first distilled by Dr. O'Reilly in 1994 from about 21 quarts of mouse urine.
With endostatin in hand, the Boston team was able to aim specifically for the capillary-making cells and address the question of whether they would develop resistance. Using mice with a particularly aggressive kind of tumor, they injected endostatin in stop-and-start cycles, a pattern that favors the emergence of resistance to drugs.
At first, the tumors shrank when their blood supply was cut off and then they grew back when endostatin was stopped. As predicted, in cycle after cycle the capillary-making cells did not develop resistance to the agent. Around last Thanksgiving, Dr. O'Reilly noticed that the tumors were no longer growing back after endostatin was withdrawn. Tumor cells were still there but had reverted to a dormant cluster, too small to need its own blood supply, and had not grown back throughout the lifetimes of the mice.
Dr. Folkman reported these results at a recent meeting of cancer biologists in Frederick, Md. When he presented a graph showing the mouse tumors growing and regressing several times and then lapsing into dormancy, there was an audible gasp, Dr. Bouck said.
"It was really one of those magical moments in science," she said.
The ability of endostatin to make mouse tumors regress without developing resistance is "unprecedented and could herald a new era of cancer treatment," Dr. Robert S. Kerbel wrote in a commentary in Nature, adding, however, that the era "could be years away."
It was Dr. Kerbel, a cancer biologist at the Sunnybrook Health Science Center in Toronto, who suggested six years ago that targeting the capillary-making cells should be the way around the problem of drug resistance. Dr. Kerbel said that neither he nor others could test the idea at the time because suitable agents to be directed at the capillary-making cells were not available.
The patent on both the mouse and human forms of angiostatin belongs to Children's Hospital. It has licensed them to Entremed, a small biotechnology company in Rockville, Md., which has been a major supporter of Dr. Folkman's research since 1994. Entremed has in turn licensed Bristol Myers-Squibb, a large pharmaceuticals company, to produce and market angiostatin. The company also has an option, not yet exercised, to develop endostatin.
"We are several years away from clinical trials," Dr. Folkman said, adding that at present his laboratory could barely produce enough endostatin for its own research needs.
Both the angiostatin and endostatin, isolated by Dr. O'Reilly and his colleagues in Dr. Folkman's laboratory, are from mice, but there is every reason to assume that the human versions have the same or similar properties. By one of nature's economies, both agents are part of larger protein molecules. Angiostatin is a fragment of a substance called plasminogen, involved in blood clotting, and endostatin is the tail end of a kind of collagen, a protein of connective tissue.
Both agents become active when cut loose from their parent protein. These fragments may be produced all the time to make sure the blood vessel system is firmly restrained, Dr. Hanahan said, or they may be generated just after processes that require new blood vessels, like wound healing.
Dr. Folkman said he did not yet know how or why the endostatin forced the mouse tumor cells into dormancy, nor is it known how endostatin acts on the capillary-making cells.

Loan Pool for Health Care

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Four of New York City's largest banks have established a $25 million pool of low-interest loans dedicated to building and expanding health care centers in the city's low-income neighborhoods, said the Primary Care Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that will administer the loans.
Loans of up to $3 million, with an interest rate of about 6 percent, are intended for family clinics, dental offices and other health care projects. 
 The group said its first two loans would be for Brooklyn projects: $2.2 million to expand a pediatric center in Bushwick and $1.6 million to convert a warehouse into a family clinic in Flatbush.
J. P. Morgan, the Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank and Republic National Bank have helped finance the project, which has received grants from the Federal Government and New York State, the group said.
Bank executives said the project enabled them to support health care and economic development in poor areas. THOMAS J. LUECK

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Andrew Tobias;
Always Playing With Money

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
THE year was 1977, New York City was broke, and a thrifty 30-year-old magazine writer was buying his first apartment: two bedrooms in the San Remo on Central Park West for $41,000. Twenty years later, it will surprise no one that the value of the apartment (more than $600,000) has grown along with the fortunes of the city.
"If I'd had any brains," says Andrew Tobias, who concedes that when he was at Harvard, he was better at making money than going to class, "I'd have spent an extra $10,000 for a view, and it would be worth $1 million now." Still, Mr. Tobias calls the apartment the best investment he ever made. 
 Which is saying something. Mr. Tobias, the financial writer with the sense of the absurd, has sold more than a million copies of "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" (Harcourt Brace). He grew rich with a line of personal-finance software, until Windows and Quicken made it obsolete. Now, he is the author of "My Vast Fortune: The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist" (Random House), an amusing look back at the eccentric financial life of a man with a Fifth Avenue childhood and an enormous sense of guilt.
The memoir chronicles the success of an investor who is haunted by a feeling that everything is his fault, or at least his responsibility. Mr. Tobias embarked on his most quixotic adventure when he spent $250,000 battling Ralph Nader and unsuccessfully fighting for no-fault auto insurance in California, where he has never lived. (He joined the battle when a state senator tried to turn a book Mr. Tobias wrote about auto insurance into a California constitutional amendment. "I said great," Mr. Tobias says. "But he said 'Don't get too excited, it won't pass.' ") Mr. Tobias also bought air time in 1993 and 1994 in the former Soviet Union to appear in his own antismoking commercials, on which he spoke the Russian he learned in high school. He measures his success by the parody the commercials inspired on a Russian Ed Sullivan-style show. "The happiest day of my life," he says, pleased that somebody was paying attention.
Mr. Tobias, 50, is talking in the crown jewel of his investments, the San Remo apartment, his home for two fall months of the year. (Today he will be there, too, to crane his neck through the window to watch the Thanksgiving Day parade. Then he'll have turkey at his mother and stepfather's apartment on Central Park South.) Mr. Tobias's primary residence has been Miami since the 1980's, when he lost an elaborate war with New York City over $44,000 in unincorporated business taxes -- he argued that it was absurd to tax a writer as a business, especially for income earned outside New York -- but he eventually gave up, paid, then moved. "I didn't leave over the money," he says. "I left over the way they treated me like a criminal."
In any case, he likes to visit. He takes a guest into the kitchen, opens his refrigerator -- there's fuchsia-colored ostrich meat, flown in from Louisiana, in the freezer -- and offers a Starbucks Frappuccino. For the place of a man who prides himself on frugality, it is decorated well and expensively in the style of fin-de-siecle Upper West Side: two enormous white sofas that swallow up the occupants, deep-blue dining room walls hung with framed New Yorker cartoons, a sleek washer-dryer combination from Germany that cost, with tax and delivery, $4,300.
"I had a heart attack when we bought this thing," Mr. Tobias says.
He liked the apartment's former 1970's look. "I had wonderful Haitian cotton Door Store everything," he says. "I thought it was great."
The decorator is Mr. Tobias's companion of three years, Charles Nolan, who designs the Ellen Tracy clothing line with Linda Allard. Their relationship is a source of happiness for Mr. Tobias, who used the pen name John Reid to write "The Best Little Boy in the World" (1973), a funny, poignant memoir about growing up gay. In the last five years, Mr. Tobias has gradually come out, and relaxed. "It's very nice to be able to be who you are," he says.
He is as cheerful and self-deprecating as his writing, a man who has always liked "being with" money, as he puts it, but has always had the urge to give as much as half of his income away. He gives to, among others, Steven Spielberg's Shoah Project, which videotapes testimony of Holocaust survivors, Zero Population Growth, a scholarship that pays full tuition for a student at Xavier University in New Orleans and, yes, the Democratic National Committee. "Nobody wants campaign finance reform more than me," he says. "It would save me a fortune."
But why no-fault auto insurance?
"It's the last thing people want to think about," he says sheepishly. "Believe me, often I think, 'Oh God, if only I hadn't gotten into this.' But somehow I fell into this thing, and it's kind of my responsiblity. If I'm not going to do it, knowing as much about it as I do, then no one's going to do it." He traces his involvement to the day in 1978 when his literary agent, Nan Talese, brought him a stack of insurance texts that led to "The Invisible Bankers," Mr. Tobias's book about abuse in the insurance industry. The texts were throwaways from Ms. Talese's husband, Gay Talese, who chose to write instead about sex in "Thy Neighbor's Wife."
"Not for nothing does Talese get the big bucks," Mr. Tobias wrote in his new book.
Mr. Tobias takes up 46 pages in his new book with the intricacies of the no-fault insurance battle but does acknowledge on page 100 that he may be the only person who finds it fascinating. He apologizes on page 106, saying he knows it is time to wrap up, but then goes on until page 115. He concedes he is obsessed, but for a reason. "Here's a way that as a nation we could be meaningfully more prosperous and more humane to people who are hurt in car crashes," he says.
His position on true no-fault is that it will usher in a world without lawsuits, in which drivers need buy insurance only to protect themselves. In essence, his California battle was against trial lawyers, and he was horrified to conclude that Ralph Nader, his onetime hero, was on their side. In fact, the title of his book's insurance chapter is "Ralph Nader Is a Big Fat Idiot."
Mr. Tobias will not own up to how vast his fortune is, although he hints that it is somewhere in the $10 million range. It is a "tongue in cheek" vast fortune, he emphasizes, particularly in New York, where he says there are apartments he can't afford. In his view, his friend David Geffen, a founding partner of Dreamworks SKG, has a vast fortune.
"If he has an ocean liner fortune, I have a rowboat," he says. "But most people just have toy boats in the bathtub, so I'm very happy."
Mr. Tobias says he began accumulating his fortune in 1952, when his father, an advertising executive, gave him $5 for his fifth birthday. He liked the feel of dollar bills in his pocket, was competitive and came to see money as a way of keeping score. He grew up in what he calls a "basic, blessed, very upper middle class" home on Fifth Avenue and 68th Street, with weekends at the family's country house in Bedford in Westchester County.
Mr. Tobias's mother adored him and told him regularly that he was a gifted child, although he remembers himself as profoundly "out of it," particularly on the day in the second grade when a new driver on the bus home from Hunter Elementary School asked him where he lived. Mr. Tobias hadn't a clue. "I panicked," he recalls. "Nobody told me there was going to be a quiz."
At Harvard, Mr. Tobias found that he was far less interested in reading Russian novels than in trying to put "Let's Go," then a slender Harvard Student Agencies guide to Europe, into the black. Mr. Tobias installed a WATS line, recruited students to phone bookstores across the country, conducted a customer survey and appeared, 18 and terrified, on "Today." By the time he graduated in 1968, "Let's Go" was making money (today it is a series of 26 travel guides) and Mr. Tobias had earned enough to buy an Acapulco-blue Mustang for $2,411.
He went to work as a writer for New York magazine at $18,000 a year and hardly ever took cabs because they stood in the way of saving money. "I was one of the cheapest guys on the face of the planet," he writes. In 1976, he was given $10,000 "to play with" by Esquire magazine for a monthly column on the stock market. Mr. Tobias was to report to readers on his gains and losses. His first instinct was to invest in municipal bonds that were to mature in 2004, but he realized that this would make for a good column every 28 years, at the time of purchase and the time of redemption. He believed then, as now, that patience, not pizazz, is the best investment strategy.
Nine months later, after adventures in oil-field-service-company stocks and "dumb little stereo and electronics companies that nearly went bankrupt," Mr. Tobias had $13,992. "I did all the things that one shouldn't do," he says. "I bet on tips from friends, and that kind of stuff. It violated all my principles." Today, he owns "a whole other set of dumb stocks," including shares in an umbrella company in Thailand, where the economy is collapsing. "I'm not suggesting this was smart," he says.
Mr. Tobias is also working on a sequel to "The Best Little Boy in the World" and writing a daily financial column on the Internet (available through www.ameritrade.com). His investment advice remains as prudent and simple as ever: make a budget, scrimp, pay off credit cards, quit smoking, fully fund your retirement plan and tomorrow start putting away whatever you can afford in short- and intermediate-term Treasuries, as well as no-load, low-expense stock market index funds.
Mr. Tobias is still something of a tightwad, although he does take cabs now, indulges himself in a historic-document collection (he has a complete collection of signatures from the Munchkins in "The Wizard of Oz") and passes up fatty ground beef for lean ostrich burgers. "They taste like ketchup," he says.
His most amusing indulgence remains parting with his money.
"There's no such thing as altruism," he says. "I'm being selfish. I really get a tremendous charge out of trying to do these things."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday in the House & Home section about Andrew Tobias, the financial writer with a sense of the absurd, and the apartment on Central Park West where he sojourns in the autumn, misstated his affiliation with Nan Talese in 1978. She was his editor, not his literary agent.

HEADLINE: Managed Care Logic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The health care industry portrays itself as an economic victim of empty beds (news article, Nov. 22), yet those beds are empty by its own design. The beds increase revenue, and like all valuable merchandise they command a high price: more than $264,000 each in 1996 hospital merger deals. 
 The perverse logic of managed care -- denying access while increasing layoffs of the highest skilled care givers -- has become the medical fast track to increased market share and profits. The empty-by-design strategy allows the industry to serve larger geographic areas with fewer beds, fewer services and fewer skilled care givers while dumping the sickest and most expensive patients on public and other underfinanced hospitals.
The strategy works, but not for patients.

HEADLINE: America's Top Truck Is Turning 50

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE granddaddy of the modern American pickup truck, the Ford F-Series, will be a half-century old next week.
Much has changed since Dec. 3, 1947, when the nation was swept up in postwar optimism and the first F-Series trucks rolled off an assembly line in Atlanta. The 1948 model F-1 -- the smallest, half-ton version of a series that ranged up to the three-ton F-8 -- had chrome trim, boxy fenders and exposed running boards, but they were a big step toward modernity compared with the bulbous trucks they replaced, whose basic design dated to 1938. 
 And the '48 pickup begat a long and successful bloodline. More than 26 million F-Series trucks have been built, and more than 8 million remain on the road. This autumn, the series is well on its way to winning the title of America's best-selling vehicle for the 16th consecutive year. In 1996, Ford sold more than 780,000 F-Series trucks, nearly twice as many as the No. 1 car, the Taurus.
Ford is noting the milestone with a 50th anniversary logo on each 1998 model F-Series; the oval decal shows a 1948 F-1 alongside the new model, and carries the slogan "Built Ford tough." That sentiment hasn't changed much: back in 1948, the slogan was "Built stronger to last longer."
The trucks have come a long way since 1948, when they were mainly workhorses for businesses and farmers. But just as many farm families have migrated to cities and suburbs, so have pickups, which now come gussied up with leather upholstery, CD players and other touches of luxury. Prices have gone upscale, too: in 1948, a brand-new F-1 cost $1,144. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $7,605 now. A 1998 model F-150 starts at $15,375 and runs past $30,000.
And like the trucks, the world has changed since 1948. More than 10,000 workers now assemble the pickups worldwide. Factories in Venezuela, Brazil, Canada and Mexico, along with those in the United States, now churn out the F-Series.

HEADLINE: Grand Tour of Bites and Bargains

BYLINE: By MIMI SHERATON; Mimi Sheraton is a former restaurant critic of The New York Times whose latest book is "Food Markets of the World" (Abrams).

 BODY:
It seems that I always need something on Grand Street. The lure on the Lower East Side might be yeasty bialys, a concert or bargains in panty hose, linens or toys. In Little Italy, I shop for scamorza, the dried mozzarella properly used in lasagna, or a special pasta cutter or a CD of Neapolitan folk songs. Where Chinatown edges into Little Italy, I buy a bamboo steamer, a fresh-killed guinea hen from a live-poultry market or a palate-tingling Malaysian chili crab. Or I find a glass shade for an antique brass lamp. In SoHo, I am drawn to art galleries, boutiques and the intriguing cuisines of India and Ethiopia.
After so many ad hoc forays, I began to wonder about Grand Street itself. What have I missed? And was the street ever truly grand? There are other famed downtown bargain streets -- Orchard, Delancey, Mulberry, Canal -- but none rivals Grand for a diverse ethnic mix nor for the assortment of merchandise, food stores and restaurants at all price levels. Noshing along this route, you can get fat in at least 15 languages. Most of all, Grand Street signifies the continuing immigrant saga of hope, struggle and achievement. 
 Others share that feeling. Explaining why he chose the name Grand Street for the avant-garde literary quarterly he founded in 1981 (and edited until 1990), Ben Sonnenberg said: "It was partly to honor the memory of my four immigrant grandparents who settled on Grand Street, where my parents met. But it was also the spirit of this long east-west street that had so many different ethnic communities on it. I wanted the contents of the magazine to be just as international and heterogeneous."
Similarly, David H. Goldsmith, chairman of the 76-year-old Grand Street Boys' Association and its foundation, conceded that the organization's headquarters were never on that street. It was not even the home of all 12 original members, immigrants and first-generation Americans who lived in the neighborhood, made good and set about helping others do the same. "Because it was the Broadway of the Lower East Side," he explained, "a big, wide, important street, it symbolized the best of the Lower East Side." On and off for seven months this year, I walked the two miles of Grand Street. I never turned a corner to go even one building north or south, no matter how great the temptation. The user-friendly Streetwise map I followed clearly delineates Grand Street's neighborhoods: the Lower East Side from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive to the east side of the Bowery; Little Italy from the Bowery to the east side of Broadway, with Chinatown making inroads on the south side of Grand Street from Mulberry to Chrystie Streets; and SoHo from Broadway west to Varick Street, where Grand Street ends.
Although Grand Street's building numbers begin at its western edge, its history starts at the East River. But the area richest in lore is the least prepossessing: old buildings long ago gave way to huge housing projects. These include some of the earliest sponsored by the trade unions representing garment workers, like the Corlears Hook Houses. (The name is a reminder of the estate on that site when the Dutch ruled New Amsterdam.)
Called by the British the Road to Crown Point, the former name of the place where the street meets the East River, Grand Street is believed to have been laid out from the river to the Bowery between 1755 and 1766, and received its current name after the Revolution. From the river to Essex Street, it is a very wide boulevard; then it narrows to normal city proportions. It was extended through the years, replacing other street names to the west, until it reached its present border on Varick Street.
From 1830 to 1870, the foot of Grand Street was an important shipbuilding area where Irish immigrants built several clipper ships that were important in the China trade. At its peak, in the mid- to late-19th century, the wide avenue was the site of Ridley's (at Allen Street), the largest department store in the United States until it closed in 1901, and the second Lord & Taylor store (at Broadway), which closed in 1903. That year also marked the beginning of Grand Street's decline, as it was overshadowed by the newly widened Delancey Street, the access road to the just completed Williamsburg Bridge.
 
Lower East Side
Other than the sparkle of light bouncing off the river and the greenery of garden parks, there is little to engage the eye. Here and there, one gets a glimpse of segments of the Williamsburg Bridge to the north, like a piece of abstract sculpture suspended against the sky. The quiet, low-key atmosphere is so peaceful, it is almost ghostly.
The buildings are still occupied by many older Jewish residents, more recently joined by younger families discovering the convenience of city life with a few synagogues and even a kosher butcher in easy walking distance. Many Chinese families have bought co-ops, too, and signs for medical and social services throughout the area are in English, Yiddish and Chinese.
Among the few visible remnants of the past are the worn little houses at 511, 513 and 515 Grand Street, and, at the corner of East Broadway, the elegant red-and-white Classic Revival building completed in 1904. It is now a mikvah, a ritual bath for Orthodox Jewish women. The monogram ATH over the doorway recalls its past as the Arnold Toynbee Hall, a site for political gatherings.
Another piece of history is St. Mary's Church, the oldest Roman Catholic structure in New York City. That distinction refers to the back portion, built of gray ashlar stone in 1832. St. Mary's strangely proportioned red-brick facade with twin spires was added in 1871, when the interior was extended.
Over cloudlike scones and tea with the pastor, the Rev. Neil Connolly, in the Victorian parlor of the rectory, I met Andrew Rudyk, a lawyer and St. Mary's historian. Once a primarily Irish congregation that intermittently included Germans and Poles, St. Mary's now caters to a mostly Hispanic community, rapidly expanding with Mexican arrivals.
In the ecumenical spirit, two street-side vitrines honor the festivals and holidays of other groups in the area, with displays for Passover and Chinese New Year as well as Christmas and Easter. It's a far cry from neighborhood animosities in 1828, when the original church on this site was burned to the ground by bigots who feared the "dangerous interests" of the Catholic Church.
Catering to the social and artistic needs of all the neighborhood groups is the Abrons Arts Center, in the only distinguished modern building along this stretch. Fine and performing arts are taught and exhibited in this 1975 branch of the Henry Street Settlement, which has its main offices in landmark town houses on its eponymous street. There are performances in dance, drama and music at the adjoining Harry De Jour Playhouse, the prettily restored theater that dates from 1915.
Daniel Kronenfeld, the executive director of the Henry Street Settlement, said that each year 1,600 students from the community attend its classes, while 10,000 local children take part in art education programs at their own schools. These include classes in painting, sculpture, ceramics, music and dance; flamenco was recently added at the request of Father Connolly, on behalf of his Hispanic parishioners.
Multicultural is also the word for eating habits here. Ruby (the Fruitman) Baumgarten has catered to a primarily Jewish clientele for 50 years, always stocking greens and root vegetables for chicken soup. Now he also keeps fresh ginger root for new Chinese customers. Savvy shoppers are regularly and loudly berated for squeezing produce, but he takes pride in never stocking anything that is too expensive for his customers. "If they're not going to buy cherries, why should I buy cherries?" he asks rhetorically.
At the glatt kosher dairy cafeteria Shalom Chai, pizzas, calzone and egg rolls are featured along with knishes and hummus. The combination attracts Orthodox Jewish families from other neighborhoods on Sundays, and the older, often infirm locals who gather to schmooze on quiet weekdays and good-naturedly engage strangers in conversation.
Almost next door is Kossar's Bialystoker Kuchen Bakery, my biweekly destination for a freezer supply of homely, chewy onion bialys. The Kossar's ovens issue forth a steady supply of fresh bialys, as well as large, round pletzels strewn with poppy seeds, and the long rolls known as bulkas, all made from the same dough. Kossar's sells bagels but does not make them. "It has to be an entirely different dough," explained Danny Scheinin, who took over from his father-in-law.
Anyone who doubts the theory that one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel wound up in China should be convinced at the Grand Deli. The partners in this three-year-old venture, as well as the Chinese cook and several waiters, are graduates of the bygone Bernstein's on Essex Street, renowned for the same menu mix. In a tidy, quasi-Chinese decorated dining room, quasi-Chinese kosher dishes like wontons, barbecued spareribs (veal) and soft, oniony, old-style chicken chow mein and moo goo chop suey are featured, with matzoh balls, stuffed derma and almost-convincing pastrami and corned beef.
Anyone interested in the fine points of Kashruth in meats, can get a colorful lecture from the bearded and cherubic Moshe Abramowitz, the Jerusalem-born butcher who owns Goldberg's Meat Market. Ask him why hind quarters of four-footed animals are kosher in Israel but not here, and learn a lesson in Talmudic pragmatism.
Dilapidated though it is, the strip of Grand Street from Essex Street to the Bowery has its share of bargains: hosiery, sterling silver, lingerie, children's clothing, home-furnishing fabrics and slipcovers still abound, although the number of stores has dwindled.
Bill Levy, 72, the semi-retired owner of the linen shop Harris Levy, reminisced about the great soups, potato pirogen and apple blintzes at the long-gone Grand Dairy Restaurant. The store was founded in 1894 by his grandfather, Harris Levy, an immigrant, and is now run by the fourth generation: Bob Levy and his wife, Meryle. It prospers not only by charging low prices for brand-name bed and bath linens, but also by specializing in luxurious imported bedding and tablecloths, often customized and ordered nationwide through catalogues.
With Asian merchants inching into this part of the Lower East Side, there are also great buys in kitchen utensils and decorative china at the Tai Cheung Supply Company; in clothes and miscellaneous tableware at the daily outdoor Dragon Gate market, and in lusty Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese noodle soups at the Golden Statue, where Grand Street meets the Bowery.
 
Little Italy and Chinatown
By all odds the most colorful human drama is played out where Chinatown meets Little Italy. Streets are jammed from early morning to late evening as Chinese shoppers hunt for the best fish and vegetables. (Although a boon to the neighborhood's economy, the commercial expansion also prompts complaints about garbage and street congestion from longtime residents.)
Here you can buy Chinese or Italian sausages, pasta and pastries, and relax over espresso and biscotti at Ferrara's, or a beef-curry bun with green tea at the Fay Da Bakery or, at the 213 Grand Street Gourmet, wash down dim sum with Hong Kong tea, a strangely addictive brew sweetened with sugar and burnished with evaporated milk.
At the Kamwo Herb and Tea Company, Tom Leung will prepare a custom mix of, say, powdered dried cicada and ginseng, or other nostrums for ailments you never knew you had. There are also bargain prescriptions to be filled at conventional pharmacies, and hard-to-find fittings at Grand Brass Lamp Parts Inc.
The long immigrant history of this area is poignantly illustrated in a small photographic exhibition in the landmark Greenpoint Bank, designed by Stanford White and opened in 1894 as the Bowery Savings Bank. Photographs show dazed, exhausted arrivals clutching bundles and babies, and there are signs with greetings in Yiddish, Italian and Chinese. One can only imagine the awe with which these refugees from the slums of Naples and Canton and the shtetls of Poland and Russia entered this magnificent cathedral of a bank with its marble, brass and mosaics, to deposit small savings proudly.
Also architecturally distinctive is the Police Building, a huge Beaux-Arts masterpiece that was, amazingly, New York City Police Headquarters when it opened in 1909. Looking at the soaring marble-and-crystal lobby, I had trouble imagining an episode of "N.Y.P.D. Blue" played out there. It is now a co-op, with two-bedroom, two-bath apartments going for just under $500,000 and attracting many voluntary inmates.
More modestly, the atmospheric little 1885 bank that is now the real estate office of James Stabile 4th, with its embossed-tin ceiling and bronze teller's cages, is a set piece that would look at home in any small town in southern Italy.
The oldest establishments here are Italian. E. Rossi's opened in 1902 and, in a temptingly crammed setting, sells Italian cookware and dishes, magazines, cookbooks, T-shirts, religious statues, CD's and more than 2,000 titles of sheet music. Lou Rossi, 87, can tell you how to prepare pasta correctly so it can be cut with the Abruzzese chitarra he sells, the only one in New York, he assures you, that is strung with real piano wire.
Ferrara's, almost next door, has just celebrated its 100th birthday; while across the street, the classic cheese shop Alleva is said to be the oldest latticini in the country, opened in 1892. By comparison, Di Palo, a trendier and livelier cheese and sausage shop, is a newcomer at 72. And the 40-year-old Italian Food Center, a mecca for juicy hero sandwiches, is the new kid on the block.
Anyone longing for old southern Italian dishes competently prepared will find them at the glitzy Teresa and Mimmo, but beware of the tonier inventions and the highfalutin northern dishes. Eat Neapolitan appetizers and pastas, and you'll eat well, served by some of the friendliest waiters in town.
For trendier appetites, hungry for nouvelle international fare and not put off by second-hand smoke, there is the breathtakingly beautiful Onieals Grand Street. The kitchen can be great or mediocre, but it's worth a try for its glowing wood-paneled interior. The saloon opened in 1875; 20 years later, a tunnel leading directly from the saloon into the police building was dug. Don't ask why.
My own special reward for this research has been the discovery of Nyonya, a crowded, clean and bright cafe featuring the spectacular food of the Perankans, descendants of Hokkien Chinese whose food is often described as nyonya (grandmother) or babu (grandfather). Having first encountered this tantalizing food in Singapore, I remain intrigued by the blend of Indian, Indonesian and Chinese culinary magic. The inexpensive Nyonya is just one of several Malaysian restaurants owned, at least in part, by an enchanting Peranakan, June Khoo, and her Chinese husband, Suan Lee Cheah, both 30-something New York enthusiasts who arrived from Penang in 1991.
 
SoHo
Grand Street in SoHo looks like a drab backwater, with parking lots, broken sidewalks and many empty buildings. Yet it is the pride of the Cast Iron Historic District. Graceful columns and arched windows, often discernible only above the first floor, are impressive even when veiled in urban grime.
Although it lacks immigrant fervor, this segment of Grand Street is home to strivers of another kind, those with dreams and aspirations in the creative arts: painting, sculpture, fashion, designs in graphics and home accessories, and cookery. Art galleries display works of budding talents as do most of the men's and women's clothing boutiques.
On Sundays, at Broadway and Grand, there is a mad jumble of a flea market with real junk and real antiques and a crazily beguiling collection of refrigerator-door magnets in the form of ceramic fruits, vegetables and fish.
The laid-back SoHo spirit was best expressed at the shop of Alpana Bawa, one of several intriguing fashion boutiques. Eager to get a closer look at the festive shirts and dresses in brilliant Indian silks and cottons shown in the window, I returned several times to find the doors locked. When I finally got lucky, I asked the saleswoman if being open was a new policy. (Most stores in SoHo do not open before 10 A.M. and many not until 11.)
The liveliest scene in this area runs from the Avenue of the Americas, where the Moondance Diner dispenses larger-than-life coffee shop fare around the clock, to West Broadway, where French bistros attract a young, international, black-clad set, many of them guests at the ultramodern SoHo Grand Hotel, half a block south. At the two best spots, Lucky Strike and Felix's, foreign languages seem to outnumber English by about four to one.
There is a diverse ethnic menu even along this short span of Grand Street. At Cucina della Nonna, one can tuck into good pasta in a tiled setting reminiscent of Sostanza in Florence; at Abyssinia, have Ethiopian curry stews served at basket tables. My favorite is the Indian restaurant, A. J.'s Niota. There, Arjun Gualaba, a native of Agra, offers a warm "niota" or welcome, to his duplex restaurant where both setting and food are delectably uncliched.
The city's prime training ground for budding Escoffiers is the French Culinary Institute, at Broadway. Technically in Little Italy, but more SoHo in tone, the school runs a felicitous public restaurant, L'Ecole, where students prepare the food, supervised by professionals. The faculty includes top toques like Jacques Pepin, Alain Sailhac, Andre Soltner and the master pastry chefs Jacques Torres and Diter Schorner.
"Have a grand day," is the message on the telephone answering machine of the Grand Deli. On my forays along this street, I have had many.
 
Tasting the World on Grand Street Without Turning a Corner
 
Here is information about places along Grand Street. Telephone numbers are provided for stores and restaurants; some are closed on Friday evenings and Saturdays.
 
Art and Architecture
 
ART GALLERIES AND CAST-IRON BUILDINGS line Grand Street from Avenue of the Americas to Broadway.
GREENPOINT BANK, 130 Bowery, at Grand Street, is a 1894 Stanford White landmark. Its palatial interior has a modest but touching exhibition on the history of the building and its immigrant neighborhood.
POLICE BUILDING, 240 Centre Street, at Grand Street. Step into the grandiose Beaux-Arts lobby of what is now a co-op and remember that from 1909 to 1973, it was New York City's police headquarters.
ST. MARY'S CHURCH, 440 Grand Street, between Ridge and Clinton Streets. The original rear section, built in 1833 of gray ashlar stone, accounts for its designation as the oldest Roman Catholic structure in Manhattan.
STABILE BROTHERS, 189 Grand Street, at Mulberry Street. Opened as a bank in 1885, the real estate office of Jerome Stabile 4th is a period set-piece suggesting an old bank in a small Italian town.
 
Design
 
ARTMARKET, 75 Grand Street, between Wooster and Greene Streets; (212) 226-4370. Individual vendors display smartly designed books, video tapes and CD's on photography, art, film and architecture as well as art postcards, T-shirts, toys and games.

SOHO ANTIQUES FAIR, Grand Street and Broadway; (212) 682-2000. Furniture, cassettes, cameras, tableware, bric-a-brac, jewelry, clothing (I spotted new mens' trench coats with zip-out linings for $18) and an amusing collections of food magnets. Every Sunday.
PHILIP WILLIAMS, 60 Grand Street, between West Broadway and Wooster Street; (212) 226-7830. Expect a wild collection of posters on food, theater and other subjects, along with such naive art as paintings on scrap metal from the rural South.
HARRY ZARIN, 318 Grand Street, between Allen and Orchard Streets; (212) 925-6112. A fabric warehouse stacked with wonderful home furnishings fabrics, many from well-known mills. They are bargains by the yard or custom-made into slipcovers, curtains and bedspreads.
 
Clothing
 
ALPANA BAWA, 41 Grand Street, between Thompson Street and West Broadway; (212) 965-0559. Delicate, festive shirts ($140 to $250), pants and dresses in colorful Indian silks and cottons.
IF BOUTIQUE, 94 Grand Street, between Greene and Mercer Streets; (212) 334-4964. Casually smart tailored clothes with original touches. Some of the best are from the Danish designer Ivan Grundahl. Coats from $550 to $850. Many are marked down 20 to 50 percent from now through December.
LISMORE HOISERY, 334 Grand Street, at Ludlow Street; (212) 674-3440. Don't be put off by musty boxes stacked floor to ceiling. Many major brands for women and men are stocked in fresh, sealed packages at just about the lowest prices in town for first quality. Know what you want, because browsing is impossible.
RODNEY TELFORD, 89 Grand Street, at Greene Street; (212) 334-4676. Jackets (about $1,200) with long skirts (about $500) suggesting Edwardian riding suits and some romantic winter coats. Several styles can be made to measure. Many pieces are on sale for the holiday season. (Restaurant buffs may remember this as the original Chanterelle; the embossed tin ceiling is intact.)

YOHJI YAMAMOTO, 103 Grand Street, at Mercer Street; (212) 966-9066. Neo-classic tailoring in the spacious showroom of the well-known designer. Women's jackets from $800 to $1,000.
 
Food and Cookware
 
ALLEVA DAIRY, 188 Grand Street, at Mulberry Street; (212) 226-7990. Billing itself as the oldest Italian cheese store in America, this 105-year-old latticini with its old tile work is known for superb homemade cheeses, especially mozzarella, available creamily fresh or dried as scamorza. Formaggio fresca, a custardy white cheese formed in baskets, is delicious with ripe fruit. Excellent aged Parmesan is a bargain at $8.95 a pound.
CHINESE SAUSAGE COMPANY, 198 Grand Street, between Mulberry and Mott Streets; (212) 966-8858. Very fresh meats, poultry and savory duck or pork sausages at low prices. Note the artful displays of flattened, dried ducks.
CHUNG CHOU CITY MARKET, 218-220 Grand Street, at Elizabeth Street; (212) 274-9338. What seems to be dried everything (spices, herbs, nuts, grains, shellfish, fish innards) is enticing and makes one want to know all about each specimen. Fortunately, there is usually at least one staff member who can respond.
DI PALO'S OF LITTLE ITALY, 206 Grand Street, at Mott Street; (212) 226-1033. A great variety of excellent cheeses, like sheeps' milk ricotta and stracchino, are among the pungent temptations dispensed by the third and fourth generations of friendly DiPalos. They provide sample tastings and cooking tips, as they have since 1926. Also here are gigantic mortadella (the original bologna from Bologna) and flavorful Giuseppe Cocco pasta from Abruzzo in nicely chewy twists called zitelle.
DONG OU FOOD MARKET, 248 Grand Street, between Bowery and Chrystie Streets; SEAFOOD MARKET, 250 Grand Street, at Chrystie Street; HUNG PHAT SEAFOOD AND MEAT MARKET, 225 Grand Street, between Elizabeth Street and the Bowery, (212) 941-6363. I have found the best selections at these three shops, with an aquarium array of fish and shellfish, some alive and bubbling under water. Prices are low, but it's important to be able to judge freshness.
GOLDBERG MEAT MARKET, 500 Grand Street, between Bialystoker Place and Columbia Street; (212) 475-6915. Glatt kosher meat and chicken are high quality and high priced, with great calf's liver at $8.95 a pound. Now if only someone would sweep the floor when leaves blow in through the hospitable open door.
ITALIAN FOOD CENTER, 186 Grand Street, at Mulberry Street; (212) 925-2954. This 40-year-old delicatessen excels at hero sandwiches, whether hot (sausage and peppers, fried eggplant with mozzarella) or cold (with prosciutto, provolone, salami, peppers and mushrooms). Prepared pastas, croquettes and bruschetta.
KAMWO HERB AND TEA COMPANY, 209 Grand Street, between Mott and Elizabeth Streets; (212) 966-6370. Herbs, teas and dried bugs and gegkoes are among the pharmaceuticals dispensed by Tom Leung.
KOSSAR'S BIALYSTOKER KUCHEN BAKERY, 367 Grand Street, between Essex and Norfolk Streets; (212) 473-4810. Anyone needing a bialy fix can get it 24 hours a day, at the world's best source, for a mere 45 cents.
PHOENIX POULTRY MARKET, 159A Grand Street, between Lafayette and Centre Streets; (212) 226-5455. Rabbits and live poultry including many kinds of chicken, duck, turkey, guinea hen and the gray-skinned "silkie" chicken that the Chinese simmer into soups to build the inner strength, "chi." All are moderately priced.
E. ROSSI & COMPANY, 191 Grand Street, at Mulberry Street; (212) 226-9254. Specialized Italian cooking and serving pieces, cookbooks and food magazines, religious statues, T-shirts, a huge assortment of sheet music and Italian folk and classical music on CD's, records and tapes. Then there's the great conversation with Lou Rossi, 87, whose father opened the shop in 1902.
RUBY'S FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, 400 Grand Street, between Suffolk and Clinton Streets; (212) 982-0160. Discriminating customers know that the self-styled curmudgeon Ruby Baumgarten buys the best-quality fruits and vegetables, but only at modest prices. A dozen Grade A extra-large eggs, some with double yolks, cost $1.09.
TAI CHEUNG KITCHEN SUPPLY, 303 Grand Street, between Eldridge and Allen Streets; (212) 219-8898. Shelves are neatly stacked with reasonably priced, practical Chinese cookware and attractive tableware.
 
Restaurants
 
ABYSSINIA, 35 Grand Street, at Thompson Street; (212) 226-5959. Curry-style stews of meats and vegetables are served authentically: guests sit on three-legged stools and use the crepelike bread injera in place of forks. Try azefa wot (lentil and chili salad), doro wot (chicken in the fiery berber sauce) and ye'beg alitcha (lamb with ginger and garlic). Dinner for two is about $52 with tip.
A. J.'S NIOTA, 337 West Broadway, at Grand Street; (212) 431-6222. Unusual Indian food is prettily presented and exquisitely seasoned, tandoori chicken being the disappointing exception. Try mussels masala, potato patties in mint sauce, chicken masala and balt gosht, a small copper pot of curried lamb, green pepper and onion. A lavish dinner for two with beer and tip runs about $73.
213 GRAND STREET GOURMET, 213 Grand Street, between Mott and Elizabeth Streets; (212) 226-4231. I like mid-morning breakfast at minuscule prices in these bright surroundings. Dim sum and crisp-skinned roast suckling pig on napa cabbage with rice ($5.95) are zestily satisfying. The congee or jook ($3 to $4), a rice porridge with chicken or pork and scallions, beats oatmeal any day.
CUCINA DELLA NONNA, 104 Grand Street, at Mercer Street; (212) 925-5488. The open kitchen does better by homey grandmother (nonna) dishes than creative alternatives. Linguine with garlic, oil and hot peppers; the fish soup-stew zuppa de pesce; chicken campagna with fusilli, rack of lamb and apple tart are delicious. Service is slow, and the room can be stuffy. Dinner for two with glasses of wine is about $70 including tip.
L'ECOLE, the French Culinary Institute, 462 Broadway, at Grand Street; (212) 219-3300. Professional waiters serve good modern French food prepared by student chefs under close professional guidance. Winners include crab cakes, leeks vinaigrette, sausage with potato salad, roast chicken and the herbed rack of lamb, along with pleasant desserts. The menu is very limited after 8 P.M. Prix fixe is $24.95.
FAY DA BAKERY, 214-216 Grand Street, between Mott and Elizabeth Streets; (212) 966-8934. The charm of Chinese sweets escapes me, so I skip the dessert pastries. Instead, I snack on golden baked buns filled with slightly sweet roasted pork or gentle curried beef and soft onions, an eat-in or take-out treat at 60 cents.
FELIX, 340 West Broadway, at Grand Street; (212) 431-0021. Despite the frenetic scene, especially when doors open to the sidewalk cafe, I enjoy brunch and lunch midst the downtown Babel of languages. Pleasing choices are onion soup, steamed mussels, ratatouille omelet, merguez lamb sausages, hamburgers and salads. Belying its reputation, the staff has been polite and accommodating. A three-course meal with wine averages $75 for two.
FERRARA'S, 195 Grand Street, between Mulberry and Mott Streets; (212) 226-6150. At this site for 100 years, the highly commercialized Ferrara's still provides respite by way of gelati, granita, espresso, cappuccino and crunchy anise biscotti. Other pastries tend to be heavy-handed.
GOLDEN STATUE, 237 Grand Street, at the Bowery; (212) 334-6868. Elemental Southeast Asian and Chinese noodle soups with various meats, innards and vegetables are the attractions in this hectic luncheonette. Bypass the rubbery beef balls but try the heady broth with pickled cabbage, shredded pork, bean curd and straw mushrooms, ample for two at $5.95.
GRAND DELI, 399 Grand Street, between Suffolk and Clinton Streets; (212) 477-5200. Chinese food and deli are strange menu bedfellows at this glatt kosher restaurant (closed from Friday afternoon to Sunday). Only observers of dietary laws need delve into the Chinese fare, although the egg drop soup is soothing. There are sustaining sandwiches of acceptable house-made pastrami and corned beef. Pickles are excellent, and the waiters, characteristically chatty. A large dinner for two with tip is about $60.
LUCKY STRIKE, 59 Grand Street, between West Broadway and Wooster Street; (212) 941-0772. As the name promises (or threatens), smoking is permitted throughout this narrow, young-spirited bistro. It is most pleasant for uncrowded weekday lunches. Good choices are the the warm lentil salad, the penne in a spicy tomato sauce, a chewy sandwich of grilled lamb and leeks, and moist chocolate cake. Lunch for two with wine and tip is about $43.
MOONDANCE DINER, 80 Avenue of the Americas, at Grand Street; (212) 226-1191. Super diner food, moderately priced, attracts a trendy crowd. It is most reliable for breakfast (served 24 hours a day) plus good sandwiches, vegetable chili, meat loaf and sauteed spinach. Service can be slow and slapdash.
NYONYA, 194 Grand Street, between Mulberry and Mott Streets; (212) 334-3669. The spicy and colorful cuisine of the Malayasian Peranakans is served in this huge, cheerful cafe that is jammed at peak hours. Best choices: the vegetable salad called Indian rojak, Hainanese chicken rice, coconut shrimp, chili crabs, curried beef redang and toasty peanut pancakes. An elaborate dinner for two with beer is about $45 to $50, but could easily be less; lunch is about $15 a person.
ONIEALS GRAND STREET, , 174 Grand Street, at Centre Market Place; (212) 941-9119. Because it is just shy of 35 seats, Onieals permits smoking, but when it is not too crowded, that is bearable. The kitchen can dish up subtly sophisticated mussel soup with saffron and a hint of orange, warm duck salad on mache, grilled sea bass with sprightly corn salsa, or puffy crabcakes. Other times, those dishes plus others can be lackluster. Dinner for two with wine and tip is about $90.
SHALOM CHAI, 359 Grand Street, between Essex and Norfolk Streets; (212) 598-4178. In this unadorned glatt kosher dairy cafeteria, Kashruth-observing gourmets fare better with the mozzarella and tomato pizza ($1.60 a slice) and calzone than with the Israeli salads, Ashkenazic knishes and Chinese egg rolls. (Closed from Friday afternoon to Sunday.)
TERESA AND MIMMO RISTORANTE, 181 Grand Street, between Baxter and Mulberry Streets; (212) 966-6862. Neapolitan standbys are the best choices in this garish, dated setting: stuffed artichokes, broccoli rape with olive oil and garlic, the fried cheese sandwich called mozzarella en carrozza, clams Posilippo and pastas like linguine with white clam sauce and penne arrabbiata. Dinner for two with wine and tip is about $80. MIMI SHERATON

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Rewards In Galleries Uptown

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
"Get Down Uptown" is the clever advertising slogan with which Barneys New York segued out of its West 17th Street store, as if it were necessary to remind its hipper clients that there is life above 23d Street. But sometimes reminders can help, especially with the relentless focus on the states of mind, style and real estate -- not to mention retail -- loosely known as downtown.
What you find in the uptown gallery world may not qualify as exactly "down," in its current application as the height of cool. But this world, which is at its densest along 57th Street between Park and Seventh Avenues and on, or near, upper Madison Avenue in the East 70's, is plenty substantial and should be a regular stop for all art lovers. 
On view uptown is a lot more history, often in galleries with sizable histories of their own, than you usually find farther south. Twentieth-century modernism prevails uptown, presented in segments that often complement museum shows. But if the area sometimes feels like the Land of the Dead White Male, it is not devoid of galleries dedicated to the young and living, or of nonprofit spaces that are "alternative" in one sense or another.
At the moment, the uptown galleries are at their autumn peak, spurred by auctions, museum exhibitions and perhaps the rising need for extra-special holiday gifts. Some of the stronger exhibitions include the dense survey of Man Ray's work at the Emmerich Gallery, the juxtaposition of Mondrian and Ad Reinhardt at Pace Wildenstein and a meaty account of Franz Kline's development, told mostly in small paintings and works on paper, at the Allan Stone Gallery.
At the Ubu Gallery, a survey of Sol LeWitt's work includes a large wall relief from 1962, never previously exhibited, in which the word "objectivity," repeated four times in booming bright letters, recedes progressively into a shallow ocher grid, or marches forward, full of Minimalist attitude.
Also to be seen are Yves Kline's "Anthropometries" at Danese, an informative survey of the French painter Nicolas de Stael at Mitchell-Inness & Nash, Cy Twombly's latest sculptures at the Gagosian Gallery and, at Joan T. Washburn, a revealing comparison of finished and unfinished canvases of Myron Stout.
But that's not nearly all. The top layer of exhibitions along 57th Street and upward is unusually deep right now. Further recommendations follow.
For starters, there are two group shows that define some of the uptown gallery extremes. At the Sidney Janis Gallery is "20TH-CENTURY MASTERS," -- a tony show, even for a concern in its third generation, that runs the gamut from big names to quirky talents. At one end is a 1920 collaboration of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, "Dust Breeding," a famously ambiguous photograph of common house dust impersonating an earthwork; at the other, Oyvind Fahlstrom's mordant "Column No. 3 (Chile F)," which diagrams the dark side of the late 60's and early 70's.
In between, there are a corner full of Jean Arp's vivacious sculptures, a wall of Abstract Expressionist drawings, three of Joseph Albers's reverberating squares and much more.
 
Younger and Smaller
Slightly to the east lies proof that small young galleries also call uptown home. Baron/Boisante Editions would fit into one of the back rooms at the Janis Gallery. It feels like a fastidious cockpit, perfect for the house speciality: "WORKS ON PAPER," -- as its current show is called.
It clocks the persistence of the human figure in art, making some telling connections (Norris Embry next to Joseph Beuys), introducing some unfamiliar personalities (the Dutch artist Anton Heyboer) and lassoing several knockouts (a spinning, two-headed blur by Arnulf Rainer and a Jean-Michel Basquiat in which several faces are described in gnarled labyrinths of line).
At Brewster Arts Ltd., the incomparable LEONORA CARRINGTON -- is having her seventh New York show since her debut, in 1948, at the Pierre Matisse Gallery. Ms. Carrington, now 80, began life as an English debutante with artistic ambitions, ran off with Max Ernst at the age of 20 and never looked back. Living in Mexico since the onset of World War II, she also never stopped painting.
Her tiny paintings reflect a fantastic Surrealism that draws on Goya, Bosch, Sienese paintings and Egyptian art, with just a pinch of Edward Gorey. Scenes of mysterious rituals conducted by elaborately costumed spirits and imaginary animals are rendered in soft, glowing colors that swirl and drift, like so much mist. The small scale and thin, turbulent surfaces have affinities with the work of the young painter Elizabeth Peyton.
In "Feral Horse," a pensive monkey sits atop a horse of fiery orange, backed by soft brown mountains and a plum sky, colors that Mark Rothko could have used. Ms. Carrington's imagination is fertile, but it is her palette and the whispering passion of her brush that make her best work so convincing.
Also worth a visit at this address is "JOSE BEDIA: THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORKS," -- at George Adams, a series of small wood toylike wall pieces that are uncharacteristically delicate for this Cuban artist and are steeped in the Afro-Cuban religious practices of Santeria and Palo Monte.
Back on the south side of West 57th, the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery is showing "BURGOYNE DILLER: THE THIRD DIMENSION, SCULPTURE AND DRAWINGS, 1930-1965." -- This bittersweet exhibition suggests that the best American painter to fall under Mondrian's spell may actually have been a sculptor manque.
In the early 40's, Diller translated Mondrian's perpendicular lines and primary colors into real space with painted wood sculptures that are remarkable for their tensile economy. In the early 60's, when Diller had the time and money to make sculpture again, his work was simpler, bolder, more original and more than a little prescient of Minimalism. The seven sculptures and reliefs in this show are seen against bright blue walls on which dozens of purposeful drawings brim with new ideas, most never realized.
 
It's a Gallery Mall
The Rosenfeld Gallery is at 24 West 57th Street, one of the area's several "gallery malls." (Uptown had them before downtown, and in more civilized form.) Right now this building is especially packed with interesting sights.
A floor above Rosenfeld, Galerie St. Etienne has pulled out all the stops with "EGON SCHIELE, 1890-1918: MASTER DRAFTSMAN," -- a concentrated examination of the artist's preferred medium, timed for the Museum of Modern Art's retrospective. Smaller, more succinct and less feverish than the retrospective, it reflects the gallery's 50-year involvement with Schiele's work and brings the viewer in unusually close contact with his charged virtuosity.
The 75 drawings span his brief career, tracing his intensifying engagement with both his medium and his models, whose faces can have the psychological immediacy of photographs, while their bodies seem carved out of the page. The tautness or speed of line, its relation to negative space and to color (which sometimes stands alone), the shaping of these formal elements to the human subject, the degree of finish: everything shifts from work to work, but usually bears the signs of an unremitting scrutiny that makes this show enormously compelling.
At the other end of the hall from St. Etienne is the Fischbach Gallery, which has evolved over the years into a mecca of Realist painting. There, THOMAS CORDELL AND SUSAN SHATTER -- turn in solid performances: he with muscular, abbreviated scenes from San Francisco to Jodhpur, India; she with monotypes that stay put and move in close, recording with appropriate fluidity the shifting light and tides on a patch of rocky coast in Maine.
Four floors below, at the Marian Goodman Gallery, where a group show called "20/20" -- is in progress, water figures prominently in "Disappearance at Sea," an impressive 14-minute film by the young English artist Tacita Dean. Its subject is the sun setting over the ocean, distorted by the revolving structure of thick lenses that magnify the lamps of a lighthouse. The camera shifts between close-ups of this magnificent, distorting apparatus and the darkening view it surveys, accompanied by the rising cries of gulls. Finally there is only a pale shaft of light, moving through the dark, picking out occasional whitecaps.
Simple, yet powerfully elegaic, Ms. Dean's film pits nature's overwhelming indifference against human determination, personified by the light's implacable mechanism. It counts as one of the best new works of art on view in Manhattan.
 
Feathers and Blood
Retrospective light is shed at Galerie Lelong, in "ANA MENDIETA: BODY IMPRINTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS, 1972-74," -- a show of the early photographic work and documented performance pieces of the Cuban artist Ana Mendieta (1948-1985). While still in school at the University of Iowa, Mendieta pushed energetically at the boundaries of performance, body and feminist art. In usually sequential images, most of which star herself, she manipulated the body as both a sculptural object and metaphor. Pasting white feathers all over a friend, she created a Mayan bird-god. Pressing panes of glass against her face or naked body, to ghoulish effect, she personalized Process Art. Wearing wigs and making faces, she anticipated Cindy Sherman.
More sensationally, Mendieta used blood, dripping it on her face so she appeared wounded, and writing with it on walls. She assumed the position (tied up) of a struggling female victim. These are not her best efforts, but their bluntness is endearing, and they are disturbing to see, considering her early, violent death in a fall from a window.
Nearby are complementary shows devoted to MILTON AVERY. -- Around the corner at the D. C. Moore Gallery on Fifth Avenue, "Milton Avery: Paintings and Works on Paper" feels somewhat routine and lacks a truly great late landscape, but with 27 works, there is still plenty to look at. "Milton Avery: An Intimate Scale," at Long Fine Art (back on West 57th and next door to Marian Goodman), is more modest but also livelier, a display of small works in various media, mostly figures and landscapes, that skips around from 1918 to 1960, confirming that Avery sustained his inimitable touch from start to finish.
 
Into the Fuller Building
In the venerable Fuller Building, at 41 East 57th, a longtime, unusually commodious gallery mall (all those elevators), one of the best shows is "FORMS AND RHYTHMS" -- at the Barbara Mathes Gallery. An exercise in compare and contrast, it features three prewar modernists whose abstracting impulses matched Avery's: Alexander Calder, Stuart Davis and Fernand Leger. They, too, never abandoned reality, but subjected it to rigorous abbreviations, exaggerations and deletions. In other words, they put style, form and color first.
Calder kept in touch with the world by dropping hints like the tulip-shaped bit of metal in "The White Tulip," one of several terrific mobiles. Leger's solution, repeated a little too often here, was to unleash big ribbons of color behind his floating figures. Davis assiduously reworked his own earlier images, making them bigger, brighter and less specific, while maintaining the sense of streetwise vernacular. In all, a very pungent conversation.
Among the other impressive exhibitions at this address, "FROM INGRES TO PICASSO," -- at the Jan Krugier Gallery, is largely as good as it sounds, while "RICHARD POUSETTE-DART: PHOTOGRAPHS," -- at Zabriskie, reveals a little-known side of this second-generation Abstract Expressionist on the occasion of his retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: lustrous black-and-white close-ups of natural forms that echo the sunburst motifs of Pousette-Dart's paintings.
When you leave East 57th Street for points north, a good first stop is Berry-Hill, where "AMERICAN STUDIES: OIL SKETCHES BY CHASE AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES" -- awaits in a small back gallery like a box of bonbons. The best flavors, besides William Merritt Chase, include Robert Henri, Ernest Lawson, George Bellows, Childe Hassam and Edward Potthast.
Such lush, miniaturized opulence is scaled up in "SARGENT ABROAD" -- at the Adelson Gallery. Here one sees John Singer Sargent's fabled facility, mostly expended upon landscapes, slipping in and out of control, veering between the academic and the Impressionist. A view of the Libreria in Venice is painted in such fat, melting strokes that we seem to be looking at its reflection in the Grand Canal. In "Alpine Pond" the surrounding peaks are rendered in strokes so fluttery that an avalanche seems imminent.
In a downstairs gallery, there's an array of Sargent's watercolors, where his technique, while equally dazzling, is more consistent. Don't miss the tiny room of watercolors by Emily Sargent, the artist's older sister and traveling companion. Quieter, decidedly clumsier, many still have a rightness all their own.
Upper Madison Avenue's version of the modernist extravaganza at Janis is the "AMERICAN WORKS: 1945-1975," -- at C & M Arts, a gallery on two floors of a lavish town house that can be a little intimidating, despite its regular public hours. The brackets here are Jackson Pollock and Brice Marden, between which are works by Jasper Johns, Phillip Guston, Rothko and several other important artists, including, inexplicably, several sculptures by the French artist Aristide Maillol.
 
Better Than It Sounds
Across Madison, dip into Reinhold Brown for "THE INFLUENCE OF RUSSIAN CONSTRUCTIVISM ON INTERNATIONAL GRAPHIC DESIGN." -- Nowhere nearly as dry as its title, the show roams through several decades of posters, proving that while Stalin may have squelched the Russian modernists, their innovations in composition, photomontage and typeface were irrepressible.
One block north, Salander-O'Reilly Galleries on 79th Street has two exceptional shows. "ELIE NADELMAN: THE CLASSICAL TRADITION" -- contains a number of rare early works by this eccentric, imperious sculptor, who was born in Poland, seasoned in Paris, where he may have helped plant the seed of Cubism, and more or less forgotten in New York, where he lived from 1914 until his death in 1946. He is much better known these days, especially for the elegantly pneumatic folk-artish wood sculptures he made after coming here, but there's still a way to go.
Containing 25 works made between 1906 and 1926, this exhibition fills some gaps and makes palpable Nadelman's versatility and his strange balance of radical and conservative impulses as well as a restless mixing of sculptural styles and types that is almost post-modern. From the years before 1910 come cubistic figures, in carved wood relief; suave Neo-Classical heads, their smoothed-out features dreamy and withdrawn, and a female nude, in bronze, whose elongated curving limbs suggest El Greco's distortions, but done with a compass.
Especially intriguing is the expressive figure of a seated woman, hands neatly poised in her lap (where they imply her missing arms). The piece demonstrates a little-known fact: that Nadelman translated the inflated volumes of the wood sculptures into marble. (It is also interesting to think of the alternately sharp and rounded vivacity of his work in relation to the Arps at the Janis Gallery.
 
Small and Sumptuous
On Salander-O'Reilly's ground floor is a sumptuous show of small landscape paintings by PIERRE BONNARD, -- which vibrate with color, light and idiosyncratic wet-on-wet paint handling, each in a key that seems all its own. In one seascape, the water is black and deep green, and the waves are defined by thick little scallops of salmon pink. The canvases bring to mind several American artists -- Avery, Marsden Hartley and, in front of "Soleil Couchant," from about 1920, George Inness.
Finally, there are two of the area's alternative exhibition spaces.
Ensconced in an ornate town house on Fifth Avenue opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the Goethe-Institut New York, whose many functions include exhibiting the work of German artists. At the moment, REINER LEIST, -- who lives in midtown Manhattan, is showing "Window," an exhibition of nearly 20 large photographs made with a 19th-century full-plate camera.
Shot from what seems to be a high floor in a building in the West 30's, each image shows the same man-made canyon at different times of day and night, in various weather. These images have too much company to stand on their own, starting with O'Keeffe and Stieglitz and Berenice Abbott, but they attest to the continued allure of New York as artistic subject, and in handsome terms.
 
Off the Gallery Path
Somewhat off the beaten uptown gallery path, in an old carriage house, is the Sculpture Center, whose current exhibition, "SUSPENDED INSTANTS," -- is half of a show of American and Brazilian artists that has been organized with Art in General, an alternative space in lower Manhattan. The theme is timely: the tendency of contemporary artists to use small common objects, in unexpected ways, or obsessive quantities, often turning the modest grandiose.
Heidi Fasnacht makes wall pieces suggesting city maps, or atomic models, out of metal springs and knobs of black clay, while Jose Damasceno creates an even vaster network out of only rubber bands and nails. Enrica Bernardelli tangles the gold-colored metal chains used in Brazil for holy medals into startlingly heavy masses that the viewer may rearrange, strength permitting.
Brigitte Nahon achieves a magical suspension with thread and clear plastic balls. And Ana Linnemann takes small rocks, drills them with holes and sews them together with thin copper wire, making what she calls "Rock Lace."
The second part of the show is as good a reason as any to go downtown.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Violins In the Wings

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS; A. M. Rosenthal is on vacation.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"You have to distinguish between means and ends," Albert Carnesale said. "What's important here is the end, diversity. Affirmative action is just one means to that end."
Mr. Carnesale is the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, a great public university in a diverse city. He moved here in July from Harvard, where he was dean of the Kennedy School and then provost. He arrived at a turning point for affirmative action in California. 
 A new policy of the Regents of the University of California, effective this year at the graduate school level, forbids giving preference in admissions on the basis of race or ethnicity. Proposition 209, which has just gone into effect, makes that a rule for all state institutions.
As a result of the Regents' policy, the number of Hispanic and black students at the U.C.L.A. Law School has dropped sharply. Last year 104 blacks were admitted, this year 21. Of the 21, only 8 enrolled. (At Boalt Hall, the University of California Law School at Berkeley, none of the black students admitted this year actually came.)
To Al Carnesale, figures like those -- and what they indicate may happen in undergraduate admissions -- represent a profound challenge. He outlined three reasons he believes diversity is essential to U.C.L.A. fulfilling its responsibilities.
"First," he said, "we have to provide the best possible education for our students. And I have no doubt that education is markedly advanced by diversity -- because students learn from each other. Teaching foreign policy at Harvard, I saw it at work. The differences in perspectives were so informative.
"Second, it is our responsibility to prepare leaders for all segments of our society. We are a public university. And the way to do that is to provide high-quality education for potential leaders in all groups.
"Third, one of the things that sets the United States apart is access to social and economic mobility. And the key to that is education. Go around the table at a meeting of business leaders, and half the stories you hear will have violins playing in the background."
If Mr. Carnesale feels strongly about that, it is because his own story has plenty of violins in the background. He was brought up in a Bronx tenement near Yankee Stadium, the son of a taxi driver, and then lived the American dream: Bronx High School of Science, nuclear engineer, adviser to Presidents on arms control.
"What can we do to maintain diversity now?" he asked. "We can encourage minority students whose records make them eligible to apply, and then encourage those admitted to enroll. We have to make sure people know they're welcome. In fact, the message is that they're wanted.
"In the medium term, we have to get more minorities eligible. It means we have to be much more engaged in the high schools.
"In the long run, there has to be something like equal opportunity for all kids to get a good education in this country. Better-off people will always have an advantage, but equal opportunity should be a goal, an aspiration."
The passage of Proposition 209 may make people think that California now requires the university to admit students solely on the basis of academic scores. That is not so. In fact, the rules require that at least 25 percent of each class admitted reflect qualities apart from school records and test results.
"We use affirmative action all the time," Mr. Carnesale said. "It is not by looking at academic merits alone that we have a football team with a 9-2 record, going to a bowl.
"In going over applications for admission you notice that applicants come from different countries, or this one plays the cello, or that one is a published poet or has overcome great personal obstacles in her life. We may notice all those things -- but not race or ethnicity or gender."
The fact is that, in California and everywhere, values apart from test scores do figure in university admissions policies -- and should. A society that has prospered in diversity cannot want monochrome higher education.

HEADLINE: James Bender, 92, Eclectic Educator, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
James F. Bender, an eclectic educator who started out training speech therapists in the 1930's and ended up teaching business in the 1970's, but only after he had done star turns as a public pronunciation specialist and pioneering pop psychologist, become a high-paid business consultant and made a fortune on Wall Street, died on Sunday at his home in Southbury, Conn. He was 92 and the founding dean of the Adelphi University School of Business.
To say that Dr. Bender had a passion for education would hardly do justice to a man who spent a week pedaling a bicycle from his home in Dayton, Ohio, to Clinton, N.Y., so he could attend Hamilton College. 
 For Dr. Bender, whose father was a teacher, the bicycle trip was an economy measure, as was his decision to leave Hamilton a year later. Unable to find enough work in Clinton, he moved to New York City, where he worked his way through the Columbia University School of General Studies working at everything from waiter to doorman.
To suggest that Dr. Bender had an original turn of mind and a sense of possibilities would be something of an understatement. He was, for example, a man whose experience administering routine psychological tests to City College employees led him to specialize in speech therapy, write his Columbia doctoral thesis on the personality structure of stuttering and found a City College speech clinic before becoming a professor of psychology at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and moving on to the new Queens College, where he became the founding director of the college's Speech-Language-Hearing Center in 1942.
Dr. Bender's tenure at Queens College was short. After he was censured in 1943 for exaggerating his academic credentials (claiming a Columbia master's degree he had earned but not received) he resigned, much to the consternation of college officials.
Their anguish was understandable. Dr. Bender had become a star attraction, repeatedly making headlines whether by compiling the widely publicized NBC Handbook of Pronunciation, making Queens College the first educational institution in New York City to acquire a "continuous recording and transcribing machine," or by emerging as a latter day Henry Higgins, using the recorder to demonstrate the stunningly improved speech and enunciation of a group of street urchins he tutored in the social graces.
It did not hurt that Dr. Bender dubbed the group 'the Dead End Boys."
The choice reflected a shrewd sense of public appeal that blossomed during the next phase of Dr. Bender's career. As the founder of something he called the National Institute for Human Relations, he was soon a ubiquitous national expert on everything from correct pronunciation, vocabulary and American speech patterns to salesmanship and marriage.
Although he had turned out his share of learned texts and scholarly articles in the 1930's, it was as a language maven and psychologist to the masses that Dr. Bender hit his stride, churning out some 250 newspaper and magazine articles in three years.
It was an index of his feel for the public pulse that his 1944 article in The New York Times Magazine, "Ninety Million Speak General American," set a reprint record for the magazine when it was picked up by a dozen other publications.
Although some of his works were discursive, the typical Bender article was an eye-catching list (of circus terms, for example) or a series of short questions and answers on a common theme (like how women had changed in 50 years).
Dr. Bender, whose books of that era included "How to Talk Well" and "Do's and Don'ts of the Sales Interview," concentrated increasingly on the psychology of the work place, a specialty that created such a demand for his expertise in the world of big business that he folded his institute and reinvented himself anew, this time as a business consultant.
A man with an instinct for where opportunity would be knocking next, Dr. Bender made millions from a series of shrewd investments in everything from gold to depressed Oregon real estate.
For all his business success, however, Dr. Bender was so devoted to education that he returned to academia in 1960, teaching business administration at Adelphi and serving as dean when its business department was elevated to school status in 1964, partly as a result of his own donations and money he raised from others.
He left Adelphi in 1966 and spent seven years at Pace University and at C.W. Post College, where he taught money management so well that a student-managed portfolio of stocks, bonds and real estate donated by Dr. Bender and others tripled in value in three years and helped finance Post's Money Management Institute.
Returning to Adelphi in 1973, he served first as acting business dean, then as dean of the Center for Banking and Money Management and finally as dean of special programs, a euphemism for persuading Adelphi alumni and others to be as generous as he was.
By the time he retired in 1985, Dr. Bender had made a new name for himself as a fund-raiser and philanthropist, among other things raising money for endowed chairs at both Adelphi and Post and endowing two chairs, in music and psychology, at the Columbia School of General Studies.
The school, the university's arm for continuing, or adult, education, had never had an endowed professorship before, but then, as the school recognized when it gave him its highest alumni award, it had never encountered anyone quite like Dr. Bender before.
Dr. Bender, whose first wife died and whose second marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, Vera Evangeline, his one-time next door neighbor in Roslyn, N.Y.; her son, Ted Sattler of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a sister, Mary Jane Perez of San Antonio, Tex., and two step grandchildren.

When Mayor Richard M. Daley met with the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan recently, he told Mr. Farrakhan to establish better relations with Jewish leaders and hinted that if he did not, he could expect rough sledding at City Hall.
Many Jewish leaders, though, were more bothered by the meeting than pleased by the warning. 
 The Mayor implied to Mr. Farrakhan that building permits for developments planned by the group might not win city approval unless Mr. Farrakhan, who has called Judaism a "gutter religion," sincerely reached out to Jews.
"In order to do developments, you need people of all different faiths" working together, Mr. Daley told Mr. Farrakhan in meeting him for the first time, last Friday.
Mr. Farrakhan plans to build a bakery, printing press and other shops, under the auspices of the Nation of Islam.
Leaders of Jewish groups in Chicago expressed alarm and dismay that Mr. Daley would meet with Mr. Farrakhan at all, and said it would be pointless for them to talk with the Nation of Islam leader.
Richard Hirschaut, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League here, said the Mayor had unwittingly "conferred an air of legitimacy upon Mr. Farrakhan," whom Mr. Hirschaut called a "rank bigot."
Some Jewish leaders noted that prominent rabbis in Chicago had met with Mr. Farrakhan a few years ago, hoping to build a working relationship, but that it had proved fruitless.
Mayor Daley, in defending his meeting, noted that Mr. Farrakhan was a Chicago resident with a large constituency and considerable property. Simply meeting someone, Mr. Daley said, scarcely amounted to an endorsement.
Mr. Daley said he began last Friday's meeting by expressing his disagreement with things Mr. Farrakhan has said about Jews over the years. Mr. Daley noted that "many of my friends are Jewish," and warned Mr. Farrakhan against trying to "blame one group of people for the problems of others."
Leonard F. Muhammad, the chief of staff of the Nation of Islam, said Mr. Farrakhan would be willing to sit down with any Jewish leaders and "discuss our differences." But while saying he was extending an olive branch, Mr. Muhammad was also highly critical of Jewish groups.
"It is amazing how they can support peace initiatives between Israelis and Palestinians, and yet refuse to meet with the premier leader of black people in America," Mr. Muhammad said. "Any disrespect shown to Minister Farrakhan is disrespect to his constituency."
The chairman of the city's Commission on Human Relations, Clarence Wood, said he would be willing to organize a meeting between Mr. Farrakhan and Jewish leaders.
Jonathan Levine, the Midwest director for the American Jewish Committee, said it was "utter nonsense" to construe criticism of Mr. Farrakhan as effrontery toward black Americans. Mr. Levine, while criticizing Mr. Daley's meeting with Mr. Farrakhan, described the Mayor as being "very sensitive to the concerns of the Jewish community."
Mr. Levine said there was no point in Jewish leaders meeting with Mr. Farrakhan "unless and until the anti-Semitic rhetoric stops," because it was absurd to seriously discuss outrageously bigoted charges.
"Farrakhan has accused Jews of everything from slavery to the economic conditions of African Americans to you-name-it," Mr. Levine said.

A Housing Plan Where Stores Have Been Included

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Hundreds of new and renovated low-to-middle-income housing units have been built in the easternmost corner of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and hundreds more are planned. But this growth has not been matched by the development of retail shops.
That will begin to change soon. In the next month, construction is scheduled to start on 20,000 square feet of retail space on a vacant lot at the corner of Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue, and 30,000 square feet will be added later elsewhere along Fulton Street, the area's main business corridor. 
 The project is the first of several planned throughout New York City to help revive distressed neighborhoods where new housing has gone up. The projects' goal is to supply these areas with what city housing officials say is a critical element: retail services. Developers have retail projects in early stages at 36 sites in eight commercial corridors.
The 20,000-square-foot retail complex in Bedford-Stuyvesant, called Fulton Ralph Plaza, has been leased to a Rite Aid drug store, a State Farm Insurance office, a beauty salon and a laundry business. The entire development is being built by the Hudson Companies Inc. of Brooklyn, which is completing 58 two-family homes for middle-income people in the neighborhood and will start 71 similar homes in March.
Fulton Ralph Plaza is part of the city's 18-month-old Alliance for Neighborhood Commerce and Home Ownership program, or Anchor, which is sponsored by the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development and the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce Inc., a nonprofit business organization.
Under the program, $11 million in public financing has been set aside to provide incentives like construction loans, loan guarantees and second mortgages to developers to build retail projects on empty sites leased from the city. Developers must attract additional financing from private sources and market the projects to tenants.
"In the past, there was undue attention paid to housing and not enough attention to retail services," said Richard Roberts, Commissioner of the Housing Department. "Both are needed to stabilize neighborhoods."
Steven A. Brown, vice president at the New York City Partnership, said that the project tries to encourage local, regional and national retailers to open stores, which will create jobs and spur further development and commerce in the neighborhoods.
The program is expected to generate 437,000 square feet of retail space over the next five years on several sites. In addition to Fulton Street, the sites include Broadway and Mermaid Avenue in Brooklyn; Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in Queens; Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X Boulevards in Harlem, and Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard in the Bronx. About 15,460 housing units have risen in neighborhoods in and around those corridors since 1992, and thousands more are expected to be created over the next three years, according to the partnership.
One of the planned projects is an eight-story mixed-used building with 35,000 square feet of ground- and basement-level stores topped by 126 condominium apartments that will be built on the corner of 116th Street and Fifth Avenue, near Malcolm X Boulevard, in Harlem. It will be developed by Full Spectrum Inc., with ground-breaking expected in the second quarter of next year.
Also, 100,000 square feet of retail space is planned on 10 scattered sites, not far from the Broadway corridor in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The developer, the Beechwood Organization of Williston Park, N.Y., is constructing 78 two-family homes in the area for middle-income people.
The program faces some hurdles. Although these neighborhoods have only limited retail areas, residents and local merchants are worried that new stores might displace the shops that are there. Another challenge is attracting large retailers who are willing to gamble that the neighborhoods' slow recovery will continue. Developers say that such tenants are needed to secure financing from private sources and to draw other retailers.
"Convincing retailers and lenders they can make a go of it in these neighborhoods is a challenging assignment," Mr. Brown said. But he and other proponents of the Anchor program are hoping Fulton Ralph Plaza will demonstrate that it can be done.
The Chase Manhattan Bank provided a $2.7 million construction loan for Fulton Ralph Plaza, which will cost $3.5 million; the rest came from public sources. Getting the financing pieces to work together took six months, said Alan R. Bell, a principal of the Hudson Companies. Although the public money makes these projects economically feasible, "signing on a credit-worthy tenant is the only way they can happen," he said.
State Farm Insurance and Rite Aid fit the bill, although the drug store was greeted with some local resistance, particularly from the proprietor of a drug store a few feet from the new retail center. A local entrepreneur is opening the other two businesses at the plaza: the beauty salon and laundry. Mr. Bell said Fulton Ralph Plaza is expected to be completed by the end of 1998.
Meanwhile, the Hudson Companies is winding down construction on 58 two-family homes along nearby Sumpter Street between Saratoga and Howard Avenues. Each house has an apartment with two floors and 1,600 square feet of space for the owner and an 800-square-foot rental unit. All but one of the homes, priced at $168,000, have been sold to people whose annual incomes do not exceed $70,000. Mr. Bell said that the 71 additional two-family homes his company plans to build four blocks away on Hull and MacDougal Streets will be similar in size and price.
"The retail project will help sell the housing," Mr. Bell said. "Neighborhood development is more than plunking down some houses."

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief May Propose Easing Restrictions on Sale of Iraqi Oil

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General is considering recommending an increase in the amount of oil that Iraq is allowed to sell in order to buy food, medicine and other goods, diplomats said today.
After hearing reports of the plight of Iraqis suffering under trade sanctions, the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is expected to ask the Security Council to raise the current $2 billion limit to $3 billion for the next six-month period when the plan comes up for renewal on Dec. 5. 
 The oil-for-food program -- which was begun a year ago to alleviate the impact of sanctions that were imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait in 1990 -- allows critical goods into Iraq under controlled conditions.
But the politics are intricate. The United States may reject any action, saying the Council should wait a few weeks to make sure that Iraq first lets United Nations inspectors carry out their work unimpeded as they search for weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors have recently returned to Iraq but are still arguing with Saddam Hussein over the extent of their access to possible weapons hideaways.
Some diplomats predict that Mr. Annan will not ask for a specific increase, thereby avoiding putting Washington on the spot.
One diplomatic source at the Security Council, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 15-member body would probably end up continuing the $2 billion limit without changes, in part because of the United States' opposition, but may promise to consider an increase later.
Britain, usually a close supporter of Washington's hard-line policies on Iraq, could break ranks in this case and favor more oil sales, as do most other important members of the Council. "The United Kingdom is quite ready to push the envelope," the British Ambassador, Sir John Weston, said on Wednesday.
Timed to influence the report, the United Nations Children's Fund, or Unicef, released a survey Wednesday that showed youngsters under 5 years old were underfed and underweight, despite the oil-for-food program. "It is clear that children are bearing the brunt of the current economic hardship," said Philippe Heffinck, the Unicef representative in Baghdad.
Washington has been the chief advocate of the oil-for-food program as it gives the United Nations control over goods arriving in Iraq. But Iraq objects to it, viewing it as a substitute for lifting the sanctions.
Iraq has close to $1 billion in oil revenues not yet spent on humanitarian goods.
Baghdad has argued that this is partly due to American blockages on ambulances and other items on order, though the Americans argue that Iraq had not turned in enough proper contracts. "The current list has things like musical instruments, rowing machines, dental floss," said one diplomat. "A straight increase would raise the amounts of those things pro rata, but are they essential humanitarian needs?"

HEADLINE: Across Asia, a Pollution Disaster Hovers

SERIES: POISONED LANDS: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BADUI, China

 BODY:
This little village is hauntingly beautiful, a patchwork of mud-brick shacks framed by the vastness of the Yellow River on one side and rugged gray mountains on the other. But as peasants shuffle along the ocher paths, their eyes following their children and aching at the sight, the hamlet suddenly seems chilly, frightening and grotesque.
One-third of the peasants in this hamlet in Gansu Province in western China are mentally retarded or seriously ill. Most people die in middle age, the women report unending miscarriages and stillbirths, many of the children are trapped in toddler-size bodies that they never grow out of, and even the goats totter and stagger into trees as they go blind and insane. 
 In the entrance to one house stood a boy named Wei Haiyun, only 29 inches tall -- the height that an average American baby boy reaches at 12 months, but Haiyun is 8 years old. Haiyun, who is mentally retarded as well, casually urinated on the floor and then played with his fingers in the puddle, as his mother watched and bit her lip and admitted that the only word he ever utters is "Ma."
The peasants believe that the horrors of Badui village are the result of polluted water discharged by the state-run Liujiaxia Fertilizer Factory next door. The factory, which sometimes denies the accusations and mostly ignores them, dumps its wastes into the Yellow River just upstream from where the villagers draw their drinking water.
The pain here in Badui is emblematic of the growing environmental catastrophe all across Asia. The cost of Asia's "economic miracle" is a rising tide of pollution that is proving a burden not just for Asia but for the entire earth.
Already, Asia has what many experts consider the dirtiest water in the world, the filthiest air, the most worrisome overfishing, and the fastest-disappearing coral reefs. One study by the United Nations suggested that 13 of the 15 cities with the worst air pollution in the world are in Asia.
"The worst pollution in the world is unequivocally in Asia," said Daniel C. Esty, director of the Center for Environmental Law and Policy at Yale University and co-author of a new book on Asia-Pacific environmental issues. "The statistics about China are stunning, and right behind those Chinese cities stand almost every other major city of Asia: Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta are all right up there among the top polluted cities of the world."
When delegates from the United States and more than 150 other countries gather in Kyoto, Japan, beginning on Dec. 1 for a conference on global warming, one of the fundamental underlying challenges will be how to accommodate the economic rise of Asia. Aside from the United States, China is already the biggest source of the greenhouse gases linked to global warming, and -- perhaps more worrying for the long run -- the two fastest-growing sources of these emissions are China and India.
More than 1.56 million Asians die each year from the effects of air pollution alone, not counting 500,000 more who die each year from dirty water and bad sanitation, according to estimates published recently by the World Health Organization and the World Bank. Another new study, also from the World Bank but using different assumptions, calculates that 2.03 million people die annually in China alone from the effects of water and air pollution.
All these figures represent statistical stabs in the dark, so all the numbers in this article may well be incorrect. But whatever the precise figures, it appears that considerably more people die each year from pollution in Asia than died in the Indochina wars centered on Vietnam (about 1.4 million, from the 1950's through the 1970's).
Industrialization vastly magnifies the impact that humans have on nature, and so for the last two centuries it has been the transformation of America and Europe that has had the most dramatic consequences for the planet Earth. But many experts believe that in the coming decades, it is the industrialization of Asia that will pose fundamental new stresses for the ecosystem. Not only does Asia have 60 percent of the world's population, 12 times as much as North America's, but Asia's industrialization is also taking place at triple the pace of the industrial revolution in the West.
"Asia's potential effects on global warming are certainly going to be much larger than in the past, and its potential effects on other aspects of the environment, and particularly its own environment, are likely to be greater as well," said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and co-author of a major study on Asia's development. "And what that really means is that Asia has got to be a lot smarter than it has been in environmental management."
 
The Air
Two Bangkok Girls Gasp for Breath
The paradox is that Asians are not fleeing the filth but embracing it. From India to China, Asians vote with their feet -- moving from rural areas with relatively clean air to the squalid mega-cities that are among the filthiest places on earth.
To an American, the endless Howrah slums in Calcutta, India, or the shantytowns outside Jakarta, Indonesia, seem hellish intersections of gritty air and contaminated water. But to many rural Indians or Indonesians, the slums sing of opportunity, of jobs, of schools, of hope to break out of subsistence poverty.
So peasants take a calculated risk, accepting that their children may die of respiratory infections or diarrhea in exchange for the chance that they may become educated and rich. It is a dangerous gamble but not necessarily a foolish one, and for many people it pays off.
Partly as a result of such risk-taking, most Asians are living longer and better than ever, and others are choking to death.
The stakes are evident in the sparkling black eyes of Kittiya Soisingh, a 14-month-old girl in Bangkok. Her parents moved to a Bangkok slum to get a better life, and as a result Kittiya may lose hers altogether.
Kittiya lives in a dark hovel beside an elevated highway, cars and trucks spewing out black exhaust beside her and above her, and so the air is dense with grit. She almost died recently after a respiratory infection and spent a month in a hospital, but now she is out again, lounging on a table on the cracked sidewalk outside her home, watching as the cars and trucks whiz by, waiting to be rushed to the hospital the next time.
"I'm always afraid," fretted her mother, Vilgi Ratchamphu, 20, as she played with the girl on the street. "I'm always afraid that she'll just stop breathing."
The problem for Kittiya is the particles in the air. In Bangkok and most Asian cities, these particles total more than the danger level of 100 micrograms per cubic meter. Among the worst cities are Taiyuan, China, and Delhi, India, each with more than 500 micrograms. Even worse is the "indoor air pollution" caused by cooking or heating with coal briquettes; indoor particles in China have been measured at 11,000 micrograms.
These particles can trigger asthma and respiratory infections in children like Kittiya, and although such infections are rarely thought of as deadly in the West, they are the third leading cause of death in the world today, after heart disease and cancer. Moreover, cancer and heart disease tend to kill the elderly, so statisticians say acute respiratory infections cause more "years of life lost" than any other ailment in the world today.
Particles are also associated with higher rates of lung cancer, of heart attacks and especially of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a fancy way of describing what happens when particles clog up the lungs so that people cannot breathe. This is the leading cause of death in China and kills Chinese at five times the rate in the United States.
To be sure, it is not just the particles that kill children, but also poverty.
Across town from Kittiya's slum, at one of the best nursery schools in Bangkok, 13-month-old Alisa Srirat also suffers from asthma and sensitivity to respiratory infections. A vivacious little girl with chipmunk cheeks, Alisa was born in England, where her father was studying at a university, and she began gasping for breath almost immediately after moving to Thailand and encountering Bangkok's air.
The girl's father, Wichai Srirat, a 33-year-old university lecturer, was able to afford good medical advice, and he ended up buying an air filter for his car to shield his daughter from air particles on the roads. That has largely resolved the crisis.
Mr. Srirat smiled as he watched his daughter play on a jungle gym at the nursery school. "She's so much better now," he mused."
For poorer parents like Kittiya's, stuck in the dirtiest neighborhoods and limited to third-rate medical care, if any, the deadliness of urban air in Asia creates an excruciating dilemma.
"She can be treated, but she can't be cured, and the doctor says we should leave this area," Kittiya's mother noted sadly. "If we stay, she'll never get over this. Her lungs won't be able to take it. But we have no place to go."
That is not exactly true, for the family could go back to the village that it left only a year ago. But a Bangkok slum, despite the bedraggled rats that amble along the gutters, still offers better schools, clinics and jobs than the countryside.
So Kittiya's parents are not being irrational in risking her life. She may die, but she may also be the first in her family to break out of a cycle of subsistence poverty. It is a gamble that leaves her mother breathless with fear, but one that she still accepts.
 
The Water
Lead and Bacteria Foul Asia's Rivers
One of the greatest scientific mistakes of the 20th century was the decision to add lead to gasoline to improve performance. The lead in the air from car exhaust maims children intellectually, permanently impairing their brain development.
In Chinese cities like Shanghai, the roads are clogged with new cars that are one of the most dazzling signs of China's economic triumph. But various studies have found that at least 65 percent of Shanghai children have lead levels higher than the point considered dangerous to mental development. The retardation is permanent, and half a century from now, most of these people will still be living out their lives, the flotsam of Asia's industrial revolution.
Most of the lead comes from auto exhaust and hangs in the air, but because of factory discharges, Asia's rivers also average 20 times more lead than the rivers in the industrialized world.
Asia's water is almost as deadly as the air, for hundreds of thousands of people die from drinking polluted water, particularly in places like India, where the rivers sometimes function simultaneously as water sources and sewage systems. The average Asian river has 50 times more bacteria from human feces than World Health Organization guidelines allow.
Perhaps the worst slum in the world is in on the edge of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on a muddy slope leading to the Bassac River. As one strolls along the wooden planks that serve as sidewalks over the stinking mud and excrement, making conversation with exhausted women trying to prepare dinner and look after their brood of naked children, nearly every mother acknowledges having lost a child or two over the years.
It is easy to see why. The tens of thousands of people who live in the slum drink the river water, which is polluted with industrial effluents and also functions as the toilet for the entire community.
There are countless other environmental challenges in Asia, like deforestation -- the continent is losing 1 percent of its forests each year -- and the loss of rare species of animals, particularly in countries like Indonesia that are treasures of biodiversity. But those problems seem a bit unreal to many workers and peasants; the giant panda may become extinct, but every year tens of thousands of Chinese children die from pollution for every panda that is poached.
 
The Complexities
Unclear Causation Vs. Clear Prosperity
The study of pollution is so invested with the language of science, with everything measured in micrograms or milliliters, that it all sometimes seems tidy and precise. But in fact, one of the fundamental challenges is that at ground level in Asia, there are enormous uncertainties about how to assess the dangers, and these unknowns make regulation all the more difficult.
In Badui and its surrounding villages in China, just downstream from the fertilizer factory, the precise reason for the health problems remains as murky as the factory's effluent. The only thing that is entirely clear is that something is dreadfully wrong.
In the hamlet of Qidui, which is three miles from Badui and also relies mostly on river water with factory waste, there are about 13 births a year, estimates the village leader, Li Genchen. Of these, he said, eight are stillbirths or children who die in infancy, and a couple more survive but with tiny bodies. Only about three of the births lead to normal children, he said.
As for adults, he said, most die in their 40's.
Circumstantial evidence is clear: The problems in Qidui and Badui began around the time when the factory started operations in 1971, and they went away in a nearby village that got piped water in 1989. Factory officials acknowledged that they have dumped dangerous chemicals, including arsenic, into the water, although they say they stopped releasing arsenic in 1978.
"Water pollution has been a serious problem, and local villagers have been making trouble over this issue," said Fu Youai, an official in the local environmental protection bureau. "The pollution is too high and has gone way over the levels set by the state, and it's harmful to human beings."
"Every year, we order the factory to correct the problems," Mr. Fu added. "But because of budget constraints, the factory hasn't been able to do so."
Tests of the water conducted on samples carried out to Japan show the presence of ammonia, nitrites and trace metals. The tests also showed arsenic in levels that exceed safety standards, but not by a large margin, and in any case these would not normally produce precisely the symptoms seen in these villages.
Doctors and chemists consulted in Japan and in the United States noted that a single sample is often not reliable, because chemicals can be released irregularly. They added that the causation of health problems can be extremely complex.
Something in the effluent might build up in fish, they said. Or some chemical in the effluent might act in combination with a mineral deficiency in the peasants, and they suggested that identifying the problem might take years of research.
Such complexities are common, for in Japan's most famous pollution case it took years to prove that inorganic mercury used by a factory in Minamata was turning into a highly toxic substance called methyl mercury. The methyl mercury then accumulated in fish and caused birth defects in babies born to women who ate the fish.
Yet for all the mystery about the ailments of Badui, there is one overwhelming practical certainty in Badui that has an echo all across Asia: The polluting factory is crucial to the regional economy. The factory employs 3,000 workers and annually produces 160,000 tons of urea fertilizer, which in turn improves the diet and raises the living standards of millions of people in Gansu Province.
If the factory was forced to close, the increased local poverty would almost certainly lead to more people dying of mundane diseases and fewer children being able to afford to go to school. So officials at the factory, which is only marginally profitable, are not at all sympathetic to the peasants and dismiss them as troublemakers grasping for compensation payments.
"The villagers are lazy and unreasonable," scoffed Zeng Qingang, a factory director. "They say, 'We should get rich by living off the factory.' "
Moreover, even some of the villagers are wary of thorough investigations that might harm their own livelihood -- like raising fish in ponds full of the tainted water. There are several of these fish farms, and although the villagers say the pollution kills up to half the fish, they sell the surviving fish on the market in the nearby city of Lanzhou.
"The fish taste different from the fish raised in cleaner water," acknowledged Cui Tengxiong, a local fish farmer. "I'm a bit afraid that they'll test the fish and then tell us not to sell them."
The heartbreak here in Badui and across Asia is so numbing that one sometimes forgets that the pollution is only half of the seesaw, and that the other half -- economic development -- is even more stunning.
Industrialization may be poisoning hundreds of thousands of people each year, but it is also resulting in new hospitals and schools that are saving even more lives.
Even in Badui, the peasants acknowledge that for all their difficulties with death and disease, their lives have improved dramatically. As recently as the great famine of 1959-61, many starved to death in Badui.
So some of the peasants, even as they sorrowfully watch their retarded children, bear the hardships that they attribute to pollution remarkably well. They suffer tragedies but keep them in a kind of perspective.
"My husband's stomach is sick, so he can't do much," Qi Chunnu, a stooped farm wife with downcast eyes, said tiredly as she stood in the entrance to her home in Badui. "My eldest child is mentally retarded. My second child is deaf and can't speak right."
And then she beamed: "But my third child is O.K."
NEXT: Public obliviousness to the health risks of Asia's environmental disaster.

Pippen Is Right, But Wrong

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
THE school teacher trying to run a class of disadvantaged kids in an inner city has to laugh to keep from crying when Scottie Pippen complains that his contract to play basketball -- a seven-year deal worth $22 million and in its last year -- has become a slap in his face.
The garbage collector or the candlestick maker, as well, must wince when they learn that Scottie Pippen grumbles that he gets no respect from the Chicago Bulls, from whose base it is estimated he has made more in endorsements than in salary. He is demanding a trade or, he threatens, he will not play this season. Pippen has been sidelined from the beginning of the season after having undergone foot surgery, and suggests he is about ready to play, but won't -- for the Bulls. 
 Now, in America, after all, we pay top dollar to be entertained, and Scottie Pippen, a smooth operator on the court, has emerged as a great entertainer. He is one of the 10 to 15 best players in basketball, and second only to M. J. Jordan as a player responsible for the five National Basketball Association championships in the last seven years the Bulls have won.
And as everyone who follows basketball, or the gross national product, knows, Pippen is currently not receiving market value for his extraordinary skills. Which is not quite the same thing as saying that he is, as some have termed it, "grossly underpaid."
Yet Pippen sees a second-year player like Kevin Garnett signing a $126 million contract for six years. Or a veteran player like Charles Oakley making around $3.6 million. In fact, Pippen's salary -- currently at $2.775 million a year -- is 122d in the league.
"I would rather leave things as I can remember them as a player and go on," Pippen recently said, in an adieu of sorts to the Bulls. "It's very difficult. I have a lot of respect for teammates and the fans in Chicago. I've enjoyed my 10 years playing here."
Memories, like Pippen's, are obviously highly selective. Does Pippen remember when hometown fans booed him and he lashed out at them for being "racist"? Does he remember when, in one of the most disgusting moments in recent sports history, he threw a monumental pout and refused to enter a tie game in the playoffs in 1994 against the Knicks with 1.8 seconds to go because the play wasn't designed for him?
And does he remember that, before signing his current contract negotiated by him and his agent in June 1991, it made him one of the highest-paid players in the game?
Does he remember when the Bulls' owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, told him: "Scottie, in my opinion, I think you will regret signing because salaries will be going up in the N.B.A. and if you continue being a good player, it'll turn out you're underpaid?"
"I remember him telling me at the time," Reinsdorf said recently, "that he wanted the security because of the back surgery and he might be injured. I said, 'Scottie, if you sign, we're never going to renegotiate.' " Pippen eagerly reached for the pen.
As part of the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' union three years ago, a team is prevented from renegotiating an existing contract.
"We'd like to pay him more money -- he deserves more money," said Jerry Krause, general manager of the Bulls and an ample target of Pippen's dissatisfaction, "but all we could do now is extend his contract by a maximum of 20 percent a year. But we know he's looking for a much larger payday."
What about his not getting respect from the Bulls? "How do you spell respect?" asked Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' general manager, who answered his own question: "M-o-n-e-y."
Meanwhile, Pippen, when not giving full value -- such as not playing because of a tantrum, or because of injury or surgery (he could have had the foot surgery earlier last summer but opted to go on a promotional tour for the shoe company he sponsors) -- has never offered to return any part of his salary to the organization.
And his public grousings have made it ever more difficult for the Bulls to trade for equal value when other teams feel that, with a 32-year-old player coming off injury, Chicago must deal from weakness.
Despite current market tendencies, Scottie Pippen indeed signed a contract that, to most people, would be commensurate with a king's ransom.
The classy thing to do would be to shut up and live up to it.

HEADLINE: In Oakland, Jerry Brown Sees Forum for Change

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
Dressed in black from his banded-collar shirt to his shoes, a balding, 59-year-old man walking along the waterfront of this city of hills and faded factories looked vaguely familiar to a group of tourists from Atlanta.
He was a dead ringer for that guy who followed his daddy's footsteps into politics and was a two-term Governor of California, who fed the hungry at the side of Mother Teresa and marched with farm workers and most recently was host of a radio talk show, "We The People," an "intelligent" antidote, he will be the first to tell you, to all the right-wing pap poisoning the airwaves. 
 "You're Jerry Brown," one tourist said. "You ran for President."
"Three times," the man in black said.
But these days, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. has more modest ambitions. He wants to be the next mayor of Oakland, his adopted hometown.
He swears he is not kidding.
For most of his life, Mr. Brown, the son of power and privilege, has played in the major leagues of American politics, far away from places like Oakland, the other city by the bay. But he said rather than being a step down -- the last stop perhaps of a once promising political career -- becoming mayor of a medium-size city with big problems is a much better place to help rebuild the "foundation of America, our cities."
"Here's where reality is, even though very powerful decisions are made elsewhere," Mr. Brown said. "Economic, environmental, racial, educational, crime, art, welfare -- all the factors that go into the national dialogue -- are right here. I've tried it at the national level, but at the local level, you can mobilize people and do good regardless of money politics."
Mr. Brown announced his mayoral ambitions in early November, and the news was greeted with smirks, smiles and sighs. He is used to the mixed reaction. He has been called every name in the book -- good and bad -- including quirky, flaky, smart, visionary.
"I think he is a sort of tortured soul in some ways and feels he needs to reinvent himself," said Larry Arnn, president of the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank in Claremont, east of Los Angeles. "From the perspective of California politics, where there is a lot of strange stuff, he is the strangest."
H. Eric Schockman, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California, said Mr. Brown "is a man looking for an office."
"He is a wonderful, inspirational speaker who can move masses of people, but that's not what big cities need," Professor Schockman said. "They need someone to roll up their sleeves and fill potholes."
With a population of 370,000, Oakland is the sixth-largest city in California and the 39th largest in the country, according to the 1990 Census. It is a blue-collar city in a world of computer chips, roller coaster stock markets, runaway factories and pink-collar low-end jobs.
"There's a driving down of wages for a significant number of Americans, and a lot of them live here," Mr. Brown said. "We're a factory town in transition. We're going to need to attract a lot of private capital and do a lot of bootstrap pulling."
Although Mr. Brown was vague about exactly how he would bring jobs to the city, he has said he would use his years of political experience and contacts to attract development.
That may not be easy. Oakland is a long way from the national spotlight, which, when it shines on Northern California, usually hits San Francisco, the city of glamour and cable cars with its own Mayor named Brown, as in Willie L. Brown Jr., the former longtime speaker of the California Assembly.
"I think the example of Willie Brown had to have had some influence on Jerry's decision to run," said Bruce E. Cain, acting director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. "Jerry saw that being Mayor of a city is a very good platform to talk about some of the critical issues facing contemporary California and, indeed, urban America."
Mr. Brown moved to Oakland, a racially and culturally diverse city, where minorities are the overwhelming majority, in 1993.
He lives in the old factory district on the city's west side near the Port of Oakland in a sprawling building that also houses his nonprofit organization and radio show.
"Oakland is a beautiful city," Mr. Brown said. "And it is full of unspent potential."
All that potential is one reason a crowded field of five or more is anticipated in this nonpartisan June election, even though the city has a weak mayor form of government.
The two-term incumbent, Mayor Elijou Harris, has not officially declared his intentions, but he is not expected to seek re-election.
Others expected to run include a city council member, a county supervisor, a chamber of commerce official, and Edward J. Blakely, an urban affairs professor at the University of Southern California, who has spent most of his life in Oakland.
"Everybody sees Oakland is turning around, and that's why Jerry is interested," Professor Blakely said. "A lot of people have paid very high prices to get Oakland into this position, and Jerry wasn't one of them."
On the streets of Oakland in interviews with business owners and homeless loners, with college students and architects, Mr. Brown's candidacy was greeted with a rainbow of outright enthusiasm, downright pessimism and guarded hope.
Hampton Hancock, a 54-year-old architect who works for the city, said he had significant reservations about Mr. Brown's ability to manage such a diverse place.
"Has Jerry ever faced in life what most families have faced?" Mr. Hancock asked. "I think he's a good man, and I think he's a serious man, but every time he has a problem he takes off to study Buddhism and some Zen master in Japan."
Carol Denise Mitchell, a writer and executive secretary, said Mr. Brown, as a white man, was the wrong person to lead Oakland. The city's last two mayors have been black and Ms. Mitchell, who is black, does not want that to change.
"I don't think anybody is doing much good for Oakland right now, and I would like to see other black candidates give it a try because Oakland is a minority city," she said.
Her views were not shared by George Gary Warren, 44, who also is black and who is a Brown volunteer.
"He's a guy people always wrote off, and he always came back," Mr. Warren said. "The same thing happens to Oakland. People are always writing us off. I think Mr. Brown can help bring us back."
Mr. Brown was headed back to his headquarters recently when another group of tourists shouted hello.
Mr. Brown waved and smiled and then told about the time he and his father, Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., were riding with John F. Kennedy through Oakland during the 1960 Presidential campaign. The candidate waved at everyone, a lesson that has stuck with Mr. Brown.
"There are very few people who have as much experience in politics as I do," Mr. Brown said. "This is what I know how to do best."

HEADLINE: The Worries About Lobster In Maine Rise By the Pound

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: FRIENDSHIP, Me.

 BODY:
Donald Simmons Sr. had little company when he began setting lobster traps in Muscongus Bay more than 25 years ago.
These days, hundreds of boats and more than 200,000 brightly colored lobster buoys crowd the same 80-square miles of the bay. 
 Hoping to find less crowded and more lucrative waters, Mr. Simmons and four fellow lobstermen from Friendship, a small town about 75 miles northeast of Portland, bought state licenses last fall to fish in a 32-square-mile area traditionally reserved for residents of Monhegan (pronounced mon-HEE-gun), an island about 25 miles southwest of Friendship.
The move outraged Monhegan's 12 lobstermen, who put out about 6,000 lobster traps in the area. It also sparked a statewide debate that could influence the future of Maine's lobster industry.
At stake, Monhegan fishermen argue, is a way of life that has sustained their offshore community for hundreds of years. State officials worry that the territorial dispute is a symptom of a larger problem: an out-of-control lobster fishery.
Lobster fishing has risen sharply over the last decade, state officials and fishermen agree. Maine licensed 2.6 million traps in 1996, the first year the state kept such records.
Part of the growth has been driven by conservation efforts that forced some fishermen to switch from species like halibut and cod. That has been coupled with record lobster catches and profits in the 1990's. Lobsters are selling for $2.90 a pound at the dock, and the price is expected to rise.
Last year, Maine fishermen caught 36.2 million pounds of lobster worth more than $107 million.
At the same time, faster boats have allowed fishermen to set traps farther and farther from their homes, and some of the informal rules and unofficial boundaries that grew up around the state's 90 or so lobstering harbors have eroded, said Col. Joseph Fessenden, chief of the Marine Patrol, the law-enforcement arm of Maine's Department of Marine Resources.
Many fishermen argue that the rising catches are a sign of a healthy industry, but biologists contend they are not sustainable.
"The time has come for us to move ahead with more stringent conservation measures in order to protect the stock into the future," said Jay Krouse, director of the agency's biological monitoring division.
Maine began taking steps to protect lobster fishing several years ago, with restrictions on the number of new lobster licenses also setting a limit of 1,200 traps for each fisherman, and an apprenticeship program that limits the number of people entering the industry.
Fishermen formed local management groups that were empowered to adopt more stringent conservation rules, including lowering the limit on the number of traps. Several local groups did just that, and others are considering it.
Monhegan has had a more stringent trap limit since 1974, when residents agreed to a maximum of 600 traps for each fisherman.
In addition to the trap limit and a January-to-June fishing season set by the State Legislature in 1907, Monhegan fishermen also informally adopted a two-year apprenticeship for anyone wanting to join the fishery, said Doug Boynton, a Monhegan lobsterman who has been fishing around the island for 30 years.
"What has kept lobstering a healthy fishery is that people have had to look after their own backyard," he said. "We had to be sure that next season there was something there."
Of the island's 70 residents, 24 make a living from winter lobster fishing, when prices are highest. Unemployed Monhegan residents, Mr. Boynton pointed out, cannot just get into their trucks and drive to the next town for part-time work.
"If we lose the winter fishing area, the community is going to die out and become a tourist attraction," Mr. Boynton said.
Monhegan's fishing traditions date to the early 1600's, when English explorers established a base there for cod fishing.
Friendship fishermen scoff at the idea that adding five new fishermen to those in the Monhegan area would deplete the lobsters there or put locals out of work.
A state-hired mediator met with the lobstermen in November and worked out a compromise allowing Monhegan's fishing season to open a month early, on Dec. 1, and splitting the area to allow both sides to fish until January, when the Legislature convenes and can consider the issue.
But disputes like this will continue unless fishermen and state fisheries managers can reduce the number of traps in the water, said Colonel Fessenden of the Marine Patrol.
"Its probably going to lead to eroding of traditional fishing areas that have existed for the last 100 years," he said, "and probably to the demise of the fishing industry."

HEADLINE: Public Backs Tough Steps For a Treaty On Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
As the world's nations gather in Japan to discuss how best to counter the threat of global warming, the American people are far more willing than their Government to take early, unilateral steps, a New York Times Poll has found.
They appear to be unimpressed by arguments that cutting the United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere might cause undue economic harm, as industry groups opposing a treaty have contended. 
 Sixty-five percent of those polled said that the United States, which releases more such greenhouse gases than any other country, should take steps now to cut its own emissions "regardless of what other countries do." The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Only 15 percent of the 953 people polled by telephone on Sunday and Monday said the United States should delay acting until many countries agree how to address the problem together.
Better-educated people are most likely to favor early action by the United States. Fully three-quarters of college graduates favor acting even without a binding treaty, as do 59 percent of high school graduates. Men and women are equally likely to favor unilateral action.
Delegates from 166 nations are assembling Monday in Kyoto to try to negotiate a tougher, binding treaty on controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap the Sun's heat in the Earth's atmosphere and threaten to change the planet's climate. The treaty would supplant the voluntary pact that was adopted five years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The Clinton Administration's position going into the talks has been criticized by European nations who say it would delay action for too long, and many Third World nations have been resisting the Administration's insistence that developing countries join the industrial nations in pledging to cut emissions.
American emissions of greenhouse gases have been increasing ever since the world's industrial nations agreed five years ago to try to reduce them by the turn of the century. The Administration has proposed a binding treaty stabilizing emissions at the 1990 levels, but not until another 10 or 15 years have passed.
The poll suggests that the public rejects the main arguments against such a treaty that have been voiced by industry groups, some unions and their allies in Congress. Rather, most Americans tend to agree with the position on the talks taken by major environmental groups.
Still, just 1 percent of all respondents offered the environment when asked what was the most important problem facing the country; crime topped the list. When asked what environmental problem was most important, people were more likely to name air and water pollution than global warming. Twenty-seven percent said they had heard or read a lot about global warming and 38 percent said they had heard or read "some" about it. About a third said they knew "not much" or "nothing" about it.
Generally, Americans strongly favor environmental protection despite its costs, the poll showed. Sixty-one percent of respondents favor protecting the environment even it it costs jobs in their community; 57 percent said environmental improvements must be made regardless of costs. Majorities have taken that view for 15 years.
Major industries, including companies that produce and consume large amounts of fossil fuels, have criticized the Administration for moving too quickly on global warming, saying that the science of global warming remains uncertain and that limiting energy use or raising energy prices could needlessly harm the American economy.
But neither of these arguments appear to carry much weight with the public.
Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed agreed that the American economy would become more competitive if the nation controlled greenhouse gas emissions "because these efforts will result in more efficient energy use, saving money in the long run." Only 17 percent agreed that cutting emissions "will cost too much money and hurt the U.S. economy."
Only 16 percent said that they believed global warming results from normal fluctuations in climate rather than from emissions released when people burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gasoline.
Asked when serious effects from global warming might be expected, an even smaller minority, 13 percent, said they believed global warming would have no serious effect.
In contrast, 23 percent said they believed global warming's impact was already serious.
Another 43 percent said global warming's effects would not be felt until the future. Despite that belief, 6 out of 7 people in this group said steps were needed right away to counter global warming.
Younger adults, especially those less than 30 years old, were more likely than older ones to believe that the effects of global warming are already being felt. And older people, especially those older than 65, are more likely to believe it will not have a serious impact at all.
Most people said they would be willing to spend money on efficient appliances, insulation and other energy-saving investments to cut emissions of greenhouse gases and save money on gas and electric bills. Only 20 percent said they would not be willing to do so.
Forty-one percent of the people in the sample said they would be willing to spend money to cut energy use even if it took as much as five years of reduced gas and electric bills to cover the cost of the investment.
Far and away the most popular approach to cutting emissions was for the Government to impose energy efficiency standards on manufacturers of cars, appliances and so on.
Fifty percent said they would favor this approach, while 20 percent said they favored tax breaks for nonpolluting energy like solar and wind power. Only 2 percent said they favored extra taxes on gasoline or other fossil fuels.
It appeared that people were not ready to endorse the Administration's proposed approach to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which would involve a complicated system of trading pollution permits.
When this system was described and people were told that it "would give companies a financial reason to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases," 49 percent said they did not know enough to judge the proposal's merits. Fifteen percent said it was a good idea, and 17 percent said it was a bad idea.
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted on Sunday and Monday with 953 adults across the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated at random to be the respondent for the poll.
The results from all regions were weighted to reflect the actual adult population of the nation. The results have also been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines and to adjust for variations in race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points either way from what would have been obtained from all American adults.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Union Pacific's Rail Troubles Take a Toll on Texas Businesses

BYLINE: By The New York Times

 BODY:
Growing delays in rail traffic since Union Pacific Railroad became the nation's largest railway have cost Texas businesses $762 million, and the losses could climb to $1.3 billion, according to a study commissioned by state regulators.
The report by Bernard Weinstein, an economics professor at the University of North Texas, came as the Texas Railroad Commission sought to force Union Pacific to give other railroads access to the Houston market by selling about 250 miles of track there to an association of carriers. 
 The congestion problems, caused in part by Union Pacific's merger with the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation last year, have resulted in trouble throughout the West. But Texas, with more than one-sixth of Union Pacific's 36,000 miles of track, may be faring the worst.
Severe traffic delays and a lack of rail cars have prevented utility companies from getting enough coal, forcing some to look to natural gas at a time of rising gas prices. Grain elevators, full with record harvests, have had to store grain on the ground, where it could spoil.
Since June, lost production and freight charges have cost the Texas chemical industry $289.2 million, and paper and forest product companies $208 million, according to Professor Weinstein's report, which was issued on Wednesday.
John Bromley, a Union Pacific spokesman, told The Associated Press that the railroad believed the report had overestimated the costs, but he added that the railroad had not undertaken a study of its own.
Union Pacific's problems began in late summer in the former Southern Pacific switching yards in Houston and radiated from there throughout the Union Pacific system, which extends from Chicago to California.
Last week, the Texas Railroad Commission approved a request to the Federal Surface Transportation Board to force Union Pacific to sell 250 miles of track in and around Houston to an independent entity that would give other railroads access to the Houston market.
"I don't think any of us believe that monopolies have been good for this country," the railroad commission's chairman, Charles Matthews, said, "and that's what this issue is all about.".
Under the commission's proposal, Union Pacific would be forced to sell its tracks on both sides of the Houston Ship Channel, which connects Houston to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as tracks that run from Houston to the Texas cities of Galveston and Beaumont. The majority of the tracks would be operated by the Port Terminal Railroad Association, a neutral switching carrier that has operated in the region since 1924.
The Surface Transportation Board, the successor to the Interstate Commerce Commission, is under no obligation to implement the Texas proposal. So far, it has been cautious in its approach to Union Pacific's problems. On Oct. 31, the board issued an emergency order requiring Union Pacific to share some of its track south of Houston with the Texas Mexican Railway Company, based in Laredo. The board will meet again on Dec. 3 to review Union Pacific's progress and to consider the railroad commission's proposal.
Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, contended that the commission's plan "will not help." The railroad "needs all the rail lines serving Houston," Mr. Davis said. "They play a very vital role in being able to offer new and better service not only in Texas but across the whole system."

HEADLINE: Students in Germany Protest Cuts in University Spending

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of students marched through central Bonn today, blowing whistles and blasting trumpets in a demonstration that crowned weeks of protests and years of discontent over the underfinancing and overcrowding of Germany's colleges and universities. Thousands more boycotted classes across the country.
The protests were the biggest displays of student anger in Germany for more than two decades. But, while a previous generation's protests focused on such political themes as the American presence in Vietnam, the huge turnout today reflected student annoyance at overcrowded lecture halls, libraries without books, long waits for access to computers and suggestions that tuition fees be introduced in Germany's state-financed universities similar to those in the United States. 
 Germany's 230 colleges and universities were intended to accommodate some 950,000 students but, over the last 20 years, the number of students has risen to 1.8 million, many of them spending much longer than is usual in the United States to complete their studies.
At the same time, spending reductions have cut teaching staff, leaving lecture halls bulging with students who say they sometimes wait for years to meet with professors. One protester today, Barbara Muller of Cologne, said some seminars were so crowded that she started lining up for a seat at 4 A.M. "and I still didn't get a place."
The protests today, after demonstrations and strikes by students in other cities in recent weeks, were the latest reflection of a broader crisis in Germany -- Europe's biggest economy -- as it struggles to pare away a padded welfare state to meet the challenges of economic globalization and European plans for a single currency based on fiscal restraint.
The students, from 40 universities, converged on Bonn in a cavalcade of buses and four special trains. One small group bicycled the 400 miles from Berlin. There were as many as 40,000 protesters, according to estimates by the police and organizers of the march. Students at 50 universities and colleges boycotted classes today to back the protest.
Many carried banners urging the Government to spend money on higher education rather than on a projected European warplane, the Eurofighter, for which Germany has committed $13 billion. "For a billion marks, 6.5 Eurofighters or 6,481 smart students -- which do we need more in the future?" a banner said.
Student leaders maintain that universities are underfinanced by as much as $3 billion a year.
The complaints have drawn broad support from professors, lecturers and politicians. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who said he sympathized with the students, blamed mismanagement by Germany's 16 federal states, most of which are run by the opposition Social Democrats, for the crisis -- an assertion denied by the Social Democrat leader Oskar Lafontaine.
The question of introducing tuition fees -- raised by some state legislators -- has drawn criticism from students that universities will become elite establishments for the rich. The federal Education Minister, Jurgen Ruttgers, said on television today that the Government wanted "people to be able to study in Germany, whether they are rich or poor." That was met with some skepticism.
"Ruttgers hypocrite," a marchers' banner replied.
A new law, currently before Parliament but not yet approved, seeks to streamline education by making universities compete for state financing, reducing the time it takes to get degrees and introducing a credits system. It does not provide specifically for the introduction of tuition fees, but Mr Kohl's Government has refused to rule out the idea -- as the students demanded today.
Many academics maintain, though, that the proposed law does not address the basic issue. "We in Germany are faced with a question, and it's a value judgment," said Klaus Borchard, vice chancellor of the university here. "What price do we set for the education of our young people?"

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL: The Two Sides of Allan Houston;
Knick Guard Combines Suburban Style With City Smarts

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS

 BODY:
There was school busing, and in a way, it made the suburban curtain that hung between Allan Houston's new world and the inner city of Louisville, Ky., appear invisible.
He had been a city kid until he was 10 years old. He lived in a small home on a tidy block, within earshot of the projects. Houston was far from impoverished, but there were financial constraints and plenty of unfulfilled window-shopping. And yet Houston also had everything a child could need: two loving parents and a Big Wheel tricycle. 
 "I was all over the yard with that Big Wheel," said Houston, now 26 and the youngest player for the Knicks. "I had two friends, and we would circle the house 300 times. That was when I lived downtown. I must have been 4 or 5. It seemed like I had that Big Wheel forever. But I don't know what happened to it when I moved."
The city's skyline slipped away in the rear-view mirror. Suburbs straight ahead. A two-story house and a more comfortable life awaited his family. His father, Wade, had just become an assistant coach at the University of Louisville. It was not big money -- no lucrative Nike contracts to fortify salaries back then -- but there were perks. The family had a van from the school and travel opportunities. Very suburban.
A kid could grow soft in this environment. And there is an undercurrent of thinking about players from middle-class neighborhoods: they don't have the edge that those from more desperate backgrounds do. Is that why Houston -- with his shy, almost slumped exterior -- is considered passive at times? It's an image he has been disproving since he moved from the inner city.
"I think there is a certain aura about growing up in a different environment," Houston said. "What I always did, I tried to gain the respect of certain people by interacting. In my high school, they had busing. A lot of my teammates lived in the projects. My mother would worry a little, but I would go down there and hang out with them just to play basketball. I didn't think anything of it. These were my teammates and my friends. I don't know what that says, but that's how I went about my way."
Houston's way makes for a contradiction in personality. He has a tranquil core that has helped him remain calm during a confusing and frustrating second season as the Knicks' $54 million investment in the future.
He has dealt with the anxiety of a wrist not yet healed and handled rumors that he would be traded for Mitch Richmond with grace and prayer. He has absorbed criticism over the mental block he has shown against his old team, the Detroit Pistons. He will face that issue again tonight, when the Knicks play the Pistons in Auburn Hills, Mich.
"Yeah, I'd like to have a good game," Houston said. "But they don't have a way to guard Patrick Ewing. So I'm not going to say, 'Give me the ball.' "
This season, the ball has come to him with less frequency. But so far, he has buried any doubts he has had over his role while a hot John Starks continues to melt down his minutes.
Doesn't Houston just want to shout: "Hey, give me some playing time? Let me show you I'm fine?"
"All the time, every game," said Houston, who has averaged 28.6 minutes of playing time, compared with 33 minutes a game last season. "But I try to put the negative stuff out of my head. I try to be positive. There may be a time when I ask the question, 'What's going on?' But right now, I have to do the best with the time I have on the court."
Just when he seems free of aggression, he will challenge anyone who considers him too passive. "Half the guys you think are hard and tough are not," Houston said. "So what is soft? It's just a perception. I'm never going to back down from anything."
Underneath the placid waters running through his veins bubbles a passion for the game. Underneath, there is an activist, too. His voice tightens when he hears about a player not living up to his responsibilities, and when he sees money isolate professional athletes from their communities. There are days when Houston pulls out of the driveway of his Greenwich, Conn., home and makes a path toward Harlem. He parks on the street, gets out of his car and walks. He just wants to meet people, shake their hands and ask how they're doing.
"Sometimes, they'll look at me and say, 'Aren't you. . . .,' " Houston said. "It's not really a big deal. I just like to say hello to people."
It's a way to reach out. He has never known another way. Houston grew up in a family of coaches, from his grandfather to his uncle to his father, each in tune to those in need around them.
"Allan grew up hearing about his grandfather a lot," said Wade Houston, who was the head coach at Tennessee when his son played there from 1990 to 1994. "A lot of the kids who played for him didn't have much, and their families were from low economic areas. And rather than have them go home after school without any food, he would take them over to his house and he would feed them and let them sleep a couple of hours. Allan grew up hearing and seeing that kind of giving back. It became a part of who he is."
Houston is heavily involved with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and he is the league's representative for its Team Up volunteer program.
He has never made a scene, not even under tedious questioning about Richmond. Even though Houston was never going to be traded, he had to endure two weeks of rumors.
"I prayed about it and I said, 'I think if God really meant for me to be here, he wouldn't have said go to New York for a year, and then go to Sacramento,' " Houston said. "If it would have happened, it was meant to be. But I just did not believe it was going to happen."
If he had been shooting with his normal motion, the speculation might have died quickly. But Houston has struggled to find his rhythm, shooting 40 percent from the field and a dismal 12.5 percent from 3-point range. Not only are his minutes dropping, but Houston is also missing the playing time he needs to loosen his surgically repaired wrist.
"You have to go with who is hot," Coach Jeff Van Gundy has explained when discussing the way he divides time between Houston and Starks. "That's the way it is going to be for everyone."
Houston has never been in this situation before. He has always been a team star. "Even last year, there was a time when I got to a point where I was comfortable and everyone was comfortable with me," said Houston, who averaged 19 points and 40 minutes a game in the playoffs. "My minutes were consistent and my shots were consistent. Even with the talent on the team last year, there was consistency. Now, it is tough. I need time to play. But it's not my call."
He is not playing passively. In the past two weeks, he has been noticeably energetic on offense and defense. But then so much of what Houston does -- on and off the court -- counters his serene image. He is kind, yet he can poke fun at a teammate with a cunning impersonation. He has Charles Oakley down. "Oak's an easy one," Houston said with a smile. "All you do is mumble and complain a lot."
Houston can be sly and shy all at once. And he can be as laid-back as he appears, too. This has become clear during 15 months of marriage to his wife, Tamara. They are best friends, but complete opposites.
"It's like the other day, we were going to enjoy the afternoon at a movie," Houston said. "We were getting out of the car. And she just took off. She was sprinting to the movie. And I'm like, 'Why are you in such a hurry?' I'm getting popcorn, and she's in the theater. She's so energetic, and I'm laid-back."
And then again, he can be as assertive as an activist and as aggressive as a baseline dunk. He can be reserved, and yet extroverted on the street. He can be suburban, but feel comfortable in any neighborhood.
"I've been in both circumstances," Houston said. "Being a product of both probably formed who I am."

4 Hurt at Macy's Parade As Float Topples Light Pole
Sudden bursts of punishing wind disrupted Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, as many of the parade's signature helium-filled balloons were damaged. Four spectators were hurt when one of the giant balloons struck a lamppost, plunging the top part of it into the crowd. Two people were hospitalized with severe head injuries. The accident was a strange counterpoint to a day in which most of the two million spectators were far away from the accident and had no idea it happened. Several balloons could not finish the parade, including Barney, the Cat in the Hat and the Pink Panther. A Macy's spokesman said the company had discussed with the police the possibility of removing the balloons from the parade, but decided against it because they thought the wind was subsiding. A1

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Mixed in Asia; Tokyo Shares In a Rebound

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Stock prices in Asia were mixed early today.
Prices continued to rise in Tokyo as investors continued to buy shares in banks and brokerage houses. These stocks fell in recent days because of fears about the health of the institutions. 
 The Nikkei average of 225 stocks was up 143.55 points, or 0.86 percent, to 16,746.75 at the midday break.
 Investors were also encouraged today when the Minister of Finance, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said he expected no more bank failures soon, after four collapses in a month.
But in Hong Kong share prices slipped early today on profit-taking. The Hang Seng index lost 78.48 points, or about 0.7 percent, to 10,504.62 shortly after opening.
And in South Korea, share prices fell 3 percent early today because of concern that conditions set for a bailout could depress the market.
"Since there is no positive news, reports of the on-going negotiations over the conditions for the I.M.F. bailout are still hurting the market," said a dealer at Dongsuh Securities.
Asian currencies were largely stable in early trading.
Most Asian currencies weakened a bit from Wednesday. The Singapore dollar stood at 1.5930 against the United States dollar, versus 1.5905 on Wednesday; the Malaysian ringgit was 3.5000, from 3.4830; the Thai baht was 39.90, from 39.73, and the Philippine peso was 34.72, from 34.67.
The Japanese yen weakened to 127.73 to the dollar, from its previous close of 127.05.
In Bombay, the Indian rupee hit a record low of 38.85 to the dollar at the start of trade on fears of new elections, the fifth record low this week.

South Korea's Needs Grow
 SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 27 (Reuters) -- The Finance Minister said today that a $20 billion package of assistance from the International Monetary Fund would not be enough to solve the nation's problems.
But he said the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank were willing to contribute resources of their own. "Forget about the $20 billion figure," said the minister, Lim Chang-yuel.
After weeks of denying it needed help, South Korea sought assistance from the I.M.F. a week ago. Some estimates of South Korea's needs run to $40 billion or more.
 Mr. Lim said Hubert Neiss, head of the I.M.F. delegation to South Korea, had assured him that the World Bank and the A.D.B. were interested in helping to bail out South Korea, the world's 11th-biggest economy.

HEADLINE: For Capital Pundits, Money for Speeches Is Scarce This Year

BYLINE: By JILL ABRAMSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
For the capital's "buckrakers," those media celebrities who rake in lucrative speaking fees on the lecture circuit, 1997 may be remembered as the year that the bucks stopped here.
It seems that Washington's inner workings and the political prognostications of the capital's leading journalists no longer enthrall the trade associations and industry groups that once happily doled out $10,000 -- and sometimes much more -- for an hour of punditry. 
 Margaret Carlson, a Time magazine columnist who found herself in demand on the speaking circuit after she became a panelist on "The Capital Gang" on CNN in 1994, said she could not recall making any paid speeches this year.
For David Gergen, editor at large at U.S. News & World Report, 1997 has been his slowest year for speeches in recent memory. Mr. Gergen's earnings from speeches once prompted President Clinton to joke about them after Mr. Gergen joined his White House staff and reported earning $239,460 for 50 speeches he gave in the first five months of 1993. (He earned $466,625 in speaking income in 1992.)
"When I saw how much more David Gergen had earned before I got him back in the Government, I realized that all of you were doing so much better than we are, you should lighten up on us," Mr. Clinton said at an anniversary party for U.S. News & World Report at the Library of Congress in 1993.
But in the first six months of this year, Mr. Gergen's earnings from speeches were not nearly as big. As probably the only star pundit who discloses his earnings from speechmaking, Mr. Gergen, who was also an adviser in the Reagan White House, earned a more modest -- at least for him -- $83,250.
Mark Shields, Mr. Gergen's former sparring partner on "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" on PBS and now paired on the program with Paul Gigot, a columnist for The Wall Street Journal, also reported a fall-off. For example, the lucrative group bookings Mr. Shields used to enjoy with fellow members of "The Capital Gang" disappeared this year.
He attributed the dry spell to the "status quo" nature of the 1996 election, which lacked the excitement and complexities of the more historic contests of 1992 and 1994. Mr. Gergen said the dip was seasonal, since there were no major political races in 1997, though he acknowledged that this year had been more severe. (But he said he expected 1998 to be more brisk, with invitations already beginning to pick up).
Ms. Carlson said there were no new Washington characters to fascinate audiences who once wanted to know all about such White House aides as George Stephanopoulos or the brand of ale consumed by Speaker Newt Gingrich. Now, along with her speaking fees, Ms. Carlson said, "even George is gone." Mr. Stephanopoulos has himself become a pundit for ABC News since leaving the White House earlier this year.
Agents who book the buckrakers confirm the trend.
"It's down for a lot of journalists, especially the ones who were just breaking into it in 1996," said Jay Callahan of Keppler Associates. Mr. Callahan agreed with Mr. Gergen that some drop-off was normal after Presidential election years.
But there is more to it than the ebb and flow of the political calendar, Mr. Callahan said. The same apathy about Washington that is felt by the public has spread to trade associations and companies that used to feel their annual meetings were not complete without a speech by a bona fide Washington insider.
"People are less inclined to want to hear about the inside story of Washington," Mr. Callahan said. "The stories that are big now turn off the public."
He cited the campaign finance scandals that have consumed so much coverage this year.
Don Walker, the president of the Harry Walker Agency in New York, represents many star media pundits, including John McLaughlin of "The McLaughlin Group," a syndicated public affairs program.
"These cycles come and go," Mr. Walker said, "but the really big names float above the cycles."
Mr. Walker said demand was still brisk for most of his clients, though he conceded that he was recently accosted in Washington by journalists who complained about the paucity of speaking opportunities.
Not all Washington journalists are unhappy about this change.
James Fallows, the editor of U.S. News & World Report, assailed the practice of buckraking in his 1996 book, "Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American Democracy." Mr. Fallows argued in the book that large speaking fees that journalists were accepting from industry groups covered by their news organizations presented an untenable ethical conflict. He wrote that the lecture circuit, which he called "the gravy train," turned journalists into entertainers.
The harsh words of Mr. Fallows and other media critics, who spotlighted the $30,000 speaking fees going to network news stars like Cokie Roberts and Sam Donaldson of ABC News, provoked a debate within journalism circles, although few news organizations have moved to ban paid speeches or require reporters to publicly disclose their fees. The New York Times, for example, forbids members of the news department to speak for compensation to groups whose activities they cover.
Mr. Fallows permits his staff to receive payments for speeches before groups he calls "non-controversial." He also recently published a list in his magazine of speaking fees earned by full-time members of the magazine's staff. His own speechmaking income of $43,500, mostly from academic institutions, was the only sizeable one. (Mr. Gergen's fees and those of another columnist, Gloria Borger, were not included because they are not full-time on the magazine's staff). Mr. Fallows said that he would not do any more paid lecturing while he was the editor of U.S. News & World Report and that the fees he reported were for 1997 engagements booked before he joined the magazine.
Asked whether the marketplace was providing its own solution to buckraking, Mr. Fallows said, "You could call it a market amelioration."
Yet the speaking drought has not affected everyone.
"The superstars will always get theirs," Mr. Callahan said. "I wish I had a nickel for every time we get asked for a Barbara Walters or a Diane Sawyer."
Several columnists for The New York Times, including William Safire and Thomas L. Friedman, maintain active speaking schedules. Mr. Safire said that nonelection years were often slower but that he had not noticed a big change in the number of speaking invitations he received.
And media speakers who can reach beyond politics to other topics, like the economy, are attracting offers. Mr. Callahan said business journalists, like Stuart Varney of CNN, were in demand as business news dominated the headlines.
For Washington pundits, it helps to have a niche. Mr. Shields, who has a moderate-to-liberal point of view, has done paid face-offs with conservative speakers in the last year, recently sparring with Robert Novak, the conservative columnist and CNN pundit, before a gathering of the fast-food industry.
The conservative pundit William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, said his fees had remained healthy in 1997, in part because his critique of conservatism and the Republican Congress offered a particular perspective.
Political figures themselves are still in demand as paid speakers, in part because they continue to bring a celebrity aura to industry conventions and corporate gatherings. Former Presidents like George Bush, and such luminaries as Gen. Colin L. Powell, still command speaking fees well into six figures. The Keppler Agency has had little trouble booking Bob Dole, known for his wit as an after-dinner speaker, or former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is making speeches to earn money as well as to increase his visibility before an expected run for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000.
The Washington Speakers Bureau, the best-known booker of speakers in the circuit, recently added a new political star to its stable of clients, former Prime Minister John Major of Britain. Executives of the agency did not return repeated phone calls.
But for most journalists, the well has gone dry.
It used to be that a steady perch as a regular on a television public affairs program was an instant ticket to lecture circuit riches. The phenomenon began to crest in 1992, with a new Administration coming into the White House and an explosion in the number of television public affairs programs. Such programs were relatively inexpensive to produce and supplied a constant flow of political chatter for the burgeoning number of cable and other news outlets, some of them operating 24 hours.
Ms. Carlson said she was amazed by the speaking lucre that easily came her way in 1995 and 1996.
"I thought, 'So this is what it's all about!' " she recalled.
Although there are no industry-wide figures available, buckraking might have reached an apogee in 1996 and then hit a wall.
"It just came to a full stop," Ms. Carlson said.
Because most Washington pundits and media celebrities are extremely well paid to begin with, the lean times have not really been felt.
Some pundits are devising strategies to weather the downturn. Clarence Page, a syndicated columnist for The Chicago Tribune and sometimes member of "The McLaughlin Group," said a seasonal upswing meant that he would soon be making up for the fall-off in group bookings that once flowed from his participation on the program.
"The period between Dr. King's birthday and Black History month are my busy season," Mr. Page said.
He said he and other African-American journalists jokingly referred to their paid speaking engagements in January and February as "black pundit payback time."

Allstate to Aid Community

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The Allstate Insurance Company has pledged $5.8 million in loans and grants over five years to various housing, youth and community development programs in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
The company, which is based in Chicago, announced the pledge last week as part of a larger $45 million intitiative to help seven stuggling urban neighborhoods around the country, from Cleveland to Los Angeles. 
 Allstate said it chose Bedford-Stuyvesant because the neighborhood has a lot of privately owned housing. The company insures about one fifth of all owner-occupied housing in Bedford-Stuyvesant, according to Monica Williams, Allstate's urban development manager.
Included in the pledged sum is a $3.5 million loan to a local minority-owned bank for the purpose of making low-interest home-improvement loans. (Allstate has not yet selected a bank.) The company also plans to give $1.25 million to Neighborhood Housing Services of Bedford-Stuyvesant and the 81st Precinct Community Council, local nonprofit groups, to help pay for youth programs, revitalization projects and insurance education.

HEADLINE: Don't Rush to Spend City's Revenue Windfall

 BODY:

To the Editor:
New York City's projected additional revenue of $319 million (news article, Nov. 26) creates a tempting opportunity. It is difficult for any politician to resist the call for school construction or repair, increased child welfare services, environmental controls or socially and politically sensitive programs. 
 However, it would be a mistake to return to past practices and use the unanticipated revenue to restore those programs or to bring new pressing concerns into the fray.
A major corner was turned at the start of the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani when serious cuts were made to bring the budget more in line with expectations and the city's fiscal capacity. These cuts were painful, and the pressures brought to bear did more than establish a reputation for those who made the decisions.
Each time we ratchet up expenditures, we mortgage the city's future in ways that outweigh any social benefit. One of the main expenditures over the last 30 years that has restricted well-meaning administrations from meeting long-term as well as short-term initiatives has been the huge interest costs New York City must pay to maintain fiscal security and ratings.
A downgrade in the city's rating can cost the city billions of dollars in interest payments that will strap its future.

HEADLINE: Dollar Nears 5-Year High Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday, approaching a five-year high, as concern about Japan's weak economy and financial system made traders reluctant to hold the Japanese currency.
Japan reported that unemployment rose to a post-World War II high in October and industrial production, housing starts and large retail sales fell. The figures show Japan's six-year economic slump is far from over. 
 "They have a long row to hoe for recovery," said Richard Koss, market strategist at MFR Inc., a money management and consulting firm.
In New York trading, the dollar settled at 127.82 yen -- its highest since August 1992 -- up from 127.73 yen in Asian trading on Thursday and 126.97 yen in New York on Wednesday.
Turnover was light yesterday, as many currency trading desks in New York were staffed by skeleton staffs after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
The dollar was little changed at 1.7645 marks, down from 1.7651 marks in European trading on Thursday, but up from 1.7613 marks in New York on Wednesday. The dollar has been held back against the mark because Germany is viewed as less vulnerable than the United States to Asia's economic turmoil. The British pound rose to $1.6886, from $1.6736 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Foxes' Friends in Commons Back Ban on the Hunt

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Parliament voted overwhelmingly today for a proposal that could one day ban the traditional British sport of fox hunting.
After a boisterous five-hour debate, and with supporters of blood sports parading outside in country tweeds and red hunting jackets, the House of Commons backed a measure calling for an end to hunting with hounds. The vote was 411 to 151. 
 Despite the 260-vote margin and a new poll showing nearly three quarters of the public behind a ban, the proposal will not become law because it was not given the required time for parliamentary debate and for committee review by the Government and must therefore await a place in the legislative calendar in the years to come, or possible inclusion as an amendment to Government legislation this year.
The young administration of Prime Minister Tony Blair has been concerned that the high emotion surrounding the issue could prove to be a damaging distraction to the pursuit of its 26-bill legislative program, and it has distanced itself from the debate.
A Government official compared the fox hunting issue in Britain to the gays-in-the-military argument in the United States, a controversy that unexpectedly emerged in the early days of the Clinton Administration's first term and derailed its progress.
Mr. Blair said he was in favor of the ban, but he and nine of his Cabinet members managed to be away today during the vote. The Evening Standard today took notice of Mr. Blair's one-day trip to visit British troops with the headline, "Blair Goes To Bosnia, Out of Hunting Range."
Passions have been running high. Promoting a ban, full page advertisements feature vivid photographs of animals killed by hunting hounds, and opposing ads feature comments from people with known liberal views arguing that hunting is the most humane way of culling foxes and is a central element in traditional British country life.
The debate has brought to the fore tensions that cross party lines. They respond more to attitudes about city living and the countryside, a place of mythical dimensions to many Britons. "Country Truths, Not Urban Myths," read the placard of one protester seated on a bale of hay in Parliament Square.
While the lawmakers debated, a barge floated by outside the Thames-side Houses of Parliament with a large banner proclaiming, "73 Percent Say Ban Hunting."
Inside, the speech-making was punctuated by jeering and growling shouts of "Hear! Hear!" as more than 50 lawmakers made formal statements before colleagues who waved papers above their heads and banged on their desks.
Mike Foster, the Labor Party member who introduced the bill, said it was aimed at protecting foxes from "cruelty and from the unnecessary pain and suffering inflicted in the name of a so-called sport." He said, "prevention of cruelty is the center piece of this particular bill."
Mr. Foster said he knew that "to many people witnessing a hunt is to feel part of English history, and the sight of a full field of horses and hounds is absolutely thrilling."
But to him, he said, it is "wanton cruelty conducted in the name of sport."
Speaking for the opposition, Michael Heseltine, the former Deputy Prime Minister, sought to dispel the notion that fox hunting was just an outing for upper-class people in red jackets and argued that tens of thousands of working-class people depended on the sport for their livelihood. Referring to the Labor Party, he asked, "How is it that a party which spends most of its life arguing about the creation of jobs, in one piece of legislation is going to decimate the jobs throughout some of the more remote and fragile economies in the country?"
Summoning up a fear held by many followers of country sports, he said today's measure was "merely part of an agenda" that, he said, "will move relentlessly through fishing and shooting and angling." At stake, he said, was the "cohesion of the countryside."
Supporters of the ban are hoping that the sheer scale of the vote will cause the Government to overcome its reluctance to put it on its legislative schedule. Opponents argue that the overwhelming numbers pose a challenge to another cherished British principle, the right of a determined minority not to be dictated to by the majority.
"We live in a nation where there is legislation to protect minority groups," Kate Hoey, a Labor member, said in Commons. "I therefore cannot understand why a country that prides itself on its pluralism and tolerance can be so prejudiced against its own rural inhabitants."

HEADLINE: Incomes and Spending Climbed in October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Personal income and spending recorded healthy gains as the Christmas shopping season approached, a positive sign for retailers.
The Commerce Department said today that personal income grew half a percent in October, the 12th consecutive monthly rise. The increase met analysts' forecasts and was bigger than September's gain, which was revised downward to three-tenths of 1 percent from the four-tenths of 1 percent initially reported. 
 Spending also rose half a percent in October, exceeding expectations. September's increase was revised upward to three-tenths of 1 percent from two-tenths of 1 percent.
Changes in income indicate how much consumers will be able to spend. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services.
Low unemployment and a high level of consumer confidence suggest that spending will be healthy during the holiday shopping season. The unemployment rate in October was 4.7 percent, the lowest since October 1973. And a report issued earlier this week showed that consumer confidence in November had not been hurt by the economic crisis in Asia, the recent turmoil on Wall Street or the recent announcements of big job cuts at a number of large companies.
Moreover, low inflation and discounting give consumers "the incentive to go out there and shop," said John Konarski, vice president of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers in Jersey City.
The Commerce Department also said today that consumers' disposable income, the money left over after taxes, increased half a percent in October after having risen three-tenths of 1 percent during September. The personal savings rate was unchanged at 3.6 percent.
Interest payments to businesses, counted separately from the spending figures over all, grew six-tenths of 1 percent during October after September's increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Moody's Again Cuts the Thai Credit Rating

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service cut Thailand's credit rating today to one notch above junk status, in another potential setback for the beleaguered Thai economy. Analysts said the move reflected fears that the country would halt repayments on its $95 billion in foreign debt.
In its third downgrade of Thai credit this year, Moody's, the United States credit-rating agency, cut the rating two notches, to Baa3 from Baa1. Lower credit ratings often make it more expensive for countries to borrow money. A further downgrade is possible, Moody's said. 
 That would put Thailand, deemed a top-flight investment since 1987, in the ranks of just two other Southeast Asian nations whose bonds are rated "speculative," or junk: Vietnam and the Philippines.
Thailand was the first domino to fall in Asia's economic and financial crisis. A fall in exports and overlending to the property sector led to the closing of more than half the country's finance companies this year.
In another struggling Asian economy, the benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 21.19 points today, or 4.9 percent, to close at 411.91, the lowest in more than 10 years. The stock index has dropped 37 percent so far this year.
The plunge was led by bank stocks, which began falling sharply after Moody's downgraded South Korea's foreign-currency ceilings for bonds, notes, and bank deposits. Dealers said investors feared that the downgrading would make it more difficult for Korean banks to borrow abroad.

HEADLINE: On Black Friday, a B+ (for Bargains);
At High and Low End, Season Starts With Quest for Good Price

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
It was only 10:30 A.M., but things were already getting ugly.
Dozens of shoppers flocked around a jewelry case at the Kmart on Broadway in lower Manhattan, where signs trumpeted discounts of 70 percent. Someone forgot to take a number. Chaos ensued. People started jostling in line to pay for their 10-karat gold rings, diamond-encrusted crosses and silver watches. Sales clerks did their best to keep order. "Who's next?" "Stop pushing!" "Where's the lady with the pendant?" 
 A few feet away, though, where red and green lingerie was hanging at full price, the only sounds were of light music wafting from the public address system. The racks remained neat and untouched.
And so it went yesterday on the first official day of the holiday season -- known to retailers as Black Friday, because they hope it will push their bottom lines strongly into the black. Shoppers all over the country piled into stores as early as 7 A.M. By the time the stores closed, one thing was clear: despite the robust nature of the economy, most people were hunting for bargains and giving cold shoulders to a lot of things that were not marked down.
"What shoppers are really looking for -- no question about it -- is deals," said Debbie Wendell, a store manager trainee at the Wal-Mart in Portsmouth, N.H.
While retailers tend to monitor activity obsessively over the entire Thanksgiving weekend, the kickoff to the crucial holiday buying period has lessened in importance in recent years as more and more shoppers choose to buy closer to Christmas. Thanksgiving weekend can also be deceiving. Last year, the season started with a bang and ended on a mediocre note. At other times, the weekend has provided a sluggish start to an otherwise good period.
Nonetheless, certain trends tend to emerge over the weekend and resonate through the season, and Black Friday often lifts the curtain on what consumers are gravitating toward. In the toy sector, for example, many shoppers said yesterday that Beanie Babies, Sing and Snore Ernie dolls and electronic virtual pets were hard to come by, and Barbie was her usual coveted self.
Patterns appear to be holding, too. Stores on the high end looked to be doing well yesterday, the obvious exception to the push for bargains, as did the discount and off-price shops.
"The dichotomy of American retailing continues," said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York. "The upper-income stores will continue to do well, as will the lower-end stores because they offer value. And the guys in the middle seem to have the problems."
In any event, where the price was right yesterday, there usually was action. A Sears, Roebuck store in Woodbridge, N.J., was packed. In Beaumont, Tex., shoppers lined up at the crack of dawn waiting for a Target store to open. At Bloomingdale's, in Manhattan, shoppers moved to sweater racks festooned with bright red sales signs like deer to a salt lick; two feet away, racks of shirts offered at full price went untouched.
Bargains were visible in the Wal-Mart in Portsmouth, and people were there to take advantage of them. Gesturing toward a rack of marked-down clothing and the cluster of shoppers around it, Ms. Wendell, the manager trainee, said, "See, that's where they're shopping."
Donna Carter, 46, of Epping, N.H., was among those looking for bargains. "I came here first for the deals," Ms. Carter said. "The smart move is to look for the sale prices and at the stores where you know the price is way down."
But many stores were short on traffic yesterday, sales or not. An Ann Taylor store on Madison Avenue was tomblike. Movement in the aisles at the Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles was hardly inhibited. At the Siani Bag Company store there, clerks stood around waiting for shoppers to appear. "Usually, the first few days after Thanksgiving aren't so busy here as we would like," said Jasmine Martinez, the store manager. "But once we get into the first and second week of December, things start picking up."
In many cities, people went to the malls in droves but were reluctant to buy more than decorations for the home.
"I spent a great deal of time in the Menlo Park mall," near Edison, N.J., said Kurt Barnard, editor of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an industry newsletter. "And it seems things are off to a slow start. I find a lot of stores have big signs that have 30 percent off in the window and not a customer in the store. The parking lots are packed 10 deep and very few shopping bags."
Indeed, many shoppers said the day after Thanksgiving was the time to look, but not necessarily to buy.
"I came knowing I do not expect to buy," said Debbie Pielech, 41, a teacher from Winchester, Mass., who went to the Fox Run Mall in Newington, N.H. "With Christmas shopping, there's a process you go through before you get what you want. Or have to, because of the time."
Stores that have been popular all year seemed to be continuing their good run. Old Navy, that mecca of low-priced clothes, saw its outlets packed.
At the Timberland store in Manhattan, there was a lot of Merry-Christmas-to-me going on, in sales of the shoes that have been popular among hearty hikers and trendy teen-agers both. "I am buying boots for myself," said Carmen Brun, a hotel manager. "I do my shopping for everyone else the week before Christmas."
And it seemed that early shoppers got the best bargains.
Wanda Dowden, a home health nurse in Fred, Tex., got up at 4:30 to go to the Parkdale Mall 100 miles east of Houston. By noon she was in good shape. She had secured a 13-inch television set for her husband and a seat pad for his pickup truck, a set of screwdrivers, an electronic fishing game and a measuring tape.
Nan Northcut, who was visiting Manhattan from Nashville with her family, said, "I shop early because I would rather not do it when things are crowded." Her husband, Joseph, heavy with bags from T. J. Maxx and Old Navy, assessed his position: "I'm just the holder."
At the Oak Court Mall in Memphis, Carol Boker, 52, a freelance writer, said that yesterday might have been too late to begin looking for the best buys.
"In the past, there have been better bargains on the day after Thanksgiving," she said. "But this year, the department stores have had more sales earlier and are not waiting until today to start. So I think I found better stuff earlier."
Stores encouraged this sort of early bargain snooping. Garden Ridge, a chain of housewares superstores, opened at noon on Thanksgiving and will stay open until 10 P.M. on Sunday. Sears, Roebuck & Company offered $500 gift certificates to some customers who managed to show up at its stores between 7 and 10 yesterday morning.
Early shopping is a family tradition with Joyce Farrish, 55, a bookkeeper at an elementary school in suburban Memphis. Every year, she and several relatives get together at 6:30 A.M. on Black Friday, put on matching sweatshirts made the day before and hit the malls. This year, they had also gone in for a little hair frosting for the occasion.
"We get there when the doors open at 7," Ms. Farrish said during yesterday's adventure. "We will shop until about 6 or 7 at night. The children stay with their dads all day, and the men are supposed to decorate the houses for Christmas while we are away.
"We try to get the early bird specials," she added. "But this year it seems like the sales aren't as good. There aren't as many bargains."
In fact, many shoppers said they were finding fewer deals than last year. But when they did, business tended to be brisk.
At the Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, for example, the fur salon was empty on one side (nothing on sale), and buzzing on the other (40 percent off). In the Giorgio Armani shop, suits on sale drew the curious while the full-priced clothes were jilted.
With shopping today and tomorrow still to go, retail executives have a lot more nail-biting ahead. Much will be revealed next Thursday, when retailers report same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, for November.
Whatever those numbers show, shoppers like Vera Morris, 72, who lives in Chicago and was visiting New York, will keep retailers on edge until Christmas morning.
"I am like everyone else," said Miss Morris, who sat in the career clothing section of Bloomingdale's, weighted down with relatives' coats. "I start the day after Thanksgiving and finish the day before Christmas. That's how it is."

Chart/Photos: "Season Of Hope"
After two holiday shopping seasons with relatively flat sales growth, after adjusting for inflation, retailers opened their doors yesterday with fingers crossed. This year, analysts are predicting that holiday sales will grow about 4 percent from last year to $162 billion. Above are yearly sales for Thanksgiving through year-end at general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other retail stores, in 1996 dollars.

Dressing Down Rudy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Marion Barry thinks Rudolph Giuliani is at "the bottom of the barrel."
The very lax Mayor of Washington is outraged at the very strict Mayor of New York. He is writing a letter to Mr. Giuliani, who hosted "Saturday Night Live" last week, complaining about the New Yorker's appearance in a skit mocking Mr. Barry as a drug-addled hustler. 
"I think the part about me and Giuliani was just despicable, the implication had to do with drugs, the person playing me was rubbing his nose," the D.C. Mayor said last night, calling from his limo phone, on his way to see "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." He said he would not have minded if he had been spoofed for a governmental action, rather than a personal attack.
"As a fellow mayor, he participated in extreme character assassination," said Mr. Barry, who spent six months in jail in 1990 after getting caught on tape smoking crack cocaine in a Washington hotel. "I've been clean over seven and a half years and I've been an inspiration to a lot of the recovering community. There have been no allegations -- even from my enemies -- since 1990. When they gave Giuliani those lines, he should have just refused to say them. It was the bottom of the barrel."
Mayor Barry also complained that "there were racial overtones. The guy had a beeper, trying to sell a bicycle. They would not have done a white mayor -- a famous white person -- that way. They low-downed it." He has talked to lawyers about a defamation suit against NBC and has demanded a public apology.
The skit, in the segment called "The Joe Pesci Show," featured the comic Jim Breuer playing Pesci as a psychotic talk show host who whacks "disrespecting" guests with a bat.
The Pesci show welcomed Mayor Giuliani, playing himself, and Mayor Barry, played by Tracy Morgan in gray suit and kinte cloth.
When the Barry character said he was the mayor of "this great nation's capital, Atlanta," and dozed off, the Pesci character sneered, "This is a mayor. This is a mayor on drugs." The Barry character tried to raise cash by selling a dozen D.C. garbage trucks -- lowering the price from $50,000 to $5 -- and a bicycle to "my man, Rudy." Then, as Mr. Giuliani looked on, the Pesci character bludgeoned the D.C. mayor, saying "the crime rate just went down."
Cristyne Lategano, Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, said that Mr. Barry should "lighten up." You know you're in trouble when Rudy Giuliani wants you to lighten up.
Mayor Barry has not been getting much respect lately. Stripped of almost all his power by the financial control board, he has been complaining about "the rape of democracy." That rape included the loss of his $625,000 skybox at the new MCI sports center, yanked by the control board chairman, Andrew Brimmer.
"That's a little drop of water in the ocean," the Mayor says, dismissing the lost skybox.
Much to the dismay of human rights groups, he even complained about the lack of democracy in Washington at a conference of mayors in Nigeria, which is run by a murderous military government that paid for the Mayor's trip.
"Any country with a military dictatorship, you know there'll be contention about it," he says.
Compared with Mr. Barry's unenlightened democracy, Mr. Giuliani's enlightened despotism does look tempting. While it may be the best of times at one end of the shuttle, it is the worst of times at the other.
Every time I fly up, New York is preening over some new sugarplum, surplus millions, dropping crime, bristling economy.
Every time I come home, Washington is getting bailed out by the Federal Government and roiling with some ludicrous new scandal. The schools are literally falling down. The drinking water is periodically contaminated. Two-thirds of D.C. homicides are unsolved. The latest corruption scandal claimed the police chief.
So you have to ask yourself: Better a guy who plays the fool on "Saturday Night Live" than on "Nightline"? With "Nightline" cameras rolling on him last August, Mayor Barry bizarrely raced down a one-way street, sirens wailing, to keep a tennis date.
Better a mayor in drag than a drag? Better a geeky control freak who is at the scene of every crisis than a cheeky good-time guy who can never be found in a crisis? Better a mayor who cracks down on crime than a mayor whose crime was crack?

HEADLINE: Miami Lends Good Name, And Bad, to Needy Region

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 28

 BODY:
When residents of Dade County voted this month to rename their county Miami-Dade, they acquiesced to arguments by public officials that they should bank on the "magic" of the name Miami to attract more business.
But Miami, the signature city among the 30 in the county, is short on magic right now. 
 While outsiders conjure images of tourism, trade and culture wrapped in international glitz, locals are reeling from high taxes, fiscal mismanagement and government corruption. Where visitors see cosmopolitanism, residents grapple with ethnic voting and intensely personal politics in a mayoral election that has taken a decidedly surreal turn.
This winter, as usual, millions of snowbirds are flocking to Miami the major tourist destination to bask in the sun. But in Miami the hometown, the winter wonderland is under the cloud of a series of scandals that, taken together, are unlike anything this city has seen.
Miami has enjoyed its raucous reputation over the years, but now many civic leaders fear that the city has gone too far, hurting efforts to woo the new business and investment the area needs. Some studies have reported that the number of multinational corporations moving to Miami-Dade is shrinking and that companies are taking jobs to South Florida urban areas deemed more desirable, like Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale and its suburbs, partly because of concerns about crime and corruption.
The city's latest woes stem from the twists in the recent mayoral election, in which a former Mayor, Xavier L. Suarez, defeated the incumbent, Joe Carollo, in a runoff.
Or so it seems. Criminal investigators are looking into possible absentee ballot fraud in the election that preceded the runoff, including voting by the dead. Mr. Carollo is suing and hopes for a new election. And an investigation by the state's attorney's office into possible violations of the city charter by the new Mayor could result in his removal.
Add to that the landslide re-election of a city commissioner with Teflon qualities who was appointed by Mr. Suarez to preside over the City Commission, despite his pending trial on Federal charges of mortgage fraud and money laundering.
The latest scandals come on the heels of a Federal corruption investigation last year that led to the imprisonment of the city manager and a commissioner; a projected $68 million deficit was subsequently discovered. That financial crisis caused the city's credit rating to sink below investment grade, where it remains, and resulted in the appointment of a state oversight board with the power to approve spending.
This, at a time when the area longs for an image of stability to lure companies here so that jobs keep pace with population.
"We can no longer continue to believe our own press releases," said Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and Labor Program at the North-South Center at the University of Miami. "We're like a fading beauty queen that keeps telling everyone I was this or I was that."
Alex Penelas, Mayor of Miami-Dade County, is trying to tackle the unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, which is well above the national rate. "All that doesn't help," he said.
Miami, the city, is only part of the bigger area the world best identifies with the brand name: the newly named county, with more than two million residents, half of them Hispanic, and cities like Miami Beach, Coral Gables and Key Biscayne.
Miami has about 360,000 residents and is the fourth poorest major city in the United States. Many immigrants have made it a first stop -- the 1990 census found it had the highest percentage of foreign-born residents of any American city -- and whites and upwardly mobile black and Hispanic Miamians have fled. It is left with a tax base insufficient to meet services, despite high property taxes, a problem worsened by a shrinking of the downtown real estate market.
Miami's political problems are viewed by some business and academic leaders as the growing pains of a city that began to boom only about 30 years ago. Some Miamians note that the same political chicanery and unwavering ethnic loyalties can be found throughout history in neighboring communities like Miami Beach and Hialeah and bigger cities like Chicago and New York.
"It's just as American as apple pie and handguns," said Howard Kleinberg, a South Florida historian. "Miami gets the publicity because we somehow manage to do it in comic opera."
Tom Fiedler, political editor of The Miami Herald, said Miami was typical of new-immigrant cities, where elections are often driven by personality rather than issues, and the tendency for factions is to win at all costs, enjoy the spoils of war and "rationalize unacceptable behavior," like voter fraud. In this case, with two Cuban-Americans facing each other in the mayoral race, the political war was waged almost entirely in Spanish-speaking Miami. In the runoff, Hispanic voters cast two-thirds of the ballots but made up only half of the registered voters.
Other analysts explain Miami's troubles as a symptom of a frontier mentality where anything goes and where counterbalancing forces like civic pride are still developing.
"We have to keep the unfortunate corruption and political shenanigans we've seen in perspective," said Robert G. Beatty, general counsel for the utility Bellsouth Florida and a member of both the state oversight board and a local economic development organization.
"These issues must be viewed in a time context out of which we will evolve," Mr. Beatty said.
But the turmoil at Miami City Hall does not help the packaging of Miami as a growing center of international commerce, as "the crossroads of the Americas" and "forefront of the future," as President Clinton has called it.
While officials like Mr. Penelas try to promote the booming airport and seaport, the diverse work force and an infrastructure "well-suited to the international business person," news reports focus on the criminal investigation of the absentee voting that helped Mr. Suarez, who served as Miami Mayor from 1985 to 1993, win.
Mr. Carollo, after dominating at the polls but trailing in absentee ballots, was short a 50 percent-plus-one majority in the first election by only 155 votes. He asked a judge to throw out the absentee ballots and declare him the winner, a request that awaits a hearing. That has not stopped Mr. Suarez from taking over with a vengeance, dismissing and demanding resignations of administrators and predicting he would restore the city's credit rating and lower city taxes by 18 percent by selling city property and cutting staff.
But Mr. Suarez now faces an inquiry by the state's attorney's office, which is questioning whether he exceeded his authority in removing top administrators like the city manager. If violations to the city charter are found, Mr. Suarez could face criminal sanctions and his removal from office. And he has caused nervousness in some quarters by pledging to work to get rid of the state oversight board, which Governor Lawton Chiles has said he has no plans to dissolve until Miami is on sound financial footing.
After winning the runoff by riding the coattails of Humberto Hernandez, the indicted Cuban-American commissioner whose boyish looks have made him the darling of older Cuban immigrants, Mr. Suarez raised eyebrows by appointing him to preside on the City Commission.
"Hernandez is my best legislator in the sense that he has the same philosophy that I do," Mr. Suarez said in an interview last week.
What is not in question is that Miami can ill afford more bad government, urban affairs experts say, and that it finds itself at a critical juncture to regain some of its past glory. While there has been significant progress on the financial front over the last year -- the city registered a $13 million surplus this year -- a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed the delivery of basic municipal services said in a report released this week that "the city remains in grave administrative distress."
Miami residents, who defeated an effort to abolish the city and merge it with the county in a referendum earlier this year, are watching events unfold with a mixture of cynicism and hope for better times.
"All we can do is wait and see," said Allyson Warren, 45, who works as a paralegal and voted for Mr. Suarez's opponent. "I'd like to see him do a good job for the sake of all of us."
Mr. Suarez, meanwhile, promises to put Miami on the path to becoming "the most exciting global city in the United States."
"Miami is the teen-ager that is emerging and all of a sudden had a big pimple," he said. "This particular pimple is pretty easy to cure. That teen-ager is going to be a beauty queen, a Michael Jordan, a Bill Gates."

HEADLINE: 'Buy Nothings' Discover a Cure for Affluenza

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
News flash: Dozens of people did not shop today.
And not only did those people pointedly refrain from buying anything themselves, but they also dared to challenge publicly the very institution of the Christmastime consumption season on this, the day it traditionally begins. 
 To the tune of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" they caroled, "Uh oh, we're in the red, dear." They passed out "gift exemption certificates." And they suggested sweetly to shoppers that they spend their time with loved ones or resting instead of herding automatically to the stores.
From Vermont to Seattle, these shopping-mall subversives advocated a new designation for the Friday after Thanksgiving: Buy Nothing Day.
Well, maybe Buy Nothing Day activities did not stretch all the way from Vermont to Seattle in one great anticonsumerist wave. In fact, the Buy Nothing Day action was largely limited to utopian-tinted places like Vermont and Seattle -- and the handfuls of quixotic counterpropagandists were outnumbered nationwide perhaps one million to one by glassy-eyed shoppers.
But there were signs that six years after it was originated by the Media Foundation, a group based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is bent on fighting consumer culture, Buy Nothing Day was starting to take on a life of its own, and a certain momentum.
"All I know is that there are these spontaneous outbursts of street theater, of mall invasions, of pranks and shenanigans of all kinds," said Kalle Lasn, director of the Media Foundation. "And this is nothing we're pushing heavily; it's just happening spontaneously."
There were scattered reports today of Buy Nothing Day posters, which could be downloaded from the Media Foundation's Web site, (http://www.adbusters.org) cropping up on college campuses around the country, and of related events, from seminars to singalongs, in a dozen spots, Mr. Lasn said. Anti-consumers in more than a dozen other countries put on similar events, he said.
In Vermont, Chapin Spencer, a part-time carpenter, said he had not heard of Buy Nothing Day until he recently saw a public television program about "affluenza," the spiritual and environmental ills brought on by American-style overconsumption.
Then Mr. Spencer and a friend who is a college professor quickly cobbled together a group in the Burlington area that drafted a couple dozen people, Quakers, college students and others, to staff tables outside stores. Braving the slush today, they passed out about 600 "gift of time" certificates that offered the recipient a block of the giver's time instead of a material gift, he said.
At the Church Street Marketplace in downtown Burlington, merchants concerned that the protest would hurt their sales asked the Buy Nothing demonstrators to move from their entrances to a vacant Woolworth's storefront, which they did. But in general, there was little negative reaction, Mr. Spencer said.
"The message is a positive one, not a confrontational one," Mr. Spencer said. "We're not telling people we shouldn't buy what we need, but we need to look at what we're buying and what the effect of that is personally, socially and environmentally."
In downtown Seattle, where "Buy Nothing" activities were held at the Westlake Mall, an ad-hoc singing group calling itself "The Frugalettes" crooned satirical carols with lyrics like "Big business has been telling us what Christmas means today" and "shopping like Santa's zombies." Their version of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" began, "Slow down, you frantic shoppers, for there's something we must say."
Some Buy Nothing advocates passed out checklists to help shoppers buy more consciously; they included questions like "Do I need it?", "How many do I already have?" and "Can I do without it?" And others dispensed advice from a booth much like the one Lucy occupied in the comic strip Peanuts, under a sign reading "The affluenza doctor is in."
"We can take control of how we celebrate this holiday," said Vicki Robin, co-author of "Your Money or Your Life," a bible of the "Voluntary Simplicity" movement, which advocates consuming less.
"If you weigh the amount of press for Buy Nothing Day against the wad of ads that came in yesterday's paper, it's no contest," said Ms. Robin, who lives in Seattle. "But ideas planted on Buy Nothing Day can make a difference in people's lives."
It was Ms. Robin who suggested to the Media Foundation that it move Buy Nothing Day from its original date in September to the day after Thanksgiving, which it did last year, Mr. Lasn said. Since then, it has taken off, he said.
Among passers-by who stopped to take in the Buy Nothing tableaux in Burlington and Seattle, virtually none had ever heard of the holiday-in-the-making. While a few grumbled at it, most caught its gist quickly and seemed to agree.
"Ads just try to get you on a guilt trip to come in and start running up your credit card," said Paul Byron Crane, 46, an environmental planner in Seattle.
Opponents complained that Buy Nothing Day was a guilt-inducer as well, and that retailers provide the economy millions of jobs and billions of dollars in income.
"It doesn't make any sense," said Allen Parker, a 39-year-old dishwasher in Burlington. "People should be able to buy whatever they want without being made to feel guilty about it. To do for others, you have to spend money."
Still, many would like to spend less. The Center for a New American Dream, a group in Burlington that advocates "sustainable consumption," recently commissioned a survey that found that most Americans would welcome lower spending and less emphasis on gifts during the holidays.
The survey, conducted last month, found that 15 percent of its 800 respondents were still paying off their 1996 holiday bills.

Chart: "Checklist for Shopping"
The Buy Nothing Day campaign in Seattle distributed this checklist to let shoppers evaluate things they were thinking of buying.
 
Do I need it?
 
How many do I already have?
 
How much will I use it?
 
How long will it last?
 
Could I borrow it from a friend or family member?
 
Can I do without it?
 
Am I able to clean, lubricate and/or maintain it myself?

Am I willing to?
 
Will I be able to repair it?
 
Have I researched it to get the best quality for the best price?
 
How will I dispose of it when I'm done using it?
 
Are the resources that went into it renewable or nonrenewable?
 
Is it made of recycled materials, and is it recyclable.
 
Is there anything that I already own that I could substitute for it?

HEADLINE: Buoyed by Japan Gains, Dow Rises 28.35

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher in a shortened session yesterday, bolstered by three days of gains in Japanese stocks.
Expectations that Japan will use public money to right its financial system eased concern that the failure of banks and securities firms in the world's second-largest economy will cut into United States corporate profit growth, investors said. 
 "The focus of the U.S. equity market is on Japan," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Zurich Kemper Investments, which oversees $80 billion. "The market has snapped back from its overreaction to what potentially could happen to corporate profits."
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 leading issues rose 33.06 points yesterday, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 16,636.26. Japanese stocks rose 3.5 percent on Thursday and 1.1 percent on Wednesday.
Stocks in South Korea, however, continued to slide. The market's main index tumbled more than 5 percent early today, falling below 400 points for the first time since 1987. Stocks recovered to end the half-day Saturday session down 4.05 points, or 1 percent, at 407.86.
Still, it was the seventh consecutive decline as investors dumped shares on fears that more companies might go bankrupt. Yesterday, the index fell 4.9 percent.
Other Asian markets slumped yesterday. Hong Kong's benchmark stock index slipped 56.18 points, or half of 1 percent, to 10,526.92.
Thai stocks fell as investors fretted that about deepening corporate losses after Moody's Investors Service cut Thailand's credit rating, making it harder and more expensive for Thai companies to get foreign loans. Thailand's benchmark index fell 3.96 points, or 1 percent, to 395.47, the lowest level since Jan. 4, 1988.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.35 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 7,823.13, led by Travelers Group, which yesterday completed its $9 billion acquisition of Salomon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also gained four-tenths of 1 percent, rising 3.76 points, to 955.40, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.05 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,600.55.
The stock market was closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving, and trading yesterday ended at 1 P.M., Eastern time, three hours earlier than usual.
Computer-related stocks, which saw some of the worst losses in the last month, were among yesterday's most active stocks.
Compaq Computer gained 5/8, to 62 7/16, and Dell Computer rose 5/16, to 84 3/16. Lucianne Painter, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, reiterated her "buy" recommendation on Compaq, with a 12-month target of $100.
The networking equipment maker 3Com gained 1, to 36, and the semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials rose 13/16, to 33.
ACC jumped 2 1/2, to 46 3/4, after the long-distance and local telephone company agreed to be acquired by Teleport Communications Group for $50 a share. Tel-Save Holdings also had bid for ACC. Teleport fell 1 1/2, to 49, and Tel-Save gained 1/8, to 21 5/8.
Telephone shares rallied for a third day. Bell Atlantic was up 15/16, to a new high of 89 1/4, and Ameritech gained 11/16, to 77 1/16. Investors are attracted by the stable earnings of the phone companies and their relatively fat dividends.
Also, more mergers may lie ahead for telephone companies. GTE rose 11/16, to 50 9/16, after USA Today reported the company was in talks to be acquired by British Telecommunications. Both companies failed in recent bids to buy MCI Communications. British Telecom's American depository receipts fell 1/2, to 78.
Travelers rose 1 5/8, to 50 7/8. The purchase of Salomon, the world's biggest bond trader, makes the new Salomon Smith Barney the second-largest securities firm.

Asia's Regional Pollution Becomes Global Problem
The smoke from Indonesian forest fires that fouled the air from Thailand to the Philippines is an example of public obliviousness to the health risks of growing pollution and the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of Asia's waste. A1 

Indian Government Resigns
India's fourth Government in 18 months resigned, deepening the political chaos and economic uncertainty that have overtaken the country since a 1996 election produced a fractured Parliament and minimal political leadership. Prime Minister I.K. Gujral resigned after such pandemonium in Parliament that the speaker, fearing violence, adjourned the session indefinitely. A1
 
End to Fox Hunting, Maybe
After a boisterous debate, the British Parliament voted for a proposal that could one day ban the traditional British sport of fox hunting. The proposal passed by a wide margin, but will not become law because it was not given the required time for parliamentary debate and committee review and must await a place in the legislative calendar.

U.N. to Increase Haiti Force
The United Nations Security Council voted to extend the mission of a multinational police monitoring force in Haiti for a year. The move reaffirms the United Nations' commitment even as it removes the last of its peacekeeping troops. A3
 
Pakistanis Storm Court
In Pakistan, supporters of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif climbed over iron gates and stormed the Supreme Court building, forcing the court to suspend contempt proceedings against the Prime Minister. The melee deepened the country's political crisis, which began earlier this month when Mr. Sharif criticized the high court, a crime in Pakistan. If found guilty of contempt, Mr. Sharif can be removed from office. A6
 
Congo Mission Will Proceed
Despite his threats to withdraw a team of human rights investigators because of Congo's obstruction, the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has decided to go ahead with an inquiry into allegations that Rwandan refugees in Congo were massacred. After meetings between team leaders and Congo Government officials, Mr. Annan wrote President Laurent Kabila informing him that the team would proceed with its mission. (Reuters)
 
Iraq Bars Inspectors
Though the standoff over Iraq's secret arsenal was supposed to have ended, Iraq is still barring United Nations inspectors from its presidential palaces, military bases and intelligence headquarters. The sites, which could hide armaments, tons of poisons and weapons research, may be the last stronghold of President Saddam Hussein's power to terrorize his enemies. In response, the United States has threatened tighter sanctions or stronger measures. A4

Denver Woman Beaten In Latest Skinhead Attack
Five skinheads were charged with beating a 26-year-old black woman who had stopped at a 7-Eleven convenience store to buy nachos on Thanksgiving Day in Denver. The attack is the city's most recent in three weeks of skinhead violence, which has left one policeman dead, one African immigrant dead, one skinhead dead by suicide, and one witness paralyzed by a skinhead's bullet.

Berrigan's Crusade Endures
Anti-nuclear activist Philip Berrigan is serving time in prison, again, for damaging weapons of war and staining them with his own blood. He is aware that he appears frozen in time, acknowledging in a recent public letter that even sympathizers would say his peace group, Plowshares, "looks ridiculous now . . . ignored by Government and media, the public no longer listening." Yet Mr. Berrigan, a Catholic priest, sees it as a requirement of his faith, he said in the visiting room of the Maine Correctional Center recently, to "confront the institutions of injustice" by fighting nuclear weapons and demanding a shift in spending from defense to social needs. A1
 
A Few Americans Buy Nothing
Buy Nothing Day, a pointed response to the annual consumerism of the Friday after Thanksgiving, has been very slowly spreading since it was launched by the Media Foundation, a group based in Vancouver, British Columbia, six years ago. There were scattered reports this year of Buy Nothing Day posters, which could be downloaded from the Media Foundation's website, cropping up on college campuses around the country, and of related events, from seminars to sing-alongs, in a dozen spots.

F.B.I. Presents Bomb Evidence
Prosecutors in the Oklahoma City bombing trial showed jurors a small piece of wood they said was important evidence linking the defendant, Terry L. Nichols, to the 1995 blast that killed 168 people.

Fur Protests Commence
Anti-fur demonstrators kicked off a month of events aimed at retailers during the holiday buying season by occupying a crane overlooking Macy's and Union Square in San Francisco.

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he had directed top aides and police officials to investigate whether tighter regulations should be applied to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, after an accident in which a six-story-high balloon knocked down part of a lamppost, injuring four spectators, one of whom remained in critical condition at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

Times Square Sidewalks Full
City officials and business people say the surging popularity of Times Square as a tourist destination has brought its always busy sidewalks to the brink of gridlock. The city and a local business group are looking for ways to ease the congestion. The main problem is the sheer volume of workers, shoppers, theatergoers and tourists. A study done for the Times Square Business Improvement District counted up to 7,000 pedestrians an hour passing a given point at peak periods. B1

Accounting Merger Nears
The partners at Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, two of the world's largest accounting firms, have voted overwhelmingly to merge their practices into one. The merger, however, must still be approved by the Department of Justice, which is now looking at whether four or five major accounting firms are enough to audit the books of the nation's public companies. And the firms are still on the prowl for a name for the combined entity. A similar merger has been proposed by two other major accounting firms -- Ernst & Young and KPMG Peat Marwick. D2

HEADLINE: Fitting the Lord Into Work's Tight Schedules

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
It is Wednesday, and Louis Tuchman's appointment book is packed, as usual. At 9:45 A.M., he huddles with a fellow lawyer to fine-tune two major real estate deals. At noon, he skips lunch to return phone calls and sign documents. But at 12:30 P.M., Mr. Tuchman steps into his firm's boardroom on the 14th floor of the Chrysler Building for what he calls the most important meeting of all.
The weekly Torah class. 
 Mr. Tuchman is part of a wave of thousands of professionals who, pressed for time and afraid they have neglected their faith, are organizing religion classes in hundreds of companies across the nation. From Bible study lunches at Northrop Grumman to noon Torah classes at Microsoft and Islamic study groups at Intel, these classes are proliferating at what religious scholars say is a breathtaking pace.
"People are rediscovering religion in their own terms," said Max L. Stackhouse, professor of Christian ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary. "This is happening all over the place, and it's increasing like mad."
Indeed, church attendance has been flat for decades, but other signs of an interest in religion are rising: sales of religious books, music and even clothing are increasing, religious retreats are overbooked and thousands are turning out for Promise Keepers, the Christian men's movement. In all, there is a sense that people are not only embracing religion in different ways, but also have become more comfortable in the public expression of their faith. With that, the barriers separating work and religion are crumbling.
"The taboo against using the 'r' word has been broken in corporate America," said Laura Nash, who teaches business ethics, corporate culture and religion at Boston University. "There's more of a confessional tone among employees, the whole Oprah stuff."
So not only is there Koran study for Boeing workers in California during the workday, but Torah and Bible study classes as well. And the same is happening at Lucent Technologies in New Jersey. And while companies seldom sponsor the classes, executives are granting permission and often allow them to be held in company conference rooms.
Levent Akbarut, an engineering manager at a Boeing plant in Long Beach, Calif., attends the weekly Muslim prayer and Koran study sessions on Fridays at noon in a conference room ordinarily used for engineering presentations and meetings with suppliers. He also attends monthly lunch meetings to discuss topics such as what Islam says about modern finances, diet and dress codes.
"Before, I had to spend two and a half hours out of my day to go to the mosque and pray," Mr. Akbarut said. "Now, we schedule it like any other business meeting."
Not all employers are comfortable with the classes. Officials at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., a Government organization, temporarily suspended a Torah class last year, concerned that the separation of church and state was not being observed.
And in August, the White House, concerned about several complaints from Federal employees who said they were harassed at work because of their religious beliefs, issued guidelines protecting religious expression in the Federal workplace. Torah classes already exist on Capitol Hill (organized by Congressional aides) and at the National Institutes of Health (organized by doctors).
No comprehensive surveys have been taken to document the growth in Jewish study classes, which attract anywhere from three to three dozen people. But Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a spokesman for the Chabad Lubavitch movement, one of the earliest and most active groups in the field, said Chabad emissaries alone conducted about 60 such classes in New York City and 720 around the country.
Rabbi Krinsky estimated there may be 250 Jewish study classes in New York City and perhaps 1,200 around the country led by rabbis from groups like Chabad Lubavitch, Aish Hatorah, Ohr Somayach International and others. By contrast, he said, in 1985 there were about 90 classes -- in the entire country.
There are also no surveys of the number of Muslim classes, said Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, a nonprofit educational organization in Los Angeles. But Mr. Al-Marayati estimated that the number had grown from "a handful" 10 years ago to "maybe a couple of hundred today."
For Christian classes, Don Kline, vice president of field ministries with Fellowship of Companies for Christ International, estimated that there were up to 10,000 Christian study classes in the workplace around the country, double the number of 10 years ago.
Two years ago, Tom Foth, principal engineer at General Signal Networks, a telecommunications and computer networking company in Shelton, Conn., said he and several of his colleagues felt that eating lunch was not the best way to use their increasingly precious time. So they organized a Bible study class, borrowing a conference room with the consent of the company. And now, a group of five to six engineers -- including a Pentecostalist, an Episcopalian, a Catholic and a Lutheran -- meets twice a week at noon for Bible study class.
At Bell Atlantic, Lionel Harvey, a manager in the circuit management department, organized a Bible study class in his Manhattan office six years ago. At first, a half-dozen people attended; now, up to 34 people show up to study and pray on Mondays and Wednesdays at noon.
"Crisis situations tend to draw people to faith," said Mr. Harvey. "So people look forward to the class with great anticipation because of the business of the day and the vicissitudes of life."
In general, the Jewish classes differ from Christian sessions because they focus less on liturgy and faith and more on ethics, law and philosophy, all based on the Torah, the Talmud and even the writings of Maimonides, some of the most important texts in Judaism. The classes resemble college seminars, open to men and women of all backgrounds, whether they are Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or even non-Jewish. The classes usually last an hour. Lunch is sometimes catered. Yarmulkes are optional.
"If you simply schedule classes in the evenings, nobody has time, because people want to try to remember what their children look like," said Rabbi Pinchas Kasnett of Ohr Somayach International, a Jewish educational organization. "So we said to people, 'We'll just get you in your office and we'll do it right there.' "
At a recent class at the Tenzer Greenblatt law firm in Manhattan, for example, Rabbi Yaacov Haber of the Orthodox Union, the umbrella organization for about 1,000 Orthodox synagogues, talked about the High Holy Days and the story of King Menasheh in the Talmud. The king, Rabbi Haber said, was a dictator who, upon suffering tremendous pain late in life, asked God for forgiveness, but only if he was healed. And God accepted that conditional repentance, despite the objections of the angels, who called God a "softie," Rabbi Haber said.
"The bad, with repentance, can be transformed into something good," Rabbi Haber explained to an enraptured group of about 12 people. "As a businessman would say, 'Every problem is an opportunity.' "
Afterward, Mr. Tuchman, a tax lawyer at the firm, described the class as "a shot of caffeine."
"I'm grateful that the rabbi can come, because otherwise I wouldn't be able to do this," said Mr. Tuchman, 37, a father of four, adding that on a good day, he returns to his home in Queens by 10 P.M.
Thinking about the convenience of having an office delivery, Russell Roberts said, "It's not much different from Domino's Pizza." Mr. Roberts, director of the Management Center at the Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis, said, "It's just one more way people can economize their time."
On the other side of the country on Wednesday, in Redmond, Wash., a noontime class was held at the Microsoft Corporation. There, Rabbi Mordechai Farkash, director of Chabad Eastside Torah Center in Bellevue, Wash., presided over a class of 10 engineers and programmers in a windowless conference room equipped with a television and a VCR. There, students not only listened to the rabbi, they also used their laptops to search the Internet for more information.
"A lot of the Torah is cross-referenced," said Gershon Parent, a software design engineer who organized the class three years ago. "It just begs to be hyperlinked."
The middle- and upper-middle-class professionals respond to the classes because they fill a spiritual void created by years of secular, career-driven focus, said Rabbi Yitzchak Rosenbaum, program director of the National Jewish Outreach Program.
In fact, some institutions have become quite comfortable with the routine of the religion classes. When Jay Knopf, vice president of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, a Wall Street brokerage firm, invited a visitor to attend a recent afternoon class at the American Stock Exchange with options traders wearing their blue smock-like traders' jackets, he offered these instructions:
"Once you get there, walk inside and check in with the guard; his name is Dave," he said. "Just say, 'I'm here to see the rabbi,' and he'll send you right up."

By one estimate, there are about 1,200 such Jewish groups in the country, up from about 90 in 1985. Lionel Harvey leading the Christian group at Bell Atlantic in a prayer as the meeting started. "Crisis situations tend to draw people to faith," he said. Six years ago, he started with 6 people; as many as 34 now attend. (Photographs by Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times)(pg. B4)

Gain in Japan Stocks Helps Bolster Wall Street
Stocks rose yesterday in the United States, helped by the third straight advance in the battered Japanese stock market, where fear of more financial failures abated somewhat. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average ended 28.35 points higher to close at 7,794.78, narrowing its weekly loss to 57.94 points. Broader market indicators also gained in holiday-shortened trading hours. But other Asian markets slumped. South Korea's market fell 1 percent early today after falling 4.9 percent yesterday. Page D2.
 
The dollar rose against the yen on resilient concern about Japan's weak economy and financial system, despite the eased atmosphere of crisis. D4.
 
Earnings and Spending Show Gains
The Government reported stronger-than-expected increases in October personal income and personal spending, reflecting the economy's vibrancy and the increased affluence of American consumers. The data also provided statistical cheer for American merchants, coinciding with the traditional first day of the holiday selling season. D3.
 
Bonds were little changed on the strong economic numbers. Although the gains in income and spending suggested the possibility of higher inflation, forecasters asserted that the longer-term trend was for an economic slowdown. D2.
 
Vote for Accounting Merger
Partners at Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, two of the world's largest accounting firms, have voted overwhelmingly to merge. The deal still requires the approval of the Justice Department. D2.

Total Takeover for Vendome
Cie. Financiere Richemont, which owns 70 percent of Vendome Luxury Group, will buy the rest for $1.73 billion, strengthening its hold on the group's global luxury brands like Cartier jewelry and Montblanc pens. D14.

Canadian Real Estate Deal
Oxford Properties Group of Toronto will acquire the Canadian real estate company Burcon Properties Ltd. for $428 million (United States). Burcon owns a majority stake in Oxford, which owns and manages commercial real estate. D3.
 
Fox Buys Children's Show
"The Magic School Bus," an animated children's program on science, is leaving public television for the Fox network. Fox needs educational programs to comply with new Federal regulations. B17.
 
India in Ford's Headlights
Ford said it would make India a base for exports worldwide and would introduce new models there despite a slowdown in India's economy. Ford also said it was optimistic about Asia's condition over all. D2.
 
Finding Religion, Again
Fearing they have neglected their faith, thousands of time-starved professionals are organizing religion classes in hundreds of companies. From Bible study lunches at Northrop Grumman to Torah classes at Microsoft to Koran study groups at Intel, such classes are proliferating. A1.
 
Bingo Battles Back
Bingo, the anchor of charity fund-raisers hurt by an onslaught of legalized gambling, is making a comeback with the aid of modern electronics. Thousands of grandmothers across the country have been dragged into the high-tech age via the use of small computers that enable them to increase their chances of winning at bingo. A1.
 
Some Markets Closed
Commodity exchanges in New York were closed yesterday. Commodity exchanges in Chicago, the stock market and Treasury market had abbreviated hours. All United States markets were closed Thursday.

The Conquest of Cool
 Business Culture, Counterculture,
 and the Rise of Hip Consumerism.
 By Thomas Frank.

 The University of Chicago Press. $22.95.
 
Commodify Your
 Dissent
 Salvos From The Baffler.
 Edited by Thomas Frank
 and Matt Weiland.
 287 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. Paper, $15. 
 If Thomas Frank were to happen upon a young man with his hair dyed Manic Panic yellow, wearing a 70's-retro Gucci shirt and plain-front khakis from J. Crew and whiling away an afternoon in Starbucks with a copy of Details and a Sony Sports Discman cranked loud enough for a passerby to detect a song by Toad the Wet Sprocket, he would be seized with despair -- though not the kind that might seize the kid's father. Frank, who is sort of young himself (he's 32), is the editor in chief of a small zine-like journal called The Baffler and also its most influential contributor. The Baffler has published exactly nine issues since its founding in 1988, but that has been enough to establish Frank as perhaps the most provocative young cultural critic of the moment, and certainly the most malcontent.
Frank is a radical leftist, but not of the French Theory strain. Although he has been to graduate school -- "The Conquest of Cool" is a book-length essay derived largely from a dissertation he wrote at the University of Chicago -- both his thinking and his prose hark back to a time when the radical left was something more in America than conferences and seminars attended by Foucault-steeped professors. Frank has thrown off the mandarin jargon; for him it's about wealth and power, haves and have-nots, loud and simple -- it's as if he were channeling Herbert Marcuse and C. Wright Mills and Thorstein Veblen through a boom box. He's just about the last thing you'd expect to come along in these relatively sanguine times (or then, maybe not): a lonely, seething avatar of a new New Left.
What mostly has Frank in a righteous rage isn't wage stagnation or the excessive compensation of corporate executives but the conspicuous consumption of the young and hip, those "self-proclaimed subversives, few of whom have any problem with the terrifying economic-cultural order into which we are blithely stepping on the eve of the millennium," to quote from the introduction that he and his Baffler colleagues wrote to "Commodify Your Dissent," a collection of essays drawn from various issues of the journal. It's Frank's thesis that the business culture and the counterculture today are essentially one and the same thing. Corporations cleverly employ the slogans and imagery of rebellion to market their products, thereby (a) seizing a language that ever connotes "new" and "different," two key words in marketing, and (b) coaxing the young effortlessly into the capitalist order, where they will be so content with the stylishly packaged and annually updated goods signifying nonconformity they'll never so much as consider real dissent -- dissent against what Frank sees as the concentrated economic power of the "Culture Trust," those telecommunications and entertainment giants who, he believes, "fabricate the materials with which the world thinks." (What form this dissent should take, and toward what future, Frank does not spell out. He's a cynic, not a dreamer.)
To have suffered the calculated pseudotransgressions of Madonna or Calvin Klein, to have winced at the Nike commercial in which the Beatles' "Revolution" serves as a jingle, is to sense Frank is on to something. (After reading Frank, in fact, you'll have a hard time using words like "revolution" or "rebel" ever again, at least without quotation marks.) And the acuity with which he dissects the mass media's relentless questing after the next new youth subculture, and the next and the next, makes clammy-handed reading for an editor. (The Baffler reported the news of sorts several years ago that a glossary of "grunge" slang published in this newspaper's Styles of the Times section was a hoax perpetrated by a Seattle record-company employee.)
But what is Frank on to, ultimately? His assumption, largely unexamined, is that society's most banal and ephemeral pop texts -- the cannily outrageous ads, the breathless trend stories, the recycled fashions and derivative rock bands -- hold the Big Meaning. Thus he chooses to ignore the many college radio stations, "indie" record labels and pamphleteering Web zines that thrive at some remove from any "economic-cultural order," or, anyway, from Time Warner and Viacom. (In many respects, pop culture in America has never been so decentralized -- which is one way to understand the slump the mainstream record business is in.)
This polemical reductionism of Frank's reaches its apotheosis in "The Conquest of Cool," wherein he attempts to explain how the counterculture was never much of a counterculture to begin with by looking mainly at several advertising campaigns of the 60's. Nowhere in the book do you hear from hippies, war protesters, feminists, eco-freaks, Stonewall rioters or California consciousness-expanders. What you get are the strategies and reflections of those who Frank feels mattered -- the men, for example, who created the "Pepsi Generation" campaign. "The Pepsi-Cola Company wanted Americans to question the 'establishment' in the most real sense of all, to turn away from the established tastes and preferences," Frank writes. It might also have had something to do with their wanting people to drink less Coke, but that's not what Frank is talking about.
Actually, Frank is unsure of the story he's telling. Sometimes he seems to be arguing that the admen, with an eye to tapping the huge baby-boom market, sought to co-opt the counterculture with a "fake counterculture." Other times, he seems to be saying that it was more a matter of copywriters and art directors at the newer "boutique" firms valuing individual expression and seeing in the youthful nonconformist a "symbolic ally in their own struggles against the mountains of dead-weight procedure and hierarchy." Discussing at some length the "Pepsi Generation" campaign, created by BBDO, Frank first says it anticipated the youth movement; then reports that some of those closely associated with the campaign feel that they were guilty of contributing to "the divisiveness of the late 60's" and are sorry for it; then notes that in the crucial counterculture years of 1967 through 1969 Pepsi pulled its "generation" ads altogether and aimed simply to establish that the drink tasted better than Coke.
It's all too much and, at the same time, nowhere near enough. Who in the counterculture back then gave any thought at all to the cola he drank? What Frank does in his book, as in his essays, is find it convenient to conflate "counterculture" with "youth culture" -- of which the former is only a small segment. And his motive? What he really wants to get across, I think, is that the 60's counterculture was never really a movement of the radical left -- and thus no challenge to consumer capitalism.
About this, of course, he is absolutely right. In "The Conquest of Cool," the only authentic rebel who turns up is Abbie Hoffman, whose "Steal This Book" -- a Yippie handbook for surviving by theft that Hoffman wanted readers to shoplift from stores -- is, to Frank's mind, "profoundly hostile to the consumer order" but no less critical of "the softer, gentler counterculture of 1967." But few counterculture types were into Hoffman, or the New Left in general. Leaders of the New Left were more often than not the sons and daughters of Socialists and Communists, and their main battles -- waged most fiercely in their interminable meetings -- were with their parents and with one another.
The counterculture was made up mostly of trembly romantics, rock-and-roll hedonists and libertarian humanists. They felt that there were manifestations of misery and oppression that had little to do with consumerism, and they left class resentment to those who were into it, the Weathermen and George Wallace (and that paradox, I think, is telling). The hippies and student freaks and the rest didn't pull the plug on consumer capitalism. They merely altered manners and attitudes in nearly every conceivable way -- not only here but in Paris and Mexico City and Berlin and, most lyrically and deliriously, in Prague, where in 1989 the prized imported sneakers and knockoff jeans and black-market rock albums failed, somehow, to dampen the urge among youths to take the lead in toppling that economic-cultural order. Which is complicated, way more complicated than Frank allows, and also pretty cool.

Around the Block
 The Business
 of a Neighborhood.
 By Tom Shachtman.
 Illustrated. 325 pp. New York:
 Harcourt Brace & Company. $28. 
 Despite their city's sprawling scale, New Yorkers know that at its best the metropolis is a collection of neighborhoods, each defined by unique rhythms of daily life. Indeed, the recent incursion of hangar-sized megastores with towering racks of everything from clothes to food has some urbanites worrying that national chains can make their neighborhoods look and feel like suburban strip malls.
The arrival of the big stores has been felt most keenly by small business owners, as the gains and losses of the large companies that dominate the headlines reverberate in the neighborhoods. So what lies ahead in New York's economic upswing for the thousands of small businesses that have existed for years in middle-class neighborhoods?
In an attempt to answer that question, Tom Shachtman chronicled the commercial life of a single block in Chelsea, bounded by 17th and 18th Streets between Seventh and Eighth Avenues and abuzz with a wide variety of businesses, from generations-old plumbing supply companies and publishers to trendy and ever-changing restaurants and clothing stores. The result, "Around the Block: The Business of a Neighborhood," provides half an answer, at best.
Shachtman offers up several good examples of how larger trends can filter down. His most dramatic story involves a lumber dealer who despairs that he will lose his business when the bank calls in his loan. It did not matter that he had made his payments on time; the bank needs to raise cash after a souring in the real estate market has left it holding millions in uncollected loans from the city's large developers.
Shachtman makes a fair enough assumption when he says that the personal and the professional are intertwined, whether in the matter of a father fretting over handing the business to his children or of how the neighborhood's new gay population has promoted the growth of stores catering to them. The personal, as it applies to service, also gives some reason to be hopeful that small businesses will survive the onslaught of the chain stores. A neighborhood video store resists the arrival -- across the street, no less -- of the appropriately named Blockbuster Video by tailoring its selection to eclectic neighborhood tastes and having workers who are knowledgeable about more films than the usual commercial fare. But Shachtman often undercuts himself by failing to analyze his material. He talks about putting a human face on capitalism, but too often the face is obscured by a blizzard of detail that reads almost as if it had been directly transferred from his notebooks.
The human element is badly needed to help provide a social context for the economic forces at work in two crucial areas. Shachtman, who is also the author of "Skyscraper Dreams" and other books, gives us a cursory look at the neighborhood's residents, presumably the core market for its retail businesses. And while he focuses at length on the entrepreneurs, he relegates the people who work for them to the background, even though, in his chapter on ways to help neighborhoods, he recommends that employees be given a chance for ownership. The bulk of his prescriptions run along the lines of greater access to government support and encouraging creativity and education. He follows up with a brief chapter on the block's high school -- where, as might be expected, the students are stick figures.
Another issue not adequately addressed is one worrying many entrepreneurs: New York City's unending and wearying list of regulations. Another key concern of neighborhood retailers throughout the city, proposed zoning changes for large stores, became a center of debate after 1993, when Shachtman was reporting his book. But it is a dominant issue today. Keep in mind that the store closest to the block he chronicled where his book can be purchased is probably the Barnes & Noble on the Avenue of the Americas.

HEADLINE: Habitats/180 South Fourth Street, Williamsburg;
A Young Artist Finds You Can Go Home Again

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
JUDITH L. TREZZA lived with her family in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, for 20 years before moving to Manhattan as a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology. She traveled widely in Europe studying art, but she called TriBeCa and Times Square home when she returned.
So when it was suggested several months ago that the 26-year-old artist consider a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, her first reaction was: No Way. 
 "The thought of moving back to Brooklyn just made me crazy," said Ms. Trezza, who also manages a rental photography studio. "It's like going back to an old hometown after having made it in the city."
In addition, she said, many Manhattanites attach a kind of stigma to the other boroughs.
"People are like: 'A 718 area code? You live in Brooklyn?' " said Ms. Trezza -- who with a pierced tongue and yellow hair going toward neon green doesn't seem the type to worry about what others might think of her area code.
But the economic reality of space in Manhattan can be persuasive. Ms. Trezza looked at some 40 spaces in two months. She had budgeted about $2,000 a month, but her situation was complicated because she also needed studio space for her work. Her plan was to find a one-bedroom for about $1,200 or $1,300 and then rent studio space separately.
"Everything was either too expensive, too small or rundown," said Ms. Trezza. "If it was in my price range it was really rundown."
WITH loft space in TriBeCa and SoHo really out of her budget, a real estate agent suggested she consider a two-bedroom loft apartment in Brooklyn at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge. Ms. Trezza, whose two most important requirements were light and space, thought she had nothing to lose by looking at the building at 180 South Fourth Street (the main entrance is actually on South Fifth Street).
"Once I saw the space, that was it," she said. "It was flooded with light."
At $1,900 a month, it fit her pocketbook and her needs perfectly. Not only was there an extra bedroom, which she could use as an office and for visitors -- of which she has many as a result of her travels -- but the large open living area fit in nicely with her love of entertaining. Her favorite feature, however, was a closet-size room with a window, which she uses for her gilding projects. She has a degree in art history with a minor in archeology, and is working toward a degree in restoration at F.I.T.
"I've only been here a month, and my favorite place is my gilding studio," she said. "No one's allowed in there but me. I read and I listen to music and I think. It's like my little escape."
IT'S also imperative to the type of work she does. In gilding, the materials used to make the gold leaf adhere to the surface must stay at a constant warm temperature to be applied properly. A small room makes it easy to maintain that temperature.
Ms. Trezza has found her neighborhood a rich source of the old pieces of furniture and decorative items she needs to practice her art. "I need to get old pieces I can restore without them being very, very valuable," she said, noting that there were a variety of junk stores in the neighborhood with prices well below what she would find in Manhattan.
Still, Manhattan is just one subway stop away. And she frequently rides her bike to work at Studio With a View, which is on West 31st Street near the Hudson River. "It's a 30-minute ride door-to-door," she said.
While she still does much of her grocery shopping in Manhattan, she said, a number of cafes and galleries are beginning to appear in her neighborhood as it becomes more popular. "There's a lot of artists living down here," she said. "They couldn't afford Manhattan rents anymore, much like what's been happening in Dumbo," she said, referring to another artists' enclave in Brooklyn: Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.
Artists started moving to Williamsburg more than a decade ago. Jeffrey Cohen, a real estate agent with Citi Habitats who worked with Ms. Trezza, said the trend had been picking up recently as the market heated up in Manhattan.
Ms. Trezza said that the tenants in her building include a graphic artist, photographers, models and a tattoo artist. The building, which originally had 35 units, has been converted into 12 apartments, two on each floor of the six-story building.
MS. TREZZA said some of her friends still refuse to cross the river for her dinner parties and Ping-Pong games. But her 1,600 square feet has not gone unnoticed by other artist friends. One has set up a light table, and another stores photography equipment there -- but in such a large space it is barely noticeable.
From the large windows surrounding her living room, Ms. Trezza looked out at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge over the dome of an old bank, which is being restored for a church. From another angle, children could be seen skateboarding in a park across the street.
"At 6 o'clock in the morning as the sun rises this place is flooded with gorgeous red and orange light," she said, "and it sets through my studio window."
Her die-hard Manhattan attitude has all but vanished.
"You can go to Manhattan and work and you can actually come home and have a life rather than working all the time to pay the rent," she said. "Now I'm a Brooklyn spokesperson. It's nice because it's helping me to get back to my Brooklyn roots."

Anne Drennan, a Police Department spokeswoman in Vancouver, B.C., frankly says that "Vancouver is known for having the highest-grade marijuana in the world," adding that busting potheads "is not a priority with us." This climate has given rise to places like Hemp B.C., a Vancouver head shop that features an attached eatery and smokery called the Cannabis Cafe. The cafe is one of North America's only pot bars that allows any adult -- not just "medicinal" users -- to smoke openly, and the place isn't shy about this technically illegal arrangement. In fact, in full-page newspaper ads that ran recently, it invited delegates in town for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade forum to drop by for a freebie. Here's what awaited the curious.
 What You See "Welcome to Hemp B.C.," reads a handwritten greeting, adding: "... we request that you be 18 or older to smoke pot. Thank you." The head shop and cafe sit in the historic Gastown neighborhood, and feature bongs of many colors and a painting of the Virgin Mary clutching cannabis leaves. Marijuana is not for sale in the cafe, though giveaways are common. Each table is set with a domed vaporizer, which cooks rather than burns the pot for a vapory hit of THC mist. 
 The Cause Marc Emery, Hemp B.C.'s owner, opened the cafe in July, as an "activist statement" to support his pro-pot political agenda. Though Emery has not gotten in any trouble for the cafe itself, he's facing marijuana-trafficking charges in a case in which the police bought and then cultivated Hemp B.C. seeds to prove that they grew into mature, smokable pot. "I'm not looking forward to the trial because the lab results are disappointing in terms of THC content," Emery says, meaning that the THC level wasn't high enough. "It would be embarrassing in court -- though, it could be due to their poor cultivation techniques."
 What You Get Along with tasteless vegetarian food, a chance to light up. Emery says most customers are American tourists. On a recent Saturday night a scruffy pair of 20-year-old road-trippers from Maryland, who declined to give their names, said they specifically came to Canada for the cafe. Reaction? They liked it, especially the vaporizer. According to the printed instructions, the units "change the molecular formation of the THC within plant matter ...to a steam or 'vapor.' " Reading this to the guys with a flight attendant's efficiency, a waitress gives them final instructions before liftoff: "Remember, this is not smoke -- so there will be no THC in your exhale, because the vapor will be absorbed by the lung lining. Neat, eh?"

HEADLINE: The Glow, the Glitter of Fine Antiques

BYLINE: By BESS LIEBENSON 

 BODY:
THE Antiquarius show in Greenwich is known as an esthetically glowing antiques show, one in a class by itself that frequently serves as a curtain-raising event for the Winter Antiques Show in Manhattan.
Antiquarius also serves as a barometer of what's fashionable and sometimes as a forecaster of the economic climate. Though it appears no dealers wanted to tackle the economic question, new trends are an issue of another kind. 
 "New trends always show up at the Greenwich show," said N. Pendergast Jones, manager of the 40th Christmas antiques show, which is open Friday through next Sunday at the Greenwich Civic Center in Old Greenwich.
"This is a happy convergence of a very up-to-date audience that appreciates great material," Ms. Jones says, and one that "is always looking for the superb piece as well as an interesting bibelot."
She also says there is great interest in Continental furniture "that is not palace furniture: like Swedish painted furniture and French country pieces." Guy Regal Ltd. of New York, a new dealer invited to fill that niche, is showing a set of 12 painted and carved chairs from France signed "Lelarge" and a Swedish gilded and painted eight-arm chandelier circa 1780. Mr. Regal described the pieces as "crisp and clean in form with a lot of style."
"The garden is always hot," Ms. Jones added. Barbara Israel of Katonah, N.Y., an antiques dealer specializing in garden ornaments, said she has "witnessed an explosion of interest in decorations for the garden." Her own interest began as a child playing in a Japanese garden abounding with Foo dogs, lanterns and carved stones, which she recalled as "a romantic ruin." Today some of her garden items have found their way into Winterthur and Smithsonian collections. At Antiquarius she will create a garden with a two-tiered fountain dominated by a terra cotta figure.
In an atmosphere of twinkling Alberta spruce trees, other booths will beckon -- some arranged as room settings with American and English furniture, Oriental rugs and accessories ranging from needlework to American Indian baskets, from Canton and Staffordshire porcelain to paintings, prints, jewelry, boxes and historical documents.
Fletcher Copenhaver Fine Art of Fredericksburg, Va., specializing in 19th- and early 20th-century American and European art, will feature the English artist Greta Delleany, whose delicate pastoral landscapes reflect the influence of Whistler and Degas.
Anthony Scornavacco's H & B Gallery in Minneapolis will highlight a pair of 18th-century French candlesticks, a sterling epergne and 17th-century tapestry panels.
One of the most crowded jewel box settings is always Sallea Antiques from New Canaan. This year's cachet will include an English tortoise shell miniature spoon box with six silver spoons and an English double tortoise shell tea caddie with cut crystal pieces.
The Spare Room, of Baltimore, Md., will display a collection of silver broaches inscribed with names or messages. And Schuyler Field and Elizabeth Ruprecht of New Canaan will showcase a striking sure-to-be conversation piece, a late 19th-century mahogany French cabinet with removable dark green leather drawers for papers or artwork.
At Antiquarius's preview party, Thursday from 6 to 9 P.M., guests will enter a holiday decorated area to have a first look at the show's pieces and to sample food at buffet. A dessert display will be crowned with a miniature spun sugar Bush-Holley House, a bow to the Historical Society of the town of Greenwich, the show's beneficiary. Claire Vanderbilt, who was chairwoman of the first fund-raising antiques show in 1958, which helped to restore and furnish the newly acquired Bush-Holley House, will also be honored.
On Friday at 9:30 A.M. a Continental breakfast-slide lecture on "Fancy Finishes: American Painted and Gilded Furniture, 1790-1860" will be offered at the Garden Education Center, Bible Street, Cos Cob. On Saturday at 10 A.M. a Continental breakfast and walking tour of the antiques show will begin at the Greenwich Civic Center, Harding Road, Old Greenwich. Show hours Friday and Saturday are 11 A.M. to 6 P.M., Sunday, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $10. The number to call for further information is (203) 869-4966.

HEADLINE: Alternative to State Plan for Lilco

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
FOR months the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, Richard M. Kessel, and other backers of Gov. George E. Pataki's $7.3 billion plan for a partial state takeover of Lilco have sounded the same refrain.
What are the alternatives, they asked, to a plan to cut electric rates an average of 17 percent? Where else could Lilco customers turn for relief from the highest rates in the continental United States? 
 As the plan slogs through the middle innings of a game whose outcome is in doubt, an expert on utility finances, Charles M. Studness of Manhasset, is offering an alternative that is changing the tenor of the long debate over energy on Long Island.
Relying on voluntary actions by the Long Island Lighting Company, Mr. Studness's proposal envisions a way out from the $4.5 billion debt for the long-closed Shoreham nuclear power plant, a major past, present and future cause of high rates.
Mr. Pataki's plan calls for the state to sell $7.3 billion in tax-exempt bonds to buy the Lilco transmission and distribution systems and its 18.5 percent share in an upstate nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point 2 in Scriba, and, most important, to buy and refinance the Shoreham debt.
Mr. Studness's plan, which its author described last week as a plan B that Lilco would consider only if Mr. Pataki's plan foundered, would give Lilco eight years to recover what it can of the Shoreham debt through operating efficiencies.
In that period, with a trend toward a competitive electric industry, Lilco would drop its rates 3.5 percent a year, and the utility would have incentives to improve transmission and delivery in preparation for competition.
When competition arrives the cost of the Shoreham debt would not be added to transmission fees.
Lilco, opposing the plan, called it unrealistic and unworkable.
Aside from variations reflecting the Shoreham problem, Mr. Studness said, his plan was "just the sort of thing that is being done everywhere else" to shepherd the old highly regulated monopolistic utility industry into an era of free competition. He said Pennsylvania, Illinois and California had used similar approaches.
"The important thing here is that rates are capped but there are no caps on Lilco earnings," Mr. Studness said. "If Lilco can reduce expenses it can produce cash to pay off Shoreham."
His plan, which has an extensive array of other elements, has been embraced by critics who regard Mr. Pataki's plan as a turkey stuffed for Wall Street, because of fees and commissions associated with what would be the largest bond sale of its kind, and rich in trimmings for Lilco.
"The Studness plan is an approach being employed increasing all over the country," the chairman of Taxpayers Against Lilco Bailout, Maurice Barbash, said. "It allows a utility to recover most or all of its stranded assets. And as soon as a utility is deregulated and has to go out there and compete you will be amazed at how efficient it becomes."
Critics of Mr. Pataki's plan say it would lock Long Islanders into more than 30 years of paying off the Shoreham debt while blocking competition. The critics add that innovations that would let businesses and homeowners generate their own electricity using microturbines or fuel cells would be on the market in a few years, allowing customers to disconnect from the main power grid.
If Mr. Pataki's proposal is approved, the critics said, the loss of customers would eventually mean insufficient revenues to pay off the bonds, leading to a spiral ending in a state bailout that would be charged, inevitably, to Long Island residents and businesses in higher rates and new taxes.
Mr. Kessel said such a scenario was alarmist. "The only death spiral on Long Island is if we don't get these rates down now," he said.
New technologies, Mr. Kessel added, "are not going to solve rate problems on Long Island."
"It's ridiculous to think every Long Islander is going to generate their own electricity," he added.
Critics of the state plan disagreed about new technologies. "They are real, they are credible, and they are going to revolutionize the way people get electricity in this country," said Mr. Barbash.
Mr. Kessel also lambasted Mr. Studness's plan as "Soviet-style junk economics," warning that it could bankrupt Lilco and force thousands of layoffs. Lilco has more than 5,000 employees.
Lilco unions, equating efficiencies with layoffs, have also opposed the plan. Local 1049 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said the plan would "create a crisis for working Long Islanders" while threatening service.
Lilco has generally avoided comment while Mr. Pataki's plan and its projected merger with Brooklyn Union Gas are pending, but it spoke out on Mr. Studness's proposal. Lilco condemned as impossible any plan for reducing rates by one-quarter over eight years while simultaneously paying off the $4.5 billion Shoreham debt with nearly $600 million a year in operating expenses.
"This is not a realistic plan," a spokeswoman, Stefanie Gossin, said. "We do not view it as a viable alternative."
Mr. Studness said that that stand was to be expected, adding: "If they can have a takeover that gives them their money up front, never in the world would they want to do this. But suppose the takeover is off the table, what is the next best alternative? In that case I can see Lilco becoming very much interested."
Such a major change would require state legislation and cooperation from the State Public Service Commission. The P.S.C. has held Lilco apart from initiatives to introduce competition pending the outcome of Mr. Pataki's plan.
Mr. Kessel said last week that the Long Island Power Authority and Lilco were awaiting a so-called private letter from the Internal Revenue Service, advising whether Lilco would be exempt from $2 billion in capital-gains taxes. The authority also wants confirmation of its exemption.
The exemptions, particularly for capital gains, are critical to the state plan, because the plan includes them in its projections.
Opponents said it was improper for the I.R.S. to issue a private letter in a case involving a public agency. One group, the Citizens Advisory Panel, has petitioned the I.R.S. to hold hearings. The panel has also sued the state's Public Authorities Control Board because it approved Mr. Pataki's plan in July without a required study of its environmental effects.
"In their hurry to get this deal approved they forgot to play by their own rules," the executive director of the group, Gordian Raacke, said.
Mr. Kessel said that despite such challenges "the deal is moving forward with the strong backing of Governor Pataki and most of Long Island, and I am hopeful that we will get rates down by the middle of next year."
Mr. Kessel said the authority and Lilco were nearing an agreement over the wholesale price that Lilco wants to charge the authority.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
Showing a Harrowing World But Not How It Got That Way

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman; Samuel G. Freedman is the author most recently of "The Inheritance: How Three Families And America Moved From Roosevelt to Reagan And Beyond."

 BODY:
MIDWAY THROUGH Frederick Wiseman's harrowing new documentary, "Public Housing," a handsome young bureaucrat arrives at Chicago's Ida P. Wells projects with the promise of $300 million in government contracts. All the residents have to do, he explains to a group of them, is create a business of their own. An elevator-repair company, he suggests, or an energy-conservation firm. Then, under a new program, the enterprise could qualify for a share of that $300 million without even going through the usual competitive bidding.
Offered such a bonanza, not one listener responds. For the residents of Ida Wells, as the documentary makes clear, the economy largely consists of barter, scavenging, welfare and crime. None show a flicker of recognition at the mention of competitive bidding, a staple of financial life in the public sector. Their polite silence is the sound of isolation. 
 This single scene distills what is most powerful and also most troubling in "Public Housing," which will be broadcast nationally on PBS at 9 P.M. tomorrow. In more than three hours of footage, Mr. Wiseman captures both the bleak monotony and unvanquished humanity of life in the projects; he brings an unflinching eye and a capacious heart to the mission.
Yet he does so without providing any sort of historical context. Only fleetingly in a much later scene, for instance, does a viewer learn that the bureaucrat with the millions works for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Never does the film explain that H.U.D. seized control of public housing in Chicago from the city's Housing Authority because of its abysmal management record. It was at Ida Wells, for instance, that in 1994 two boys aged 10 and 11 dropped a 5-year-old out a 14th-floor window to his death.
In a broader sense, the film's exclusive focus on the present omits the overarching tragedy of public housing in America, its journey from being one of New Deal liberalism's greatest triumphs to one of its greatest failures, from being a stepladder for the working poor to a sinkhole for the welfare poor. How odd it is that PBS provides the press with program notes detailing this sad history while leaving the rank-and-file viewer ignorant.
Admittedly, anyone familiar with Mr. Wiseman's work will not expect a larger backdrop to the richly detailed portrait of Ida Wells. In an acclaimed career of 30 films spanning as many years, Mr. Wiseman has hewed to a specific aesthetic. He immerses himself in social institutions, ranging from a mental hospital in "Titicut Follies" (1967) to a dance troupe in "Ballet" (1995), and chronicles them without supertitles, narration or background music.
"Public Housing" belongs to a particular strain within the Wiseman oeuvre -- the documentaries like "Hospital" (1969), "Juvenile Court" (1973) and "Welfare" (1975) that bear witness to what Michael Harrington famously dubbed "the other America." The image that best defines both Ida Wells and "Public Housing" is a brief, hazy shot of the Sears Tower in Chicago's Loop, just five miles away and yet impossibly distant.
Sealed off by forces of class and race alike, Ida Wells plods through its days with a listlessness that the film's resolute pace utterly captures. A homeless man, his shopping cart loaded like a caravan camel, shambles past a vacant lot. A young mother smacks her daughter across the face. Two police officers comb through rubble and weeds for a streetcorner dealer's stash. The sirens and gunshots that periodically sound barely disturb the routine. Instead, the most unsettling noises in "Public Housing" are the children's songs jingled out by an ice-cream truck, so alien in a place that literally and metaphorically murders its young.
Even when Mr. Wiseman wants to demonstrate the potential for change, his journalistic integrity refuses to indulge easy hope. The film shows workshops for Ida Wells residents on "manhood training," birth control, employment and family preservation, among other topics. These scenes reveal a chasm dividing African-Americans, as it is invariably a middle-class black who addresses an underclass black audience and often grows exasperated in the process.
"Can you really afford to say, 'Yeah, I want to work, but not for $5.50?' " a job-training specialist says to one recalcitrant woman. A drug counselor, evaluating a crack addict for admission to a treatment program, breaks from his standard intake questions to cry, "You belong to a group of people, the only group in the whole industrialized world, whose life expectancy has fallen in the last 10 years."
The life signs in "Public Housing" appear in less therapeutic moments. When an exterminator gives an elderly resident tips for snaring roaches, or when a police officer handles the eviction of a disabled man with gentleness and respect, "Public Housing" brims with the generous spirit of an August Wilson play.
EVEN AT ITS MOST affecting, though, the film inadvertently betrays its weakness. One set-piece features the grandmothers of a sewing circle -- surely a remnant of the decent place Ida Wells once was. In another scene, the president of the Tenants Council presses the project's management to find an apartment for a teen-age mother and her infant. "What good is it going do to screen people?" the tenant leader asks, adding later, "Some rules are made to bend."
Any reading of the history of public housing suggests that its demise stems partly from the reluctance of the local authorities -- under incessant legal assault during the so-called "rights revolution" of the 1960's -- to continue their practice of evaluating applicants. But that fundamental piece of history is nowhere to be seen or heard in "Public Housing." Nor is the history, especially in Chicago, of segregating public housing in black slums. Nor is the effect of Federal, state and local budget cuts on public housing, which have made preventive maintenance nonexistent in many projects.
Without even hinting at any of that, Mr. Wiseman has still produced an indelible picture of underclass existence. But he has also raised a question he probably never intended to: Doesn't history matter?

HEADLINE: FILM;
An Author Adapts To Being Adapted

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
RUSSELL BANKS HAS HAD A long and tangled history with the movie industry. In the past, his wintry, critically admired novels have been snapped up by Hollywood, attracting the enthusiasm of A-list directors from Jonathan Demme to Wolfgang Peterson, but have stopped short of being turned into films.
This year has been different. "The Sweet Hereafter," adapted by the Canadian director Atom Egoyan from Mr. Banks's 1991 novel about the aftermath of a disastrous school bus accident, was a favorite on the film festival circuit and has just opened to glowing reviews. A second film, "Affliction," adapted by Paul Schrader from Mr. Banks's 1989 novel about a small-town cop whose life spins out of control, is completed, though it is unclear when it will be released. 
 Now that these films are finished, Mr. Banks is not about to join the ranks of writers like William Faulkner, J. D. Salinger and Nelson Algren who felt betrayed when their work was translated onto the screen. Nor was he shut out of the filmmaking process, like Jane Smiley, who was disappointed when the recent filmed version of her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "A Thousand Acres," omitted a scene that was crucial to "transforming the story from a melodrama to a tragedy," as she put it.
Mr. Banks is not complaining. At the Telluride Film Festival, where the two movies based on his novels made their North American debuts last summer, he was a visible figure, beaming like a proud uncle, signing books and practically handing out cigars.
The success of the movie version of "The Sweet Hereafter" has made Mr. Banks, 57, a hot property. No fewer than three of his other novels are being developed as movies, including the 1985 "Continental Drift," until recently his best-known book, with Willem Dafoe in the leading role. He is writing the screenplay, his first. He now wears his gray hair in a fashionable buzz cut. (His 13th novel, "Cloudsplitter," will be published in March.)
It is not surprising, Mr. Banks said in a recent interview, that the current adaptations were low-budget productions by auteur director-screenwriters who work outside the studio system. "My work is generally considered fairly dark and pessimistic and bleak, and Hollywood doesn't embrace that attitude very enthusiastically," he said. Indeed, despite a cast that includes Nick Nolte, James Coburn and Mr. Dafoe, "Affliction" does not yet have an American distributor.
OF THE TWO BOOKS, "The Sweet Hereafter" posed the more daunting challenge for a screenwriter. Set in an economically depressed town in upstate New York very much like Keene, N.Y., where Mr. Banks has lived for the last 10 years, the novel consists of a series of monologues delivered by four principal characters, including a lawyer who tries to goad the townspeople into bringing a lawsuit. That structure, Mr. Banks said, forced Mr. Egoyan to take numerous liberties.
"Atom had to take the book apart and put the story back together in an utterly different way," said Mr. Banks, who has a cameo role in the movie as a doctor. "I like to think he structured it horizontally and layered it, whereas I had it structured in four separate vertical narratives."
Mr. Schrader's film, by contrast, is such a faithful translation of the novel that it is almost an homage, although inevitably some scenes and characters from the 350-page book are omitted. But if the car on the page is a blue Plymouth, so is the car on the screen. "If you really respect the voice of the author," said the 51-year-old Mr. Schrader, whose adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel, "Touch," was released earlier this year, "then you have to capture that voice, not just the dialogue, but the detail, the theme and the moral voice as well."
"Affliction," a searing tale about the legacy of male violence, is drawn from events in Mr. Banks's own family history, and the movie, like the novel, takes place in a New Hampshire town resembling the community where the author's father was brought up. After his wife leaves him and his young daughter loses respect for him, the cop, played by Mr. Nolte, becomes obsessed with the possibility that a murder is being covered up and passed off as a hunting accident. The novel caught Mr. Schrader's eye at a Manhattan bookstore, and gripped him with the first paragraph, he said. He and the producer, Linda Reisman, struggled for seven years to raise the $6 million for the film.
"Both films are utterly loyal to the book in the same essential ways," Mr. Banks said. "It wouldn't matter to me how Paul or Atom structured the story as long as they structured it in an effective cinematic way. But what they both managed to do was go to the meaning of the stories and maintain that." As it happens, both films were shot in Canada by the cinematographer Paul Sarossy.
When Mr. Egoyan first sought the rights to "The Sweet Hereafter," they were held by 20th Century Fox. But according to Mr. Banks the studio abandoned the picture after the box-office failure of the 1992 film "Lorenzo's Oil," starring Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte. "They said: 'We don't want to do another depressing story about a child who's sick,' " the author recalled. Mr. Egoyan said he learned that the rights were again available after the writer Margaret Atwood introduced him to Mr. Banks.
AS A NOVELIST WHO SEEKS meaning in the concrete details of ordinary, and often overlooked, lives, Mr. Banks had trouble seeing what he had in common with a filmmaker 20 years his junior who "seemed to go straight for the abstract without the intervening layer of detail." But after watching Mr. Egoyan's 1994 film, "Exotica," he began to realize that they shared similar obsessions, including a fascination with "the relationship between the individual, the family and the community," he said.
Along the way, Mr. Egoyan, who had never adapted a book before, tried out every proposed change on Mr. Banks -- from opening the story with a scene between the lawyer, portrayed by Ian Holm, and his troubled daughter (played by Caerthan Banks, the novelist's daughter) to adding the Robert Browning poem "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" as a recurring motif.
"There was no contractual need to get his approval," Mr. Egoyan said. "I was so taken by the book that I felt I needed his blessing. I've been quite surprised at how satisfying it is to serve a book that one admires." He and Mr. Banks spent a day going over the screenplay together line by line.
Mr. Egoyan traveled to Keene to videotape the courthouse, the gas station, the quarry, and other locations that the novelist had in mind when he was writing "The Sweet Hereafter" which was filmed last year in British Columbia."I wanted to enter into his experience of the story, to taste this process in as complete a way as possible," Mr. Egoyan said. Mr. Banks said he found it "a little unsettling" to see how accurately Mr. Egoyan had captured the places he had visualized.
Having grown up in Michigan, in what he describes as "small-town winter America," Mr. Schrader saw no need to make a similar tour for "Affliction." But he gave Mr. Banks a chance to approve all the sets and locations before the filming began. At a party in Montreal after filming was completed, Mr. Schrader recalled, Mr. Banks confided in the crew that it had been intensely moving to see a barn that looked exactly like his grandfather's burn to the ground in a climactic moment in the film. "He got quite emotional about it," Mr. Schrader said. "I could see how deeply he had been pulled into the realization of this fictional story he had written."
Their collaboration was so close that Mr. Schrader, who wrote the screenplay as well as directed, once called Mr. Banks from the set and got him to write a few lines of voiceover narration. "He said, 'It's snowing like hell up here, and we've got to explain it,' " Mr. Banks said.
Despite his happy experiences, Mr. Banks has become wise to the ways of Hollywood. Recently, he was disheartened to learn that Carl Franklin, the director of "Devil in a Blue Dress" and the much-admired "One False Move," is no longer in the running to direct "Rule of the Bone," based on Mr. Banks's last novel. To avoid such disappointments in the future, Mr. Banks said, he has signed on as a producer for the movies being developed from "Continental Drift" and another earlier novel, "The Book of Jamaica," because "that's the only way you're going to have any control over who directs it, who writes it and who acts in it."
"And if you care about these things as I do," he added, "then that's the way to do it."

HEADLINE: Lyndhurst Earning Keep as a Film Site

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
OVERLOOKING the Hudson River in Tarrytown on 67 landscaped acres is Lyndhurst, one of America's finest Gothic Revival mansions, formerly the estate of the railroad magnate Jay Gould and now the property of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
What, then, are all those little boys doing on those manicured lawns? Why are two identical vintage Cadillacs parked in the raked gravel driveway? 
 Quiet!
Orders are barked.
Lights! Camera!
The making of a movie is under way. A crew is filming "Gloria," a new version of the 1980 John Cassavetes movie starring Gena Rowlands. This "Gloria," directed by Sidney Lumet, starring Sharon Stone and Jeremy Northam, is scheduled for release next summer.
History for hire, or Lyndhurst as a film location, takes on economic importance as budget cuts to cultural institutions have been exacerbated by the reduction in funds from the National Endowment for the Arts, down to $98 million for fiscal 1998 from $99.5 million in fiscal 1997. And there is a new cap of 15 percent on funds to any one state -- proposed under the Interior Appropriations Bill on the amount of money arts institutions can receive from the endowment fund -- meaning that financing for New York, which has received 27 percent in the past will be cut almost in half.
"With money scarce, it's a financial challenge to try to earn more," said Susanne Pandich, director of Lyndhurst. "It costs $1 million a year just to keep Lyndhurst operating, to say nothing about capital costs. We've reduced salaries and staff and we're constantly looking at creative uses of our property so we can become more self-sufficient." Marketing Lyndhurst as a location site is approached in a business-like manner. "We are listed in all the location guides, and scouts come by regularly," Ms. Pandich said. "A lot of TV commercials have been shot here, and this is the second time Sidney Lumet has used Lyndhurst as the location for a major motion picture. 'Reversal of Fortune' about Claus Von Bulow was done here."
Because location rental fees account for about 1 to 5 percent of an entire production budget, the financial benefits are considerable. "Our fees are set on a scale of $2,000 to $8,000 a day, depending on what is required," Ms. Pandich said, adding that it is important for administrators of historic properties to understand what a film company is proposing to do before contracts are signed.
"We have a responsibility to the public to see that the property in our care is protected," Ms. Pandich said. "At Lyndhurst, for example, special effects come under scrutiny. Before we agree to any use of special effects, we must be assured that any special effects won't harm the landscape, the building or the furnishings. For interior shoots, for example, all our furniture is removed by special fine arts movers and by our own people. The movie company is charged an additional $1,000."
On the first day of shooting, Ms. Pandich walks through the house with the film's production manager, making notes. The same procedure is repeated on the last day.
"We follow guidelines set down for filming by the National Trust," she said. "Tradeoffs such as excessive wear and tear must be weighed against economic gain. The project must be appropriate for our property."
Ms. Pandich was involved in about a dozen film productions during her 10-year tenure as curator at Biltmore, the National Trust property in Asheville, N.C. "That's where I learned how to deal with film companies," she said. "Every aspect of the project was carefully examined. In every instance, we had to weigh the care of the property against the dollars that the film would produce."
With the increased use of historic resources by film makers, a publication to help preservationists become knowledgeable about all aspects of the process has been issued by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. "It gives detailed information about what the location experience entails, examines both the benefits and the drawbacks and proposes solutions to potential problems," Ms. Pandich said, adding that the economic impact of filming at Lyndhurst is greater than the location fees.
"The benefits have a ripple effect. The tourist industry in the area gets a boost because of the increase in visitors who want to see where movies have been made. They spend money in restaurants, shops and hotels, and they also visit other historic sites in the Hudson Valley. It's a win-win situation for all of us."
In the movie "Gloria," Lyndhurst is transformed into a Catholic school for boys, a spokesman for the movie company said. "It represents a sanctuary upstate for the leading characters fleeing the mob. It's an ideal site. Sixty-seven acres with great river views and only 40 minutes away from mid-Manhattan. For us that means big savings in hotel bills, food, rental cars, and what's more, the crew can go home at night and sleep in their own beds. Makes for a happier ship."
When asked about the wear and tear on the mansion during the shooting, he said, "Our location manager, who acts as a liaison between Lyndhurst and us, sees to it that we leave the place better than we found it."
Movies, television commercials, advertising stills, fashion shoots all produce revenue crucial to the continuing restoration at Lyndhurst, and weddings, too, have become lucrative. Lyndhurst was the first museum property in the area to open its doors for weddings and social events.
"The place lends itself to grand events, generating business we can use," Ms. Pandich said. "We have a commercial kitchen and a full-service caterer and wedding planner on site, Fabulous Foods, to help with every aspect of weddings from menus to music to flowers."
The busiest time for weddings is from April to October. "Many couples choose the Rose Garden as the site for their wedding ceremony," Ms. Pandich said. "The setting is beautiful. A charming gazebo in the garden is surrounded by hundreds of varieties of roses, planted, cultivated and tended for over 26 years by volunteers of the Garden Club of Irvington-on-the-Hudson. Lyndhurst's 1865 brick Carriage House, newly restored, is also a popular place for weddings."
For large weddings, the Carriage House's courtyard can be covered with a tent year round, accommodating as many as 350 guests. Ms. Pandich also said that Lyndhurst offers a romantic setting unduplicated anywhere. "Where else can brides arrive at their ceremony in an antique carriage drawn by a matched pair of Morgan horses and then, following the ceremony, have a reception on the veranda of the mansion? And during the reception, the mansion itself is opened for touring by the wedding guests."
Fees range from $250 to $3,000, and part of the fee is tax deductible because the proceeds go to restoration of the property.
Another popular time for parties at Lyndhurst is December when corporations hold holiday parties in the Carriage house. In addition, on Saturday and Sunday evenings from Dec. 13 to 28, candlelight tours of the mansion, decorated for Christmas, will be offered. "The mansion will be lighted by candles and elaborately decorated with turn-of-the-century trimmings," Ms. Pandich said.
Virtually every room will be decorated for the season. Visitors will be able to wander through halls decked with festoons of pine and laurel, see the mansion's Victorian Christmas trees, listen to live music and drink mulled cider. Admission is $10, $6 for children. Reservations are required and are now being taken. For reservations or more information, the number to call is 631-4481.

HEADLINE: Girls and Computers Still an Issue

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
SISTER JEAN BAPTISTE, principal of the Ursuline School, a Roman Catholic private school in New Rochelle for 6th through 12th-grade girls, said she knew she had made the right decision this year in requiring incoming sixth graders to buy laptop computers.
She recalled a conversation that she had had recently with the father of an eighth grader. "This parent, who is in the business world, came up to me and said: 'Sister, you can't imagine what a difference it makes if a woman can do computers. It really cracks the glass ceiling,' " Sister Jean Baptiste said. "The world these sixth graders will move into will be totally computer run. We want to give them the self-confidence and skills to move into that world. That's the point of a women's school. We have to give our young women an edge. We started with the sixth grade partly because there are only 25 of them, while I have 180 girls in ninth grade, and partly because I want to catch them before they turn off." 
 Keeping girls interested in technology and allowing them to keep their career options open later on was the theme of a daylong conference on "Women, Girls and Technology" earlier this month at the Marymount Institute for the Education of Women and Girls at Marymount College here. The conference was sponsored by the institute, the Marymount Academic Computing Center and the Lower Hudson Regional Information Center. Attending the meeting were teachers, administrators, parents and students from Briarcliff, Chappaqua, Croton-on-Hudson, Elmsford, Harrison, Greenburgh Central 7, Ossining, Pocantico Hills, Scarsdale, Somers and White Plains school districts as well as from the newly formed Young Women's Leadership School of East Harlem, which is an all-girl junior high school in Manhattan.
Many educators have expressed concern that girls -- specifically those entering the middle school years when social identity and popularity are often more important than academic pursuits -- associate computers and technology with boys, and that the girls are reluctant to enter what they see as a male domain.
"We're hitting a brick wall with the girls," said Jim O' Brien, a technology teacher at Somers High School, echoing classroom experiences that many teachers shared. "I have 4 girls out of 25 in one tech class, and 5 out of 25 in another. The guidance counselor who refers the most girls to these classes is male. Home economics has bridged the gender gap. Why do we have such hurdles? It's depressing to me that there's such a clear-cut stereotype, that 'technology is for boys.' We tried to structure a facility that's inviting, that doesn't look like a machine shop or a garage, and we try to make our activities nongender biased, but it's frustrating."
Students have also expressed frustration.
"A lot of girls are afraid of the challenge and are afraid to be put down or to fail," said 17-year-old Taniqua Ward, a junior in the Greenburgh Central 7 School District. "They automatically walk in there scared."
In other schools, teachers and administrators have found that even the most carefully designed technology centers attract more boys than girls.
"We've got all this stuff available, all the equipment and software, but we see a situation where boys knock down the door during lunchtime recess, but we don't see a lot of girls knocking down the door," said Peter Lisi, principal and superintendent in the Pocantico Hills School District. "I honestly do not know why. We're concerned about our girls not having the same opportunities as our boys. We don't want to see our girls left behind or our boys victimized because of their interest. One question to address may be the whole issue of stereotyping."
In some districts, where the schools have established gender equity committees to address such stereotyping concerns, there are still potential problems.
"In middle school, young women can lose their voice," Dr. Joan Weber, an assistant superintendent in Scarsdale, said. "Our district has a two-year-old gender equity committee to make sure there is equality for boys and girls."
To some experts, the problems lie in how boys and girls view computers. Jo Sanders, director of the Center for Gender Equity at the Washington Research Institute in Seattle and the conference's keynote speaker, said: "Males tend to see computers as something of intrinsic interest, or as a power expression, another form of manhood testing. Girls see computers as a means to an end. Girls have been socialized to believe that it's not quite an appropriate thing for them. You have to provide opportunities and experiences for girls to succeed and excel in technology."
What often happens, some experts said, is that teachers who encourage boys to tackle a problem until they solve it on their own tend to rescue girls who face similar problems by providing the solution and reinforcing a girl's feeling of inadequacy.
Dr. Sanders continued: "As technology is becoming more prevalent in schools, girls are taking themselves out of it. Teachers have to make sure that in the technology classroom they're not letting classmates put down the girls."

HEADLINE: Now About Bob and Those TV Spots . . .

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
TO people who watch television in Connecticut -- and that's most people -- he's like the fly that keeps buzzing around until he seems like part of everyday life and you get the impression that you'd miss him if he flew away somewhere. Or maybe not.
His name is Bob. 
 Now you get it. He's the guy in the commercials, some 500 a week, over the state's network and cable stations, passionately telling, sometimes yelling, about the bargains at Bob's Discount Furniture. Again, and again and again, day and night, he appears, a skinny guy with a high-pitched voice extolling the virtues of living room sets or bedroom sets, usually ending with an invitation to "Come on Down" or exulting that he's "Gotcha" by the low prices and high quality.
The pitchman has become a celebrity of sorts. Wherever he goes, someone is sure to yell "Hey, that's Bob," or sidle up and say, "Hi Bob! " as though they have been friends for years.
That's the public Bob. There is, however, another Bob. This Bob is quiet-spoken, self-effacing, reflective, a complete turnaround from the manic Television Bob. They do dress alike though: open shirt, pullover sweater, jeans, sneakers.
"I feel like a fraud sometimes," said the private Bob Kaufman. He was relaxing in one of the soft chairs in his Orange store and talking about his double identity. "I am rather introverted," he said. "People who know me say its amazing when they see me on TV." So why does he do the television commercials that force him to change from Introvert Bob to Extrovert Bob? It's simple; they work.
Bob's Discount Furniture was started modestly in 1991 with one store in Newington. The "Come on Down" and "Gotcha" commercials started in 1992, a disastrous year economically for Connecticut in general.
In the years since, in equally distressing economic times, more stores have been opened and now they total a dozen in Connecticut and two more in western Massachusetts. Last year, Bob's Discount Furniture was rated as the 63d largest furniture company in the nation.
The commercials that have fueled the remarkable growth are about as elemental as can be. They are written and produced by Bob and two others connected to the company, Stan Adelstein and Andy Bricker.
"It's not complicated," says Bob. Their studio is an upstairs room in the Manchester Bob's store. They set up an arrangement of furniture, use one camera, some lights, and Bob goes into action. That's it. Occasionally they go on location. A commercial featuring Bob with Carla Berube, a former UConn and now New England Blizzard basketball notable, was shot at East Catholic High School, also in Manchester.
Bob has no illusions about the artistic merits of the commercials but he defends them. "Who is better to tell about products than someone who believes in them?" he asks.
He acknowledges that the commercials get a mixed reaction. "Some people love them and some people hate them. One time, a guy came up to me and I thought he was going to beat me up. 'I hate those ads,' he said, 'but I like you.' " Bob says he thinks most people approve of him because of his sincerity about the products he is selling. "If I had to fake it, I couldn't do it."
He says he is not dismayed if some people reach for the clicker when he appears. "We all watch too much television anyway," he says. Besides, there is much worse on the tube. "I heard a statistic the other day that a kid by 18 has seen 18,000 murders on television."
He also well knows that "Come on Down," taken shamelessly from the television show "The Price Is Right," is a cliche of cliches by now. "I hope no one wants to put it on my tombstone."
When he first decided to appear in the television commercials, one of the least enthusiastic people was his father, Leo Kaufman, who for decades had run an advertising agency in Hartford with many furniture accounts. " 'Look at you,' he said. 'And you've got a voice that sounds like chalk on chalk.' " Today, Leo likes to accompany Bob when he is invited to speak on his career as an entrepreneur.
Bob Kaufman, who is now 45, grew up in West Hartford and was graduated from the University of Connecticut in l974 with a degree in marketing.
His first job was with Radio Shack in Groton. He enjoyed it, he said, but something happened a few years later that was to change his life dramatically.
He was going to a meeting on his motorcycle when he noticed that the gas in one tank was almost depleted. He bent down to switch to the second tank, lost control, and crashed into a pole. His right leg was badly shattered and for a time in danger of being amputated. The leg is still partially paralyzed. He took months to recuperate and had to give up his job with Radio Shack.
He worked in other jobs, including a stint as a supervisor in a factory, but eventually decided to try something else. He had been sleeping on a waterbed, relatively new at the time, because it was supportive of his injured leg. So he became an entrepreneur, in waterbeds.
"I became the waterbed king," he says cheerily. He would lease space in stores to sell waterbeds with a proviso that the stores would be paid only when he had his profits. It was a no-risk deal for him and by the end of the 1980's, he had space in 24 stores in four states.
But the waterbed craze was ebbing in the early 1990's when Bob Kaufman and Gene Rosenberg, who had owned a chain of furniture stores and was considered an expert in special promotions, took over a building in Newington where a furniture store had gone into bankruptcy. The building, an early casualty of a growing state recession, became the first Bob's Discount Furniture store, with Mr. Rosenberg owning two-thirds of the business and Bob one-third under an agreement that still exists.
The recession actually helped the business, Bob says today. "As we got successful, we started to get calls from owners of buildings that were vacant because other stores had gone bankrupt. They wanted to fill them up. The second store was in Windsor, then Middletown, then Willimantic" and so on.
As the chain has expanded, the stores have became fancier, and more dignified: arrangements of furniture in tasteful patterns, coffee for patrons to sip, freshly baked cookies, huge jars of candies for children.
Bob says he is always amused at the reaction to the stores from people who have seen his antics on television. It's a different world. "We don't pressure anybody," he said. "We don't have markdown sales. If you buy something today it's the same price tomorrow. Our salespeople don't hover. Some people come in for lunch. We don't care. They'll be back."
He is also amused by some of the more affluent people who come to his stores to shop but don't tell their neighbors. "You'd be suprised at how many times someone in Avon or Farmington asks if we can deliver the furniture in an unmarked truck."
At age 45, the off-camera Bob is a contented man. "I think I'm the most blessed man in this state," he says.
In a way, his good fortune extends to the accident that nearly cost him a leg. "Know where I'd be if is wasn't for the accident?" he said. "I'd still be at Radio Shack."

HEADLINE: Loyal Partners at Devil's Den

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
THE placid waters of Godfrey Pond in Weston reflected the orange-red leaves of the trees surrounding it as Howard Pierpont, a 72-year-old Stratford man, dug his pitchfork into a mound of wood chips made damp by a weekend of solid rain. Now it was Monday morning, and Mr. Pierpont was using the chips to cover a woodland trail.
"You need it to prevent compacting the trails over the winter, and so people can get a better footing with all these leaves around," he said of his work. "We were supposed to work on the trails this weekend, but we had to cancel because of the rain. Hopefully we'll get to it this weekend, but I wanted to get some of it done today while the weather was good." 
 Considering Mr. Pierpont is no paid groundskeeper but a retired volunteer, his dedication would seem noteworthy. Yet it is hardly unusual at Weston's Lucius Pond Ordway-Devil's Den Preserve, the largest piece of protected open space in Fairfield County. Owned by the private Nature Conservancy, the 1,700-acre wildlife sanctuary tends to bring out the nature-loving philanthropist in many, including Weston's local government.
Over the past decade, Weston has embarked on a series of joint ventures with the Nature Conservancy to enlarge this woodland tract, buying available land contiguous to Devil's Den. This history of cooperative land-buying is unusual for the Conservancy, an international organization based in Virginia. Denise Schlener, executive director of the Conservancy's Connecticut chapter, calls it a "breakthrough."
"As we protect larger natural landscapes, partners are critical to our success," she said. "Jointly owning land is a real opportunity. I know we couldn't do this by ourselves. We wouldn't want to do this by ourselves."
By "this," Ms. Schlener meant the latest of 4 land purchases over the past 10 years in which Weston played a key role. The land in question this time, a 32-acre parcel near the Den's signature feature, Godfrey Pond, is a farm owned by Leon Lachat, a long-time Weston resident who is said to be selling the land well under market value because of a desire to see the town retain some rural character in the face of increased development.
Large-lot zoning is the general rule, with a two-acre minimum requirement for houses, but Weston has not been immune to the development fever which has swept through Fairfield County since the 1980's. "When I was a kid, growing up here in the 1940's and 1950's, there were a lot of farms with meadows," the Weston First Selectman, George Guidera, said. "Not anymore."
Mr. Guidera, a Republican in his sixth term, said Devil's Den is one place where residents from Weston and surrounding communities can get away from encroaching civilization. The only downside to Devil's Den, he added, is that "it's all in one place. But when you get in the center of the thing, it's tremendous. You can't believe you're only 45 minutes from Manhattan as the crow flies."
The town began buying land with the Conservancy in April 1988, after a court ruled that a 16-acre parcel in the center of Devil's Den, thought to be in Conservancy hands, was actually owned by a man who immediately talked about building houses there. The Nature Conservancy, Mr. Guidera recalled, threatened to sell its entire Weston acreage rather than maintain the preserve in so compromised a state. Lacking the funds to buy the would-be developer out, they asked the town government for help.
"The Conservancy had come to the prior First Selectman, and she said there was nothing she could do," Mr. Guidera said. "They smartly came back when I came in and said that they could raise $425,000, could I raise the other $425,000?"
Mr. Guidera recalled balking at donating town money to a private charity, but suggested an alternative: For the same $425,000 price, Weston would buy the conservation restrictions from the Conservancy for the entire Devil's Den preserve, and the Conservancy could then use that money to help buy the central parcel.
Holding such restrictions meant that even if the Conservancy were to sell the preserve to a developer, the land could not be developed.
"It was a no-brainer," Mr. Guidera recalled. "Everything we've decided to do with them has been a no-brainer. That was cheap when you consider the alternatives."
The alternatives include allowing parcels up for sale to be developed and adding to a local population that has risen from 660 people in 1942 to about 10,000 today. That, town officials say, would mean more roads to maintain, citizens to protect and children to educate. In other words, higher property taxes.
Mr. Guidera said that even those in Weston who do not visit the preserve understand this. In 1990, with the state in the midst of a recession and local governments scrounging to make cuts, Weston bought 85 acres of land next to Devil's Den from the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company at $6,950 an acre. When it came time to ratify the purchase, at an open town meeting in which all voting-age Weston residents can participate, it was resoundingly approved.
That time Weston bought the land on its own, without the Conservancy's help. Two years ago the town joined with the Conservancy again when People's Bank sold an undeveloped 70-acre parcel, again adjacent to the preserve, which a bank had foreclosed on for $200,000. Weston again paid half of that for the development rights.
"In this market, that's nothing," said Stephen Patton, co-director of the preserve along with his wife, Lise A. Hanners.
Overseeing a 1,700-acre preserve would seem a formidable task for anyone, especially with limited staffing and a yearly Conservancy budget of $250,000. The couple, both ornithologists, arrived at Devil's Den in 1990 and spend a considerable portion of time studying the activity of migratory bird species like the worm-eating warblers, which summer in the Den, one of the last remaining large-scale habitats of its kind.
Devil's Den has a long history, but it came into being as a preserve only in the late 1960's, when Bridgeport Hydraulic sold the land to the Conservancy in three separate pieces. Katharine Ordway of Weston willed the Conservancy enough money to make those initial purchases and it is for her father, Lucius Pond Ordway, that the preserve is partially named.
"Ordway left an extraordinary legacy to the Nature Conservancy, which led us to a whole other period in our history," Ms. Schlener said. "Thanks to her, we were able to be more aggressive. For many of us, Devil's Den is a core preserve that has value extending beyond its biological importance to the role this woman played in the development of the Conservancy."
The name Devil's Den may have been derived from a cloven-shaped imprint found on a rock there during Colonial times. The name did not scare away settlers, nor did the sloping topography that prevented most farming. A saw mill was built on the site before the Revolution, damming two brooks to form what became Godfrey Pond. Fishing, hunting and trapping also took place, but more lucrative was charcoal-making, a procedure which involved burning dried cordwood in sealed mounds for as long as a month. More than 40 sites at Devil's Den, most of them little more than isolated clearings with scattered stone debris, have been linked to this activity. A display has been set up near one such site on Laurel Trail to show how this long-ago practice was performed.
Perhaps because it is so close to the Devil's Den entrance at the end of Pent Road, Laurel Trail is one of the most frequently traveled and documented of all the preserve trails. There are more than 20 miles of trails in all, and visitor recreation is limited to hiking, nature-watching and, on some trails, cross-country skiing.
Even dog-walking is prohibited, because dogs pose a danger to birds and other native wildlife.
Such regulation might not go down well with everyone, but it would be hard to tell from the preserve's deep pool of volunteers. There are 140 active volunteers, according to the preserve's program coordinator, Lillian Willis, which helps when an average of 40,000 people visit Devil's Den a year.
"We are unique in the area," Ms. Willis said. "There's nowhere else you can go and hike for 20 miles."
Many volunteers "adopt" a portion of a trail to maintain. Others lead guided tours of particular areas for adults or for school groups. Some, like Mr. Pierpont, do both.
"I don't think of it as work," said Cia Marion, a volunteer from Westport. "I think of it as fun."
Frank Waters sometimes demonstrates the collier's work regimen for young visitors. A Norwalk resident since 1955 who lived in Weston for a time before then, he said that children from urban areas like Norwalk and Bridgeport who visit with school groups seem especially appreciative of Devil's Den's bucolic features.
"One of the things we try to do is get the commitment to encourage protection, so that they and their grandchildren can see what true nature is like," he said.
Because several farm buildings are located at the Lachat property and because it is directly connected to Godfrey Road, a main Weston thoroughfare, the Conservancy wants to put a "conservation center" there. Mr. Patton said a center will help teach nature appreciation to people in the community and provide an indoor gathering place for volunteers.
The Lachat deal still has several hurdles to clear, culminating in a town meeting on Thursday where the Weston half of the $1.5 million purchase price will be decided on.
For the first time, the town will be a full partner with the Conservancy -- buying half of the land itself. (The partners would also hold a three-year option for the purchase of another 10-acre piece of the Lachat estate.) Mr. Guidera said he anticipated no serious opposition to the expenditure.
"It's the most fantastic working relationship I've seen anywhere between a government and a private group," he said. "We trust them, they trust us. When we argue, it's a minimal argument."

HEADLINE: Back Again In Stamford: Speculative Building

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
WHEN the business boom of the last decade ended in 1988 with a deep recession and fortunes lost, no industry in Connecticut was in worse shape than commercial real estate. Everywhere, empty office buildings were gaunt reminders of reckless excess. Many in the industry predicted they would never see speculative office construction again.
Suddenly, though, steel is rising again. The last four years has seen new manufacturing and retail buildings constructed all around the state, and in the last 12 to 18 months new office buildings have started going up again. In parts of Fairfield County, investors are even planning to build office structures on speculation. 
 At a recent real estate financing seminar, Jeff Sussman, president of the Louis Dreyfus Property Group in New York, stunned a gathering of brokers, investors and municipal officials by announcing that his company would build a 21-story office tower on speculation in downtown Stamford, the first there in a decade. "That's news!" cheered the city's economic development director, Kip Bergstrom. Then there is Shelton, where another office building, albeit smaller, is being built on speculation. Elsewhere in throughout the state, however, experts on the commercial real estate market said similar development is still several years off. Brokers and investors alike said Stamford has been more pushed by influences from outside the state than pulled by forces from within. Many of the companies seeking to move out of New York City are leap-frogging Westchester and landing in Fairfield County. Over the last year they have occupied just about all the available vacant top-quality office space with 75,000 square feet or more in the Stamford market and environs. In the real estate business, the use of vacant office space is termed "absorption."
"Fairfield County, in particular, has a shortage of office space," noted Chris Cooper, a spokesman for the State Department of Economic Development. Declining vacancy rates have pushed rents for Class A office space in Stamford to around $32 per square foot. Although rents of $35 per foot or more are required for new construction to be profitable, developers are pressing on under the expectation that rents will climb to that range by the time that they are ready for tenants to move into them. Rents in Stamford have been rising at a rate of 10 percent a year, Mr. Bergstrom said, "so we're going to get there pretty quickly."
New methods for financing real estate development are helping the process along. Banks -- the dominant sources for real estate capital in the 1980's -- have been replaced by real estate investment trusts and commercial mortgage-backed securities. A lot of money has poured into these financial vehicles during the past few years, and fund managers like the state.
During the mid-1980's, the banking industry had shifted from its traditionally conservative approach to financing development, demanding that builders line up tenants in advance before approving mortgages (which is know as "building to suit,"), to the riskier strategy of financing speculative development. The result, Mr. Bergstrom said, was too much office space. When the recession struck, the banks found themselves holding mortgages for vacant buildings. Some banks were forced out of business.
The real estate investment trusts and securities funds, however, are more diversified in the markets and properties they invest in, and presumably less subject to loss if a property or a whole regional market becomes unprofitable. Connecticut's recovery from the recession has been very slow, but the state still has several advantages, including a good transportation system, schools and colleges, a skilled labor force and attractive communities. These were factors that lured the Swiss Bank Corporation to move its huge headquarters out of Manhattan to Stamford, which in turn has drawn other investors, including Mr. Sussman's company.
"Stamford is becoming a very unique market," he said. "It has both urban and suburban characteristics that major companies want. We think it's a great place."
Mr. Sussman observed, however, that building on speculation for the office market is still a gamble. Most office projects still need commitments from enough tenants, preferably including a single, large company that is in effect an anchor, before lenders will agree to finance their construction. But he says he believes half his building will be rented before he puts a shovel in the ground.
Likewise, David Mack, a partner with the Davis Companies, a Boston-based developer, said a 100,000-square-foot office building he has planned in an office park in Shelton may be fully leased before it is completed, possibly even before construction begins on it. Shelton is attractive because land costs are lower than Stamford. Companies there also don't face the traffic congestion that plagues Stamford and New York City. "You have one accident, and everybody in your company gets to work at 10:30 in the morning," he said.
Stamford and Shelton, in fact, have a relationship. "Just as we're New York's suburb, they're our suburb," said Mr. Bergstrom. Just as companies from New York are relocating to Stamford, companies from Stamford are relocating to Shelton.
Strong office real estate markets tend to radiate out from their centers. Greenwich has decided it has grown enough, Mr. Bergstrom said, so Stamford's overflow has moved east along the shoreline and Merritt Parkway corridors, and north along Route 7 and Routes 25 and 8.
For the moment, it has skipped Bridgeport. Harbour Place, a $950 million complex of stores, hotels, a conference center, theaters and offices, has been proposed for a 50-acre property on Bridgeport's waterfront. But Michael Freimuth, Bridgeport's Director of Planning and Economic Development, said office rents there aren't high enough to make new construction profitable, so the two office buildings in the project aren't scheduled to be built until its final phase, well into the next decade.
Danbury has experienced low office vacancy rates and has seen some new construction, which has radiated into its suburbs. All of it has been build to suit, however; no speculative development.
Meanwhile, the Hartford and New Haven markets have been improving, but both still have substantial vacancy rates. "We've had no new building since 1988," said Bob Daglio, a broker with CB Commercial/Whittier. But whereas five years ago a company might have had its choice from among 20 office buildings with 75,000 square feet of floor space, today, its choice would be limited to about five buildings. "We're all cautiously positive that it's getting better," he said.
While most of the rest of the state struggles to win over investors and restore their economies to pre-recession levels of growth, Stamford has begun to experience growing pains. Mr. Bergstrom said some developers are concerned if there are enough construction workers available to build everything planned. Traffic congestion on the major highways is worse than ever.
The city might support an additional two million square feet of office space above the three million now under construction or approved, he said, but then it might have reached its limit for growth.
That prospect doesn't make Mr. Bergstrom unhappy, however.
"The rest of the state would love to have the problem of trying to decide how big they want to be," he said.

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:

Postal Lawsuit
Julio Ramos, a Puerto Rican mail handler working at the United States Postal Service's distribution center in Harrison, has filed a Federal anti-discrimination suit, accusing the Government of discriminating against him by setting an English-only policy on the job. 
 The suit was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and names Postmaster General Marvin Runyon as the defendant.
Juan A. Figueroa, president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the civil rights organization representing Mr. Ramos, said: "It is ironic. We're United States citizens who come here to be treated like second-class citizens."
The lawyer, who said that Mr. Ramos was told by one of his co-workers to go back to Puerto Rico if he wanted to speak Spanish on the job, said this was the fifth case in a year brought by his organization to dispute English-only rules.
But Pat McGovern, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service, said there was no policy discriminating against the use of Spanish on the "workroom floor" of the distribution center. She explained that many workers speak second languages at work. "It's done every day of the week," she said. "We have a diverse work force."
Workers are required to speak English only when conducting official business, for example, in the personnel office, she said, adding that speaking any second language was considered an asset in dealing with the Postal Service's many customers.
The English-only issue has become increasingly controversial. In Amarillo, Tex., two women were recently discharged by an insurance agency for speaking Spanish on the job, leading to a boycott of the agency by two Hispanic groups and threats of lawsuits. Two years ago, an Amarillo judge sparked a national controversy when he ordered a Mexican-American woman involved in a custody dispute to speak English to her 5-year-old daughter.
 
Public Housing
The Greenburgh Housing Authority recently received a failing grade on an assessment performed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and United States Representative Sue Kelly thinks an injustice has been done.
At the very least, it is a bureaucratic error that the Congresswoman wants corrected, she said to Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of the Federal agency.
Last year the Greenburgh Housing Authority received an A-plus. But this year, when an inspector visited the site, the newly hired maintenance supervisor, who was unfamiliar with the office's filing system, was unable to find documentation required for the audit. Thus the failing grade.
When Wesley Lee, executive director of the authority, telephoned the next day to tell Mr. Cuomo's agency that the papers were available, he was told by a worker that the F grade was final.
Referring to Mr. Lee and his staff, Ms. Kelly said in a letter to Mr. Cuomo that she "would hate for a bureaucratic technicality, such as this, to needlessly mar their careers."
 
Water Quality O.K.
The results from water-quality testing of Long Island Sound this summer and fall show that three Westchester harbors had a marked improvement over last year, said Steve Yergeau, a researcher at the environmental group Save the Sound.
Although it is still not known why the improvement occurred, Mr. Yergeau said he believed that cool, dry weather was a contributing factor. But he emphasized that comparing one year's data with the next cannot be used as an indication of long-term trends.
The environmental organization, which studies issues in New York and Connecticut, currently monitors 50 sites in 11 harbors and coves in Westchester, Fairfield and New Haven Counties. Trained at the beginning of the season, 123 volunteers in the group's Adopt-a-Harbor program collected data on dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and chlorophyll in the water and on water salinity and the presence of algae.
None of the three harbors tested in Westchester -- Echo Bay in New Rochelle, Milton Harbor in Rye and Mamaroneck Harbor -- became hypoxic, which occurs when oxygen levels in the water drop precipitously.
Despite the influx of excess nutrients, sewage spills at the beginning of the summer season did not lead to excess algae growth, which in turn leads to low oxygen levels, the report said. The high pathogen levels, however, did keep swimmers out of the water for part of the summer.
 
Rating Reaffirmed
Westchester has done it again: the county's impeccable credit rating has been upheld.
With the selling of $83 million in municipal bonds, Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's Corporation and Fitch Investors Service reaffirmed their confidence in the county's financial stability by rating the bond issue AAA or an equivalent.
Municipal bonds are sold to finance capital improvements undertaken by the county. The bond agencies' ratings are equivalent to a credit rating, which if high, enables the county to borrow at relatively low interest rates.
"The county has maintained a stable financial position despite slower revenue growth and substantial expenditure pressure," Standard & Poor's reported.
The county's Finance Commissioner, Eric Langeloh, reported that Westchester sold the bonds, which were purchased by Merrill Lynch & Company, at a net interest rate of 4.62 percent.
"In the current market, this rate is a good one," the Commissioner said.
Among the items to be financed by the sale of the bonds are improvements at the Westchester County Medical Center, repairs and rehabilitation of sewers, work on county roads, bridges and buildings and improvements at Playland and other parks.
 
Funds for Women
The Westchester Fund for Women and Girls recently awarded grants to the following groups:
*$3,000 to the Guidance Center, a New Rochelle organization, to provide domestic violence prevention and early intervention services to Port Chester Hispanic immigrant girls and women.
*$2,500 to the Community Planning Council of Yonkers for outreach and workshops for immigrant mothers of children attending the Fermi School, which is in an economically distressed neighborhood.
*$4,800 to the Northern Westchester Shelter Office in Pleasantville for legal services to women.
*$5,000 to Westchester Jewish Community Services in Hartsdale to develop a directory of services for women and girls.
*$4,000 to the Westchester Community College Foundation in Valhalla to develop training workshops for students and faculty to increase awareness of family violence issues.
*$1,000 to the New Rochelle school district for a girls' fitness program known as Physical Activity and Teen-age Health. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Building Is Booming -- in Some Places

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
WHEN she drives the 20 miles from her home in Oxford, Conn., to her office in Monroe in northwestern Fairfield County, Laura Maksymiw said, it seems as if a new subdivision is going up on every street. "And the houses are selling before the framing's put in," she said.
As executive officer of the Homebuilders Association of Fairfield County, Ms. Maksymiw remembers how recently such activity was absent. "The last four years, building dried up," she said. "By the beginning of this year, it began to pick up. In fact, my builders say there's a shortage of framers and other skilled construction workers. Many of them left the area and went to Florida or North Carolina when the market went down, and never came back." 
 Ms. Maksymiw echoes what many in the building trades in the metropolitan area are saying: Home building is booming, but only in certain areas, due primarily to their proximity to Manhattan or other commercial centers or to their cachet as second-home communities. They also note that while building permits and other measures of activity are up, they are still far from the boom years of the 1980's.
In the Town of Southampton on Long Island, for instance, building permits are up by 10 percent over the last year, and land values have been steadily appreciating, in some sections by as much as 50 percent.
In Westchester County, where developers have been scrambling to find appropriate land to subdivide, building permits are up by 54 percent over 1996. And in New Jersey and Connecticut, where the number of building permits has increased by 11 and 24 percent, respectively, some sections have benefited by the boom more than others.
"Places like Greenwich, Darien, Stamford and New Canaan, although they don't have much land left, have never been slow," Ms. Maksymiw said. "People who have money always have money. But now places like Monroe and Newtown are also hot."
The Town of Newtown, which is just outside of Danbury, has the most available land in the state, Ms. Maksymiw said. "It's accessible, highly desirable and the houses being built there are priced between $250,000 and $350,000."
Of course, no one would be building houses if they weren't selling, Ms. Maksymiw said. "I think low interest rates is the main reason business is good. And the fact that we've had a good winter. Last year was mud city. Everybody is busy now putting in their foundations before thefrost."
In the first three quarters of 1997, 1,539 building permits were issued in Fairfield County, a 38 percent increase over the same period last year, according to the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development. In New Haven, where 1,607 permits were issued, there was a 37 percent increase from 1996. And in Hartford, there were 1,627 permits issued, up 26 percent from last year.
Steve Temkin, president of T & M Building Company in Torrington, has just started Milford Chase, a development of 34 single-family homes, priced from $220,000 to $325,000 in Milford, which is in New Haven County. "It's the first town out of Fairfield," Mr. Temkin said. "A lot of the people buying houses there commute to Fairfield."
He is also in the last stages of completing another project in Milford, called Settler's Ridge, which Mr. Temkin said had been sold out. The base price for a three-bedroom colonial had been $206,900. "I'm now looking for another tract," Mr. Temkin said. "Milford's been a proven market for me."
On Long Island, 25 percent of all residential construction activity is concentrated in Brookhaven, the island's largest town, where 1,100 building permits were issued through last September compared with 880 last year, said Robert A. Wieboldt, executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute. Activity is greatest in the Three Village area, which includes the villages of Stony Brook, Port Jefferson and Setauket, Mr. Wieboldt said.
Charles Mancini, a vice president with the Park Ridge Organization in Ronkonkoma, which builds in the Three Village area and elsewhere on the island, said business was up 15 percent over last year.
He's currently working on a number of projects, including a 250-unit town-house development in Port Jefferson, with a price range of $130,000 to $160,000; a 55-home development in Setauket in the $280,000's to mid-$300,000's price range and 57 homes in Dix Hills, where the homes sell for $500,000 to $1 million.
"By spreading out the price ranges we offer, it helps us as a company to get through the rough spots," Mr. Mancini said.
On the East End, where the market is more dependent on second homes, building activity is definitely up, said Vincent J. Cannuscio, Supervisor of the Town of Southampton. "The activity is divided between east and west of the Shinnecock Canal," he said. "East of the canal, most of the building taking place is on old subdivided lots. And west of the canal is where most of the activity and new subdivisions are being built."
In the Town of Southampton, 317 building permits were issued through last September, compared with 283 the same time last year, said Mr. Weiboldt. Four out of every 10 houses in Southampton are second homes.
A custom-home builder, James V. Zizzi, is used to working on single lots and has built a total of 250 homes on the East End. He said a real trend now was to buy an older home and knock it down just to get the land. "They'll pay between $800,000 to $900,000 for the house." He added that an acre in Westhampton Beach would cost $800,000, "if you could find it."
Mr. Zizzi is now starting work on his first subdivision, with 18 houses, in Quogue. "We're getting our final approvals now," he said, adding that he expected the houses to be priced at $550,000 to $700,000.
THERE'S been a real appreciation in land values in the last two years, Mr. Cannuscio said. "In Water Mill and Bridgehampton, for instance, a one-acre lot used to cost between $75,000 and $95,000. Now it would cost $150,000."
Developers say they're aggressively looking for new sites. "We're looking at about five new sites now," said Patrick Kalian, president of Kalian Companies, in Red Bank, N.J., which is now building six single-family home communities in various parts of the state, with prices ranging from $150,000 to $700,000.
Even though they're looking, developers say it's not the best time to buy. "We're at the top of the market right now," said Jeffrey S. Doynow, a principal with Glickenhaus/Doynow, a development company, in Chappaqua, in Westchester. "Everyone's bidding now, forcing the prices up," he said. "If you meet the market and it takes three to ten years to get your approvals, it's a gamble."
Mr. Doynow is now working on seven different projects, mostly in Westchester and concentrating on the high end of the market. "The high end is very strong now," Mr. Doynow said. "A lot of people are doing very well."
Mr. Temkin, the Torrington builder, said one reason people were anxious to buy now was their fear that prices would soon be going up. In a project he is now finishing called Settler's Ridge, in Milford, Conn., the base price for a 3-bedroom colonial was $206,900 for the last units. In 1994, it was $189,900.
William H. Ethier, executive vice president of Homebuilders of Connecticut, cautioned against reading too much optimism into the increased number of building permits issued in certain areas. Even though the state as a whole saw a 24 percent increase in building permits compared with last year, "You've got to remember that 1996 was the second worst year on record," he said.
In 1996, a total of 7,714 permits were issued, Mr. Ethier said. "Only 1991 was worse, with 7,700," he said, noting that the state has projected that a total of 8,300 permits would be issued this year, with the number climbing to 9,500 by the year 2000. "These numbers should be kept in perspective in relation to the 1980's when we averaged over 17,000 units a year," Mr. Ethier pointed out.
A lot of developers and others in the building trades are calling the current market good, but not overheated. "I've doubled my business since last year," said Mr. Kalian, the Red Bank, N.J., developer. "But it's never going to be the 80's, and that's O.K. It's the 1990's version of the 1980's."
In Connecticut, Clifford Cooper, a Litchfield County architect, said that his business had also doubled this year. "I've been practicing in Litchfield since 1975, and business has always been in line with the economy," he said. "It was up in the 1980's, then there was a lull. Now it seems like the 80's again."
A great deal of the building in Litchfield is of second homes, and one change he has noticed since the 80's is that "people want real value now, not inflated value," Mr. Cooper said.
"Also I think my business has really benefited since the advent of the home office," he added. "People can work one or two days from home. This has led to an increase in the residential market, and also the commercial market, as far as retail space, in order to service these people."
In Westchester County, sales at the high end of the market were so strong in the third quarter of this year that they pushed the average price of a single-family house over $400,000 for the first time.
Mr. Doynow, who is building seven single-family home developments in which prices range from the mid-$300,000's to $2.5 million, said he prefers working at the high end. "It gives me an opportunity to really cater to my clients," he said.
AT Hardscrabble Lake, in New Castle, he has sold 45 of 93 houses, priced from $800,000 to over $1 million. "Most of my customers are from the financial world," Mr. Doynow said. "A lot of them are kids who are making a lot of money. I also get a lot of doctors."
 Housing starts in Westchester increased 54 percent for the first 10 months of this year, according to F.W. Dodge, a division of the McGraw-Hill Construction Information Group. Broken down, that translates into an 8 percent increase in single-family homes, and a 199 percent gain for multifamily units.
One of the most active town-house developers in the county is Ginsburg Development, in Hawthorne, which expects to close on over 160 units this year, compared with 150 in 1996. Its latest project is Mystic Pointe on the Hudson River in Ossining. Now starting its second phase, it has sold 79 of 168 homes, priced from the low $200,000's to the high $400.000's.
"There's a tremendous unmet need for houses for people making $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year," said Martin Ginsburg, president of the company. "It's very hard to offer houses at reasonable prices with the price of land and the tremendously costly approval process in a place like Westchester."
The huge number of multifamily starts in Westchester is due, in large part, to a proliferation of luxury rentals in the county, developers and brokers say. One of the most active companies is Avalon Properties of Wilton, Conn., which is now planing projects that would add a total of 1,540 units to the county's rental roster.
"We've definitely been filling a need created when co-ops and condos were the only thing being built," said Alexander Twining, a vice president for real estate for Avalon. "We've been backfilling that need, and think it will continue at least for a few more years."
Rentals have become increasingly attractive, Mr. Twining said, because more people are looking for short-term living situations and "real estate is no longer a good short-term investment," he said.
Avalon is also very active in Connecticut, where it is working on 1,046 rental units; in Long Island, on 1,197 units and in New Jersey, on 1,388 units "When the market is really strong you'll see more condodevelopment," said Mr. Twining. "When condos and co-ops are hot, we're not building."
Applied Companies, in Hoboken, N. J., also specializes in luxury rentals. This has been the company's biggest year ever. "We're building close to 4,500 units," said Michael Barry, a vice president.
It is now working on the first luxury rental to be built in Morristown, N. J., in nearly three decades. Called the Chancery, the 131-unit, six-story apartment building is expected to attract upper- and middle-income residents to the downtown district, Mr. Barry said. Rents are expected to range from $1,100 a month for a one-bedroom apartment to $1,400 for a two-bedroom. The company just completed a 117-unit luxury apartment complex in New Brunswick and a 300-unit luxury rental on the Hudson River in Jersey City.
"We were able to acquire a lot of the land we're building on now in the early 1990's when the market was down," said Mr. Barry. "We picked up a lot of properties in default. But there's not a lot of that around any more. It's all been absorbed."
THROUGH August, 18,150 building permits were issued in New Jersey compared with 16,299 in the same period in 1996. But when you shake out the differences between the two winters, the years are about even, said Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Builders Association.
"There were two distinctly different weather patterns," Mr. O'Keefe said. "In 1997, we were able to continue construction throughout the year. The first four months of the year were 25 percent ahead of last year. But if you look at it historically, building is subdued. In the 1980's the state averaged 38,000 units a year. Now we're on a par with the rate of construction in the 1940's."
Most of the construction now in progress, he said, is concentrated in the central part of the state and at the upper end of the market. Sixty percent of all construction is taking place in six counties: Monmouth, Ocean, Middlesex, Somerset, Burlington and Morris. "It's a question of perception," Mr. O'Keefe said. "If you're living in those sections, you'd probably think things were robust. But that wouldn't be the case if you lived somewhere else."

High-Tech Teaching Is Losing Its Gloss

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
TWO Pilgrims, Priscilla Mullens and Elder Brewster, went on line this month to answer questions from schoolchildren around the country about the first Thanksgiving in 1621.
The actors who played them, guests of the Scholastic Network, were from Plimouth Plantation, the museum in Massachusetts, and they offered an austere picture of life in the colony, where surgeons bled their patients and John Alden's bride-to-be treasured the wooden shoes her father made her. 
 Their appearance, like those of the astronaut Pete Conrad and the children's authors Jan and Stan Berenstain, is the kind of event computer enthusiasts point to when they hail the possibilities of the World Wide Web for education.
School systems nationwide are investing in high-priced machines and software in the conviction, fostered by the White House, that there is no greater good America can offer schoolchildren than computers.
While cuts in many programs have continued, spending on technology for schools is expected to rise to $5.2 billion this year from $4.3 billion last year, an increase that far outpaces inflation, according to a report in a recent issue of Education Week. The Texas Board of Education is looking into giving all students laptops instead of textbooks.
Yet much of what passes for education on computers is a far cry from the well-crafted programs of Scholastic. Most of it is akin to glorified video games offered in the vague but firm belief that access to endless information, regardless of quality, must be good.
But given the price and the lack of data on the benefits, the conviction that computers are fundamentally altering the modern era, and that therefore children ought to be involved with them at the earliest possible age, is facing an intellectual backlash.
Some of the skepticism is coming from computer experts themselves, who point out that since it doesn't take 12 years of school to master computers, they can become a distraction from other learning that takes longer. Automobiles also changed an era and schools now offer driving courses. But the classes last one semester and come later, in high school.
 
'A Glitzy Toy'
David J. Gelernter, professor of computer science at Yale, put the issue this way: "Computers themselves are fine. But we are in the middle of an education catastrophe. Children are not being taught to read, write, know arithmetic and history. In those circumstances, to bring a glitzy toy into the classroom seems to me to be a disaster. It reinforces our worst tendencies. The idea that children are in educational trouble because they don't have access to enough glitz and what they really need is a bigger database is staggeringly ludicrous. They need practice in the basics."
Raising questions about the costs and benefits of computers, Samuel G. Sava, executive director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals, wrote in this month's newsletter: "In the U.S., 37 percent of students use computers in at least some math lessons -- nearly triple the international average. Yet this increased use seemed to make no difference to our math results. In sum, if computers make a difference, it has yet to show up in achievement."
The computer debate is actually part of a larger one on the nature and purpose of education, on whether to emphasize the view of children as flowers to be cultivated or beasts to be tamed.
Mixed in with all the new-dawn perspective on computers is a strain of child liberation talk. Computers, many of its advocates insist, will free students from the constraints of authoritarian teachers and rote learning.
For this group, computers are producing a new kind of young intellectual explorer, what Don Tapscott, author of "Growing Up Digital" (McGraw Hill), calls the "Net Generation" and what Idit Harel, founder of MaMaMedia, a creative new educational Web site for children, calls "the clickerati."
Mr. Tapscott says that the current generation is "beginning to process information and learn differently than the boomers before them. New media tools offer great promise for a new model of learning -- one based on discovery and participation."
He, like Dr. Harel and others, says computers will allow a shift from teaching to "the creation of learning partnerships and learning cultures. The schools can become a place to learn rather than a place to teach."
The other side of the argument is often represented by Clifford Stoll, an astronomer and computer expert in Oakland, Calif., who says learning, no matter what the tool for it, will not -- and should not -- change.
 
'Learning Is Work'
"Maybe I'm the weird one," Mr. Stoll said, "but I never thought learning was supposed to be fun. It requires discipline, responsibility and attention in class. Learning is work. Turning scholarship and class work into a game is to denigrate the most important thing we can do in life. Someone has to react against all this bogus stuff."
And yet, the stuff may not be all bogus.
Research on the impact of computers on learning has produced some encouraging results, at least in the upper grades. College and high school students learning algebra with computers have done markedly better than those without them in a series of tests, according to Kenneth R. Koedinger, professor of psychology and computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University.
And while basics like reading and arithmetic have not yet been shown to be affected, other skills like communication, presentation and initiative-taking have been.
Many experts also point to the ease with which writing and editing are done on a computer screen and to a computer's ability to track individual achievement by recording the progress of each child.
As a better edited, age-appropriate version of the Web is provided to youngsters, by Scholastic, MaMaMedia and the like, the more useful computers will be.
Linda G. Roberts, director of the Office of Educational Technology of the Department of Education, says that I.B.M. is on the verge of a breakthrough whereby computers will recognize the individual speech of pupils, allowing the machines to give feedback to children reading aloud.
The difficulty, of course, is that technology developers always seem to be on the verge of something big and it is hard to know which high-priced invention will pan out. Early Apple computers, seen as so vital a decade ago, were never much used and are sitting in dusty corners of schoolrooms across the country. CD-ROM's may go the way of the phonograph if the Internet really becomes easy to manipulate.
 
Rethinking
Meanwhile, billions of dollars are spent, music and art programs suffer neglect, libraries go unstocked. And therein lies the dilemma.
"At the moment, the most mindless use of computers is at the elementary school level," said Judah L. Schwartz, professor of education at Harvard University. "I hope that the introduction of computers will produce a rethinking of the structure and content of the curriculum. In fact, if putting computers in the schools produces only that, it will make it all worth it."

The Metropolis in a Square Block

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
A SIGN on a building at the corner of Seventh Avenue and West 18th Street bears the names of two dentists, Dr. Andrew B. Schenkel and Dr. Joseph Sachs. "Used to be just Dr. Schenkel," said Tom Shachtman, struggling to contain his curiosity as he walked past. "I haven't called them. At this point I'd just be bothering them."
Not long ago, any evidence of change in the commerce of this block would have found Mr. Shachtman on the scene, notebook in hand. An award-winning documentary film maker and author of books on subjects from serial killers to beautiful villages in New England, Mr. Shachtman has just come out with a new book, "Around the Block: The Business of a Neighborhood" that chronicles a year in the life of one square block of Manhattan, from Seventh to Eighth Avenues between 17th and 18th Streets. 
 Starting in spring 1993, this chunk of Chelsea became his Samoa. In his scrutiny of entrepreneurial life, he came to admire virtually every small business owner he studied.
"I was knocked out by how hard they all work, how much raw intelligence they bring to the task," Mr. Shachtman said.
Though the book has enough nuts-and-bolts economics to qualify as a text in a business course, he has a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater, not an M.B.A. One could almost hear Gypsy Rose Lee's mother singing about her disdain for the humdrum life in "Some People" from the musical "Gypsy," as Mr. Shachtman spoke of "a certain vitality to small business that appeals to people who want more than to just pay the rent."
Though he says he chose the block for its ordinariness, it served up a generous share of human drama. Maxwell Lumber, for example, owes its continued family ownership to a suicide committed for insurance money. Jung-ok Hwang, the Korean-born owner of the House of Cheers liquor store, who had bought and sold furs in Europe and Canada, had to take courses to learn about wine and the liquor business before the Italian owner of the shop would agree to sell it to him.
Mostly, though, the book chronicles mundane setbacks and advances: a dry cleaner's sacrifice of space to raise money for repairs, the instant success of a bakery's oversized muffin, a bicycle messenger service's race against fax machines. Triumphs were in abundance.
Mr. Shachtman said he chose the year of his study arbitrarily. "I thought, let's snip off these frames of film and see what we can see there," he recalled. It turned out to be an action movie. A budding economic recovery, relatively low rents and Chelsea's booming gay scene had entrepreneurs primed for risk-taking, and that is what stirs Mr. Shachtman's blood.
His interest in business did not, however, entice him into the midsized Manhattan textile concern founded by his grandfather and handed down to his father. Second-generation proprietors have a place in his book, but what fascinated him most were the neophytes, like Myron Michaels.
A former Long Island high school science teacher, Mr. Michaels opened an optical shop, Sight on Seventh, just as Mr. Shachtman began his research. Mr. Michaels, whose shop was initially criticized by a neighboring merchant for being "too Upper East Side," became progressively more hip, both in the kind of merchandise he carried and in the way he dressed, as he fell in love with the neighborhood.
It is not, strictly speaking, Mr. Shachtman's neighborhood. A Manhattan native who is 55, he lives in Greenwich Village with his wife, Harriet Shelare, who works in public relations, and a 17-year-old son, Daniel. (Another son, Noah, 26, is an editor at a New York publishing house.)
Mr. Shachtman, who has written 20 other books, several with co-authors, reports regularly to a desk at the Writers Room on Astor Place, which he calls "an urban writers' colony."
But for this book, he spent hours on "his" block in Chelsea, logging numbers of passers-by, watching waves of workers emerge from the subway in the morning and conducting exhaustive interviews in grubby printing shops and glitzy restaurants.
With more than 100 little businesses and only 3 big ones (at the time, Barneys New York; Cahners, a publishing company; and Nynex), the block generated a gross annual product Mr. Shachtman estimated at $1.5 billion for 1992, about 0.5 percent of the city's total. It was an ideal laboratory. Mr. Shachtman interviewed the owners of some 75 businesses.
He had already studied family businesses in "Skyscraper Dreams: The Great Real Estate Dynasties of New York," published by Little, Brown in 1991. In "Around the Block" he wanted to explore the dreams of more modest business owners. His enthusiasm for the people he met during his research for that book had him itching to take a visitor around the block, where, he said, "I'm not a well-known neighborhood character. I am more a fly-on-the-wall thing."
But this is a fly who knows how to buzz with the locals. He dropped by House of Cheers to say hello to Mr. Hwang, and stopped into James Harb's architecture studio, where he admired a photograph of a spectacular home Mr. Harb had built in the Catskills. At the Chisholm-Larsson Gallery, he chatted with Robert Chisholm, the gallery's co-owner, about a recent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.
Mr. Shachtman's book has been well thumbed by some of its subjects. "Of course when I saw it had an index, who could resist going to those parts first?" said Mr. Chisholm, whom Mr. Shachtman credits with being a pioneer on the block, even before Barneys New York stamped the area as chi-chi in the early 80's with its expansion and purchases of real estate.
Mr. Harb, who opened his office on the block around that time because Barney's had commissioned several projects from his firm, said, "I found it very illuminating that on this little block one walks every day there are eight million stories." He added, "I think the neighborhood is such a terrific mix."
In Mr. Shachtman's view, small businesses will remain part of the mix. Barney's downtown store is closed, and some of the other businesses discussed in the book have failed or relocated. But half of them have expanded or plan to, he said.
Mr. Shachtman says "Around the Block" is not an only-in-New-York story. "It could be replicated all over the United States," he said, in cities with pockets of similar population density and affluence. But even if names and addresses were concealed, this Chelsea block would be about as well disguised as Gotham City.

Chart: "PULSE -- STREET ACTION"
Some examples of the ebb and flow of commerce on one Chelsea block from 1993 to 1994:
 
CALL IT LUCK -- A radio host criticizes the Raymond Dragon boutique on Seventh Avenue and 17th Street for its window display of two scantily clad male mannequins embracing. Passersby spit on the window but the display draws customers. The store launches a catalog and expands its manufacturing business.
 
ARTIST IN, SCHOOL OUT -- William Wegman, known for his Weimeraner photographs, buys the West 18th Street building that houses the Chelsea Day School and puts in a studio and rooms for dogs. The school moves to West 14th Street.
 
GOING UPSCALE -- The Pasta Pot, a struggling shabby restaurant on the southeast corner of 18th Street and Eighth Avenue, finally closes. A sleek new bistro, the Viceroy, takes its place and packs them in.
 
PACKING IT IN -- With mounting debts, outmolded equipment and an inability to broaden his client base, Carl Berman folds his business on West 18th Street, Guild Mailing Service, in the spring of 1994. Mr. Berman, an amateur herpetologist who collects rare lizards, moves upstate.

South Korean Chaos Could Eventually Mean Opportunity

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN

 BODY:
AN investor in the Mexican stock market at the beginning of 1995, when the country was mired in a currency crisis, could have doubled his money over the last three years.
So with the International Monetary Fund putting together an aid package for South Korea, aggressive investors are no doubt pondering: Will stock opportunities prove to be as appealing this time around?
With its mighty industrial base, educated work force, and high savings rate, South Korea may well be a good place for investment in the long run. But as was true with Mexico, there is no reason to rush in. 
 Even though the devaluation of the Mexican peso occurred in late 1994, and an American-led rescue was cobbled together quickly, the stock market did not hit bottom until March 1995. Anyone who sat out the entire year and then ventured into the Mexican market still enjoyed a 75 percent gain for the last two years.
In South Korea, the political and financial situation will remain uncertain for some time. The I.M.F. has not yet announced its proposals for change in return for financial assistance. And a new Government in South Korea -- to be elected on Dec. 18 -- will have to set its economic policies.
Even in the best-case scenario, if the country's leaders muster the political will to take austerity measures, strengthen the banking system and secure a generous international aid package, South Korea will not return to financial health soon.
"Countries do not emerge from banking crises in six months," said Morris Goldstein, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics and a former I.M.F. official. "It usually takes three to four years."
Given the unpredictability of the financial crisis engulfing Southeast Asia, caution is urged in South Korea.
"Certainly, it is not a time for the general investor to look at investing," said Jeffrey Shafer, vice chairman of Salomon Brothers International and Under Secretary for International Affairs at the Treasury Department during Mexico's crisis. Still, "people who know the country very well may be able to find attractive opportunities."
After paring their holdings to the bone, some money managers specializing in Asia are starting to bottom-fish. They say the slide this year in Korean stocks, 37 percent in the local currency and 54 percent in dollars, has left several of the country's healthier blue chips trading at fire-sale prices.
"I don't see how these world-class companies can go down any more," said Frank Chiang, manager of the Montgomery Emerging Asia Fund, who added that he sold his Korean holdings in early November. "When market sentiment changes, these stocks should pick up 20 to 30 percent."
Mr. Chiang said he would tiptoe into a few Korean stocks in the next few weeks, stopping at about 2 percent of his $35 million portfolio, which has declined 19 percent this year through October. The market now trades for well below book value, he said, versus one to two times book a year ago.
John J. Lee, manager of Scudder, Stevens & Clark's closed-end Korea Fund, likes Pohang Iron and Steel, known as Posco. Stock in the steel producer is now trading for less than 10 times this year's expected earnings. The American depository receipts closed Friday at $16.75. Because the amount that foreigners can own in a South Korean company is limited, foreign investors paid a premium of 40 percent for Posco as recently as three months ago, he said. That premium has now virtually disappeared.
Mr. Lee said another good bet is SK Telecom, South Korea's dominant mobile telecommunications provider and his fund's biggest holding. Although he expects earnings to grow by a hefty 35 percent this year, the stock now trades for a mere 14 times this year's earnings. The A.D.R. closed Friday at $5.9375, and its premium has dwindled to 5 to 10 percent. Because his top priority is to insulate his fund -- already off 49 percent this year -- from excessive risk, Mr. Lee says he now has 15 percent in cash.
He is also sticking with large, well-known entities, particularly exporters whose goods will become more attractive as the Korean currency, the won, falls. He is shunning banks and companies with excessive debt.
Many of South Korea's problems can be traced to excessive Government influence in banking decisions, a practice that has caused banks to funnel loans to favored companies regardless of risk. In recent years, that has led to excessive investment in the automobile and petrochemical industries, among others. With other Asian countries pursuing similar markets, seven of Korea's vaunted industrial conglomerates have gone bankrupt this year, leaving the nation's banks with a mounting pile of bad loans -- much of it to be repaid to foreigners in yen, dollars and marks. With the won losing value, that debt has become expensive to service, and foreign lenders are reluctant to roll it over.
Though the I.M.F.'s presence will help, recent declines in the Thailand and Indonesian markets have shown that it will not be enough. To win investors' confidence, South Korea will need to make significant changes in its banking system, improve corporate disclosure, strengthen regulatory agencies, open its financial markets and break the lifetime employment habit in corporations. This bitter medicine could depress the economy and stock prices even further.
Even worse, if Asia's troubled economies unleash exports onto world markets, Korean companies could be caught in debilitating price wars with rivals.
"Earnings are not necessarily going to be there in the short term," said Douglas Wilde, international investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. "If you are willing to take a longer-term view -- say, from three to five years -- you could be generously rewarded, because Korean companies are world-class companies and they will come back."

HEADLINE: The Fitness Gurus

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
THE man and the woman were facing each other, crouched down low, their arms out in front of them as if to ward off blows. They were sweating as they hopped around menacingly to the arena rock thumping in the low, hot, mirrored basement of the Crunch gym on Lafayette Street. Then the instructor barked a short command and Michael Linstroth, a 25-year-old actor, grabbed the right arm of a 25-year-old teacher named Robyn Poarch and slung her over his shoulder.
A coed wrestling class may not seem like the ideal activity at 9 A.M. on a cold, damp November Saturday, but about 10 women and 4 men, most in their 20's, showed up for it. The program, which was really more aerobics than wrestling, lasted about an hour, and when it was over the reviews were ecstatic. 
 "How many times do you get to flip a woman in public and get praised for it?" said Mr. Linstroth, chuckling.
Even by the city's Darwinian standards, competition in the New York gym business is tough these days. From employing drag-queen aerobics instructors and live deejays in the weight room to installing in-line-skating-simulation machines, the local gyms are trying harder than ever to entertain their jaded customers.
"Ten years ago New York was lackluster in its development of first-rate, dynamic, energized and entertaining fitness clubs," said John McCarthy of the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association. "Today it has taken the lead from Los Angeles in terms of trends."
The owners of the hot local gyms -- the New York gym gurus -- are driving this. Most of them are survivors of the 80's when the aerobics studios folded into the weight-lifting rooms and health spas to form full-service gyms; and of the 90's when there was a gym-building boom and many less savvy operators went under.
Today the gurus are tensing up for a new round of conflict. Most plan to open new sites and while they all offer just about the same equipment and services, they have strikingly different visions of the future.
Roland W. Betts of the Sports Center at Chelsea Piers is banking on a huge, mall-like gym with an accent on sports, while Bob Giardina of New York Sports Clubs has the Gap approach. He wants a gym in every neighborhood. Doug Levine of Crunch is using theatrical exercises and marketing techniques to sell his gyms and his products to the MTV generation while the Erricos of Equinox Fitness Clubs are promoting wellness to stay in touch with the aging customer. Alan Finger sees the future in yoga. David Barton is keeping it simple. And Richard Miller of the Gym Source is looking for the next hot exercise machine.
They shy away from criticizing one another in public, but behind the scenes they are locked in a death struggle for clients, gym-friendly real estate and most important, the sexy new trends that will keep them ahead of the curve. Some of what they come up with may seem a bit over the top, but there are hard business reasons behind it.
"The real reason is nobody wants to exercise," Mr. Miller said.
Conventional wisdom is that gyms lose at least 20 percent of their members a year because most members find exercise boring and frustrating. The successful gyms are those who have learned to keep their members happy by distracting them with endless rounds of new gadgets and games. And a new trend can give a gym identity.
Whatever their strategies are, all of the gyms are planning to expand and many of them have gone into debt to do so. And there are many people in the business who believe that not all of them will survive, particularly if there is a downturn in the economy.
"There will be a shakeout in this industry," said Kevin Sagafi, chief operating officer of New York Health and Racquet Club. "Some of the clubs will go down and they will be bought out by the others."
On the other hand, there are many who say that as the baby boomers worry more about death, and as the children they raised to believe in fitness get some money, the gym boom will be booming for some time.
"I think there is still room for more clubs, which is sort of amazing," said Nicole Dorsey, who covers the gyms for Fitness magazine.
Ponder the future of fitness with the gym gurus of New York.
 
 
 
Roland Betts And the Show at Chelsea Piers
 The six-lane swimming pool at the Sports Center at Chelsea Piers was filled with grown men and women, their bodies stuffed into large inner tubes, their legs in the air. It was 9 P.M. on a recent Thursday and they were sloshing around after a little ball, laughing and shrieking at the referee of this weekly game of coed inner tube water polo.
"This is like being on vacation," said a 37-year-old pet-supply retailer, Amy Shapiro, as she relaxed in the hot tub after the game. "This is, in essence, a place to play."
Ms. Shapiro's reaction is music to the ears of Mr. Betts, 51, a movie producer who is part-owner of the Texas Rangers and the Chelsea Piers complex, where the Sports Center is located. It is Mr. Betts's vision that the future of gyms lies in combining sports that people do for fun, like basketball, Rollerblading and water polo, with the more traditional forms of exercise like running or weight lifting. His idea is to make his gym fun, rather than a place for a quick, painful workout.
"People care about the equipment they work out on and they want all the sports," Mr. Betts said. "This is a place not to spend a half hour, but to spend a good amount of time."
Most clubs combine sports with exercise these days. But the Sports Center, which opened in 1996, has taken this to a new level. Members don't just take a kick-boxing class, they learn in an actual ring. They don't kayak in a pool but in the Hudson River. When they run, they do so on a quarter-mile indoor track. Volleyball games are at an indoor sand beach. Aside from its sophisticated equipment, the Sports Center's main advantage is its size; it is built on a restored pier that juts about three football fields into the river, giving the gym 150,000 square feet of space on one level.
The Sports Center is part of a movement toward building ever-larger gyms. The Reebok Sports Club/NY, a 140,000-square-foot gym on six floors, opened on 67th Street and Columbus Avenue in 1995. Mr. Betts and Nanette Pattee Francini, who lives in Los Angeles and runs the Reebok club in New York, say the future is in such big gyms, which can offer the best of everything under one roof. It's the mall approach.
 
 
 
Bob Giardina: The Gap Approach
 But there are many in the gym business who say that New Yorkers prize quickness and convenience above all else.
Bob Giardina, the president of New York Sports Clubs, envisions a neighborhood gym of the future with a lightning-fast check-in system, computer kiosks that give members useful information and a gym that can easily be converted as exercise fashions change.
"The focus here becomes, how can I get you what you need in the quickest amount of time and still make it entertaining and fun," said Mr. Giardina, a lively 40-year-old who has been in the business about 20 years.
His first step is having as many gyms as possible. New York Sports already has 30 places in the city, and the company just raised around $85 million to buy at least 10 more. At about $1,100 for a first-year membership, the clubs do not feature all the luxury of a Reebok, the city's most expensive at about $3,000 for initiation and a year's dues, or the grand gadgetry of a Chelsea Piers, which is about $1,400 for the first year.
"New York Sports is the club that ate New York," said Ms. Dorsey of Fitness magazine. "It is a quality club for the masses."
Mr. Giardina is experimenting with electronic check-in cards that will allow faster entry and exit and allow his staff to monitor when, where and how long each of the company's 80,000 New York City clients is using the gyms. If a client is not coming, he or she will receive a telephone call asking if there is anything New York Sports can do to improve the situation. Personal attention like this, Mr. Giardina says, will become more important as competition between gyms grows.
He is also anticipating that stretching will become quite important as more people deal with exercise-related injuries. But New York Sports gyms are not designed with any areas dedicated to one fitness trend. Mr. Giardina envisions the gym of the future as an empty box filled with equipment that can be moved in, out and around as exercise tastes change.
"If I am flexible and stay close to my customer then I don't need to know how I'm going to change," he said. "I know I'll be able to do it."
One way that he intends to stay close is through computers. Today, you can log on to the gym's Web site and get a trial membership, or discover the times and locations of classes they want to take. Soon they will be able to use interactive terminals at the gyms to learn about nutrition, plan a workout, meet other gym members or advertise their business.
 
 
 
Doug Levine: Sweat and Theater
 High up in his University Place office, Doug Levine, the 38-year-old former stockbroker who started Crunch in 1989, is pondering a future in which gyms and exercises will become more theatrical and gym logos will be marketable on clothing and other products. An example of his thinking is at the just-opened Crunch in Los Angeles, where a frosted-glass passage runs between the men's and women's showers, exposing the outlines of the bathers to passers-by.
"People say Crunch is like a record company," Mr. Levine said. "We try to find the next hit."
Mr. Levine has five gyms in New York, in addition to the one each in Los Angeles and Tokyo. Membership costs about $800 a year. But what keeps the gym's mostly young clientele coming back is its skillful marketing, which tries to stay one step ahead in an urban, self-mocking and inclusive way. Crunch's motto is: "No judgments."
One typical Crunch advertisement features a photograph of a man in a bunny suit holding a basketball and standing by a graffiti-covered wall. The text reads: "The thing that really creeps me out about basketball is when you're playing against some guy you've never met before, yet he knows all this secret stuff about your mama."
Exercise classes at Crunch are also outlandish. In addition to coed wrestling, members can take Abs, Thighs and Gossip, presided over by a drag queen named Anthony Truly, who says things like, "It's no fun being beautiful if nobody hates you"; recently the club offered Cyked, a yoga class taught on stationary bicycles in a candle-lighted room; and a current offering is Capoeira, described as an "Afro-Brazilian blend of dance, aerobics and self-defense." It is this kind of class that Mr. Levine hopes to parlay into salable products.
Crunch now sells creams for hair and skin, videos, CD's and clothing. There are plans in the works for sneaker and sunglasses lines. The Crunch exercise program is broadcast twice a day on the cable station ESPN2.
On the gym front, Mr. Levine is looking to put exercise machines in virtual-reality caves that would simulate any environment or let the exerciser play a video game. Other ideas under development are rooms that act as living video games. Chelsea Piers already has something like this: a floor covered in large dots that light randomly while a person hops around trying to touch them.
 
 
 
Richard Miller: The Limits of Technology
 Recently, manufacturers have been experimenting with strength-training machines that can add or subtract weight electronically and tell the user whether he or she is lifting that weight properly. Richard Miller of the Gym Source says this approach will not work.
"People love to put on the weight themselves and hear them crash," he said. "It's people's last link to being physically bohemian."
Mr. Miller was sitting in the basement office of his store on East 52d Street recently, surrounded by a veritable medieval torture chamber of metal and plastic devices. Where he does see computerization working is in so-called cardiovascular machines like treadmills, stationary bicycles and rowing machines.
"The cardio machines will get more computerized, especially in monitoring the body," he said. "And there will be a great deal of virtual reality."
The talk around the gyms is that elevating one's heart rate to specific levels for specific amounts of time is the most efficient way to get results. So the newest machines have metal pads on the handlebars to show one's heart rate. The equipment will also do more and more things to divert and inform.
"You will be able to watch television, log on to the Internet, trade bonds," Mr. Miller said. "And the machine will remember every time you ever exercised on it."
 
 
 
The Erricos Appeal to Aging Boomers
 If you want to know where the Errico siblings, Lavinia, Vito and Danny, think the gym business is going, head over to the 45,000-square-foot Equinox gym they are constructing at 63d and Lexington. Pass the juice bar and the retail shop, the aerobics and spinning studios, the sound-proofed yoga room, the pool and the spa. And go directly to the women's showers, where each client has her own changing stall.
"We know that our customers are getting older," Vito Errico said. "And with that new dynamic, we really felt that people might like more privacy."
The Erricos will have five gyms in the city when the Lexington branch opens in December. Like the gyms, the siblings are chic, upscale and a little flashy. It costs about $1,400 for a first-year membership.
The age of the gym client is going up in general, as the baby boomers move into middle age. The Equinox theory is that people in their 30's and 40's are less concerned with being thin and more concerned with feeling good, and that people in their 50's and up just want to stay healthy.
"When we first got into this it was all physical," Lavinia Errico said. "Now we realize that you can be fit but unhealthy."
Equinox is betting on a future in which people use gyms for what is often referred to in the business as mind-body. The approach includes stretching, dietary changes, vitamin supplements (which Equinox will sell) and meditation to promote good digestion, sleep, sex and a sense of well-being.
"In the future, insurance companies are going to work with health clubs to make sure their clients are staying healthy," said Mr. Sagafi, of the New York Health and Racquet Club, which features underwater treadmills for older knees. "There will also be physical therapists in gyms."
 
 
 
Alan Finger: Betting on Yoga
 About 40 people stood on mats, bent at the waist, with their left arms pointed at the ceiling. Alan Finger, the founder of Yoga Zone, a five-year-old company with two locations in the city, walked among them, his hand straying here and there to correct a posture.
"In and out," he said in his South African accent. "Exhale. Hold your breath. Use your breath to start to shape your consciousness."
In Mr. Finger's view, the future of physical fitness will not entirely belong to the gyms. He knows that almost all of the aerobics studios of the 80's were forced to close when gyms began to offer their sport. He also knows that gyms are now all offering yoga. But he says there is room for a smaller studio.
"Yoga will grow more and more," Mr. Finger said. "The gyms will try to incorporate yoga, but I think yoga is too profound and deep to be merged into a gym, because it is spiritual."
Mr. Finger, and his wife, Greta, have taken on a partner -- Howard Maier, the man responsible for the famed "Buns of Steel" videos -- and have just come out with their first catalogue of products and a yoga-at-work program. But they are not about to add many new studios or sell out to the gyms.
 
 
 
David Barton Getting Personal
 While his competitors race to add every new service available and expand as fast as they can, David Barton, who has three gyms in the city, is taking a more conservative approach. "I don't want to be all things to all people," he said, though he said he will add a few gyms.
Mr. Barton is an unlikely spokesman for simplicity. He is a 33-year-old fire plug of a man, so laden with muscles that it affects his posture, who is given to dying his hair and wearing T-shirts that say: "Look better naked." It is his theory that the future will go to gyms that are small, offer personal training and achieve results with as basic and economical a workout as possible.
"There will be a gym on every corner," he said. "And a place that can get results will win out over this corporate fast-food philosophy."
 
At Low End, Health's Not What Counts
THE future of gyms does not belong just to the rich and famous. Lucille Roberts, an immigrant from Siberia who opened her first gym in 1969 and has big plans, caters to the low-cost customer.
"It is only the upper classes who are into exercise for health," she said. "The middle classes just want to look good. We have tried health classes. They just want to fit into tight jeans."
In New York City, most of the cheaper gyms -- say, those under $700 for a year's membership -- are the less-sophisticated neighborhood clubs with only one or two locations. Many are being bought by chains, especially New York Sports Clubs, which upgrade them and charge more.
For Lucille Roberts, whose gyms are named after her, the key to the future is rapid expansion and corporate uniformity.
"We are working on a standardized exercise program," said Ms. Roberts, who says her under-$200-a-year gyms are pitched at female clients like the secretary, the teacher and the policeman's wife. "It will be like a McDonald's, where you know what you get in every place."
Each gym would have a computer with instructions that would tell staff members how to arrange the equipment, run the club and teach exercise classes down to the last step. In short, members would have the same experience, no matter which Lucille Roberts club they worked out in.
This year, Ms. Roberts bought 17 gyms in the region from the troubled Living Well Lady chain. She now has 47 clubs in the area. The 24 in the city have more than 300,000 members. Her plans are to double those numbers in the next decade and to franchise her name across the world.
Ms. Roberts says that lower- and middle-income customers need new machines and new exercises just as wealthier ones do. But with all the innovations and differing recipes for good health, she also sees a backlash.
"People are very confused with everything that is out there," she said. "They don't know what to do, and so they are headed back to basics." EDWARD LEWINE

Paying Off a Mortgage: Is Fast Always Smart?

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
FOR years, prepaying a mortgage by putting extra money toward principal each month seemed like sound financial advice for those who have extra cash. Recently, lenders have started preaching the prepayment gospel with a new fervor, aggressively marketing mortgages that are paid off every other week rather than monthly, one of the hot products in the home loan business these days.
And at first glance, these loans -- known as biweekly mortgages -- look like no-brainers; make 26 half payments a year instead of 12 full payments, and the extra annual payment shortens a 30-year home loan to about 22 years, saves a homeowner tens of thousands of dollars in interest and builds equity much faster. Many biweeklies are based on direct withdrawals of the payment by the bank, too; lenders love this, as it takes away the borrower's "float" and eliminates paperwork. 
 The hype, however, may not match the amount of help these biweekly mortgages provide borrowers. "I don't think there is a tremendous benefit to the biweekly mortgage -- it's nominal at best," said Neil E. Bader, the chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage Company, a mortgage broker in Manhattan.
He said that a borrower, before prepaying a mortgage, should always pay off non-deductible debt and debt that has a higher interest rate than the family mortgage -- which means virtually all debt, especially on credit cards. "If you get a mortgage at like 7 or 8 percent, you are really only paying 4 or 5 percent after the tax deduction," Mr. Bader said. "It's probably the cheapest money you will ever borrow."
Then there is the time value of money. Even in these low inflation days, it matters. Why pay off a long-term loan with 1997 dollars? Ten years from now, that same monthly mortgage payment will have, effectively, shrunk by 30 to 50 percent even if inflation stays at 2 to 4 percent over the next 10 years. "When you take inflation into account, and most people don't, I don't really think it pays to prepay," Mr. Bader said.
Consider, too, the fees on biweekly mortgages. Lenders say they like biweeklies because such mortgages reap a little extra fee income and keep customers happy and in the lender's loan portfolio; they charge up to $500 in advance and $5 or so a month for the life of the loan to convert an existing mortgage to a biweekly schedule or originate one. On a $100,000 mortgage, that means a borrower would be paying the equivalent of a half a point, just for this service. (A point is an origination fee that is equal to 1 percent of the mortgage amount; by paying points up front, a borrower can obtain a lower interest rate.)
Small change compared with the thousands saved by paying biweekly? Well, true. But also consider that prepaying is something borrowers can do quite easily themselves -- for free -- on most mortgages.
Keep in mind, too, that a borrower who has a biweekly mortgage has, essentially, a 22-year mortgage rather than the 30-year loan she qualified for. That sounds great if the only reason she took a 30-year was because she could not qualify for a shorter-term loan.
But considering that with a biweekly mortgage the lender's interest rate exposure is shortened, in theory, the interest rate on the loan should be lowered, as well. At least, that's what happens when a homeowner chooses a 15-year mortgage instead of a 30-year mortgage. The gap between the interest rate for the two terms is currently about a third of a percentage point.
Small change again? Sure, but if that biweekly mortgage was even a sixth of a percentage point lower than the 30-year rate, the savings would cover the fees for the program and then some.
"Biweekly mortgages are unnecessary, and there are very few people for whom they would be a good idea," said Marc Eisenson of Elizaville, N.Y., an authority on mortgage prepayments and the author of "The Banker's Secret." (Good Advice Press, 800-255-0899)
Mr. Eisenson says those who still want to prepay can -- by making the regular monthly payment, then adding any prepayment amount, for example, one-twelfth of the regular monthly principal payment.
Making the extra payments that way also gives a borrower flexibility; should a financial calamity hit -- layoff, illness -- the borrower can scale back to the regular payment.
Of course, flexibility is also the reason why most people cannot stick to a voluntary program of accelerated payments. John P. David and Pamela J. Gonsky bought a home in Miami in April and recently converted their $154,000, 30-year mortgage to a biweekly one.
"Like most people with a new 30-year mortgage, we have grand plans to try to pay off our mortgage earlier, make payments against the principal and try to cut the term, " said Mr. David, a public relations executive. "But we haven't made any additional payments, yet. Maybe with the 'accelerated payments' as they call it, we can make a dent just by paying every other week -- and have something to hold us to it, like direct deposit."
Though they will save $90,000 in interest over 20 years with a biweekly mortgage, Mr. David also said it was unlikely that they would keep this loan that long, so the savings would be smaller; on average, mortgages are paid for seven years before the home is sold or the loan refinanced. He noted, too, that they will pay about $1,500 in fees over the life of the loan. "Unfortunately, the banks have a zillion ways to take our money," he said. "At least, in this case, I get some benefit."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Shoe Leather Debate

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
AMID the typical pre-Thanksgiving torpor and buzz, a few clues last week hinted that something was amiss at the New York University Department of Journalism and Mass Communication. There were the uncollected messages on the office door of the graduate studies' chairman. The cancellation of his Tuesday class. And the letter posted in the elevator that announced, in the terse style of a man accustomed to economy of expression, his resignation.
The decision by the chairman, William Serrin, to quit the helm of N.Y.U.'s graduate program in journalism after two and a half years came less than a week after a rancorous faculty meeting that had been convened to discuss the future direction of the department. Mr. Serrin's make-the-deadline approach (he is a former New York Times reporter) angered some faculty members; he, in turn, described some of the criticism at the meeting as "savage." 
 The dispute reflects a larger debate about how journalism education should respond to changes in the profession, where the definition of news seems to be constantly shifting and traditional media like newspapers, magazines and television are both embracing and competing with new media like Web sites.
For N.Y.U., the question is whether to emphasize an intellectual attitude toward journalism that encourages students to analyze and critique the media or to focus primarily on teaching practical skills like its uptown rival, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
"The division is over whether the profession can best be improved through criticism or through performance," said Michael Norman, who teaches writing and a course on journalistic traditions at N.Y.U.
Mr. Serrin, who as head of the department had made an effort to upgrade instruction in reporting and writing, said he had worked "to keep a foot in both camps." But some faculty members still saw him as more of a traditionalist.
The Columbia program, often called the boot camp of journalism because of the way it intensively drills students in the skills of reporting and writing, has also been re-evaluating itself. But the school, now under the stewardship of a new dean, Tom Goldstein, has long been committed to a nuts-and-bolts approach to training future journalists. Its response to the changes in the profession has been largely practical. It is putting the finishing touches on a Center for New Media, for example, and all students are now required to master the basics of print, broadcasting and computer-based media.
And though the school is in the midst of what Mr. Goldstein called a self-study, administrators are exploring not the philosophical underpinnings of the program but such questions as whether it has too many students, whether it crams too intense a workload into nine months and whether it should add courses so students could specialize in particular areas, like business or art.
While journalism at Columbia is taught in a separate professional school in the university, journalism at N.Y.U. is taught in a department in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Perhaps that helps explain why the N.Y.U. program has a more academic bent.
At N.Y.U., there seem to be as many answers to the question of what a journalism education should offer as there are faculty members. "It's a very democratic department," said William Burrows, a professor there for 23 years. "Maybe to a fault." Mr. Serrin said there has been a longstanding split between the "critics and essayists" and the "so-called professional journalists."
Mr. Norman, another former New York Times reporter, is among those who argue that the department ultimately serves students and the profession best by teaching aspiring journalists to write and report.
"I think we need to embrace the profession much more," he said. "We need more programs to bring professionals in, and we need to send professors out to work in newspapers."
Robert Manoff, the director of the department's Center for War, Peace and the News Media, favors what he calls a "radical approach." He said the program should push students "to get at not the situational truth, but the existential truth," and to say "something deep about the human condition."
Mitchell Stephens, a department professor who studies the fall of the written word and the rise of the image, put it this way: "Instead of merely replicating the practice of journalism, we are trying to encourage it at its most thoughtful." He added, "This is where journalism is being rethought."
In the N.Y.U. journalism department, where it takes three semesters to earn a master's degree, the curriculum seems as eclectic as the faculty. The offerings include, on the one hand, "Writing and Reporting I" with Richard Blood, an adjunct professor and newspaper traditionalist who says he resents seeing people who have never practiced journalism teaching it. "Details, details, details," Mr. Blood thundered at students in a class on feature writing. "Show, don't tell. Too many of you tell me, tell me, tell me."
On the other hand, there is a course called "The Journalistic Tradition," which covers Dickens through Joan Didion. One of its instructors is Jay Rosen, a professor who is also head of the department's Project on Public Life and the Press and who has been a key figure in the controversial public journalism movement, whose supporters argue that journalists have an obligation to promote good citizenship. In a recent seminar, Mr. Rosen led students through a discussion of the points of view a reporter could take on any given story, before analyzing Norman Mailer's coverage of the 1960 Democratic National Convention.
At Columbia's Journalism School, the basic courses have expanded over the years to include broadcast and new media, but most of the course work still focuses on developing skills and professional ethics. During the two semesters it takes students to earn a master's degree in journalism, many students spend more time prowling the city for stories than debating ideas in class. Few do internships, unlike their counterparts at N.Y.U., who can get course credit for work at a newspaper, magazine, broadcast outlet or Internet company.
When it comes to reputation, Columbia has the edge. For one thing, it is more competitive. Out of 1,005 applicants for this year's class, 291, or 29 percent, were accepted. N.Y.U. received 400 applications from prospective students who wanted to enroll last fall and accepted 180, or 45 percent, of them.
Though a Columbia degree is no guarantee of a job -- many graduates end up in careers outside journalism -- the perception among applicants is that the program opens doors, in part because there are plenty of alumni in high-ranking media positions. That perception may be why more than three-quarters of those who were accepted into this year's class decided to enroll, compared with about half of those admitted to N.Y.U.'s graduate program.
"Columbia has the pedigree; N.Y.U. is more innovative and dynamic," said David Dent, a Columbia Journalism School alumnus who teaches journalism at N.Y.U.
Situated in Greenwich Village, N.Y.U. is also geographically well situated for a romance with nearby Silicon Alley, a fact that has not gone unnoticed at Columbia's Journalism School. "For most people in Silicon Alley, anything above 59th Street is basically Maine," said Andrew Lih, the director of technology at Columbia's Center for New Media.
Yet it is Columbia that has surged ahead in providing an education in new media to students, some of whom plan to go on to jobs at Internet-oriented companies or to start their own Web businesses. N.Y.U., meanwhile, has been trying for months to find a new director of digital journalism; the previous director, John Garcia, left to take a job at MSNBC.
Still, the N.Y.U. journalism program has come a long way in the last decade. It has its own six-story building on Washington Place and a full-time faculty of 19, many hired since 1990. (Columbia has a faculty of 32.) Recently, N.Y.U. spent several hundred thousand dollars on computer equipment for the department, and N.Y.U.'s dean of arts and sciences, Philip Furmanski, has agreed to allow it to hire several new instructors.
"I certainly see them as competition," Dean Goldstein of Columbia said of N.Y.U.
But rather than challenging the Goliath uptown head-on, the N.Y.U. journalism department appears to be maneuvering around it by carving out specialized niches that will distinguish it from Columbia.
For example, N.Y.U.'s science and environmental reporting program, which Mr. Burrows started 15 years ago, has gained a reputation for producing science journalists. And the cultural reporting and criticism concentration, started in 1994 by Ellen Willis, the feminist writer, has drawn a diverse pool of students more interested in media or arts criticism or alternative journalism than daily newspaper work.
Ms. Willis said the concentration had been inspired partly by the failure of journalism schools to address the "explosion of journalistic forms that started in the mid-1960's." Students practice and study everything from "social milieu reporting" to performance art criticism, using Greenwich Village culture as fodder.
But the cultural concentration has its critics in the department. "It's much too narrowly focused," Mr. Norman said. "It's lower Manhattan cultural reporting and criticism. There is no attempt to embrace the mainstream strains of American culture."
The department is considering several new specializations, in urban affairs and, like Columbia, in business and economics. And it is trying to develop another niche where Columbia does not have a dominant presence: magazine editing. The plan is to have students learn the history of magazines and how to generate ideas for articles and new publications. The department recently called in editors from magazines like Mademoiselle, Newsweek and Money to bounce the idea off them and see if they would participate in the program.
In the wake of Mr. Serrin's resignation, several professors sounded optimistic, saying the faculty would find a way to blend its intellectual and professional missions. And some said that the diversity of opinion is one of the department's strengths. "If everyone thought how I thought," Mr. Burrows said, "I would quit."
But several students waxed somewhat nostalgic not just for their departing chairman but also for what he seemed to represent. Bo Rosser described it as "hard-core journalism experience." She said: "You need some people like that. Otherwise, you become way out there."
Mr. Goldstein, meanwhile, seemed inclined toward a little N.Y.U.-style noodling. "In my ideal world," he said, "we would have a course on evidence and judgment -- understanding how lawyers, sociologists, journalists know things, and how they make judgments, how they are influenced by market questions and cultural relativity."

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: MICK FLEETWOOD;
There's No Stopping Tomorrow

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it will soon be here
Open your eyes, look at the day
You'll see things in a different way
From "Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac 
 Mick Fleetwood is trying, maybe for the first time in his life, to think about tomorrow.
It's an about-face in the 50-year-old drummer's attitude toward money that could make him rich. By rights, Mr. Fleetwood should already be a zillionaire. For 30 years, the 6-foot-6-inch Briton has been the heart of the Fleetwood Mac band, whose top five albums alone have sold about 55 million copies, including "Rumours" in 1977, its first mega-hit and one of the 20 best sellers of all time.
But in those early days of glory, Mr. Fleetwood always lived for the moment, going through thousands of dollars of cocaine a month, refusing to listen to financial advisers' prognostications and impulsively buying up several homes, a $400,000 spread in Hawaii and a $1.8 million farm outside Sydney, Australia.
His buying spree eventually helped lead to disaster, forcing him to declare personal bankruptcy in the mid-1980's and put his "kingdom up for sale," as one Fleetwood Mac song described it.
Then the go-go 80's gave way to the sober 90's, and Mr. Fleetwood, going with the flow, did likewise. Six years ago, he decided to take charge of his life, and in an impressive turnaround, gave up cocaine and liquor cold turkey.
"After a while, it turned into a nightmare," Mr. Fleetwood recalled. "The party after the gig was sometimes more important than the gig." He has said that in those days, "I'd get off a plane. I'd have to meet a dealer. It was horrible, and you become beholden to it."
And then, finally, he continued, "It slaps you around the face, and you go: This has got to stop."
To be sure, sobriety has had its price. "I think life is more on the edge when you are horribly aware of what is going on all the time," Mr. Fleetwood said in an interview in Boston, one of the stops on a tour that brought Fleetwood Mac to New York last week. "If something is going to hit you, it will hit you head on when you are not stoned." Even so, he said, the price is worth it. "Don't kid yourself," he said. "Life is a lot more interesting now than the crazy things that one can remember, and I mean that one can remember."
Dressed in a blue cotton suit and a yellow gauze shirt, Mr. Fleetwood tucked his giant frame uncomfortably into a too-small chair in the dining room of the Bostonian Hotel. He repeatedly crossed and uncrossed his legs, as if nervously recalling incidents he would just as soon forget.
Mr. Fleetwood figures his sharper mental focus should enable him to hold onto his money this time around. And there should be plenty of it. A 44-city reunion tour of Fleetwood Mac's five most famous members, began on Sept. 17 in Hartford, and ends tonight in Washington. It is expected to bring Mr. Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie and John McVie about $3.5 million each, according to several industry experts. In addition, the tour should pump up sales of their old albums and generate about $600,000 more apiece in royalties.
PERHAPS Mr. Fleetwood's biggest challenge in securing his financial future will be to avoid the temptations endemic to the business: what he calls "the Chuck Berry Syndrome," the tendency of high-rolling musical performers like Mr. Berry, the rock-and-roll legend, to live from one big payoff to the next.
"Chuck would never walk on stage without having the cash handed to him," Mr. Fleetwood said. "It's the psychology of being a gigster. You play the gig and go back to the dressing room and say: 'This is for you, and this is for you.' It is very of the moment."
That freewheeling mentality made it easy for Mr. Fleetwood to throw his money around. And throw it around he did. "Mick likes real estate and restaurants," said Carl Stubner, Mr. Fleetwood's new manager, thinking back to his client's spendthrift days. Mr. Fleetwood's impulsive real-estate purchases led to his bankruptcy, and two subsequent restaurant investments turned out badly, as well.
This time around, Mr. Fleetwood is convinced he has a savvier team behind him. Mr. Stubner, 34, is a former stock broker and an agent at Deluxe Management, an artists' management firm in Los Angeles. And Mr. Fleetwood is now planning to turn over the bulk of his funds to David Manashe, a friend of Mr. Stubner and a stock broker at Dean Witter Reynolds, a unit of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
Mr. Stubner said he acts as a financial gatekeeper for Mr. Fleetwood, who is frequently approached with deals. "People solicit me," Mr. Stubner said. "They park themselves on my doorstep. I want to align him with people who have credibility." Mr Fleetwood has already met with Mr. Manashe and believes him to be a thorough researcher whose investment approach he will generally follow.
MR. STUBNER sees his role as more than just doling out financial counsel. He has helped Mr. Fleetwood put together a record label called Fleetwood Music, which is already working on its first album, "A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac." Happily for Mr. Fleetwood, "I am not putting my own capital up," he said. "I have partners." Atlantic Records puts up the money and, once it is recouped, shares the profits with Mr. Fleetwood. Such "tribute labels" are a common strategy these days of performers heading into middle age -- from the Rolling Stones to Bob Dylan -- who try to leverage their superstar status into a rich payoff.
Neither side would disclose details of the arrangement. But it is the venture's musical possibilities, not its financial potential, that seems to animate Mr. Fleetwood.
"It is a whole creative thing. The artistry behind it. I am going to do the artistic direction, not a record company," he said. Elton John has already recorded one track, while Jewel, Matchbox 20, Shawn Colvin and the Cranberries are also contributing to the compact disk that will be out in March.
Mr. Stubner views one of his tasks as cooling his client's high-risk passions for restaurants and real estate. Mr. Fleetwood currently owns a home in Los Angeles and another in Hawaii, and Mr. Stubner thinks that is quite enough. He may not be able to keep Mr. Fleetwood away from restaurants, however.
"I will probably venture into that again," Mr. Fleetwood said. "For me it is like having a gig every night." As to his failed 1994 restaurant venture in Washington, he acknowledges: "Carl wasn't real happy about it."
The one gig that doesn't hold much charm for him is poring over his investments. For that, he relies on Mr. Stubner and his third wife, Lynn Frankel, a 34-year-old former public-relations executive, whom he married in 1995 after a six-year relationship. Her late father had overseen Mr. Fleetwood's investments until his death two years ago.
Mr. Fleetwood's lack of curiosity about the way Ms. Frankel's father handled his money says much about his interest in the topic. "I don't know the specifics," Mr. Fleetwood said. "My wife's father had an adviser. Her father was very much into that whole New York Wall Street thing. He did very well."
That willingness to trust others is unusual even by celebrity standards. Mr. Fleetwood and Ms. Frankel never signed a prenuptial agreement, he says. And according to Brian Adams, a friend and former partner of a Los Angeles accounting firm and now a sole practitioner, in the 1970's, "He never read a contract agreement," preferring to put his faith in his advisers. Mr. Fleetwood's dyslexia may have played a part in his deference to others on financial matters, Mr. Adams added.
Mr. Fleetwood attributes that inattention to his "crazy, hazy period," rather than to dyslexia, and says he now does read agreements.
Several industry executives believe the current tour is more of a financial imperative for Mr. Fleetwood than for other members of the band. Though he declined to comment specifically on his net worth, he would say only half-kidding, "I'm not broke if that's what you mean." Whereas in contrast, Mr. Buckingham is said to have held onto his money, and Ms. Nicks has earned income from hit solo albums and royalties for songs she wrote.
Aside from his expected take of several million from the tour, another possible windfall awaits Mr. Fleetwood. In 1987, he said, he invested about $400,000 in the Hotz Corporation, a producer of computer software to make it easier for starting musicians to play music., started by his friend Jimmy Hotz. Suddenly, that move is looking smart. Last year, the Intel Corporation and other investors put up $2 million to help bring the product to market. If it takes off, the value of Mr. Fleetwood's stake could multiply.
Mr. Fleetwood realizes that the public, dazzled by the luxuriant life styles of some rock stars, would be disappointed by details of his own somewhat reduced circumstances. "We want to believe other people have grandeur," he said. "Why not? It is a question of whether you let that take over your life or you temper it and have fun with it."
Perhaps because he focuses so much on music and his fellow musicians rather than on his portfolio, his financial standing doesn't seem to be uppermost in his mind. It is his personality, after all, that is the glue that held Fleetwood Mac together in its early days and that has helped bring the members back together. "I'm really good with people," he said. "That's what it's all about. That creates vision and involvement and energy with other people."
His love affair with music began in his adolescence. Born in Cornwall, England, in 1947 to a career army officer and his homemaker wife, Mr. Fleetwood was sent to boarding schools and almost immediately encountered difficulties with his studies, the result, he later learned, of his dyslexia. Frustrated by his academic failure, he found solace in playing the drums, and by the age of 16 had run off to London to make his fortune in rock and roll.
WITHIN four years, he had joined John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan, to create Fleetwood Mac. Though the group was immediately successful in England, it did not hit the United States until 1969. A year later, Mr. Green left to lead an ascetic religious life. Then Mr. Spencer disappeared in Los Angeles and turned up as member of Children of God, a religious cult.
Though the group reconfigured several times, it was not until 1975, after Mr. Fleetwood asked the guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and the singer Stevie Nicks to join the band, that it hit the big time. The new group's first album, Fleetwood Mac, sold six million copies and hit No. 1 in November 1976.
Intimacy bred its own problems. Mr. Buckingham and Ms. Nicks, who had been romantically linked, separated. John and Christine McVie divorced. Drugs and liquor were a staple of life for some band members. At first the emotional turmoil seemed only to fuel the band's success. Its next album, "Rumours" sold 25 million copies worldwide. Tours were sold out.
But for Mr. Fleetwood, the addictions to drugs and spending were beginning to take their toll.
Becoming a heavy cocaine user in the late 1970's, he would buy drugs not only for himself but for friends, according to Mr. Adams, the accountant and one-time adviser to Mr. Fleetwood. "I will tell you that he was very generous," Mr. Adams recalled in a recent telephone interview. "There were a lot of people that glommed off him."
As his success grew, so did Mr. Fleetwood's appetite for real estate. He had a home in Bel Air and one in Malibu in California, the land in Hawaii and, in 1980, the farm in Australia. In none of the purchases did he have any particular purpose in mind.
Even Mr. Fleetwood has a hard time explaining his obsession with land, but he seems to have regarded it as a refuge from the turmoil of his life. "I was finding a way to create a creative kingdom, a safe harbor from what was a very crazy world at that point," Mr. Fleetwood recalled. "Australia was a very safe place."
His advisers warned him against the purchases, but Mr. Fleetwood now says that they didn't speak up enough. Celebrities, in his view, are sometimes indulged, just as children. "You often go out and buy them candy, and you know you shouldn't, because they're moody and crazy," he said. "But you still let them have it.
"In anyone's language, it was a lot of money," he added. "But I was not into doing a major amount of bean counting."
Had he been, he would have noticed that all his expenditures were eating up his shrinking cash flow. Most of his money flowed into property, not his drug habit, Mr. Adams calculates. Mr. Fleetwood, by contrast, told The Washington Post in a recent interview that he had spent $8 million over the years on cocaine.
After "Rumours," the band had negotiated a megadeal for "Tusk" in 1978. Mr. Fleetwood took a $2 million advance, but by the time he saw the Australian property in 1980, he had apparently spent it and had to borrow the $2 million purchase price from Security Pacific Bank. That loan was based on a guarantee from Warner Music, which in turn took all of Mr. Fleetwood's assets as collateral, according to documents filed in connection with the bankruptcy.
Payments of interest and principal on the loan were running at about $800,000 a year. Mr. Fleetwood's other expenses, including his various mortgages and alimony payments, brought his budget to about $1.6 million a year, according to Mr. Adams. And looming on the horizon was the huge tax on the $2 million advance.
Meanwhile, "Tusk" did not match the success of "Rumours." By 1981, it was clear to Mr. Adams that Mr. Fleetwood was headed for bankruptcy. So he flew to Australia to inform his client of the direness of his financial situation. He found a man in denial. "He told me that it was not possible," Mr. Adams recalled. Staying with the drummer, he woke up one morning and found Mr. Fleetwood gone. A note read:
Oh Brian, Brian, we've something to say.
We stopped in Singapore the other day.
To a hotel we went, the best in town.
Amusements we sought, amusements we found.
It was fairly obvious where his client had flown off to for a little rest and recreation. But Singapore was only the first stop on his itinerary. From there, he headed for Africa, where, during one drunken binge, he smashed a $7,000 Rolex watch to bits with a beer bottle.
Over the next three years, Mr. Adams says, Mr. Fleetwood continued having trouble facing up to reality. And Mr. Fleetwood concurs that he was living in something of a fantasy world. "I just didn't care because the roller coaster took precedent," he said. "You felt untouchable."
But that couldn't last forever. Finally, in 1984, Mr. Fleetwood declared bankruptcy in a Federal court in Los Angeles. It would take him nearly a decade to climb out of his personal and financial morass.
For one thing, he had less career flexibility than some other group members. He could neither write songs nor perform alone. "It is a very specific thing that I do," he said. "I cannot play without people. I am a drummer. I can't play in my living room."
For another thing, he was still using drugs and drinking. He testified in court papers that the bankruptcy was financially and emotionally devastating. And, in a recent interview in Rolling Stone magazine, Ms. McVie recalled that Mr. Fleetwood had told her back then that "he was living in somebody's basement with a damp carpet. . .and he used to lie in bed watching soap operas all day long."
In the interview for this article, Mr. Fleetwood said he quit drugs "like that," six years ago, and snapped his fingers. Though he is vague about his motivation, he attributes much of it to a desire to build a relationship with his wife, Lynn, and his love of being a musician.
ONCE he was clean, it was easier to talk with former band members about the reunion tour. Lindsey Buckingham said he felt as though he were finally talking with the old Mr. Fleetwood. And the success of the road show has given him a second shot at fame -- and modest wealth. This time, at least, he is likely to hold onto some of it.
Not that he has the financial sophistication to go it alone. While he admires the financial acumen of Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, who attended the London School of Economics, his own economic views are simplistic, with occasional lapses into conspiracy theory boilerplate. The "real elite are the people who run this planet. You don't hear about them," he said. "Two hundred million dollars is a lot of money, but it is not in the big picture, It is peanuts. There are people with huge dynasties of wealth. They earn that in a week in oil.
"It's the banks that run the planet, the Trilateral Commissions," he added. "Who do you think runs all the governments? Banks, and when it comes down to it, probably not that many."
Such musings suggest strongly that Mr. Fleetwood will remain as dependent on advisers as he was a decade ago. But he is betting that he has picked a better team. And now that he leads a somewhat calmer life, he should have the time to listen to them.

HEADLINE: A New Breed of Wildcatter for the 90's

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
TEXAS past: the Oil Patch, where roughnecks and the rig count ruled.
Texas present: the Silicon Prairie, where venture capitalists and software engineers roam. 
 A state still identified with commodities -- petroleum most of all -- has learned to make a living from semiconductors and software. Over two years, technology has taken the place of energy as the state's largest employer. Texas payrolls in computers, electronics and related fields are rising twice as fast as for America as a whole. The state is home to two of the world's three largest personal computer makers -- Compaq and Dell -- and, here in Austin, to the nation's highest concentration of chip plants outside Silicon Valley.
The transformation stands as a dramatic example of how computers and electronics are remaking the nation's economy. By tying its fortunes to these accelerating industries, the Texas economy, ravaged by low oil prices and a real estate crash into the early 1990's, is far outperforming the nation's.
Austin, which has grown more rapidly in this decade than any major city but Las Vegas, Nev., is being California-ized, as venture capital firms, software start-ups and natural food groceries proliferate. Dallas, home to about half the state's technology jobs, is being Austin-ized, with even starchy old-line technology companies like Electronic Data Systems trying to mimic Austin's fleet firms. And Houston has deployed computer power to restore the energy industry's profitability, even as oil prices stagnate.
How Texans earn their fortunes is no mere parochial matter. Texas and its oil industry have produced two of the last six Presidents. Lyndon B. Johnson gained national power in part because of his ability to tap the industry's donations; George Bush founded an oil company himself. Now Gov. George W. Bush, son of the former President, is considering his own Presidential bid -- certain to feature a pledge to bring the nation the same sort of high technology growth that Texas has had.
Compared with the high times of the early 1980's, this latest burst of prosperity can seem downright somber. The last Texas boom was about "Let the Yankees freeze in the dark" bumper stickers and savings and loan chiefs plowing federally insured deposits into Ferraris and their friends' condo and office deals. The latest is more about contracts to hedge petroleum price risks, and software developers laboring into the night, guzzling Jolt colas, to hasten projects that might perk up their stock options, too.
With new jobs and wealth come a new way of life. The old Texas rich, whether ranchers or oilmen, lived off the land, preserving a kinship to the cowboy. The mythology of American business has few characters as monumental as the Texas wildcatter -- like H. L. Hunt or Jett Rink in the movie "Giant" -- who bets everything on a well that comes in big. Texans never tire of playing up this history: To celebrate its 90th anniversary, Neiman Marcus adorned its flagship Dallas store with oil rigs that reached to the ceiling and spouted black confetti; a live Texas longhorn corralled at the entrance greeted guests.
Silicon wafers and software packages, though less evocative, might be the most apt emblems for the store's newest generation of shoppers. The New Texas Rich, some hardly out of college, parlay computer and financial smarts into businesses that, once sold or taken public, shower down as many millions -- or billions -- as the last generation's gushers.
MICHAEL DELL -- now the richest Texan, with wealth estimated at more than $4 billion -- is only the most recognizable of a group that includes the software wizards Sanjiv Sidhu of i2 Technologies in Dallas and Joe Liemandt of Trilogy Development Group in Austin, with holdings of about $750 million, as well as Michael and Selim Zilkha, who sold their technology-laden Zilkha Energy Company in Houston for more than $1 billion just a week ago.
"Technology is the fuel of the new economy," Mr. Sidhu said, pointing out that his software even helped companies cut corporate energy bills. "That is what's happening in Texas."
At first glance, Mr. Dell and the like appear far less distinctive than the old Texas oilmen, let alone the ranchers. Many, emigres from Silicon Valley, transplant their casual but round-the-clock work habits, their inflated housing budgets and their coastal tastes.
When Christina Jones, president of an Internet computer marketer called pcorder.com, arrived in Austin in 1992 shortly after graduating from Stanford University, "there were no brew pubs, no bagel shops" she said, adding, "Austin is definitely growing up."
But as Molly Ivins, the syndicated Texas columnist, has said, "Texas is just like the rest of the country, only more so." Today, "more so" includes a knack for exploiting the latest hot industries and the traditional Texan appetite for risk. Once technology became the touchstone of entrepreneurship, Texans were bound to cash in.
Texans, that is, no matter where they were born. Asked after a broadcast of "Wall Street Week" in Dallas last weekend whether he had changed Texas more than the state had changed him, Eckhard Pfeiffer, the German-born chief executive of Compaq, thought just long enough to respond, "I would say I've affected Texas more." But his friend, Carolyn Farb, renowned for tapping the Houston rich -- old and new -- for charity, thought his very answer hinted that he was mistaken.
"Such modesty," she said. "Spoken like a Texan."
The New Texas Rich are also like the Old Rich in their maleness and whiteness; the Texans on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans include no blacks or Hispanics, and no self-made women. For the first time, however, women like Ms. Jones or Rebecca Mark, chief of the Enron Corporation's international energy operations, are loudly knocking at the club doors. Not to mention Darla Moore, who as Richard Rainwater's hatchet woman (and wife) oversees a real estate, hospital and energy empire concentrated in this state.
Blacks and Hispanics, together about 40 percent of the state's population, are only beginning to reach the higher corporate ranks. Still, in Houston, not known for being in the social vanguard, voters decided earlier this month to preserve affirmative action in public contracts.
The technology boom, in fact, leaves many of the state's citizens with nothing to download. Incomes and education levels lag behind national averages. Several counties along the border remain among the nation's poorest, and El Paso is the poorest city of its size. Low-wage jobs, especially in apparel, are moving to Mexico and Asia. And the technology expansion has created more assembly line workers than software millionaires.
Diversification has at least allowed Texas to smooth Big Oil's violent cycles, though at the cost of exposure to technology's own rattles and shakes. "Do I think Texas is more recession-proof than in the early 80's?" asked Harvey Rosenblum, research chief at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "Yes, I do. But I don't think we're a lot more recession-proof." Among the tremors: a chip glut caused layoffs at Motorola, Austin's largest employer, and Intel has postponed plans for a new plant in Fort Worth.
For years, it was unclear whether the state's bet on technology would ever pay off. "Maybe the whole business of high tech and computers is a good deal more dicey than its proselytizers in Texas like to admit -- as dicey, in fact, as oil," said a 1984 Texas Monthly account of Texas Instruments' failure in the home computer market.
BUT as technology companies expanding in the 1990's saw their costs in California and the Northeast soar, they discovered a haven of low wages, taxes and real estate prices in Texas. Samsung has just opened a new chip plant in Austin, the city's 15th, while in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, Northern Telecom has almost 7,000 employees, nearly 2,000 more than at its Canadian headquarters.
Even Houston, headquarters of the world's energy industry, is home to one of the largest software companies, BMC Software, with $600 million in annual revenues. The company was founded in 1980 by a former Shell Oil computer specialist, John Moores, whose software made Shell's computers more efficient. Shell set him free to commercialize his work.
In deference to the locale, the elevators at BMC's 20-story headquarters are lined with the hairy hides of Texas cattle.
Having parlayed its oil wealth into technology wealth, Texas is using information technology to build fresh oil wealth. New on the Houston scene is the "virtual" energy company, where workers mine data on their work stations and contract out the drilling and production.
Thus the largest leaseholder on the United States continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico is not Chevron or Shell, which are second and third, but the Zilkha Energy Company.
Zilkha? In a downtown Houston office tower, a staff of only about 60 has assembled enough data to fill about 2,000 standard one-gigabyte hard disks, all of it accessible on their desktops. Two-thirds of the holes that result from their number-crunching strike oil or gas, explaining the company's sale a week ago to Sonat Inc., an oil and gas producer based in Birmingham, Ala.
"In any new technology, the first mover has the greatest advantage," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, the president of Enron, whose own sophisticated hedging and financing strategies helped Zilkha to grow. "They were the first movers."
Successes like BMC's and Zilkha's have inspired the big oil companies, too. Shell has used proprietary software for interpreting seismic data to set record after record for production depth in the Gulf of Mexico.
Computerization of many office tasks has, over the last decade, helped Shell to cut its work force from 33,000 to 20,000. Now, the company is growing again -- but through the expansion of Shell Services, a unit that provides technology help to Shell and, the company hopes, other energy concerns. The unit has added more than 500 workers, for a total of 2,200 over the last year and a half.
Philip Carroll, Shell's chief executive, has also begun buying stakes in small computing companies like Prism Technologies, a Houston software concern. And to make sure no one like John Moores ever again gets smothered or ignored by the Shell bureaucracy, Mr. Carroll has set up an in-house firm called Shell Technology Ventures.
If Mr. Moores came to him today, Mr. Carroll said, he would tell him: "John, here's some seed money. Why don't you go out and see if you can develop this commercially? We'll set up a little company and you can be president." Mr. Carroll paused. "And Shell would own BMC."
If Houston is just emerging as a technopolis in its own right, Austin has gone from start-up to maturity.
WITH 2.9 percent unemployment, compared with 4.7 percent nationally, Austin's growth has slowed this year. A strong national economy means fewer migrants arrive from the coasts, and Austin has sucked its own labor pool dry.
Long popular among companies based elsewhere as a site for research laboratories or chip plants, the state capital has, over the last two years, created a strong support network for start-ups. Banks, law firms and venture capital partnerships based in Silicon Valley have opened offices here, competing with home-grown counterparts.
"Technology has changed the economy here completely," said Joseph C. Aragona, a partner in Austin Ventures, the oldest venture capital firm in town. "In 1987, we had the highest office vacancy rate in the nation -- 48 percent. You could have bought buildings for what you now have to pay for rent."
Reinvestment of the state's oil wealth helped turn things around. In 1983, the University of Texas -- whose petroleum holdings have helped its endowment grow into the nation's second-largest, behind Harvard's -- pledged buildings, laboratories and 32 endowed chairs at $1 million each to lure the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, or MCC, an industry consortium. Five years later, the university led another successful campaign to capture the headquarters of Sematech, a consortium of American semiconductor manufacturers.
Among the results: Austin is home to 800 software companies and 5 chip makers with 15 plants.
The makeover is both economic and cultural. Bible Belt politicians fought with companies like Apple Computer over the granting of health benefits to same-sex partners. Environmentalists who cherish the area's hilly terrain, and residents who saw Austin as an oasis of affordability, gripe about young newcomers able to pay Palo Alto prices for housing and office space.
Consider the advent of Joe Liemandt. When Mr. Liemandt left Stanford University in his senior year, back in 1990, to write software that could streamline corporate sales operations, his father, a high-technology executive in Dallas, called him "a moron." Venture capitalists were equally put off, so Mr. Liemandt and three co-founders financed their Silicon Valley start-up with credit cards.
By 1991, Mr. Liemandt, far enough along to expand, came to Austin, where a real estate agent showed him the city's priciest spot on the edge of the Hill Country, with a panoramic view of Lake Austin and the skyline glowing in the distance.
"How much?" Mr. Liemandt asked.
The agent rambled evasively before saying, "It'll be $12 or $13 a square foot."
At the time, Mr. Liemandt was paying $44 a foot for Spartan California quarters with views of other boxy buildings. "I'll take it," he said.
The move to Austin paid off in other ways. Mr. Liemandt hired a top programmer from MCC, giving Trilogy credibility to clinch its first sales to corporate customers. With Trilogy's revenues already more than $100 million, Mr. Liemandt, a majority shareholder, probably is not far off when he values his private company at more than $1.5 billion.
At 29, Mr. Liemandt might be the youngest self-made member of the Forbes 400 -- and the only one who lives in a rental apartment. Meanwhile, Mr. Dell, at 32, is building Austin's first technopalace. In Houston or Dallas, half the town would be angling for invitations. In Austin, however, jeans-and-boots populists are rooting for the tax assessor to prevail in appraising the house at $22 million, four times the area's previous high and $16 million more than Mr. Dell says it's worth.
Popular culture is just catching up with the alienated Austin of the 1980's, in movies like "Slackers" and the new "Austin Stories" sitcom on MTV. The Austin of the 1990's had its defining moment at the Four Seasons hotel this summer. Dell shareholders left their Lamborghinis with the valet long enough to see Mr. Dell begin the annual meeting by flashing a three-year chart showing his company's stock far outgaining even Microsoft's. He interrupted the ovation just long enough to say, "That will conclude our presentation."
IF Austin is setting the pace for the state's surge, Dallas still has the most technology jobs.
After World War II, local military electronics companies had some of the nation's few telecommunications experts outside the Bell system, along with several computing pioneers. From these origins came Texas Instruments, for a time the world's largest chip maker; the Sevin Rosen venture capital firm, which has backed Compaq and other fast-growing technology firms, and the telecom corridor, whose 70,000 jobs include more than 2,000 each at Northern Telecom, AT&T, Ericsson, Alcatel and Fujitsu.
Meanwhile, Dallas's old-line technology firms are having to reinvent themselves. Texas Instruments has sold its military electronics and laptop computer businesses and reduced its dependence on memory chips to concentrate on specialized processors for cellular telephones and modems. E.D.S., slipping behind I.B.M. in sales of computer services, has tried to shuck the rigid style of its founder, Ross Perot, for an Austin approach. It has moved 200 young technical whizzes out of its Dallas headquarters and freed them from the buttoned-down dress code. But only after an internal brawl was it decided to let them visit the main office without dressing up.
Dallas, however, has begun spawning technology start-ups that could not care less what their workers wear. Mr. Sidhu left Texas Instruments in 1988 to start i2 Technologies and figure out how artificial intelligence could help companies cut inventories. Since going public in April 1996, his company has doubled its value to about $1.4 billion.
If Texas, as an unofficial member of OPEC, once had its own cycles, companies like i2, with global customers, are tying Texas more closely to the nation and the world. What is more, the collapse of its own financial institutions nearly a decade ago means that credit ultimately comes from the securities markets or distant money center banks.
A place so intently distinctive that its citizens still expect beer and truck advertisers to pander to their Texan-ness is only starting to reckon with its maturity. The last transformation, a generation ago, propelled Houston, Dallas and San Antonio into the ranks of the nation's 10 largest cities. If writers like Larry McMurtry, most of all, described the resulting dislocation and reinterpreted the state's past, only a few cyberpunk authors in Austin have begun imagining the future. For his part, Mr. McMurtry said at an Austin literary festival earlier this month that he has quit writing novels.
In "Lone Star," still the classic account of the state's past, T. R. Fehrenbach, a San Antonio scholar, predicted decades ago that the state's singular history would draw to an end as its people left the land. Since then, he has found that Texans remain Texans, even in the cities. And so they are sure to keep on being Texans now that their livelihoods depend less on their natural resources than on their brains.

Cushioning the Shock Of Global Warming

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
IN the debate over global warming, attention has focused mainly on how to reduce emissions of excess carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping industrial waste gases. Negotiators from more than 150 countries will convene tomorrow in Kyoto, Japan, to try to agree on just such cuts.
But many experts are convinced that whatever action is taken, the world's political and economic systems are probably not capable of responding fast enough to keep carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere from rising, late in the next century, to about twice what they were when fossil fuels began to be spewed into the air during the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. 
 If mainstream scientists are right, a doubling of carbon dioxide would mean that the world is already assured of a substantial rise in global temperatures and sea level, heavier rainstorms, more severe droughts and floods and a poleward shift of climatic zones.
With that realization, the question of how well the world is prepared to adapt to climate change is gaining new attention.
"We are pretty clearly going to be moving into uncharted territory in a world of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations," said Dr. Richard Moss, an expert with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an advisory group set up by the United Nations. "Developing and implementing adaptation options seems to be a prudent course at this point."
While some strategies for coping with a different climate might be devised, it would probably not be possible to cushion all shocks. Such measures as building sea walls and planning for more efficient use of water in increasingly drought-prone areas, for instance, would go only so far.
There will surely be winners as well as losers: while Canadian and Russian farmers might reap more wheat, African farmers might reap drought-induced disaster. While summer heat in the southern United States might be more intense, northern winters might be milder. The economies of entire regions -- tourist-dependent New England, for instance -- might be transformed with uncertain results. Adapting to climatic upheaval would surely involve great human and financial cost despite any planned measures.
 
A Hardy Species
But humans are a resilient species. They have always had to contend with climatic change and have often been profoundly affected by it. Conventional wisdom now holds that Homo sapiens owes its very existence to a climatic adaptation. According to this view, the onset of a drier ice-age climate in sub-Saharan Africa some 2.5 million years ago shrank forest cover, expanded grasslands and forced a certain species of pre-human to take up a two-legged life on the ground permanently, setting off an evolutionary chain of events that led directly to modern man.
Much later, experts now believe, a similar drying so constricted natural food supplies in the Middle East that people were forced to begin cultivating grains -- a revolutionary adaptation that transformed human society and touched off a population expansion leading to human dominance of the planet. Still later, mega-droughts in both hemispheres destroyed several early empires that failed to adapt.
In the Little Ice Age of the 15th to the 19th centuries, the inability of humans to adapt to extreme cold led to crop failures, starvation, mass migration and, in some instances, cannibalism. But despite the misery and cost, that same time (which was punctuated by some mild periods) was one of the most creative in history, the era of the late Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the American Revolution and the rise of the industrial economy.
One way to get at the question of how to adapt to global warming is to ask how well modern people already deal with extreme events, like floods and droughts, that are expected to become even more extreme. "The answer is, not well," said Dr. Michael H. Glantz, a social scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who bases his conclusion on a number of case studies in the United States.
The worst prospects are in developing countries, which in many ways are inherently more vulnerable. Countries like Bangladesh, Egypt, China and many small island countries, for instance, stand to see much or even all of their territory inundated by rising seas.
At the same time, many third world populations, particularly in drought-prone countries, exist precariously close to the edge. Any increase in the length or severity of droughts could push them over -- and their countries' agriculture-dependent economies as well.
To a great extent, the United States and other rich countries "have managed to insulate ourselves from the vagaries of climate," said Dr. Peter Gleick, the director of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security in Oakland, Calif.
For instance, the United States has spent billions on reservoirs, dams, pipelines, aqueducts and irrigation systems that help smooth out the effects of climatic extremes on water supplies and floods. "But people in most developing countries really live with the climate," said Dr. Gleick. "If the rains fail, their crops fail. If the rivers flood, often they die."
Similarly, farmers in the United States have at their disposal a wealth of expertise and resources to help them adjust the kinds of crops they grow to cope with a new climate -- albeit at some cost. A farmer in much of Africa or in Bangladesh has nothing comparable.
In North America, global warming would probably bring some benefits. Northern climes are already becoming greener as the world warms, and future warming might expand the continent's agricultural belt. Farmers farther south could switch crops; citrus fruits might replace field crops in Georgia, for example. Milder northern winters could cut the costs of heating and snow removal.
But for every benign impact, according to the intergovernmental panel, there would be at least one negative counterpart. How will the New England tourist industry adjust, for instance, if brilliant fall foliage is replaced by duller oaks and hickories from farther south and ski slopes turn to slush? How disruptive and expensive would it be to progressively abandon beachfront developments as seas rise? What would be the impact of increased summer demand for air conditioning on power supplies and costs? Are public health agencies ready for an expected increase in heat-related deaths and possibly the migration of tropical diseases farther north? These questions are just beginning to be asked.
The typical response to climate-related disaster has usually consisted of waiting until something bad happens and then scrambling to cope. Recent examples include the Mississippi River flood of 1993 and the Ohio River and North Dakota floods of 1997. If heavier rains and more severe droughts are in the cards, as the panel predicts, the vulnerability can only increase.
But inertia is a powerful force: even after a big flood like those of the last few years, people continue to tempt fate by living on flood plains even though Federal policy now encourages them to move -- with one hand, anyway. With the other, it encourages them to stay by insuring flood damage.
In the end, there is probably only so much that can be done. "I think there are limits to adaptation even in the rich countries," said Dr. Gleick. Experts have barely begun to probe what those limits are.
Fifty or 100 years from now, if scientists' predictions about climate change turn out to be right, it may be that people will take the new climatic order in stride. How much pain, strain and cost lie between here and there is anything but certain.

HEADLINE: The World;
Joining With the Taliban In a New War on Drugs

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: LASHKARGAH, Afghanistan

 BODY:
THIS grim, remote town is the capital of Helmand province, the opium-growing capital of the world.
Once dubbed Little America because of all the aid workers here, the province is now controlled by the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that forces men to grow beards and women to stay at home, amputates the hands of thieves, and strips tape from cassettes because music is considered evil. 
 The Taliban has been widely condemned for autocratic conduct and has been accused of providing a safe haven, and training camps, for terrorists.
But last week, the new head of the United Nations' drug-control agency sat down with Taliban leaders and offered them economic assistance. The reason: the group's religious strictures ban drugs of any kind, and it has declared its intention to stamp out the cultivation of opium poppy, the base for heroin.
Western democracies, which got into bed with unsavory regimes to fight Communism, are now finding allies who are rather unpleasant -- and unreliable -- in the war on drugs.
The United Nations and its top drug fighter, Pino Arlacchi, need the Taliban to meet a publicly declared goal of eliminating drugs around the world within a decade. No one doubts that Mr. Arlacchi's vision is audacious. But this serious, energetic Italian academic-turned-politician has been asked if he is not also naive. After all, more drug battles have been lost than won. Latin America, for example, is littered with the remains of well-intentioned projects to wean peasants off growing coca. Unlike their coca-growing counterparts in Latin America, however, Afghan farmers do not have a long history of harvesting poppy. Twenty-five years ago, poppy production here was 200 tons; last year, it was 2,800 tons.
So Mr. Arlacchi is convinced he can succeed. Twenty years ago, he noted, opium was grown in just about every country across Asia, from Turkey to Thailand. Now, he said, the war can be concentrated on just two countries, Afghanistan and Burma; together they account for 90 percent of the world's opium supply.
 
Testing
Mr. Arlacchi has begun here, where the Taliban's militancy works in his favor. The Taliban's religious fervor clashes, however, with a secular reality -- opium poppy has been a major source of their income. And there is widespread skepticism among American officials and United Nations diplomats over which will win out.
But even the skeptics think it is worth testing the Taliban, which controls 90 percent of the poppy-growing areas of the country.
Western governments will also be tested because the poppy-eradication project is going to cost at least $25 million a year for 10 years in Afghanistan. For at the core of Mr. Arlacchi's program are alternative development projects. Give farmers the means to grow crops other than poppy, the theory goes, and they will become law-abiding citizens.
Will Congress contribute America's share for a United Nations project? With the money going to the Taliban, liberal human rights activists might unite with conservatives to oppose the spending. Anticipating problems, Mr. Arlacchi is assembling what he calls a "council of wise men," prominent world leaders from government, industry and the arts, to help him raise money.
It was only after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 that amber fields of grain gave way to bright fields of poppy.
As the country sank into war, everything fell into disrepair, from tractors to irrigation systems; fertilizer and seeds have been hard to come by. So farmers turned from wheat, melons, cotton and their traditional crops to poppy, which is labor intensive but yields more dollars per acre than traditional crops.
Last year, for example, a 60-year-old local farmer named Agha Mohammad planted 14.5 acres in poppy. For his harvest, he was paid $7,920 by drug smugglers. So this year, he is planting three more acres, he explained last week as three of his small sons chased away birds trying to feast on the newly sown poppy seeds.
Mr. Mohammad, who has a long snow white beard, is a tenant farmer. The land owner, Hazad Mohammad, said he took in $16,528 last year from growing poppy.
 
Incentives
In a country where the per capita income is $100 a year, it is not easy to imagine that these men would give up this revenue source. But both men insisted they would.
"We are only growing opium to support our families," said Mr. Mohammad, whose family numbers 23. "If we can be assured of irrigation water, we'll cultivate the crops we did before the war."
On the edge of the field is a small canal. It is a channel of the Boghra irrigation system, which was built in the 1960's with American aid money. It is an impressive project.
Stretching for 40 miles through flat, desert land, the main canal passes low, thick mud-walled houses set among orchards and small vegetable plots. Green shoots sprout in the plots that get water; camels and donkeys wander in the fields.
Before the war, the canal's waters irrigated 61,000 acres, making this region the bread basket of Afghanistan. Now the canal is filled with 15 years of silt, and most of the water-control gates are rusted.
The irrigation system can be repaired so that farmers can again grow wheat, onions, and apples. But then drug traffickers will still be able to offer the farmers two or three times as much for poppy.
"That's why we need incentives and sanctions," Mr. Arlacchi said, as he walked from Mr. Mohammad's poppy field.
The incentives will come from the West, in the form of development aid. The sanctions will be applied by the Taliban, of course. Authoritarian enforcement may be distasteful to the West. So were many of the dictators Washington dealt with during the cold war.

HEADLINE: Gulf Syndrome;
Americans Decide War May Not Be Quite So Scary

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE'S nothing like a crisis with Iraq to get American blood boiling.
For the moment, diplomacy has defused the latest standoff over allowing United Nations inspectors to resume their hunt for Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal. 
 But opinion polls show that most Americans were prepared to support an extensive military strike to force President Saddam Hussein to back down.
This is in stark contrast to the tremulous tone of public debate in 1990, as America girded for war against Mr. Hussein, and it seems to suggest that Americans have finally shaken off their famous Vietnam syndrome. But a question remains: Are Americans ready to use their muscle anywhere? Or is their attitude more conflicted than that, notwithstanding their eagerness to punish Iraq?
A Newsweek poll taken Nov. 13 and 14, in mid-standoff, found that 53 percent of Americans favored using force if Iraq refused arms inspections because of American participation. And the figure climbed to 82 percent if Iraq were to shoot down an American U-2 spy plane flying for the inspectors.
If diplomacy failed, Congress was clamoring for an attack punishing enough to topple Mr. Hussein's regime. "I'd like to see him taken out," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
Even liberal pundits are sounding bloodthirsty these days. Last week George Stephanopoulos, President Clinton's former senior adviser, called on his old boss to ignore a Ford-era Presidential order barring American.-sanctioned assassinations and put out a contract on Mr. Hussein. "If we can kill Saddam, we should," Mr. Stephanopoulos wrote in the current issue of Newsweek.
What a change from seven years ago, when Americans and their elected representatives were almost evenly divided over whether to wait longer for economic sanctions to bite or to wage war to repel Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
The stakes were different then, of course; the fact that Iraq had conquered and occupied an independent neighbor made both the urgency of ousting Mr. Hussein and the potential cost seemed to demand a great deal more debate.
Still, the result seems to have emboldened Americans into replacing their old first instinct ("Don't go to war because we might lose and divide ourselves at home") with a new one ("Let's go to war; we'll win big and unify ourselves at home").
The polls show this. The politicians are talking the talk. And there are logical reasons to explain why Americans seem to feel freer to use force now than they did in 1990.
For one, people and generals everywhere tend to calculate their chances in the next war from their experiences in the last one. In 1990, the last big war was Vietnam. Now it is the Persian Gulf war.
Vietnam, moreover, had been only the final convincing course in a generation-long learning experience about the limits of American power. Before Vietnam fell, there had been the stalemate in Korea, inconclusive and frightening confrontations with the Soviets and insolent challenges from teensy nations. Standoff was largely the name of the game, and it seemed prudent to put up with that fact.
All of that had only begun to change in 1990; there was, in fact, still a Soviet Union, even though it was fast coming undone. Now Americans have had plenty of time to realize how different the world has become without it.
But Iraq is also a special case. First of all, the United States and its allies have had seven years to demonize Mr. Hussein. And a wealth of new information surpassing nearly everyone's worst fears has emerged about the size and scope of his doomsday stockpiles. So unlike in 1990, when George Bush struggled to find an argument for defending Kuwait that resonated with the public, President Clinton can pick and choose from Iraq's terrifying array of poison gases and killer germs as a rationale to bomb away.
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, playing show-and-tell on national television a couple of weeks ago, plunked down a five-pound bag of sugar and proclaimed that if the sugar were anthrax, a deadly bacteria, it could kill half the population of Washington. In case anyone missed his point, he said last week that the United Nations believes Iraq may have produced up to 200 tons of VX nerve gas, "theoretically enough to kill every man, woman, and child on the face of the Earth."
The public and Congress agree on the urgency of destroying Mr. Hussein's ability to inflict mass destruction. "We cannot let stand what they are doing," Senator Lott said.
All this demonstrates that Americans are still willing to fight to win a war that seems morally unambiguous. But the stakes have to be high enough and clearly defined, and the bad guy must be really bad. And since the end of the cold war, these clear-cut choices about what America must defend seem harder to come by.
Beyond the case of Iraq, the more likely model for American military operations in the foreseeable future is peacemaking, particularly if it can be described as a humanitarian venture. Cadets at West Point train for such missions, and politicians have learned how to sell them. Recent efforts to halt civil or ethnic strife that threatened to get out of hand have included Stop the Famine in Somalia, Restore Democracy in Haiti and End the Genocide in Bosnia.
But Americans are still hesitant to get involved in these episodes.
As the first American troops arrived in Bosnia two years ago, a CBS News/New York Times poll found that 55 percent of those surveyed opposed the mission, while only 40 percent supported it. Respondents said Mr. Clinton had explained the situation well enough; they just didn't feel they had a direct stake in the conflict.
Today, even though no American forces in Bosnia have been killed in combat in those two years, Congress is still pressing the Administration to pull out the troops by June 1998 -- although it remains to be seen just how hard lawmakers will fight so long as the mission is going well.
In Iraq, the public seems to be willing to pay a higher price -- but only up to a point.
In a curious way, the thumping American military success there in 1991 is posing thorny problems for American planners now.
 
Easy Win
The new-found bellicosity toward Saddam Hussein seems to spring from a belief that the military can thwart him with unmanned Tomahawk cruise missiles or a few bombing runs, and suffer few if any casualties. But this view doesn't take into account how many bombs were dropped on Iraq in 1991 without forcing a withdrawal from Kuwait. For that, it took tanks and infantry.
Disarming Mr. Hussein's arsenal of horror weapons poses a similar problem. Mr. Clinton's generals have presented him with a plan to bomb every suspected weapons site in the country. But as the President himself is fond of pointing out, the 88,000 tons of bombs dropped on Iraq during the gulf war had less success in destroying its clandestine arsenal than have United Nations inspectors since the war.
Without inspectors on the ground, the only other reliable option would be to send in ground forces. No one in the Administration wants to talk about that, mainly because of the much higher risk of casualties.
And unlike Mr. Stephanopoulos, 55 percent of Americans surveyed in a recent Gallup poll opposed a plan to kill Mr. Hussein -- even though, according to another poll, 73 percent thought he should have been ousted in 1991.
Even in Iraq, it seems, Americans are more comfortable with uneasy coexistence than with sending a hit man to deal with the enemy they feel should have been removed six years ago.
So the the war of nerves continues.

ASIAN IMBROGLIO
The Tigers Clean House
Pacific leaders met in Vancouver, British Columbia, and joined in President Clinton's chorus, decreeing that only stringent policies and close monitoring could calm the financial storms washing through South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand. For the sick, the leaders prescribed a combination of belt-tightening, propping up of currencies, rooting out corruption and toughening oversight of banks. South Korea, humiliated after insisting it would dig itself out of the crisis, asked the International Monetary Fund for $20 billion in help, then quickly acknowledged that it would not be nearly enough. 

THE NEXT DOMINO
China? Even Japan?
American economic officials desperately want to believe that Japan is different from the wobbly countries of Asia because of its great wealth and industrial strength, but Tokyo is hardly calm. That was evident on Tuesday, when Japanese stocks skidded 5.1 percent after Japan's oldest brokerage, Yamaichi Securities, collapsed. Yamaichi had hidden $2.06 billion in losses, much to the embarrassment of the Government. Still, an outright cataclysm is highly unlikely for Japan...Meanwhile, Russia is laying the groundwork for expanded Western help as it tries to prop up the ruble. Investors fleeing from emerging markets have withdrawn $4 billion from the Russian treasury bill market. If they keep going, the ruble could be rubble. China, meanwhile, has its own problems: a steep drop in foreign investment, heavy debts, bad loans and a shaky banking system. But China's policies may insulate it from the global upheaval: its currency is not freely traded, and its stock markets are somewhat protected.
 
AT THE I.M.F.
Lender Faces Risks, Too
South Korea got a taste of the pain that awaits it when Samsung, its second-largest business, said it would cut investment, move 30 percent of its 260,000 employees to new jobs and cut the salaries of managers. Even before it forks over assistance to South Korea, the I.M.F.'s cupboard is getting drafty. And Washington is not showing much generosity when it comes to replenishing the supplies. Besides its low resources, the I.M.F. may have to try innovative medicine because it is not dealing with basket-case economies but with recently high-flying tigers. Steve Radelet, an economist at Harvard, says, "It makes no sense to ask for austerity from countries that have excess production capacity and are still saving 30 percent of their income."
 
PUBLISHING
Harold Evans's New Chapter
Mr. Evans, the colorful dean of Random House's trade group, is jumping back into journalism. The 69-year-old London native signed on as editorial director of Mortimer Zuckerman's publications -- The Daily News, U.S. News & World Report and The Atlantic Monthly. Mr. Evans's seven years at Random House were marked by high-priced gambles on books that did not always pan out, like the $2.5 million he advanced for the scandal-tinged book by Dick Morris, "Behind the Oval Office." Mr. Evans is an old nemesis of Rupert Murdoch and will now be able to take potshots at a Murdoch paper, The New York Post.
 
THE CITY POLITIC
Best of Times, and the Worst
New York City is reaping a tax windfall of $319 million from the exuberance of Wall Street, however irrational. But away from the canyons of Manhattan, the times can be grim. With many families no longer receiving food stamps, hunger is worsening, food pantries and social service agencies report. Most days, "I know we only have enough food to last until 4 o'clock," said Diane Ward, director of the Community Kitchen of West Harlem.
 
A DECO CLASSIC
Buying a Chrysler
The aging Art Deco classic, the Chrysler Building, is getting a new owner, Jerry I. Speyer, who co-owns Rockefeller Center. He is expected to pay $220 million for the 1930 tower, noteworthy for its silvery crown and gargoyles. But the skyscraper, on East 42d Street, badly needs $100 million in renovations. "Its spire is one of the most recognized pieces of architecture in the world," said Edward S. Gordon, of the Insignia/ESG Company, which has marketed the building. "It has a lot of sex appeal."
 
WALL STREET
Lull From the Storm
At least for the time being, Wall Street is weathering the Asian turbulence. "The last thing that Asia needs is for the U.S. to be weakening," said Desmond Lachman, head of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the quiet holiday week at 7,823.13, down 57.94 points, after jumping more than 300 points the week before.
 
INVESTMENT BANKING
A Star for Merrill
When Merrill Lynch buys Mercury Asset Management of London for $5.3 billion, it will get not only an investment giant but also a new star employee, Carol Galley, Mercury's vice chairwoman, who will become the only woman to sit on Merrill's executive management committee. She is a favorite target of London tabloids and of jealous male colleagues. The 48-year-old Ms. Galley started at the bottom of the ladder and rose spectacularly to become, in the view of the tabloids, "the most powerful woman in Britain," a super-manager controlling more than 900 pension funds. "She is a good money manager and a very good people manager," said an analyst with James Capel, an investment firm.
 
CRIME SYNDICATES
Mobsters Invest, Too
Organized crime is trying to cash in on the aging bull market now that the mob is being squeezed out of the garbage hauling and garment businesses, investigators say. In the latest example, which led to 19 arrests, the Bonanno and Genovese crime families of New York joined forces and paid bribes to brokers at a small firm, Meyers Pollock Robbins, Federal prosecutors said. "The mob has never seen a market that they didn't want to manipulate," said James K. Kallstrom of the F.B.I.
 
EMPLOYEE TESTING
Better Answer Correctly
Companies large and small are increasingly relying on psychological tests to determine who is too impulsive, ethically challenged or self-absorbed to be a good employee. At least that is what the test companies say the tests discover. "If you are a particularly kindhearted person who isn't sufficiently punitive, you fail," said Lewis Maltby of the American Civil Liberties Union. "Mother Teresa would never pass some of these honesty tests." The hiring companies say that in an era when former employers do not like to write reference letters and when the face-to-face interview may not tell all, they need to rely on other tools, even for entry-level workers. Some tests have asked applicants whether they agree with statements like, "I have often wished I was a girl." Sibi Soroka sued after taking such a test, saying it violated his privacy. "These are questions you wouldn't even answer for your own mother if she asked you, let alone some personnel director at some company you're not even sure you want to work for."

Russia Needs Alms Control

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
See the spectacle of Moscow selling its latest missile know-how to Iran's ayatollahs and championing the sordid cause of Iraq's Saddam, proudly bestriding the world stage by sticking Russia's thumb in America's eye.
And then read this headline on the front page of The Times: "Russia Is Seeking More Western Aid for Financial Ills; American Backing Asked." 
 Yevgeny Primakov is socking it to us while Boris Yeltsin is begging it from us. To explicate this pushmi-pullyu policy, I turn to my Russian counterpart, Vyacheslav Punditsky.
Q: Suddenly Russia's budget is busted, the ruble is shaky, the stock market plunged 40 percent, wages aren't being paid and the International Monetary Fund won't continue its lending -- what happened?
A: You want party line? Fallout from Thailand; emerging markets now imploding markets. Tough all over, nobody's fault.
Q: C'mon -- what's the root cause of the red ink and the desperation to borrow?
A: Root cause is roots -- potatoes, beets, radishes. Farmers barter them for vodka, shoes, music videos. Three-quarters of our sales is barter.
Q: But isn't that why money was invented, so you wouldn't have to schlep around a huge sack of potatoes to trade? Why don't Russians use their rubles?
A: Because when you sell for money, you have to pay taxes. But when you swap -- no taxes. Russian people no fools.
Q: But don't Russians realize that if they don't pay taxes, the Government can't pay wages and welfare, and the I.M.F. won't pop with its next installment?
A: You know what is "tax base"? Too small. The big gas company, Chernomyrdin family's Gazprom, pays no tax. Big oil, big mineral, big weapons producers, owned mainly by Government -- also pay no taxes. So whole burden falls on little people. That's why, when Moscow demands 80 percent of their money, the answer is: "What money? You want a potato?"
Q: Why, then, doesn't Yeltsin broaden the base by privatizing and then taxing the big Government monopolies in energy and armaments?
A: Easy to say. Anatoly Chubais did some of that privatizing, creating oligarchy of seven capitalist big shots, but those thieves fell out and caught each other paying him off. Now Yeltsin put Chubais in woodshed, or doghouse, and reform of Gazprom is dead.
Q: But the young reformer Boris Nemtsov is still in place, even though he lost one of his titles in the Chubais chastisement. Isn't he the apple of Yeltsin's eye, the chosen successor, and don't the polls show him to be the most popular man in Russia?
A: General Lebed was popular, too. Yeltsin brought him in, used him, let him get unpopular, threw him out. When Nemtsov can't pay the back wages he promised by next month, Yeltsin will blame him. "The Czar never knew." Nemtsov is a good man, and his new helper Zadornov is a product of Yabloko reform, but they are dependent on Yeltsin, and "the other Boris" is reduced these days to making speeches about where to bury the Romanovs' bones.
Q: Wasn't Nemtsov untouched by the publishing scandal?
A: Scandal is an American hobby. This is Russia. We have political stagnation that has led to law-enforcement breakdown and economic ruin. It's systematic -- no, systemic.
Q: What's the economic answer?
A: Public auctions of the monopolies. Land sales. Lower taxes so more people can use money again and Government can raise some revenue.
Q: The practical political answer?
A: We need a whole group of reform leaders in the Kremlin and the Duma who can guard one another's backs as they let the people exploit the riches of this country. Grigory Yavlinsky's party, Yabloko, dreams of that, but it won't happen soon.
Q: Why not? Why can't a literate population in a resource-rich land make ends meet?
A: Because this Czar knows where he wants to stay but not where he wants the country to go. That's why he puts one arm around Iran and Iraq while he has the other hand in America's pocket.
You like "root cause is roots"? Big insight. If you use, credit Punditsky. With Primakov on the loose in Iraq, and Chernomyrdin wheeling his nuclear deal in Iran, it's the only kind of credit we can get.

HEADLINE: Cast Out By the Right

BYLINE: By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury is director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Try to understand my problem. As a black conservative intellectual, I belong to an endangered species. For if few conservatives choose to think of themselves as intellectuals, even fewer blacks can pass muster as conservatives.
Not that my position is uncomfortable. With black critics of racial liberalism being such a rare breed, I have found my voice amplified on a range of issues. 
 Recently, however, I have been unable to shake a troubling thought: The designation "black conservative intellectual" may not be merely anomalous but oxymoronic.
I should say at the outset that I disagree with those black liberals who think racial loyalty must propel every "authentic black" to the left wing of the political spectrum. And I reject the tenet that no "real intellectual" can ever embrace conservatism.
Today, in fact, the governing political philosophy in America is a (mildly) conservative one, and a growing number of blacks embrace political, economic and social conservatism -- some because they are religious traditionalists, others because they are middle-class suburbanites concerned about high taxes and too much government.
I am a bit of both, and so for more than a decade now I have found myself at home within the conservative intellectual movement.
But in the last few years, conservative intellectuals have developed an inflexible, hard-edged dogma when it comes to race. There was a time, from the mid-1970's through the late 1980's, when some of the most nuanced and serious thinking about race came from the right -- whether it was James Q. Wilson's work on adolescent criminal behavior, Nathan Glazer's criticism of racial quotas or Charles Murray's analysis of the welfare state. They were concerned about the plight of black Americans. And their writing had a subtlety of thought and a generosity of spirit.
But today conservative discourse on race has largely been reduced to sloganeering, filled with references to black criminality, illegitimacy and cultural pathology. This talk does not describe a tragedy shared by us all. Instead it denounces a cultural failing said to threaten our civilization.
A "get out of the wagon and help the rest of us push" approach to indigent families and a "lock 'em up and throw away the key" attitude toward inner-city law-breakers have become staples of conservative ideology. There is scarcely a thought given to the impact such policies will have on poor black communities.
Once conservatives battled rigid quotas. Now they attack all affirmative action programs meant to encourage greater inclusion of blacks in American institutions. Once conservatives promoted programs that required work in exchange for welfare benefits. Now they want to cut families off benefits entirely.
Black conservative intellectuals are faced with rebutting arguments like those made by Charles Murray in "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks might be genetically inferior, or countering arguments made by Dinesh D'Souza in "The End of Racism," which held that blacks are culturally inferior.
A few weeks ago when I suggested to a gathering of conservatives that their seeming hostility to every social program smacked of indifference to the poor, I was told that a surgeon could not properly be said to have no concern for a terminally ill patient simply because he had moved on to the next case. The analogy alone speaks volumes.
Just last month, I heard a top aide to a Midwestern Republican senator tell cultural conservatives that, in the name of restoring "traditional American values," his boss sought to "build a bridge to the 19th century." (Now that's turning back the clock!)
I have tried to argue with my fellow conservatives about the nuances, complexities and moral ambiguities of issues like welfare, affirmative action and drug control policy. But I have succeeded only in arousing the suspicion that I am not a "true believer."
Indeed, my views on affirmative action have evolved, and that is seen as a betrayal. At a conference in Washington this fall of conservative intellectuals, I suggested that a modest degree of affirmative action in higher education could be justified. That prompted an angry response from Norman Podhoretz, the conservative writer and editor, who called me "disingenuous" and added, "I much prefer the old Glenn Loury to the new one." The discussion limped along from there.
My dilemma is not unique. Consider the case of Robert Woodson Sr., the president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. For 20 years, Mr. Woodson has been criticizing the agenda of black liberals, but he has also been helping grass-roots organizations expand economic opportunities in their low-income communities.
It distresses Mr. Woodson that so little interest in this work is shown by some conservative intellectuals even as they insist that government has no answers and that blacks must help themselves. Indeed, two years ago, Mr. Woodson and I publicly terminated our association with the conservative American Enterprise Institute for its support of Mr. D'Souza, who was a research fellow there.
Mr. Woodson has also rebuffed conservatives who want him to speak out against affirmative action. He fears that other African-Americans may see him as an instrument of forces hostile to blacks' interests. Mr. Woodson has a valid point, but few conservatives can see it. They think he is hostile to conservative interests -- even though his work otherwise embodies the very ideals they uphold!
The fact, as chilling as it is unavoidable, is that many among the conservative elite seem tone-deaf on the issue of race. They can't see that our country's moral aspirations -- to be "a city on a hill," a beacon of hope and freedom to all the world -- seem impossible when one sees the despair of so many of those Americans who descend from slaves.
We have unfinished business on the race front, and it won't be finished simply by enacting tax cuts, approving school vouchers, continuing the war on drugs or reforming welfare.
Some conservatives understand this. Michael Joyce, the president of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, is one. John DiIulio, the Princeton political science professor, who promotes the work of inner-city churches with at-risk youths, is another. But they are exceptions.
 We need a morally astute, politically mature conservatism that acknowledges personal responsibility as one part of the social contract but also understands the importance of collective responsibility. "Those people" who now languish in America's central cities are "our" people, and "we" must build relationships with them. We cannot simply abandon them or leave them to their own devices.
The fault lies not with conservatism per se but with those conservatives who fail to see that their creed is entirely consistent with the creative use of the moral imagination.

HEADLINE: A Safety Net for the Neediest

 BODY:
The city seems safer and more prosperous to those with good jobs and peaceful homes, but New York's most vulnerable residents struggle daily for food, shelter and freedom from violence. With unemployment in the city at 10 percent, boom times have not come to people on the margins of society.
All over New York, neglected children are waiting to be fed. Young mothers are struggling to cope with too few resources. The elderly, often cut off from families, are languishing alone in silent apartments. Unexpected illness, a divorce or a lay-off from a job can push a family into crisis. Private generosity is now more important than ever as governments at all levels retreat from sustaining society's weakest members. 
 Today The New York Times's Neediest Cases Fund begins its annual appeal to help seven of the city's largest and oldest charities provide the poor and the abused a shot at a better life. In a big city, it is often hard to see how one can help one's neighbors. The annual drive, first held in 1912, does that by putting every dollar into direct aid for people in the city's five boroughs. No money is diverted for solicitation or administrative expenses.
Donations will help the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service pay for a program in the New York public schools to combat child abuse and provide emergency cash and food aid for families on the verge of collapse. The Children's Aid Society, another beneficiary of the fund, reaches 100,000 children a year with services ranging from transitional housing for homeless families to running mobile health clinics in the poorest neighborhoods and tutoring programs for teen-agers all over the city. The Community Service Society of New York, another beneficiary, prevents homelessness by giving clients cash to help them stop evictions, while rehabilitating buildings to house the homeless and low-income families. These efforts form part of a social safety net that no city can survive without.
Every dollar can help make New York a more humane and caring place to live. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 29

 BODY:
After the Chrysler Corporation spent more than half a billion dollars to convert a car factory in Newark, Del., to produce big Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles, it threw a party in September to open the new assembly line. The state's political leaders stood with Chrysler's chairman on a podium decorated with red and white bunting and waved victoriously to hundreds of cheering auto workers whose jobs had been saved.
When the Durango went on sale this fall, dealers could not keep enough in stock. And Chrysler, which barely breaks even on ordinary passenger cars, began pocketing $8,000 in profit for every Durango sold. 
 There is just one problem: The Dodge Durango has a much worse environmental record than the full-sized sedan, the Dodge Intrepid, that the factory used to build. Its gasoline consumption and output of carbon dioxide, a principal cause of global warming, are 57 percent higher than those of the Intrepid. And the Durango's emissions of nitrogen oxides, the main cause of smog, are twice the level of the car it replaced.
If the Durango and most other sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were classified as cars, they would violate Federal standards for pollution and gasoline consumption aimed at protecting the environment and conserving energy. Instead, these vehicles have long been classified as "light trucks" because they were once used mostly on farms and construction sites.
Lawmakers, regulators and Presidents back to the Johnson Administration have granted special favors to makers and buyers of light trucks. Among those are rules for pollutants and fuel consumption that are considerably softer than those applied to cars for the last two decades.
These lower standards remain in place even though light trucks now account for nearly one of every two family vehicles sold and even though most of them are used by suburban Americans simply for shopping and commuting.
For years, American auto makers and their workers have waged a potent campaign to preserve the rules. Now, as President Clinton proposes to reduce American emissions of global warming gases to 1990 levels within a dozen years, the auto industry's lobbying is in high gear.
The manufacturers are worried about a meeting -- beginning on Monday in Kyoto, Japan -- in which 166 nations will try to limit global warming, which has been linked to the burning of fossil fuels like gasoline.
American emissions of global warming gases are increasing even faster than previously expected, in part because of the rise in popularity of sport utility vehicles and other gas-guzzling light trucks. These trucks will be the fastest-growing source of global warming gases in the United States over the next decade, according to a new study by an Environmental Protection Agency researcher, exceeding the increase in all industrial emissions combined. Already the emissions from 65 million light trucks match those from the 125 million cars on the road, the study found, and truck emissions are expected to move sharply ahead of those from cars in the years ahead.
But auto makers oppose curbing gasoline consumption through higher gasoline taxes or tighter fuel-economy standards. On Oct. 2, the Big Three's chief executives and the president of the United Automobile Workers union met with President Clinton. Three weeks after that meeting, when the President announced his position on global warming, he conspicuously omitted any mention of restrictions on vehicles.
That was only the latest case in which American car makers and their unionized workers have mobilized to protect the rules under which light trucks enjoy special privileges, including tax favors that provide incentives for auto makers to build light trucks and for Americans to buy them.
That combined lobbying muscle has been highly effective. It was not that long ago, for example, that Bill Clinton, seeking voters with an environmental conscience during the 1992 Democratic primaries, called for the auto industry to achieve much higher fuel economy. Al Gore, his running mate, had even introduced a bill in 1989 requiring a 65 percent increase in the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks as a way to reduce global warming. But after pressure from the U.A.W., the Big Three and attacks from politicians in auto manufacturing states, the Clinton-Gore team backed off.
The auto makers have also set up lobbying groups like the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, which says it includes 6,000 other organizations and 35,000 people. The coalition has persuaded a broad range of nonprofit groups to join its efforts to influence regulators and politicians of both parties.
But the industry does not need to spend a lot of money on coalitions or campaign contributions to achieve its goals. Virtually every Congressional district has auto dealerships, while auto assembly plants and parts factories have spread out of the Great Lakes region to the South and both coasts. General Motors and Ford are so enormous that they each produce more than 1 percent of the nation's economic output, the only two companies to do so. The 800,000-strong U.A.W. is a potent force in Democratic politics. So it is no surprise that the auto makers and union leaders generally encounter an open door when they call on lawmakers.
Nor have the auto makers been shy about using their position as the nation's biggest advertisers to discourage the news media from criticizing light trucks. The industry, for instance, virtually stopped advertising in the Sierra Club's magazine after an article discussed the poor fuel economy of sport utility vehicles.
Here are some of the ways that light trucks are given special treatment:
*Most light trucks are allowed to emit 75 percent to 175 percent more smog-causing nitrogen oxides than even the biggest cars.
*Each manufacturer is required to build a fleet of cars with an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles a gallon, but light trucks have to clear a bar of just 20.7 miles a gallon. Manufacturers can make their trucks much heavier and roomier while using fewer expensive but weight-saving aluminum parts. But those trucks consume far more gasoline than even the biggest cars and spew more gases that contribute to global warming.
*The largest Chevrolet Suburbans and full-size pickups have become so heavy that they no longer even qualify as light trucks under the 22-year-old fuel-economy legislation. That means their fuel economies are not even calculated or included in the manufacturers' averages.
*By building pickup trucks and mini-vans that can run on ethanol as well as gasoline, auto makers plan to win credits from the Government that will allow them to build more gas-guzzling light trucks -- even if buyers of the special vehicles never use ethanol, a type of alcohol made from grain and extremely rare at filling stations.
*Until 1989, American-made sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were protected from foreign competition by a Federal tax on imported light trucks that was 10 times as high as the tax on imported cars. That high tax of 25 percent still applies to imported pickups. So American auto makers have been under less competitive pressure to develop cleaner, more fuel-efficient trucks, as they had to do with cars.
*Light trucks are exempt from the Federal gas-guzzler tax, which covers cars that get less than 22.5 miles a gallon and can add as much as $7,700 to the price of some expensive sedans and sports cars.
*People who use fairly large light trucks on the job -- even real estate agents carrying nothing bulkier than brochures in Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicles -- are allowed to claim larger tax deductions than people using cars for business.
*A lot of bigger light trucks are exempt from the Federal tax on luxury vehicles, now 8 percent of the amount of the sale price that exceeds $36,000.
Many of these special arrangements for light trucks were made during the energy conservation movement of the 1970's, when only 20 million light trucks were on the road, and they were mainly commercial vehicles. Lawmakers and regulators focused on making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient because there were so many more of them.
But as light trucks have become the vehicle of choice among millions of families who use them just like cars, they have grown from one-sixth of those sold to almost half. Today, the 65 million light trucks on the road are more than triple the number in 1975, while the number of cars on the road has only risen by a third since then.
For struggling American auto makers, trounced in the 1970's and 1980's by their Japanese and European competitors, light trucks have been a miracle, propelling them from dismal results to record earnings. Detroit and its workers rightly credit light trucks with saving thousands of jobs.
Yet light trucks pose significant problems -- and not just prodigious gasoline consumption.
Without the shift toward more and bigger light trucks, the United States would find it easier to make the reductions in global warming gases to 1990 levels that the rest of the world is demanding. Cars and light trucks accounted for nearly one-fifth of American emissions of these gases in 1990, and their emissions are projected to rise by as much as 55 percent by 2010 if the surge in light trucks continues. The emissions would rise by only 35 percent if light trucks were no more popular than they were in the 70's.
As for pollutants that cause smog, regulators in California, which is allowed to set its own tougher standards, have concluded that light-truck exhaust may prevent them from reaching Federal goals for smog reduction and are quietly planning to crack down. Finally, because light trucks consume so much gasoline, they make the United States more dependent on foreign oil at a time when oil imports are at record levels.
 
Government Response
All Remains Quiet On Washington Front
The auto industry has not encountered much resistance to the special treatment of light trucks. The Government has raised the fuel-economy standard for light trucks by just two-tenths of a mile a gallon over the last decade, to 20.7 miles a gallon from 20.5. Since 1995, Congress has barred further increases.
And while the Government tightened standards for nitrogen oxide emissions for both cars and light trucks several years ago and is planning to tighten them further, the standards remain far more lax for trucks.
The Clinton Administration, having backed away from calls for raising fuel-economy standards, has instead focused on supporting research into more fuel-efficient vehicles. The Government has been giving the auto industry $250 million a year since 1994 to pay for such work. Yet the research has mainly focused on producing a prototype car by 2003 that can travel up to 80 miles a gallon. Light-truck designs have received little attention even though they have emerged as the bigger problem.
Asked about the issue, President Clinton and Vice President Gore responded through spokesmen that they would have considered increasing fuel-economy standards if not prevented by Congress. "The industry raised a fuss, and Congress stopped it," said Barry Toiv, the deputy White House press secretary. But the Administration has done little to oppose Congress.
Environmental groups have also given the light-truck issue low priority because they think they have little chance of success. For now, they are making only sporadic efforts to raise public awareness.
"Getting Congress and this President to control sport utility pollution is like pushing a Chevy Suburban uphill with your nose," said Daniel Becker, the energy policy director of the Sierra Club.
That so little has been done about these problems in Washington is a reflection of the fact that Detroit is giving people what they want. Americans -- even ones who fancy themselves as environmentally conscious -- have fallen in love with trucks.
Take Henry E. Douglas, a 39-year-old engineer from Hyattsville, Md., who is single. After many years of keeping the heat low in winter to save energy, Mr. Douglas compromised with his principles this autumn. He traded in his 1994 Subaru wagon for a 1994 Land Rover Discovery that goes 14 miles on a gallon of gasoline, half as far as the Subaru, and produces twice the pollutants.
Mr. Douglas picked the sport utility vehicle so he could drive from his home to New England ski slopes in even the nastiest weather. "I feel guilty about buying this big truck to drive around in, and I have caught flak from friends for it," he said. "I did a little good old American backsliding, as I think a lot of people have done lately."
The fall in the price of gasoline, after inflation is taken into account, has taken the economic pinch out of driving light trucks. For a family that drives 15,000 miles a year, owning a Suburban, which sells for $26,000 and up, now costs only $550 more in annual gasoline bills than driving a Honda Accord, or less than $50 a month.
Light trucks have many other attractions. They are stylish. They are roomier than cars, with the largest sport utility vehicles carrying nine people. Sitting above the cars around them, they give drivers a sense of power. They make passengers feel safer, although they are more prone to flipping.
Yet because they have grown much heavier relative to cars over the last 20 years, and because they tend to ride higher, light trucks inflict heavy damage when they collide with cars. Even though there are twice as many cars in use as trucks, the trucks now kill more people in cars each year than other cars do. Two big insurers have already begun raising liability rates for light trucks, and others plan to do so.
Auto makers are nonetheless building light-truck factories and converting old car factories on the assumption that within a few years half the vehicles sold will be light trucks. Sales of the biggest sport utility vehicles are growing fastest of all. With the introduction of models like the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, sales of full-size sport utility vehicles soared 53 percent in the first nine months of this year compared with figures from the same period a year earlier, even as car sales fell 4 percent.
Americans' infatuation with light trucks alarms some Federal and state regulators. A quick comparison of specific models shows why. Both gasoline consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide are 86 percent higher for a Chevrolet Suburban than for a Honda Accord, and 43 percent higher for the Suburban than for even the huge Buick Roadmaster station wagon that General Motors built until last year. The cleanest Suburbans emit twice the nitrogen oxides of the Accord or the Roadmaster.
The E.P.A.'s expert on light-truck emissions, John German, has calculated in a new study that because of the shift to light trucks, Government forecasts of nitrogen oxide pollution from family vehicles in 2020 should be raised by 6 percent to 23 percent. Projections for carbon dioxide emissions and gasoline consumption by 2010 should be raised by 8 percent. The forecasts have been based until now on the outdated assumption that light trucks would be less than a third of the passenger vehicles in use through 2015, when they already exceed 34 percent.
Regulators in California, which has 7.5 million light trucks, said they would begin drafting rules to require trucks to meet the same antismog standards as cars by 2008. "We did not expect trucks to be this popular," said Steven G. Albu, chief of automotive engineering studies at the California Air Resources Board. "It undermines our efforts to get to the Federal clean air goals."
 
How It All Began
Chicken Came First, Then Truck Rules
For light trucks, the long line of favors from Washington all started with frozen chickens.
Beginning in 1962, the Kennedy Administration accused the European Community of unfairly restricting imports of American poultry at the request of West German chicken farmers. In January 1964, two months after taking office, President Johnson punished the Europeans by imposing a 25 percent tax on all imported light trucks.
The official reason given for choosing light trucks was that American imports of Volkswagen vans from West Germany were close in dollar value to the lost American sales of chickens to Europe. But recently released audio tapes from the Johnson White House suggest that the President may have had another motive. The tapes show that in January 1964, President Johnson was trying to persuade Walter Reuther, the U.A.W.'s president, not to call a strike just before the 1964 election and to support the President's civil rights agenda. The tapes also show that Mr. Reuther wanted President Johnson to respond to Volkswagen's growing shipments to the United States, although the labor leader was more concerned with the Beetle than the vans.
Through three rounds of global trade negotiations since then, import fees on virtually every other manufactured good except clothing and textiles have been reduced to 2 percent or 3 percent or have been eliminated. But Detroit has lobbied effectively to protect the light-truck tariff.
During the most recent round, which concluded in 1993, the American auto industry warned that it would withhold its support from any agreement that reduced the 25 percent tariff that remained on many light trucks, said a senior Bush Administration trade official who insisted on anonymity. The Bush Administration followed the industry's wishes despite complaints from Japan. To this day, the tax remains at 25 percent for imported pickup trucks, although the Government has reduced it to 2.5 percent for mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- on the ground that they are not trucks. But Washington continues to classify them as light trucks for all other purposes.
The tax has helped prevent European and Asian auto makers from winning a firm foothold in the light-truck market; they are only now catching up by building pickup and sport utility vehicle factories in the United States. While Detroit held only 64 percent of the nation's car market last year, the Big Three sold 86 percent of the light trucks. The barriers to competition have meant less pressure on Detroit to make its models cleaner and more fuel efficient, two strengths of Japanese car makers.
The import tax was just the first of many special favors. The 1973 Arab oil embargo led Congress to set gasoline mileage rules for cars. But the auto industry allied itself with farmers and home builders who said that similar standards for pickup trucks would pose an intolerable burden by forcing auto makers to make the trucks smaller and less powerful. So Congress asked the Transportation Department to come up with a separate set of rules for light trucks.
Enthusiasm for regulation has faded as worries about oil shortages have ebbed. Fuel-economy standards for cars rose to 27.5 miles a gallon in 1985 while truck standards have barely changed. In 1975, when Congress passed the fuel-economy legislation, the average fuel economy of new light trucks was 13 percent below cars. Now, it is 25 percent lower.
The rules, combined with rising gasoline prices, forced Detroit to design much smaller cars in the late 1970's and early 80's. But when gasoline prices dropped after 1981, Lee Iacocca and Harold K. Sperlich, Chrysler's chief executive and president, respectively, made use of the opportunity provided by the separate rules for trucks. In 1984, they introduced the mini-van.
Had it been classified as a car, the mini-van would have made it hard for Chrysler to meet fuel-economy standards for its fleet. But because it was at least partly based on a pickup design, and came in a cargo version, too, regulators accepted it as a truck.
With America hungering for roomier family vehicles again, the eight-passenger mini-van was an instant success, rescuing Chrysler from the brink of disaster. Ford then set off the sport utility vehicle surge with the introduction of the Explorer in 1990.
Now that they are selling ever-bigger sport utility vehicles, Chrysler and Ford are having trouble meeting even the lower fuel-economy standard for light trucks. So they plan to build more than 200,000 mini-vans and pickups annually that can burn ethanol as well as gasoline. This will allow them to take advantage of generous Government fuel-economy credits for such vehicles, even if the buyers never use ethanol.
Why ethanol? Ethanol is commonly made from corn; corn farmers and processors successfully lobbied Congress in 1988 to insert the loophole into fuel-economy laws as a way to increase demand for corn. While the auto makers were not especially interested in ethanol then, they were happy to go along. Now they see a way to benefit.
Environmentalists paid little attention to light trucks when fuel-economy rules were enacted or when clean air legislation was drafted during the Carter Administration. "We weren't smart enough in the 1977 legislation to take on the light-truck issue," said Michael P. Walsh, director of the E.P.A.'s air-and-radiation division from 1977 to 1981.
Congress also failed to foresee the popularity of light trucks in writing tax laws. When the gas-guzzler tax was drafted in 1978, House members from rural districts insisted that light trucks be exempt to protect farmers' pickups, said Albert Buckberg, a longtime economist for the Joint Committee on Taxation who has since retired. Because the larger light trucks were not seen as luxurious, they were also exempted from the luxury vehicle tax in 1990.
Times have changed. Even the American Automobile Manufacturers Association concedes that only a quarter of light trucks are now used for farming and other commercial purposes. In just the last year, luxury-car makers have been rushing out deluxe sport utility models like the Lincoln Navigator, at $40,000 and up, and the Mercedes-Benz ML320, priced at $35,000 to $40,000. Cadillac announced plans on Nov. 20 for a huge new model next year. When the tax laws were written, Mr. Buckberg said, "There were no such things as the Lincoln Continentals of sport utility vehicles."
 
Fending Off Threats
Aggressive Lobbying At All Political Levels
The year was 1990, and Iraq had just invaded Kuwait, raising fears that the oil lifeline between the Middle East and the United States would be cut. That crisis, and fears about global warming, produced a serious effort by Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, to raise fuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks by 40 percent by 2001. The measure won the support of 57 senators but fell three votes short of the total needed to defeat a filibuster.
To help head off the legislation, the Big Three hired a lobbying firm, FMR Group Inc., which organized a campaign of grass-roots resistance in Nevada. Detroit auto makers hired another lobbyist in 1990, John R. Bonner, to drum up opposition to the Bryan bill in other states. Mr. Bonner set up a news conference in Washington and invited representatives of groups that used big vehicles. A Nebraska farmer pointed out that a Honda Civic could not haul a livestock trailer. A charity official from South Dakota said disabled people needed big vans for their wheelchair lifts. An Alabama sheriff said small cars could not be driven as fast to crime scenes. Each speaker's plane fare and expenses were paid for by the auto makers, Mr. Bonner said.
To help block any further moves to raise fuel-economy standards, the auto industry set up a lobbying group in Washington in 1991 called the Coalition for Vehicle Choice and has bankrolled its budget ever since. The coalition is headed by Diane K. Steed, the top highway safety regulator in the Reagan Administration.
The next threat to light trucks came during the 1992 campaign of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Mr. Clinton criticized President Bush for not raising fuel-economy standards.
But once Mr. Clinton had won the Democratic nomination with the support of environmentalists, his position began to shift. Auto industry and U.A.W. officials met repeatedly with campaign advisers through the summer to contend that raising fuel standards would eliminate jobs -- and cost the votes of tens of thousands of auto workers. At a campaign stop in Detroit on Aug. 21, Mr. Clinton said that while he wanted more fuel-efficient vehicles, they might not be technically feasible -- the justification later used for subsidizing industry research instead of raising fuel-economy standards.
And the auto makers are not reluctant to retaliate against opponents of sport utility vehicles, like the Sierra Club, one of the few public interest groups actively fighting the spread of the vehicles. The club's bimonthly magazine, Sierra, carried ads for sport utility vehicles until it published an article last winter criticizing their poor fuel economy. All of the sport utility ads disappeared, costing the magazine 7 percent of its annual advertising revenue, according to Joan N. Hamilton, the editor in chief.
"We had to shrink the pages of our magazine accordingly," she said. The magazine has continued to publish articles critical of the auto industry.
For many years, Detroit's lobbying in Washington followed one rule: call Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the longest-serving House member and served as Commerce Committee chairman for 14 years.
When Republicans captured control of the House and Senate in the 1994 elections, Mr. Dingell lost his chairmanship. But the auto industry has lost none of its influence and may have even increased its sway. Many Republicans have long shared the auto makers' hostility to regulation. The auto industry's political contributions, while modest compared with those of other industries, have long gone lopsidedly to Republicans.
The manufacturers' latest worry is the conference on global warming. The theory of global warming predicts that the buildup of certain gases in the atmosphere will lead to less of the sun's energy being reflected from earth into space, resulting in a warmer climate. While some scientists have questioned whether global warming is a serious enough problem to justify costly policy moves now, there is broad scientific agreement that some problem exists.
The auto makers fear pressure on the United States to curb gasoline consumption through higher gasoline taxes or higher fuel-economy standards. The result has been aggressive lobbying, including in October, when President Clinton met with the Big Three's chief executives and the U.A.W.'s president, Stephen Yokich.
The White House had hoped that the auto makers would thank the President for trying to break open the Korean auto market. But the executives spent most of the hourlong meeting criticizing the Administration's desire to secure a binding international agreement in Kyoto. Only the United States, with its strong legal system, would respect such an agreement, they warned, and at the expense of slower economic growth and the loss of thousands of jobs.
But the lobbying extends far beyond meetings with the President. The Durango assembly line party looked like a campaign event, and in a way it was, part of the industry's unending effort to cultivate allies at all levels of politics. Thomas R. Carper, the Democratic Governor of Delaware, pointed out in his speech that Chrysler's $623 million investment to convert the factory to sport utility vehicle production was the equivalent of $1,000 for every person in the state. Asked minutes later about the environmental issues surrounding light trucks, the Governor volunteered to help Chrysler fight any restrictions.
"If they need our help," he said, "we'll give it to them."
After the ceremony, Robert Liberatore, Chrysler's chief lobbyist and a former top Democratic Senate aide, steered Senator Joseph Biden, a Democrat, toward a lunch with Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, and Delaware's other Senator, William Roth Jr., a Republican.
Asked later what they had talked about, the Senators said the conversation had mainly involved Chrysler's interest in free trade. But when pressed, Senator Biden said Mr. Eaton had also spoken to him about the dangers of raising fuel-economy standards.
 
A Widening Constituency
Country Truck, City Truck
 The Everly family near Bondurant, Iowa, has been using pickups to farm since the 1920's and cannot imagine life without them. Last spring, James L. Everly used his pickup to haul seed corn and herbicides to his fields. This autumn, he used it to transport his crops to a grain elevator.
"You couldn't use a sedan or a wagon because you'd get stuck in the mud," Mr. Everly said.
By contrast, Andrew and Jillian Dijak in Westport, Conn., have other expectations for their truck. They traded in their Audi two years ago to lease a Range Rover. They thought the big sport utility vehicle would provide more protection in an accident. Now they are on the waiting list for a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle. "Winters can be harsh here, and I have two young children," Mrs. Dijak said. "I thought being higher would be safer than the Audi."
Auto makers are designing many light trucks these days for two different markets: the original customers who use them as work vehicles and the newcomers who view them as oversize cars. People who need work vehicles want the features they have always counted on -- powerful engines, four-wheel drive and sturdy frames -- to negotiate muddy fields or rough roads.
But commuters, along with soccer moms and dads, also want air-conditioning, luxurious interiors and fast acceleration. The auto makers are granting their wishes, making the trucks even heavier and requiring more powerful, gas-guzzling engines. The horsepower of the average light truck has soared 48 percent in the last decade. Chrysler has begun offering a new engine in the Jeep Grand Cherokee that allows it to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in seven seconds -- as fast as a 1978 Corvette.
Most sport utility vehicles and pickups have blocky shapes that make them less aerodynamic, reducing their energy efficiency. Popular four-wheel-drive systems, which allow better control on bad or snowy roads, likewise hurt fuel economy by adding up to 500 pounds of weight. Light trucks even have taller, less aerodynamic passenger compartments than cars -- a peculiar remnant of the days when men wore hats.
"In Texas, you have to be able to wear your cowboy hat," said Tom Baughman, Ford's truck engineering director.
Many light trucks, particularly the larger sport utility vehicles and pickups, are designed to carry heavy cargoes or haul trailers, and have fuel-gulping engines.
But an internal study by the Big Three has found that slightly less than half of full-size sport utility vehicles, and only 15 percent of all sport utility vehicles, are used for towing. Full-size sport utility vehicles may be handy for carrying big families, but three-quarters of the buyers come from households with three or fewer people.
 
Environmental Problems
Higher Emissions, Lower Fuel Economy
To build trucks sturdy enough to satisfy farmers like Mr. Everly and peppy enough to please former car drivers like the Dijaks, auto makers have developed bigger and bigger engines. But there are drawbacks.
Two decades of progress in reducing emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxides from family vehicles is being slowed by the shift from cars to light trucks. For light trucks as a group, actual emissions are 20 percent to 100 percent higher than for cars as a group, with the exact figure ranging from city to city based on the severity of auto inspections, according to the E.P.A.
Nobody says light trucks have to be this dirty. Mr. Albu of the California Air Resources Board said that regulators planned to outfit a Ford F-150 pickup with a better catalytic converter in an experiment intended to show that trucks can meet even the strictest car emissions standards. The upgraded catalytic converters could end up costing manufacturers $100 to $300 a vehicle, said John Dunlap, the agency's chairman. The E.P.A. is required by a 1990 law to cut allowable nitrogen oxide emissions for cars and light trucks in 2004, but has not decided by how much.
All but the smallest light trucks also burn a lot of gasoline. Many auto executives say that Americans are not worried about conserving gas. When Chrysler introduced the Durango, which gets 13 miles to the gallon in the city and 17 on the highway, Mr. Eaton declared, "Fuel economy within the area we're talking about here is not an issue to the consumer."
American gasoline use is already expected to grow by up to 33 percent by 2010. If light trucks become as common as cars by then, gasoline consumption will be an additional 8 percent higher than if light trucks remained a third of the vehicles on the road, according to the study by Mr. German of the E.P.A.'s automotive pollution office in Ann Arbor, Mich.
If Americans were still buying the same proportion of light trucks as in 1975, and if these light trucks had improved in fuel economy as quickly as cars since then, gasoline consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by cars and light trucks in the United States would already be 9.3 percent lower today, according to calculations by John M. DeCicco, a senior researcher at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy in Washington. That translates into 600,000 barrels of oil a day, or 3.3 percent of national oil consumption.
Many environmentalists have advocated tightening fuel-economy rules. The auto makers and most economists disagree. Higher gas taxes, they point out, would limit the miles people drove. Light trucks are far less popular in Europe because gasoline there costs up to $5 a gallon after taxes are included. In the United States, said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, "if fuel were $3 a gallon, for example, I think you'd see a very different distribution of size of vehicles, car and truck."
Yet higher gasoline taxes are unlikely, particularly with the Federal budget nearly in balance. Higher fuel-economy standards for light trucks are also unlikely. So for now, light-truck sales keep climbing. "We are in the business," Mr. Trotman said, "of supplying customers what they'd like to buy."

"A Heavyweight Gets Heavier"
Auto makers are designing light trucks not only for buyers who use them as work vehicles but also for people who use them as oversize cars for shopping and commuting. One example is the 1997 Chevrolet Suburban, a behemoth even a decade ago, which has put on 1,000 pounds in weight since 1985 as General Motors has made it more attractive to car drivers and added more towing power.
 
EXTRAS -- Air-conditioning, stereo systems, luxurious interiors and extra insulation for a quiet ride make the truck seem more like a car but add weight
 
HEAVY FRAME -- Allows owner to tow up to 6,000 pounds
 
WEIGHT -- 4,800 to 6,700 pounds, depending on model and equipment
 
HIGH BLOCKY DESIGN -- Originally planned as a way to let occupants have room to wear cowboy hats, it hurts aerodynamics and fuel economy.
 
V8 ENGINE -- With up to 290 horsepower, it provides lots of power but gets under 15 miles to the gallon and produces twice the nitrogen oxide emissions of a large car and significantly more global warming gases.
 
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE -- Improves traction on muddy tracks and snowy roads but hurts fuel economy by adding 470 pounds and requiring that the frame be higher off the ground, which hurts aerodynamics. (pg. 42)

Most light trucks - sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups - are environmentally more harmful than even the biggest cars in three ways: They consume more fuel; they contribute more to global warming, and they emit more smog-causing pollutants. The more popular light trucks become, the more they inhibit efforts to curb tailpipe pollutants, global warming and energy waste.
 
Size
Two decades ago the average light truck and car weighed about the same and had similar engines. High fuel-economy standards for cars have held down weights and engine power since then, but lower standards for trucks have allowed greater weight and bigger engines. Graphs show average weight and engine horsepower for cars and for light trucks, 1975-95.
 
Smog
Because light trucks are allowed to emit more smog-causing nitrogen oxides than cars, the growing popularity of light trucks is slowing progress toward cleaner air in urban areas.
 
The Environmental Protection Agency sets standards for the pollution a vehicle can emit after 50,000 miles. Most light trucks are allowed a higher total than any car.
 
The E.P.A. tests a few vehicles each year that have been driven 50,000 miles and orders recalls of models that emit too much. But the agency mostly relies on a less direct method: Testing new models after just 4,000 miles. These short-distance results must fall well under the 50,000-mile maximum to avoid risking a future recall because engines get dirtier with use. Chart compares levels of nitrogen oxides emitted for some popular car and light truck models.
 
Gasoline Use
The Government allows light trucks to get fewer miles to the gallon than cars, so the trucks can weigh more and have larger engines than cars.
 
Americans are driving more miles each year, so fuel consumption has been rising anyway in recent years. But light trucks' rapid growth will raise consumption even faster.
 
Manufacturers are required to build a fleet of cars with an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon; light trucks need average only 20.7 miles per gallon. And loopholes give auto makers even more leeway: Some of the biggest models are so heavy that they are not classified as light trucks and thus are exempt from minimum mileage rules. Chart compares gas mileage figures for some popular car and light truck models.
 
Global Warming
Even the cleanest internal combustion engine produces gases that contribute to global warming, chiefly carbon dioxide.
 
The amount of carbon dioxide a vehicle releases depends directly on the amount of fuel burned. On average, burning a gallon of gasoline releases 19.7 pounds of carbon dioxide, containing 5.4 pounds of carbon. Because light trucks generally burn more fuel for each mile driven than cars do, they produce more carbon dioxide.
 
The United States has pledged to reduce overall emissions of carbon gases to 1990 levels by 2010. The rise of light trucks will make this goal very difficult to reach. Chart compares amount of carbon dioxide emitted from some popular car and light truck models.

Graph: "On Trucks, Global Heater Included"
Light trucks -- which include sport utility vehicles, pickups and mini-vans -- are the fastest-growing source of emissions of global warming gases in the United States. Their increasing popularity will make it harder for the United States to fulfill President Clinton's proposal to reduce American emissions to 1990 levels within 15 years.
 
Light trucks are expected to account for 34 percent of the increase in total energy-related carbon emissions from 1990 to 2010. That total will be 32 percent higher than the 1990 level.

HEADLINE: Iraq Accepts An Extension Of Oil Deal 'In Principle'

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Iraq said today that it accepted in principle an extension of its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations despite its reported reservations about how the arrangement has been carried out.
Iraq also said that an American U-2 surveillance plane flew over the country "to carry out provocation and espionage activities" beyond the reach of Iraqi defenses. 
 As for the oil deal, "Iraq does not object, in principle, to the renewal of the agreement," the Iraqi Culture and Information Ministry said in a statement published by the official news agency.
A ministry spokesman said that Iraq still viewed the deal, which allows it to export oil worth $2 billion over six months, as temporary and not a substitute for the removal of all curbs on the country's oil exports, imposed as part of sweeping sanctions after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
On Thursday, a United Nations spokesman in Baghdad said that Iraq was not willing to renew the deal until issues related to the approval of contracts, delivery of supplies and letters of credit were solved.
The previous day the Iraqi Health Minister, Umeed Madhat Mubarak, said that the United States had been blocking medical contracts negotiated under the plan.
Iraq says thousands of children die each month because of a shortage of medical supplies and equipment caused by the sanctions.
The oil deal went into effect last December and was renewed by the Security Council for six months from June 8. The current phase expires next Friday.
Of the $2 billion realized from the oil sold every six months, Iraq receives $1.32 billion, which it is to spend on food, medicine and other critical needs. The remainder is earmarked for reparations to victims from the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the cost of arms inspectors charged with ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.
The official news agency, I.N.A., said the U-2 spotted today entered Iraqi skies at 9.20 A.M. flying at high altitude beyond the reach of Iraqi air defenses. "Iraqi systems and air defenses have been monitoring the plane since its entrance up to its exit," the agency's report said, quoting an official spokesman.
Iraq has said it will shoot down spy planes, which are conducting United Nations surveillance, if they fly within range of its air defenses. It has also demanded that the United Nations replace the American spy plane with aircraft from other permanent members of the Security Council.
The United Nations weapons inspectors visited more sites in Iraq today. As they headed out for sites for the eighth consecutive day, it was not clear if they planned to include any "sensitive" locations that Iraq has maintained are off-limits.
Iraq says it has no more weapons to hide while the United States and the United Nations say it is still concealing biological and chemical weapons.
A clean bill of health is needed from the United Nations Special Commission in charge of arms inspections before sanctions are lifted.
The United Nations Secretary General decided on Friday against recommending a specific increase in the oil that Iraq could sell to buy food despite pleas from aid agencies to do so, diplomats at the United Nations said. They said that instead the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, would suggest that the Security Council examine the general possibility of raising Iraq's oil revenues in the light of a steady slide in the living standard of the average Iraqi.
United Nations envoys said Mr. Annan had considered recommending that the Security Council raise to $3 billion the oil Iraq could sell for the next six months.
The news agency reported that President Saddam Hussein met the Russian Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, today and hailed cooperation between their countries.
Russia brokered a deal with Iraq this month that allowed the arms inspectors, including Americans, to resume activities. In return, Russia promised to work for the lifting of sanctions.

HEADLINE: OPEC Raises Output Limits, Pleasing Saudis

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 29

 BODY:
OPEC agreed today to the first large increase in its production ceiling in four years, as Saudi Arabia asserted its dominance over the group.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to a 10 percent increase in its collective ceiling, to 27.5 million barrels a day. Widespread cheating by group members is likely to mean a higher real output. 
 Consequently some industry experts said prices could fall on Monday in open market trading. "I would think this means 50 cents to $1 off crude prices next year, with true production going up to around 28.5 million barrels a day" said Nigel Saperia of Bankers Trust International in London.
But Persian Gulf Arab countries that form the core of OPEC were pleased by the increased ceiling. Kuwait's Oil Minister, Issa al-Mazidi. said, "We have been waiting for this for some time."
Saudi Arabia's new quota of almost 8.8 million barrels a day, up from a longstanding 8 million, is its highest in more than 15 years and points to a big rise in oil revenues next year, if prices stay where they are.
The Saudis and other gulf nations have grown frustrated watching other producers ignore the quotas while they kept to theirs.
But some of the increased revenues will be lost if prices dip. "On balance this may lead to lower prices," said Mehdi Varzi, research director for Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London.
And Nauman Barakat of Prudential Securities in New York agreed, saying, "I don't think the fact OPEC quotas are now closer to actual production will impress the markets."
Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia insists that with economies strong, the markets can absorb the extra oil, allowing prices next year to average $20 a barrel for Brent crude oil. It now sells for about $19.
"We will produce according to our quota and the market will take it easily," said a Persian Gulf expert familiar with Saudi thinking.
Quota cheating brought OPEC's actual output in October to more than 27.8 million barrels a day, according to independent monitors. The new arrangement should lead to an actual increase in production of perhaps 500,000 barrels a day or more, industry analysts say.

HEADLINE: Like It or Not, Germany Becomes a Melting Pot

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
Almost 30 years ago, Elbeyi Inci left his home on Turkey's Black Sea coast and came to West Germany to work on construction sites -- one of the so-called guest workers lured by official design to the dynamo of the postwar economic miracle. At that time, foreigners were less than 4 percent of West Germany's population.
These days, according to his son Sabri, Mr. Inci's descendants in Berlin number about 20. They include the four of Sabri's five children who were born in Germany. Sabri spoke in an interview at the Inci Pizza, the family business on a street in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin where Turkish overwhelms German. 
 Now, roughly 7.1 million of Germany's population of 82 million, or almost 9 percent, are foreigners, the highest proportion in Europe, far ahead of the continental average of 5 percent and well above that of such countries as France (5.7 percent) and Britain (3.8 percent).
The combination of numbers and stories like that of the Inci family might suggest that Germany, whose foreign population was a negligible 1.2 percent of the total in 1960, is being forced into an unfamiliar cosmopolitanism not only by economic factors but also by Europe's changed dynamics after the cold war.
But if Germany is being forced to acknowledge that it has become a melting pot, then it is doing so with extreme reluctance. When guest workers came to Germany 20 to 30 years ago, jobs were plentiful, and the expectation was that with short-term residence rights they would disappear when they were no longer useful.
Now, jobs are scarce, and Germany's unemployment stands at a record 4.5 million. But many foreigners have acquired permanent residence rights in a land that is less interested in diversity than in cohesion and that does not want to be viewed as an immigrant nation as the United States once was.
"Foreigners seeking German citizenship must through their behavior show a credible integration into our social and state order," said Erwin Marschewski, a Christian Democratic spokesman on internal affairs.
And as a divisive debate over the future citizenship of foreigners born here seems to suggest, many Germans -- particularly those close to Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- are reluctant to abandon the principle that the nation's core be made up of Germans who can trace the ancestral blood line demanded by a 1913 citizenship law that still defines the essence of German nationality.
The whole debate about citizenship was incited by a proposal by the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition Government, to permit foreigners born in Germany to hold dual citizenship until the age of 18. After that, they would have to choose one nationality or the other.
But Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, who belongs to Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats, insisted, "There will never be dual nationality in Germany." Indeed, said Finance Minister Theo Waigel, rather than devise new rules, the best solution to Germany's problems might be "a sensible limit on immigration." The idea is stuck in political wrangling.
Unlike the United States but like most other European countries, Germany does not automatically grant citizenship to children born here of foreign parents. They may only apply for citizenship under strict rules once they have reached age 18.
Increasingly, however, the definition of who is a German is being challenged by people like Ozlem Inci, Sabri Inci's 19-year-old daughter. She has applied to become German, in part because she feels remote from the land of her forebears and has none of a previous generation's attachment to a country she has seen only on vacation.
"I'm not thinking of going to live in Turkey; I grew up here," she said, speaking a much more confident German than her father after her years in German schools, which have left her far more open to mixing with Germans, even dating them.
"People like me are foreigners in Turkey," she said. "They call us the Deutschlanders. There you are not a real Turk, and here you are not a complete German. We are somewhere in between."
The aim of the dual citizenship proposal is to prevent Germany's growing population of foreigners from becoming alienated minorities. But the response to it has said as much about the fears of many Germans as it has about the aspirations of many foreigners.
Easing the rules on citizenship, Mr. Kohl said recently, would double the number of Turks streaming into Germany. The remark drew widespread criticism from Turkish groups and from Germany's Jewish organizations as likely to worsen anti-foreign sentiment.
The urgency of the debate is a result of the startled recognition by officials that contrary to the original vision of the guest workers' doing their bit for Germany and then going home, and despite immigration policies that have become more restrictive in recent years, an established immigrant population has grown with its own youthful dynamics.
Almost one-quarter of all foreigners are under 18. And, most telling of all, more than 60 percent of legally registered foreigners under 18 were born in this country, a phenomenon that German officials call "immigration by birth."
"The longer-term demographic development is characterized by a reduction in the proportion of Germans in the population and a drastic increase in the younger age groups," said the latest report issued by officials dealing with legal immigrants. It does not reflect untold numbers of clandestine immigrants, largely from Africa and Eastern Europe.
Not only have the Turks, Yugoslavs and Italians imported to fuel the economic miracle grown into a settled community of around 3.4 million -- two million of them from Turkey -- but the ranks of Germany's foreign population have also swollen with war refugees from the former Yugoslavia, asylum-seekers from many parts of the world and East Europeans drawn to the Continent's traditional economic powerhouse. Berlin alone has a Russian population estimated at 100,000. And Italians who first arrived as guest workers now have automatic rights under European Union rules to live and work in any of the Union's 15 member countries, including Germany.
At the same time, the very nature of the economic pickings that drew the guest workers here has changed. Like his father before him, Mr. Inci came to work on construction sites. But since 1992, he and his brother have been running the modest Inci Pizza eatery, which is just one of 42,000 Turkish-owned businesses ranging from kebab stands to textile companies and travel agencies.
For all that, though, Germans and Turks remain keenly aware of the distinctions between the groups. "Even if I had a German passport, I would still feel like a foreigner and be regarded as a foreigner," Mr. Inci said.
Indeed, Miss Inci said, even though some of her friends have married Germans, qualifying for German passports, there are parts of Berlin where she feels uncomfortable, even threatened, because of violent right-wing extremists who flourished in the early 1990's and attacked Turks and other immigrants.
"I'm at home here," she said, gesturing to a part of the Kreuzberg district that is overwhelmingly inhabited by Turks, "but there are parts of Berlin where I don't feel at home at all."

HEADLINE: Greenhouse Gas Issue: Haggling Over Fairness

SERIES: THE WARMING WORLD: Rich vs. Poor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Of all the many issues in the talks that begin here Monday on cutting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, none carries more considerations of ethics and morality than the question of how big a burden the third-world countries should bear -- and how soon they should take it up.
No issue is more likely to torpedo the chances of a successful agreement. Yet some experts see cause for hope that an accord between rich and poor might eventually be struck, if not here in Kyoto, then later. 
 The poorer nations have long occupied the moral high ground. They insist that since the rich countries got rich largely by burning the coal and oil that produce the heat-trapping carbon dioxide, and since they are still responsible for most emissions today, it is only right that the wealthy be the first to take legally binding steps to reduce them. They point out that third-world countries stand to be hurt worst by whatever climate changes result from the rich countries' emissions, and they argue that they are hard-pressed enough to assure a decent existence for hundreds of millions of their people.
President Clinton and the United States Senate, which will vote on any agreement, raise their own fairness issue. They insist that because warming of the atmosphere by greenhouse gases is a global concern, all countries must share in the solution. This is particularly so, they argue, since third-world countries' emissions are expected to surpass those of the rich countries in 20 or 30 years.
The United States insists it will sign no agreement unless all countries take part in a "meaningful" way. For the first time since the signing of a global climate treaty at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, legally binding limitations on greenhouse emissions will be under consideration here. The American stance has provoked counterarguments in the vein of a recent statement by Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, chairman of the developing-country caucus in the talks.
"Very many of us are struggling to attain a decent standard of living for our peoples," he said, "and yet we are constantly told that we must share in the effort to reduce emissions so that industrialized countries can continue to enjoy the benefits of their wasteful life style."
The issue is more complicated -- and possibly less intractable -- than it might seem on the surface. The arguments conceal factors believed by many, including Dr. Mwandosya, to contain elements of a constructive approach.
One good sign, the third-world countries say, is that they have already lessened the rates at which their emissions are increasing. A recent study by the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research organization, found that many key third-world countries, have cut or eliminated energy subsidies and as a result are emitting less carbon dioxide than they otherwise would have.
Cutting the subsidies has raised energy costs and thereby discouraged the burning of coal and oil. The pricing changes were undertaken for economic reasons, not environmental ones, the report said, but the effect on carbon emissions was the same.
"It appears," the study reported, "that developing countries are already doing a great deal to limit emissions -- a fact largely overlooked in the current debate."
 
Encouraging Signs In Third World
Dr. Mwandosya said in a recent interview that he believed the reported reductions would be evident when third-world countries make their first official emissions inventories, over the next two years, as required by the 1992 Rio treaty. While the treaty does not impose on the poorer countries any targets and timetables for emissions cuts, it does require them in general to rein in emissions.
The 1992 treaty required industrialized countries, on the other hand, to aim at a specific goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Most countries, including the United States, will fail to meet this voluntary target. Two and a half years ago, the conference of the parties to the treaty agreed in Berlin that the original goal was inadequate and began the long negotiating process that is to conclude in Kyoto.
The Berlin agreement specifically exempted third-world countries from having to do more more than what the treaty's general provisions specify. As a result, the poorer countries have resolutely refused to consider any new commitments in eight sessions of talks leading up to Kyoto. But the final round here will involve the full conference of the parties again, and the issue of new commitments for third-world countries could be taken up formally.
In addition to whatever progress the poorer countries have made in reducing emissions, there is another reason for encouragement, in Dr. Mwandosya's view. He cited the "natural phenomenon" by which third-world countries have historically followed the rich nations' lead in economic and technological development. A variety of existing technologies, many experts say, could reduce emissions either by burning fossil fuels more efficiently or by replacing fossil fuels with alternative energy sources like solar or wind power.
That is why, Dr. Mwandosya said, it was important "for the developed countries to create a momentum -- we normally follow the momentum." This could allow third-world countries to leapfrog the fossil-fuel stage of economic development by adopting more efficient energy technologies and alternatives to fossil fuels -- if the rich countries lead the way in applying them. On the whole, they have so far failed to do this.
There are some moves afoot to leapfrog fossil fuels. Often they are portrayed as "win-win" solutions in which the twin goals of economic development -- the poor nations' priority -- and cleaner energy can be furthered. Vast rural areas in the third world are without electricity, for instance, and providing it without resorting to fossil fuels is one way to serve both needs.
Hundreds of thousands of households in Africa and Indonesia are in fact being equipped with solar power in projects sponsored by the United Nations Development Program, the Global Environmental Facility and the World Bank. The trick in spreading alternative energy sources is to remove economic barriers to their adoption, said Anders Wijkman, a policy expert with the United Nations Development Program. Among the toughest barriers, he said, are remaining subsidies that keep oil and coal inexpensive and lack of access to financing for people who want to invest in alternatives like solar energy.
One reason poorer countries are so reluctant to take on specific reduction targets just now, said Dr. Mwandosya, is that they are unsure that they could meet them, given a scarcity of the money and technology necessary to do so, although the 1992 Rio treaty provides for the transfer of both.
A number of "joint implementation" projects have been tried on a pilot basis: a business or government in a rich country finances or provides the technology for a specific emissions reduction project in a third-world country. The idea is that reductions can be made more inexpensively in a poor country than in a rich one. It makes no difference to the atmosphere, since greenhouse gases mix globally. Eventually, if parties to the 1992 treaty so decide, the rich countries would get credit for emissions reductions even though they take place somewhere else.
 
Fears That Some Would Reap Advantage
Full-scale joint implementation for credit could be one element of a Kyoto agreement on the third-world countries' role. But fearing that rich countries would use the plan as an excuse for doing nothing to reduce their own emissions, many poor nations have been skeptical.
The issue is complicated by the fact that third-world countries are in varying stages of development. They range from the poorest of the poor to countries on the verge of breaking into the predominantly industrialized world, like China, India, South Korea and Mexico, with many degrees and combinations of circumstances in between. And many of the countries, in all stages of development, are much more urgently concerned with growing and festering air and water pollution, locally and regionally, than with the seemingly more remote problem of global climate change.
American businesses that depend heavily on energy use say that third-world countries, particularly the better-off ones, would reap a competitive advantage in the world economy if they were absolved from mandatory emissions cuts and American businesses were not. Some labor unions fear that that would force companies to shift more operations overseas at the cost of jobs in the United States.
Industry-backed studies support that view. But a recent study by the World Resources Institute found that even in energy-intensive industries, energy costs are just one factor -- and one too small to make much difference -- among many that are considered when when decisions are made on where to produce goods. Moreover, the study found, rising energy prices in third-world countries are narrowing and perhaps eliminating whatever cost advantage those countries may have. It concluded that "differentiated commitments for developed and developing countries can work without compromising U.S. economic competitiveness."
 
Wealthy Countries To Lead the Way
The idea of tailoring reductions targets to individual countries' economic and social profiles, rather than a one-size-fits-all commitment, has gained some currency in the talks. But the third-world countries show no signs of backing off on their insistence that the rich nations show the way by undertaking specific commitments first. They have, in fact, laid on the table the most stringent proposal of all for industrialized countries: a 35-percent emissions reduction by 2020.
The size and timing of cuts by industrialized nations is at the heart of the Kyoto talks. But "if we get that first round of commitments in Kyoto, I think we will be able to get the developing countries on board fairly soon after," said Dr. Kilaparti Ramakrishna of the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., who is an expert on international environmental law and has closely followed the talks. But he said the developing world is unlikely to follow until the rich countries have demonstrated that their cuts are actually being carried out.
No one expects that the third-world countries should undertake the same reductions commitments as the rich ones initially, but what would satisfy the United States Senate is unclear. Ninety five Senators signed a resolution last summer saying, among other things, that the United States should not sign any agreement unless it "mandates new specific scheduled commitments" by third-world countries to reduce emissions.
The fact that time is short and the developing-country issue has not been formally dealt with until now may sharply limit what is possible in Kyoto. It may be, as a senior State Department official said recently, that only part of the problem can be solved now, with negotiations continuing beyond Kyoto.
This article is one of a series that have appeared since Aug. 12 on the science, politics and economics of climate change with the approach of an international meeting in Kyoto, Japan, beginning tomorrow, to discuss limits on greenhouse gases.

HEADLINE: Where Water Is Power, the Balance Shifts

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: PYRAMID LAKE, Nev., Nov. 26

 BODY:
Over the last century, the American West was remade with exclamation points. Free Land! Unlimited Water! No Chance of Failure! So went the trumpeting in the dust as the Federal Government tried to build an oasis civilization in the driest part of the United States.
Now, a major corrective is under way as the Government tries to undo some of what billions of tax dollars have done. More than ever, water still shapes destiny, but it is changing hands now, without bands blaring, cameras rolling or fliers promising riches. 
 And the exchange in power is no less dramatic. From the Colorado River to California's Central Valley, water from the subsidized farms and playgrounds created by Government irrigation is being diverted to nearly extinct fish and wildlife, long-forgotten Indian tribes and cities that barely existed when the big dams and canals were built.
Perhaps the most significant of the efforts to alter the balance of power in the arid lands is taking place here on the Truckee River in northern Nevada, site of the nation's first major Federal irrigation project, and one of the most fought-over streams in the country.
Flowing out of Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada border, the Truckee runs down the east slope of the mountains, trickles through fast-growing Reno, is diverted to farmers in the desert and ends its 105-mile ride at Pyramid Lake, where Paiute Indians have lived for at least a thousand years.
Until recently, most of the river's water was siphoned off to alfalfa farms and cattle ranches created by Government enticement 80 years ago in the middle of the high desert east of Reno. Now, the Government is buying back much of that water and giving it to the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indians, to projects to restore fish runs and once-bounteous wetlands, and to new communities in Nevada, the fastest-growing state in the nation.
The farmers feel betrayed, comparing the Government to the mob. Indians say they are getting some measure of repayment for lost water that caused the biggest natural lake in Nevada to fall by 80 feet, killed off a species of cutthroat trout and drained one of the nation's first wildlife refuges. And the city of Reno, given a guarantee of future water as long as it learns to conserve and clean the water it uses, is no longer talking about withering up.
As contentious as this replumbing has been, many of the people who control water policy say the Truckee plan is a model for the reordering of river systems now taking place from the Florida Everglades to the Platte River in the Plains to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. The driving idea is that natural systems, whether they be wetlands or salmon-spawning channels, deserve as much water as agricultural lands.
"The Truckee River is the most litigated river in the history of the United States, and if we can pull off this huge change in who gets the water, it shows that any place can do it," said Steve Bradhurst, president of the Truckee River Partnership, a group made of business, environmental and government representatives that is helping to guide the new water allocation policy here.
Many of the changes were started in the Bush Administration, but are being enacted, with buyouts, closing of dams and river restoration, during the Clinton Presidency. And just as it was when the Federal Government set out to dam, divert or straighten the major rivers of the West at the start of the century, there are clear winners and losers.
"I'm the first one to say that the Indians got the short end of the stick years ago," said Ted deBraga, a third-generation farmer near Fallon, about 50 miles east of Reno. "But now they're trying to do the same thing to us."
Mr. deBraga waved around a flier from 1914, when water was first being diverted from the Truckee to the flat land in the desert of northern Nevada. "The land is free," the flier from the United States Reclamation Service says. Water rights can be purchased through no-interest loans and are "permanent and assured."
Pyramid Lake and its cutthroat trout, the Indians and Reno, the little mining town that grew into a casino-cluttered city on the Truckee, were not even considered in the original diversion.
Pyramid Lake, though nearly as big as Tahoe, existed "only to satisfy the thirsting sun," said Senator Francis Newlands, the Nevada legislator who fashioned the 1902 law that transformed the arid West, beginning with the Truckee project.
The project, named in honor of the Senator, diverted the Truckee from a dam through 32 miles of desert to a reservoir and then through 500 miles of canals to serve a small group of ranchers. It was the forerunner of the Hoover, Grand Coulee and Glen Canyon dams -- some of the biggest public works projects ever built.
The Truckee diversion was an effort to create a garden West in places overrun by rattlesnakes and sage. It has never worked out as envisioned. The Newlands water was supposed to create 300,000 acres of farmland; today, there are barely 60,000. Similar predictions never panned out for the Columbia River or Colorado projects.
The cost to the environment was the loss of epic salmon runs on the Columbia, an altered shoreline through the Grand Canyon, the submerging of Glen Canyon and the extinction of the biggest of all American cutthroat trout -- some weighed as much as 42 pounds -- here in Nevada. The Truckee essentially died, becoming an open sewer, and a bare trickle during drought years.
But recreational communities, ranchers, and subdivisions built around desert golf courses did follow the irrigated water here, as elsewhere in the West. And they are loath to give it up. "What did the taxpayers get for all this? They got economic development and growth," said Lyman McConnell, executive director of the irrigation district fed by water from the Newlands project.
The 4,000 farmers in the Newlands project used to get more than half of all the Truckee River water as it entered Nevada. Now, they are down to about a fifth of the allocation -- still more than Reno-Sparks metro area, a community of more than 200,000 people, receives.
A similar reordering is under way in California. This year, about 800,000 acre-feet of water, well more than an entire year's runoff of the Truckee River near Reno, is being transferred from the big farms of California's Central Valley to help depleted fish runs in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. That amounts to 10 percent of the water in a system of 20 reservoirs and 500 miles that irrigates 3 million acres of farmland.
A plan started by Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and supported by all the big water users except the farmers, will likely further reshape water use here well into the next century. It requires the Federal Government, the governments of California and Nevada, the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indian Tribe and the Sierra Pacific Power Company, which provides Reno's water, to sign on to a permanent design for Truckee River water allocation.
The biggest losers will be the biggest water users -- the irrigated farms in the desert.
"Was it all a mistake? Is that what the Government is saying now?" Mr. deBraga said. "If it was, it's one the Federal Government made, not the farmers. This stuff is going on all over the West right now. And if we fall, everyone else will fall."
About 45 miles from the irrigated desert farmland, on the Paiute Indian Reservation, the tribe that was nearly wiped out by the diversions of the earlier part of the century has rebounded somewhat. There are new fish hatcheries for the cui-ui, a Pleistocene-era fish that was the foundation of the Paiute diet, and for a different strain of Lahontan cutthroat that has been reintroduced into the lake.
The lake level has come up, and recreation and fishing have brought jobs to the 2,000 or so members of the Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe. But a marsh that was full of birds and fish, called Winnemucca Lake, has disappeared because of the decades of lost water. It is a bare white alkaline flat, and dust swirls at its edges.
Many Indians are still angry over the original diversions. They want all the Truckee River water that is being shipped to the ranchers put back in the river, as a clean source of water for the fish.
"We know that the white man is not going to go away and Winnemucca Lake is not going to come back," said Mervin Wright Jr., chairman of the tribe. "But we hope that once we sign on the dotted line sometime next year, there will be a permanent change for the better, and that all of our new friends will not then desert us."
The tribe, originally castigated by the city of Reno and the power company, has become an ally of those interests, and of environmentalists. All of them share the goal of trying to get back the Truckee's water from the irrigated farms. And the best legal leverage for that has been the long-ignored Indian water rights and stream requirements for bringing back endangered fish.
"For about 100 years it was everybody against the Indians," said Bob Pelcyger, the lawyer for Paiute water rights. "In a very short period of time, that's turned around. Now, it's everybody against the Newlands project."
On the land that turned green with diverted water, near the town of Fallon, the ranchers and new suburban home owners whose wells draw some of their water from Truckee River canal spills, many people still refuse to believe that they will no longer get the lion's share of the water.
"The Government is acting like the Mafia," said Mr. McConnell of the irrigation district. "A guy comes around and says 'Do you want to buy fire insurance?' You say no. Then they start a fire next door, and force you to buy fire insurance. That's how the Mafia works, but it might as well be the Government here in Nevada."
"This is all about power," said Mr. McConnell, who says the Newlands farmers are going to continue fighting to hold onto the water that was diverted to them more than 80 years ago. What the ranchers see as betrayal, however, the Indians see as justice and the city dwellers in Reno see as common sense. Asked about comments by the farmers that their interests were being sold out to satisfy a new water world, Mr. Wright, the Paiute tribal chairman, said, "What goes around, comes around."

HEADLINE: Money Store Makes Investment in Politics

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
To many Republicans and Democrats in Washington, the Money Store could not have a better name.
In the last 15 years, it has been not only the nation's largest lender of loans backed by the Small Business Administration but one of the biggest campaign donors in the industry. The company and its executives have contributed and raised more than $400,000 for Republicans and Democrats over the last two years. 
 In the same period, the Money Store Investment Corporation has persuaded lawmakers and Administration officials to block a regulation that senior career officials at the Small Business Administration say would reduce the likelihood of a huge taxpayer bailout, should the economy turn, and with it the Money Store's fortunes.
The regulation, proposed nearly two years ago and still pending, would require the Money Store to increase certain reserves, which would take a deep bite out of the company's rapidly growing profits. Its implementation has been repeatedly delayed by leaders of the Small Business Administration appointed by the White House.
Officials at the Small Business Administration have promised to put out a final regulation soon. But top career officials say they have become concerned that the politically appointed officials have yielded to the Money Store in a way that could lead to significant losses for taxpayers. In recent days, the career officials have threatened to take the highly unusual step of withholding their signatures from any final rule.
It is common in Washington for companies to use money and lobbying to try to influence regulators, lawmakers and the White House. Nonetheless, the case of the Money Store and its role as the most important company in the politically popular small-business lending program stands out on several fronts.
The company has run political circles around its competitors, some of whom claim to have been treated less favorably by regulators. The main industry group, of which the Money Store is an important member, has lobbied unsuccessfully in favor of the new rule. The group, the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, fears that the lack of proper safeguards could jeopardize the future of the Government-sponsored program.
"It is a classic example of the intersection of money, politics and regulation," said Martin D. Teckler, a former official at the Small Business Administration who helped draft the proposed regulation. "The Money Store has used money and it has used lobbyists. It's not untoward or improper. It's the process and the way the system works."
David Bunden, an executive at the Small Business Funding Corporation, a company that helps lenders sell loans to investors and financial institutions, said the Money Store's unique position as the biggest player at the Small Business Administration "gets them access and influence, but not undeservedly so."
The sale of loans has become a vital component of the Money Store's phenomenal growth. The company has burnished its image as a lender of last resort to homeowners and small businesses with poor credit records by using popular advertising pitches that feature the baseball greats Phil Rizzuto and Jim Palmer. It has more than 220 offices around the nation and in Puerto Rico. Since 1993, its revenues have more than tripled, to $778 million last year from $219 million in 1993, and it expects to issue about $7.5 billion in commercial, homeowner, student and auto loans this year.
 
'We Don't Expect A Quid Pro Quo'
Executives of the Money Store said their political activity was no different from that of any other big company with important issues pending in Washington.
"We give fairly, equitably," said Marc Turtletaub, the company's president and chief executive. "We don't expect a quid pro quo for donations. But by the same token, any business the size of ours in America has to be aware of the fact that legislation plays a large role in their business. We don't expect preferential treatment. The most we expect is to get access to make our case. All we want is an opportunity to make our case. Folks are constantly calling us for our contributions."
Mr. Turtletaub and other executives say the proposed regulation is unnecessary because the company already has sufficient safeguards to protect taxpayers in the event of a downturn in the economy.
But some lawmakers and Money Store competitors disagree. They say that the company has used contributions and lobbyists who are former regulators and Congressional aides to block a regulation that is an important safeguard for taxpayers.
"We've all gone through the savings and loan problem, which no one has any interest in repeating," said Senator Christopher S. (Kit) Bond, Republican of Missouri, the head of the Senate Small Business Committee. He said the Money Store had put pressure on lawmakers for looser regulations that could "put the credit of the Government at greater risk."
At issue is a proposed regulation requiring the Money Store to hold back greater reserves than it already does when it sells portions of the Government-guaranteed loans. The sale of those loans is vital for the company to replenish its capital and necessary for its continued growth. The company has already sold more than $759 million in small-business loans in the last five years. And executives have told some regulators that the proposed rule could shave millions off its quarterly profits.
Mr. Turtletaub said that those securitizations had "performed beautifully" and that the imposition of new rules requiring that the company hold greater reserves was "senseless."
But since the end of 1995, career regulators at the Small Business Administration have sought the rule to increase the reserves to 5 percent so that the Money Store would have a greater interest in the loans it sells. The fear, they say, is that the company will issue riskier loans if it has too small an interest in them after they are sold.

'The Money Store Rule' Shows Company's Clout
 Because it is not a bank, the Money Store does not have the traditional capital base of deposits, and because it does not have the resources of other large nonbank lenders, it has had to rely more heavily on repackaging its loans as securities and selling them in the secondary market to refinance new loans.
Its securitization program began in 1992 after the Small Business Administration approved a new rule that allowed only companies other than banks to pool their loans into securities and then sell them. The new regulation, passed after considerable internal debate about whether it was in the best interests of taxpayers, became known in the agency as "The Money Store Rule," and it solidified the image of the company as a powerful player at the agency.
Other incidents later dramatized how important the company had become to the agency's small-business lending program. When, for instance, the company proposed a sale of $100 million in loans in March 1996, on very short notice, regulators responded that they needed more than just a few days to review the offering. So one of the Money Store's lobbyists pressed the regulators to have the offering papers shipped to an agency lawyer on vacation, where he reviewed them in time for the company to complete the sale before the end of its fiscal quarter.
The offering was made soon after career regulators proposed a new rule that would require the Money Store to put 5 percent of any loans resold into a reserve fund. In its offerings, the company has put considerably less in reserve.
Money Store executives were told about the proposed change in December 1995 or early January 1996, and they immediately undertook an effort to have it blocked. About the same time that they learned about the rule, Mr. Turtletaub was invited to join President Clinton at a Democratic Party coffee at the White House. Mr. Turtletaub said that he did not bring up the 5 percent rule there, but that a few weeks after his White House visit, he raised it with Philip Lader, who was then the top administrator of the Small Business Administration.
At the meeting, Mr. Turtletaub asked that the rule not be considered, people who were present say. He said that the regulation was counterproductive and that the marketplace and credit rating agencies were in a better position than the regulators to assess the risk of the loans, people who were at the meeting say. Mr. Turtletaub and officials of the Small Business Administration said the meeting was not improper.
On March 14, soon after the meeting, the Money Store contributed $50,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Later that month, the regulators approved a $100 million securitization that did not have a 5 percent reserve.
 
A Powerful Lineup Sides With the Store
As debate continued over the rule, the Money Store lobbied heavily against it. It enlisted support from important lawmakers like Representative James A. Talent, the Missouri Republican who now leads the House Small Business Committee; Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey. All have received donations from the company or its top executives.
An aide to a prominent Republican lawmaker, who insisted on not being identified, recalled how the Money Store operated. When Mr. Turtletaub sought to discuss the matter with the lawmaker, he got the National Republican Senate Committee, the beneficiary of big contributions from the company, to try to broker a meeting. The effort led to a meeting between the aide and Mr. Turtletaub.
The industry's main trade group, the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, says that it has sought the 5 percent rule out of concern that its absence could lead to greater losses in the program. The program's annual appropriations are tied by a formula to the amount of losses it incurs.
"Our position has been that this is a way to protect the safety, soundness and integrity of the program," said Anthony R. Wilkinson, president of the group.
But the Money Store has so far prevailed. The agency repeatedly delayed promulgating the rule that had been sought by the career regulators. Congress finally entered the fray last fall, when it ordered the agency to issue a final rule by March 31, 1997, that treated all lenders -- banks and other institutions -- uniformly.
Earlier this year, the agency's leadership changed hands, and the new administrator, Aida Alvarez, overruled the career regulators and decided not to implement a final rule. Instead, in April she issued what she called an "interim final regulation."
Ms. Alvarez, a former reporter at The New York Post and aide to the Clinton campaign five years ago, declined requests to discuss the matter. Her aides say she has postponed issuing the final rule so that she can further study the issue. The interim measure she approved permitted all sales of loans with a 5 percent reserve, and it also gives the agency the discretion to approve other sales with smaller reserves.
Since the interim measure was issued, the agency has approved several loan sales, but on different terms. A sale by Sierrawest Bank, for $51 million, was approved in June, and included the 5 percent reserve after bank executives say they were told by the Small Business Administration that the reserve was required. The Money Store's offering, for $140 million on Sept. 29, did not have the 5 percent requirement.
In a letter sent in October to Ms. Alvarez, Sierrawest's chief financial officer, David Broadley, said that the agency's approval of the Money Store's sale seems "to be inconsistent" with the agency's interim rule.
The ranking political appointees at the Small Business Administration say they believe there has been no unfair treatment of Money Store competitors.
Career regulators who worked on the 5 percent reserve rule see the matter differently.
"The total career staff was in favor of the 5 percent rule -- right up the line," said an official who spoke on the condition of not being identified. "There is no good rationale of why it went the way it did, and those who worked on it believe it was politically fixed."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Even as Economy Booms, Working Poor Just Scrape By

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
Wall Street is a money machine, the six-digit bonus is back and excess has become the ethos of New York City in the late 1990's. The bonanza can be measured by the density of smoke at downtown cigar bars and the thickness of sirloin served uptown. It is echoed in the buzz of construction and the clatter of tourists transforming Times Square.
But so far, the boom has meant nothing to Clara and Virgilio Quizpe, Peruvian immigrants who, along with their three children, scrape by on the $200 Mr. Quizpe takes home each week from his job installing parquet floors. 
 The soaring Dow has figured little in the calculus that governs the family's survival. Rent for their one-bedroom apartment in Flushing, Queens, is $675 a month; utilities run about $60. That leaves them less than $150 a month for food, medicine and other essentials. To get by, Mrs. Quizpe (pronounced KEES-pay) makes frequent visits to a food pantry. The children wear hand-me-downs donated by friends.
Mrs. Quizpe, 29, was a part-time cleaner at a Manhattan department store until two years ago, when the cleaning company that employed her learned she was pregnant and dismissed her, she said. Then, last winter, after working outdoors at a car wash, Mr. Quizpe, 28, came down with tuberculosis. He spent seven jobless months on his back.
Their savings quickly exhausted, the family fell behind on their bills; eviction notices arrived, and Con Edison threatened to turn off the lights. But their frightening slide toward homelessness was braked last month by Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, which paid a month's rent and utility bills.
The money that kept the Quizpes in their home came from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which begins its 86th annual appeal today. Last year, readers of The New York Times sent the fund nearly $5 million, much of it spent helping people like the Quizpes make it through unexpected crises like a fire, the death of a breadwinner or a catastrophic illness that can rapidly deplete the resources of working families.
In many ways, the needs of New York's working poor are more acute this year than in the recent past. Rents are skyrocketing and the cost of city living continues to climb, but wages for unskilled labor have hardly budged.
Compounding the struggle are recent changes in the welfare laws that deny many legal immigrants the benefits that once made it possible to get by on low-paying jobs.
"These people were just surviving before; now they're really in dire straits," said Steven Cohen, a professor of public policy at Columbia University.
Although the city's unemployment rate has recently dipped -- to 9.1 percent in October from 10 percent in June -- it remains among the highest in the nation.
The otherwise robust economy has helped create the illusion that everyone is prospering, say those who run some of the city's largest social service organizations.
"All the good news lulls people into thinking that the have-nots have plenty," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven agencies that receive support from the Neediest Cases fund. "But no matter how good things get, there will always be abandoned children who need homes and people who are too sick or too old to support themselves."
With government helping less, charitable groups are being called upon to do more, he said, "and donations are just not keeping up with the need."
For instance, Mr. Coltoff said there are now 1,000 children waiting for the society's handful of available day care and Head Start slots.
While Americans increased their charitable giving by 9 percent last year to $10.7 billion, contributions to social service organizations fell 5 percent, said Ann E. Kaplan, research director of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. For the most part, she said, deep-pocket donors favor capital projects, like a new college library, a hospital wing "or something that gives them recognition."
"In many ways, giving money for basic human needs is an act of faith, because you never get to see the results," she said. "You have to derive satisfaction in knowing you've helped the lives of your neighbors."
When Adolph S. Ochs, who bought The Times in 1896, met a penniless immigrant on Christmas Day in 1911, he had a similar thought. After learning that the man had nowhere to sleep, Mr. Ochs gave him a few dollars and offered him a job at the newspaper.
The publisher decided that most New Yorkers would be similarly inspired to help others if they knew about the obstacles their neighbors faced. The next year he sent a reporter to orphanages and poorhouses to find the 100 neediest cases and write articles about them during the holiday season.
That first campaign drew more than $3,600 from 117 contributors. Last year, nearly 13,000 readers donated $4,921,908.79 to the fund. Because The Times pays all administrative expenses for the fund, every dollar reaches those in need.
Most of the money goes to families and individuals who need a small push, an emergency grant to help them avert disaster.
"If we didn't get assistance, we would be spending Christmas as paupers on the street," said Mrs. Quizpe, a small, jolly woman whose 10-year-old son, Juan-Miguel, is already taller than she is.
For now, she says it makes more sense to stay home with Juan-Miguel and her year-old twins than to go back to work. Day care at a neighbor's apartment, she said, would cost $180 a week for the twins; working as a housekeeper or baby sitter might earn her, at best, $225 a week.
Although she still owes her landlord back rent, Mrs. Quizpe is remarkably optimistic. Perhaps it is because life in New York is far better than it was in Peru, where she lived until five years ago, working as a home health care attendant. The family enjoyed a middle-class existence in Lima -- in a spacious house with pet monkeys, parrots and a dog -- but Mrs. Quizpe said she fled the country after witnessing a politically motivated killing by left-wing guerrillas.
Her brother and an aunt had already died in terrorist attacks, she said, and she was tired of living in fear. "I never knew whether the next knock on the door would be a bullet for me," she said. She applied for political asylum in the United States, and her case is still being considered by immigration officials.
Two years ago, her husband and Juan-Miguel received permission to join her in New York. Last week, the family sat in their neatly kept living room as a caged cockatiel named Pepe squawked in the corner. Mr. Quizpe, who recently returned to his job and works six, sometimes seven, days a week, rarely gets to see his children.
Neither parent speaks English, so they depend on Juan-Miguel for translation. "It's frustrating that we can't help our son with his homework," said Mr. Quizpe.
Their apartment has gleaming parquet floors that Mr. Quizpe installed himself. But the building superintendent has not repaired crumbling, water-damaged walls, and Mrs. Quizpe worries that her infants will eat the flakes of peeling paint. Hanging over the children's bunk bed are a mirror etched with the financial-district skyline and an oversize replica of a $10,000 bill with the family's photo in the center.
Mrs. Quizpe says her husband is often depressed about their finances.
"Not me," she said with a shrug and a smile. "I know things could always be worse."

HEADLINE: Jack Berry, Florida Citrus Baron, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Jack M. Berry, a Tennessee-born New York businessman who made a fortune in Florida orange groves, died on Nov. 21 at a hospital near his home in Winter Haven, Fla. He was 81 and the last of the Florida citrus barons who transformed the industry in the 1960's.
The death certificate listed the cause as heart failure during routine treatment for bleeding ulcers, but his family, citing his doctor's informal opinion, said he died of grief, six weeks after the death of his high school sweetheart, the former Ruth Norman, to whom he had been married for 60 years. 
 Born into a farming family in Bolton, Tenn., about 25 miles northeast of Memphis, Mr. Berry, whose father died when he was 14, grew up poor but with a certain amount of foresight and just enough luck to give him a Depression-era start.
When he graduated from a Memphis High School in 1934, college was not an option, but a job was waiting for him in New York City, thanks to the high-spirited ways of his oldest brother, Charles.
Charles, 16 years Jack's senior, had come of age in more comfortable times, attended the University of Florida, married into a citrus family and moved to New York to peddle his in-law's produce to local grocery stores and supermarkets.
According to family legend, Charles was a playboy who needed somebody to do the work and found his little brother well suited for the task.
While his older brother concentrated on New York night life, Mr. Berry worked hard and saved his money, enough to buy the business after Charles died of a heart attack in 1942.
Within a few years, Mr. Berry realized that the rise of supermarket chains was dooming the citrus brokerage business just as the development of frozen concentrates was creating opportunities for Florida growers. With the chains increasingly bypassing brokers to deal directly with Florida packers -- and squeezing out the mom-and-pop stores that had been the bread and butter of his business -- Mr. Berry began scouting central Florida for orange groves. By the time he moved to Winter Haven in 1950, Mr. Berry already owned one grove, and he soon had others.
As the rise of concentrates, which now consume more than 90 percent of Florida's harvests, vastly increased demand for oranges, Mr. Berry prospered.
Then, in 1962, a killer freeze wiped out half the Florida citrus crop and gave Mr. Berry one more opportunity.
It had long been axiomatic among the growers on the high ground of central Florida, known as the ridge, that orange trees, which need dry soil, could not be grown in the poorly drained lowlands of southern Florida.
Mr. Berry knew that as well as anybody, but he also figured that by digging irrigation ditches to create elevated beds, even the unforgiving land of southern Florida could be made safe for orange trees.
The way his family tells it, Mr. Berry and two friends, Winston Lawless and Bob Paul, got to drinking whisky one night and by the time they had finished they had agreed to buy 18,000 acres of scrub land near La Belle, 100 miles south of Winter Haven.
The men then drew straws to divide the land, and Mr. Berry got what seemed to be the least promising parcel.
Maybe it was, but his friends planted only small portions of their parcels, and Mr. Berry, with the backing of the Prudential Insurance company, prepared and planted his full 6,000 acres, even digging an irrigation canal to the nearby Caloosahatchee River.
When his trees thrived, the growers of central Florida took grudging note. But it was not until 1982, when another freeze devastated crops in central Florida but left the Berry harvest untouched, that his pioneering created a stampede.
Since then, more than 100,000 acres of southwestern Florida have been converted to citrus crops.
The spike in prices created by the 1982 freeze was the beginning of the big money days for Mr. Berry. He paid $25 million in cash that year for 16,000 acres in Sarasota County, bringing his total citrus holdings to more than 45 square miles, and giving him yet another economic opportunity. When the man who sold him the Sarasota property offered him an Indiana plastics factory, Mr. Berry bought that, too, selling it years later for a large profit.
Mr. Berry enjoyed his wealth but not its notoriety. When Forbes magazine's 1993 list of the 400 richest Americans estimated his net worth at $280 million, he was so disturbed by the publicity that he divided his holdings among his children so he would not make the list again.
He is survived by a son, Jack Jr. of Winter Haven; two daughters, Holly Richert of Winter Haven and Ruth Ellen Weems of Venice; eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Feeling of Change in Newburgh;
In an Old River Town, a Sense of How Bright the New Might Be

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
In July of last year, Gerardo Sanchez was sitting in his bedroom in New York City sipping a Cuban espresso and watching the History Channel. A documentary was being shown about the 11 most endangered historic sites in the country, and it featured the 455-acre East End of this tired, old Hudson River city.
Mr. Sanchez, who played a role in the Art Deco revival of the South Beach district in Miami in the 1980's, sat up and shouted "Bingo!" "We were looking for a city that would entertain our program of exterior restoration," said the Cuban-born Mr. Sanchez. "Let's pray the city administration is open to our ideas." 
 Other developers, most of them from the Hudson Valley, followed.
Now in this long depressed city, with its boarded-up row houses, high unemployment and booming crack trade, one can almost smell new hope wafting off the river that many say holds the key to its future. There are plans to build a center dedicated to the study of the ecology and habitat of the Hudson River. Developers are restoring its 18th- and 19th-century housing and constructing new buildings. Trendy restaurants are opening. The county repaved Broadway, the main thoroughfare, which used to resemble the pockmarked surface of the moon. The armory, once a rotting hulk, has been restored and will house Orange County offices, which are now in the village of Goshen.
"This is the first tangible hope Newburgh has had in 35 years," said the City Manager, Harold Porr 3d. "There's a general lifting of the communal spirit."
But this town of about 25,000 residents, 60 miles north of Manhattan in Orange County, could face a tough road. Indeed, it has tried and failed to resuscitate itself in the past. But this time, boosters say, things are different. "We're not looking to just bring in yuppies," said Jim DeLaune, the city's economic development director. "This involves serious investment by serious developers."
Cities and towns up and down the Hudson are realizing they can build a new economy around tourism and recreation. In nearby Kingston, restaurants, antiques shops, museums and marinas line the waterfront. A cruise line ferries passengers up and down the river. In Beacon, which is just across the river from Newburgh, not only is there interest in rebuilding a railroad that once scaled Mount Beacon, but also a new ferry pier is planned.
Mr. Sanchez's partner, Vincent Trunzo, predicts that Newburgh's revival will be based on tourism, too. He sees it as the new South Beach, but with a river instead of a shore. "The same magic that we performed in South Beach is going to happen in Newburgh," he said.
Mr. Sanchez, an effusive, confident man, believes the transformation will happen sooner rather than later. "This year, there will be a boom, next year a boom and then a blast," he said. "Newburgh is going to be it."
The city welcomed the men. Their company, Polonia, acquired 11 buildings, 7 of them from the city in exchange for restoring the exterior of City Hall, which was a crumbling wreck. They have restored two buildings so far. In another, which they bought from private owners, they plan to open what they believe will be the world's largest magazine store, and in an old foundry they plan to build a hotel, apartments and commercial space. They expect to spend $5 million.
Another developer, Vinny Clavio, a restaurateur, plans to open a $4 million riverfront complex with a gym, marina, a small restaurant and shops. "If Newburgh doesn't make a comeback then I'm broke for life," he said, peering through the wall of windows of his rambling riverfront restaurant and admiring the glittering Hudson and Mount Beacon."Look at all this natural beauty," he said.
Newburgh, named an All American City by Look magazine in 1952, has definitely seen better days. During the Revolutionary War, the city was the site of George Washington's headquarters for more than a year. A museum and a park mark the site. Until the 1960's, when some say urban renewal started the decline of Newburgh, the city was the economic and social hub of Orange County. A ferry service from Beacon used to carry shoppers to and from the city. Later the growth of malls in the suburbs and the closing of factories meant harder times.
But there have been efforts to bounce back before. In the middle to late 80's, middle-class home buyers moved into the East End of the city, a poor neighborhood. Developers came, too, taking government money and making promises, but many abandoned their projects when they got bogged down in government bureaucracy or other problems.
One skeptic, a retired man who refused to give his name, recalled that five years ago a developer rehabilitated half the row houses on his block. Several did not sell and were rented to welfare recipients. "Now my block is ruined and my house is worth half of its value," he said. But Christine Woroschinski, who opened a bakery on a mostly restored block of Liberty Street more than two years ago, is more optimistic. "I like Newburgh for what it used to be, but unfortunately it's not what it used to be," she said. "Hopefully, we'll turn it around."
The city got a boost in December 1994 when it was named a Federal enterprise zone. That made Federal money available for the restoration of housing and for the development of the work force, small business and tourism.
"I've told many people we're going to put the new back in Newburgh," said Mayor Audrey Carey, the first female African-American mayor in the state. "People seem to have hope where there was none."
Although Newburgh still has a serious crack problem, crime is down 18 percent. The police are following the example of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and cracking down on quality-of-life crimes like street gambling, loud music and public drinking, an approach that Police Chief William Bloom says cuts down on more serious crimes.
What sets Newburgh's revitalization apart is that a good deal of the restoration of old houses is being done for working poor people with the aid of government subsidies. According to Federal census data for 1996, 41.8 percent of the city's households earn less than $20,000. Sixty-five percent of its 26,454 people are black and Hispanic. Whites, most of them working class, predominate in the West End of town where they live in worn single-family homes with modest yards. There are a few leafy, middle-class blocks in the East End.
Drew Kartiganer, an architect and developer based in Newburgh, has rehabilitated 19 apartments in row houses and is renovating 20 more for low-income tenants. He is also building 12 three-bedroom houses with unobstructed river views that are expected to sell for $130,000 to $140,000.
"Newburgh is going to come back stronger than anybody knows or expects," he said. Mr. Kartiganer recalled that the first row house that he renovated had been a crack house. "A lady in the building asked me, 'Why do you want to touch this building? It's a crack building,' " he recalled. "It was exactly the building that I wanted to touch because that corner no longer has a crack problem. We need to take the worst buildings in the worst areas."
That is exactly what Arnold Moss, a developer with homes in New York City and Garrison, N.Y., is doing. He acquired 33 buildings from the city that were in foreclosure in an East End neighborhood with a busy crack trade. It is widely considered the worst in the city. Mr. Moss is turning those buildings into 64 units for the working poor. Twenty percent of the financing comes from state and Federal subsidies.
"There's so much drug activity in the city because there's so much abandoned housing," Mr. Moss said. "But there won't be so much when we get finished with it. The city has a long way to go but I think there's a lot of positive things starting to happen." The recent opening of Rocky's Broadway Cafe, a two-tier piano and cigar bar decorated in mahogany and copper, has been cited as another sign of the city's turnaround.
John Panzella, the owner, said he started a business because City Hall, just across the street, got a face-lift and the armory was restored. "I said if Newburgh is good enough for them, then it's good enough for me."
One local developer, Walt Lambert, is renovating the old American Legion building into an office building, and the space is already leased.
Mr. Lambert says he looks around Newburgh, past the boarded-up buildings, vacant stores and drug traffic, and sees a new Newburgh -- or rather the thriving Newburgh of old.
"I know what it was once," he said. "And I know what it can be again."

HEADLINE: Coleman A. Young, 79, Mayor of Detroit And Political Symbol for Blacks, Is Dead

 BODY:
Coleman A. Young, the combative, tart-tongued former union organizer who became the first black Mayor of Detroit when he was elected in 1973 and then went on to run the city for a record 20 years, died yesterday at Sinai Hospital in Detroit. He was 79.
The cause of death was respiratory failure, officials said. 
 A popular and streetwise politician, Mr. Young became a hero to black voters who saw his victory as a sign of their growing power in local government, especially in cities in need of healing after race riots in the previous decade. His election came as a growing list of black mayors in Northern cities were elected by black voters long frustrated with white-dominated administrations.
But like the other black mayors, Mr. Young also presided over a city that more than once came close to bankruptcy. Detroit had already been reeling from high unemployment in the automobile industry, a high crime rate and deteriorating housing when he was elected.
Afterward, the Motor City lost even more of its factories, stores and jobs as well as thousands of its middle-class residents, particularly whites who had been moving to the suburbs in great numbers since Detroit's 1967 race riots. Mr. Young, in his autobiography, "Hard Stuff" (Viking Penguin, 1994), noted that 1.6 million whites lived in Detroit at the end of World War II and that only 200,000 were left by 1990.
"I don't dispute the gravity of Detroit's problems," he wrote. "They are basically the same problems that beset every American city, except that they are magnified by the fact that modern Detroit was built around the auto industry, which has been losing blood for two decades, and the accompanying reality that white flight, industrial and social, has left Detroit with the damnedest demographics in America."
Mr. Young, inaugurated in January 1974, decided that the city could not survive without cooperation among business, labor and the state and Federal governments. So he called together some of Detroit's leading business and labor figures and persuaded them to approve his plan for reshaping the riverfront. With their help, the Renaissance Center office-retail complex became the showpiece of downtown, and the adjacent Hart Plaza, a riverfront park, became the area's anchor.
The center, built for $350 million by a consortium of of more than 50 corporate investors led by the Ford Motor Company, opened in 1977. It included four cylindrical office towers and a hotel. In May 1996, the Renaissance Center was bought by General Motors for about $80 million. The fact that the complex sold for less than a quarter of the price it cost to build two decades earlier was said to reflect the real-estate market's wariness in investing in a deteriorated downtown.
Mr. Young also developed a five-year economic plan for Detroit that he presented to President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 with the idea that it could be a blueprint for saving the nation's cities. Mr. Young had hoped that Mr. Ford, a former Michigan Congressman, would not let the state's largest city falter. But the plan failed to gain the support of the Republican Administration.
Even so, Mr. Young's efforts led to several major construction projects in his first and second terms, including new plants for General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation. The Mayor was also credited with keeping Detroit financially afloat in the late 1970's and early 1980's by persuading city workers to accept cuts in salaries and fringe benefits and voters to approve a $96 million increase in income taxes.
But that was not enough to keep businesses and residents from fleeing the city. Although the riverfront began to look prosperous, the rest of downtown was often compared with a war zone, with neighborhoods crumbling, businesses boarded up and poverty remaining high.
Still, black Detroiters viewed Mr. Young as their future and their hope. That view was first reflected in Mr. Young's three-day inauguration celebration, when blacks joined the city's political elite. It was also at that inauguration that Mr. Young's stormy relationship with the largely white suburbs seemed to begin.
"I issue an open warning to all dope pushers, to all rip-off artists, to all muggers," Mr. Young said at his inauguration in pledging to fight crime. "It is time to leave Detroit. And I don't give a damn if they are black or white, if they wear Superfly suits or blue uniforms with silver badges. Hit the road."
The reaction to Mr. Young's speech illustrated the depth of the racial divide between the city and its suburbs. Blacks heard one thing in his inaugural remarks while whites heard something completely different. Blacks applauded the new Mayor, understanding him to say that Detroit would get tough on crime and address their concerns about brutality and harassment in the largely white police department.
But the Mayor's statement angered many white suburbanites, who saw it as an invitation for the city's criminals to enter the suburbs and wreak havoc, and it troubled many white city residents, who saw it as an attack on the police department.
Most white voters had backed Mr. Young's opponent, John F. Nichols, a white former Police Commissioner, who lost by a slim margin. Mr. Young won the election largely on the promise to ease tension between the police and black residents.
As a step in that direction, he eliminated a police decoy unit whose officers had been accused of killing 22 black residents and arresting hundreds more without cause during its two-and-a-half-year existence. And he began a hiring program that infused the police force with officers from a wide range of ethnic and racial minorities. Under the program, the proportion of blacks rose to more than 50 percent in 1993 from less than 10 percent in 1974 and has remained at about that level.
Both actions were credited with reducing the number of brutality complaints against the city's police to 825 in 1982 from 2,323 in 1975.
Mr. Young won his second term in 1977 with 60 percent of the vote and seemed politically invincible by his third term in 1982. Even his critics said he could be the Mayor as long as he wanted. But his third term was marred by two Federal investigations that grew out of his efforts to direct city business to black-owned companies. No charges were ever filed against him in either case.
He breezed to a fourth term in 1986 without making the expected bridge-building racial appeals. Isabel Wilkerson, writing in The New York Times after Mr. Young won a nonpartisan primary over a dozen challengers, said the Mayor, running in a city in which 70 percent of the voters were black, seemed "to revel in the sort of polarization that other politicians dread."
A biographer of Mr. Young, Wilbur Rich, a political science professor at Wayne State University, said in 1989: "He embodies all the things that a lot of black people can't be themselves -- tough, combative, confrontational. He will tell white people off in a minute. That's reassuring to a lot of black people."
Near the end of his fifth term in 1993, with his health deteriorating because of emphysema, Mr. Young decided not to run for re-election. His power and influence were somewhat on the wane, but few doubted that if his constituents sensed that he needed them in a close election, they would turn out for him.
Mr. Young was twice married and divorced. He is survived by a son, Coleman Young Jr., and by two sisters, Juanita Clark and Bernice Greer of Detroit.
Coleman Alexander Young was born on May 24, 1918, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. His family moved to Detroit when he was 5, settling in Black Bottom, a racially and ethnically mixed neighborhood where Mr. Young's father opened a dry-cleaning and tailoring shop.
Mr. Young graduated from high school with an excellent academic record but went to work on a Ford assembly line after failing to obtain financial aid to attend the University of Michigan. He became a union organizer and then a postal worker before being drafted in World War II. He served in the 332d Fighter Group, the all-black Army Air Corps unit known as the Tuskegee Airmen, rising to second lieutenant.
He returned to the post office after the war. Later dismissed for union organizing, he bounced from job to job before helping to organize the Negro Labor Council, a group seeking equal job opportunities for blacks. His work with the council led to his being called in 1952 before the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was investigating Communism. Under questioning about his work with the council, Mr. Young declared, "I am not here as a stool pigeon."
Mr. Young was considered too radical by labor and management, and it was difficult for him to find work in the 1950's. He found a series of jobs, including salesman, cabdriver and painter, but kept his interest in politics. In 1959, he ran for state representative from the Black Bottom District but lost by a small margin. In 1963 he was elected to the State Senate, where he served until becoming Mayor. In the Senate, he was instrumental in gaining open-housing legislation and repealing a ban on busing to achieve racial integration.
Mr. Young, one of the first big-city mayors to support Jimmy Carter's Presidential bid in 1976, enjoyed his greatest prominence during the Carter Administration.
Mr. Young was the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1977 to 1981 and the chairman of the Democratic Convention Platform Committee in 1980. He also led the United States Conference of Mayors from 1981 to 1983 and the National Democratic Conference of Mayors in 1980.
Perhaps emblematic of his tenacity, Mr. Young had been in intensive care since July 24. He suffered cardiac arrest on Nov. 12, and his heart stopped for about 40 minutes before doctors revived him. He had chronic respiratory problems, which periodically led to rumors that he had died.
He wrote in his autobiography: "I would also call Detroit the most resilient city in America, to which end I kind of like to think that it takes after its Mayor of the past 20 years. We've been through a lot together, up to and including the unsubstantiated rumors of our demise."

HEADLINE: Buffeted Asian Economies Raise Fears of Unrest

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 29

 BODY:
As Asia's Miracle seems to fade to a mere marvel, many experts on the region worry that growing economic frustrations risk provoking political and social upheavals.
The underlying challenge is that for decades an implicit social contract has governed much of Asia: citizens put up with corruption, nepotism and often authoritarianism in their governments in exchange for getting rich. But now the financial crisis that has swept the region means that people can no longer count on getting rich. 
 No one knows exactly where the breach of this social contract could lead -- to riots, to toppled governments, to ethnic clashes, or perhaps to nothing at all -- but there is a profound apprehension that some countries may pay a price that is far greater than the already wrenching economic turbulence.
"Most of the governments in Southeast Asia claim the right to rule on the basis of delivering the economic goods," noted Muthiah Alagappa, a Malaysian scholar of politics at the East-West Center in Honolulu. "So one of the sharpest repercussions of all this is going to be the questioning of governments that are no longer able to deliver the goods."
The paradox is that much of Asia is still expected to grow by rates that are faster than the pace of the American economy. But Asians accustomed to cruising in the fast lane in the economic equivalent of a Ferrari may be profoundly irritated at hobbling along for a couple of years with the rest of the traffic.
Many Asian countries have not endured a real recession in more than two decades -- or in the case of Indonesia and Thailand, for three decades. The population of Asia is so young that most Asians have no memory of a recession, and if one is now arriving it will be a devastating experience socially and psychologically, as well as economically.
"After consistently high rates of growth, even a deceleration of the growth can cause disappointment and despair that may well have political and social fallout," said Linda Tsao Yang, the United States executive director of the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines. "And if the economic adjustments cause growth to grind to a halt, then the political fallout will be even more challenging."
Consequently, Mrs. Yang argues that international organizations and Western governments should be careful in setting conditions for bailouts, so as not to aggravate poverty and risk a backlash that would undermine social and political stability.
Aside from the threat to governments in the region, one of the greatest concerns is how economic malaise will aggravate ethnic fissures. One of the most sensitive divides concerns the ethnic Chinese minorities who dominate the economies of most Southeast Asian countries.
In the 1960's, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia were all torn by bitter riots between indigenous people and ethnic Chinese. In Indonesia, where the 4 percent of the population that is ethnic Chinese controls about 60 percent of the nation's wealth, upheavals led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people in the mid-1960's.
The long economic boom since then helped salve the ethnic antagonisms, for the average worker or peasant enjoyed a better life, even if he might fume about the Chinese shopkeeper down the road charging high prices for old vegetables. But over the last year, anti-Chinese riots have become more common, and the Indonesian Bishops Conference this month issued a statement warning against allowing the economic crisis to trigger further outbreaks.
Citizens should "refrain from blaming each other" for the economic crisis, the statement delicately urged.
In the latest Indonesian unrest, in September, the murder of a girl by a half-Chinese man led to rioting. Mobs tore apart a temple and burned Chinese-owned homes and shops. At least five people were killed.
Even in more homogeneous countries, the challenges are immense, in part because economics and security are often intertwined.
In South Korea, for example, some people fret that the current economic weakness and labor unrest, as workers go on strike to protest planned layoffs, might tempt a North Korean attack. And others worry that the economic crisis, coupled with labor unrest and a possible opposition victory in the presidential elections on Dec. 18, conceivably could encourage South Korea's own military to stage a coup, although this is widely regarded as very unlikely.
"I think at this moment this would not be possible," said Lee Shin Bom, a member of the National Assembly. "But it may be natural for people to worry about any possibility."
In a region once famed for its strongman rule, it is striking that relatively weak governments now rule many countries in Asia, from India to Japan. The economic crisis has already toppled one Government, Thailand's, and some analysts believe that more could follow.
"Leaders are generally vulnerable across the region," said William H. Overholt, a Hong Kong-based managing director of Bankers Trust Company. "And there's also a generational change under way that is now going to be accelerated."
To be sure, a bit of upheaval might not always be such a bad thing. One Government that may be vulnerable, for example, is the autocratic one in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma -- and many experts believe that a new Government is just what that country needs.
One of the biggest uncertainties concerns Japan, the world's second-largest economy, where Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had already been weakened before the Asian economic flu swept into his country this month and toppled a major bank and large brokerage house. Now Mr. Hashimoto is even more beleaguered, and the opposition is suggesting that he resign.
One difficulty in making predictions about the consequences of the economic crisis is that while governments are weak throughout much of Asia, the opposition forces also tend to be fractured. Japan's experience over the last half-dozen years demonstrates that in such circumstances the result can be that the social contract tears without leading to revolution or even much evolution.
Japan operated for decades with a social covenant similar to those of many other Asian countries -- accepting wealth in exchange for tolerating political iniquities. As a result, Japan, one of the most honest societies in the world, had one of the most corrupt political systems.
That social contract became frayed when Japan's economic "bubble" came under pressure in 1989 and eventually collapsed, leading to a long slowdown from which Japan has yet to emerge. Japanese voters retaliated in 1993 by evicting the Liberal Democratic Party from power for the first time in 38 years.
The opposition ruled briefly and ineffectually, and last year the Liberal Democrats were effectively voted back to power, not so much in a moral victory as by default. Voters, stymied by the lack of attractive alternatives, are retreating from the electoral system in disgust, sending voting participation rates to their lowest levels ever, and politicians are even more hobbled than before.
"The system has become more and more fragmented, and no one is ready to take charge of Japan," said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Tokyo University.
Another huge question mark concerns Indonesia, which like Thailand and South Korea has already turned to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. Indonesia has a population of 200 million and no clear successor to President Suharto, who is 76. Although Mr. Suharto is still widely expected to win a seventh five-year presidential term next year, the economic crisis may weaken his authority and limit his ability to install whomever he wants as his own successor.
Then there is the giant of the region, a domino that towers so high that, while it is not wobbling now and perhaps never will, could produce a crash whose political, social and economic consequences would shake the world.
"The real question is China," said Michel Oksenberg, an Asia expert at Stanford University. "If China suffers a downturn, at what point will the substantial number of urban migrants feel pressure, and how will they react?"
China in some ways is vulnerable because the Communist Party has switched the basis of its legitimacy from the Maoist revolution of 1949 to the remarkable economic successes of the last 15 years. The challenge for the party is that this economic triumph has also nurtured dangerously high economic expectations and the emergence of a class of tens of millions of migrant laborers who increasingly resemble something akin to the volatile proletariat that Marx warned might rise up against the owners of capital.
Professor Oksenberg noted that there have been a growing number of reports of sporadic worker protests in recent years and added, "I do not think of the Chinese working class as quiescent, and I think that's what makes the regime nervous."

HEADLINE: Dismissing the Deficit Won't Help Workers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson dismisses the trade deficit on the ground that it represents only 1 percent of gross domestic product, although she admits it will expand ("Trade Deficits Won't Ruin Us," Op-Ed, Nov. 24). The trade deficit may have its limitations as a statistic, but it is our best measure of America's international competitiveness. 
 Ms. Tyson's assertion is like claiming a company had a good year because its loss was only 1 percent of sales, and growing. Like such a loss, our deficit can be financed only by more debt or the selling of assets. This is a strange definition of economic health.
The outsourcing of American production has undercut high-wage jobs and has been a major cause of the growing inequality of incomes. From 1979 to 1994, the increased trade deficit eliminated 2.2 million jobs in manufacturing -- mostly high-wage jobs for the three-quarters of the labor force without a college education.

HEADLINE: Chinese Schools Drawing Both the Young and Old

BYLINE: By RAMIN P. JALESHGARI 

 BODY:
BRIAN SMITH sits squeezed into a too-small chair in a classroom at the Chinese Center on Long Island. Chinese-American kindergartners filling the room obediently repeat Mandarin words to a smiling teacher and Mr. Smith also tries diligently to get the sounds right.
Mr. Smith, a lawyer from New Hyde Park, has to be a good example for his 5-year-old daughter Kristin, who sits alongside, watching carefully. Even though she was born in China, Chinese language school is a first for Kristin -- as well as for her adoptive American father. 
 Brian and Kristin Smith are just two of the hundreds of students attending Chinese language schools across Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Some, like this father and daughter, belong to one of the more than 145 families that have adopted children from China and are committed to promoting their child's ethnic heritage. Others are second- or even third-generation Chinese-Americans encouraged to learn, many for the first time, the language of their ancestors.
Also attending these classes are American business people, hoping to become proficient enough to communicate when working with the economically emerging People's Republic. Chinese immigrants, learning dialects other than their own, round out the class rosters of formal Chinese schools in Westbury, Stony Brook, Hicksville, West Hempstead (2), Great Neck and Huntington.
"In recent years," said Kamal K. Sridhar, associate professor of linguistics and former director of English as a Second Language at the State University at Stony Brook, "there have been an increased formal efforts to promote language maintenance among hyphenated-Americans; the numerous Chinese language schools on the Island are a good example of that. This is because there has been an increased movement toward multiculturalism and tolerance, so individuals feel more comfortable to promote their native languages."
Dr. Sridhar, who specializes in language maintenance within immigrant groups living in the United States. said that maintaining a language was an important aspect of retaining cultural identity, a phenomena apparent within the Chinese community.
At the Chinese Culture Association of Long Island, for example, classes held at New York Institute of Technology in Westbury are not limited to language alone. Students can sign up for cultural studies in dance, chorus, Chinese yo-yo, paper cutting, painting and Chinese calligraphy.
"We have a Chinese school on Long Island because we hope our next generation will learn Chinese and becomie familiar enough with it to keep our heritage," said Peter Chang, the association's president. The organization's 250 students hail from Manhattan to western Suffolk and attend classes there through 10th grade.
Jennifer Chiang, a 10th grader at Garden City High School, has attended Chinese school for eight years. "My parents want me to learn the culture by being literate and experienced with the language" she said. "When I was younger, I didn't really like Chinese school, but now that I'm closer to college, I know that having a second language is important -- especially if you want to go into international business, which I do."
Jon Lin Pei, a fellow student, graduated from the program last year. A junior at Great Neck South High School and co-chairman of the school's Asian Club, Jon Lin Pei takes his Chinese language education in stride. "Chinese school has become pretty much a part of my life," he said, "although I don't claim to be fluent in the language because of it. I'm not. I mostly speak English, even at home to my parents. The school has made me really involved in Chinese culture and that will stay with me even if the language doesn't."
Part of his exploration of his ethnicity includes participation in his high school's Asian Night, a benefit event that has become a highlight among Long Island's Chinese community celebrations -- drawing many thousands of dollars in contributions.
Parents who enroll their children in Chinese language classes do so for a number of reasons. Mae and Tom Ahn's daughter, Olivia, is in her second year at the Chinese Culture Association of Long Island's program. While Ms. Ahn grew up in Chinatown and speaks Chinese fluently, her Northport-born and raised husband, Tom, knows nothing of the language of his forebears -- even though his parents spoke it at home.
"Throughout my childhood, I made a conscious effort to constantly prove my American-ness and that included deliberately focusing on English instead of Chinese," said Mr. Ahn, who is a vice president for corporate real estate at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. "I don't want my daughter to have the same experience. The school is necessary because we speak English at home to accommodate me, so unfortunately, Olivia cannot learn in the house."
Jennifer and Noel Schavzin's daughters, Pearl and Rebecca, are enrolled in the Westbury program to keep up a dual family tradition of linguistic expertise. Mrs. Schavzin hails from Taiwan and speaks both Mandarin and Cantonese while her husband, a native of Ukraine, speaks four languages in all.
"Of all the languages we could have chosen for our children to learn, we went with Chinese because it is so difficult," said Mrs. Schavzin. "We know if they can master Chinese first, other languages will come much easier to them." Yin Mei and Doug Critchell's sons, also enrolled in the association's classes, have developed a strong affinity with their mother's millennia-old culture. Both boys often serve as translators for their maternal grandmother, who lives with them. But for Yin Mei, the association with the Chinese culture that language school represents was, at first, both an attractive and unattractive opportunity.
"I fled Communist China to escape censorship and thought-oppression," said Ms. Critchell, a performing arts instructor at Queens College. "For the longest time, the thought of my birth country aroused hostile, even anti-Chinese feelings. It was a tough decision to get involved with the Chinese community -- especially since, with an American husband, I could have easily stayed out of it."
Henry Chang, a former president of the association, said his group and its affiliated school wanted to lure members of all ethnic communities in the interest of promoting intercultural exchange. "Our members are not only Chinese-Americans. We have Caucasians, people of mixed parentage, parents with adopted Chinese kids. All are welcome."
Mary Ann is a single mother who adopted her daughter, Maya, from China. She, like many parents of Chinese children, went to the association's classes to research the best language school options for her 3-year-old. "Maya knows that she's from China and has, at times, expressed some interest in learning Chinese," she said. "She was an infant when we adopted her, so English is her first language. Soon she'll be ready to start formally learning, and it's gratifying to know that there are many options on the Island."
Mr. Chang said, "We are getting more and more parents like Mary Ann who looking to further their child's understanding of their ethnicity through language study, and we're happy to have them."
At the Chinese Center on Long Island, where the Smiths attend school, special outreach to families with Chinese children is being promoted in conjunction with the local chapter of Families With Children From China, a national organization dedicated to promoting and supporting adoptions from the Chinese mainland. According to the organization, in 1995 when the adoptions for China were first viable for United States citizens, the national rate of adoption from that country was approximately 800 a year. This year the number approaches 4,000, with an overall rate of well over 10,000 for the last two years.
"We have 145 families within our Long Island chapter, but we estimate the number is actually closer to 200," said Ron Tralle, who is the area's regional coordinator for the organization. "A lot of Americans have considered Chinese adoptions for a number of reasons; the most important being the security of knowing that it's not likely that a birth mother will show up out of the blue, years down the line, demanding her child back." Mr. Tralle and his wife, Kathleen, adopted their daughter, Amanda, in 1994. They live in Hicksville.
The average adoption from China costs $15,000 to $25,000 and almost all the children are girls -- often abandoned by parents who desire a boy. Families in China receive government support for one child and usually cannot afford to keep having children.
"There were so many little girls in the orphanage we adopted our daughter from that the staff couldn't handle the volume," said Brian Smith, "so they strapped the toddlers into these little green chairs to prevent them from running around. They didn't do it to hurt the children; it was just simply too much for them to handle. Anyway, those girls would rock and sway in their confines to get some stimulation. Today I look at my daughter and all I can think is 'Thank God she was saved from the little green chairs.' "
For George Wing, president of the 36-year-old Chinese Center of Long Island, promoting intercultural exchange between parents with Chinese children and the community will help stave off the kinds of prejudice he endured as a Carle Place youngster.
"'When I was growing up on Long Island in the 1950's," he said, "we were probably the only Chinese family in our town, and even though I'm American-born there was prejudice -- especially when it came to dating." Mr. Wing, a retired New York City shop teacher who himself does not speak any Chinese dialect, added: "I believe that our school and center helps promote the kind of exchange that can educate against bias -- even though we are not a political organization."
One of the prize students in Mr. Wing's group is Lloyd Doppman, a detective with the Nassau County Police Department who is fluent in Mandarin. Detective Doppman is one of only 10 police offers in the department who speak an Asian language.
"Studying Mandarin has opened up a very different way of life for me," he said. "I've been become part of an old and venerable culture by adoption." Detective Doppman also speaks Korean and Japanese and is the president of the police department's fraternal organization of Asian officers.
"The Chinese community has been very welcoming to me, and there is no doubt my ability to speak the language has opened those doors," he said. Detective Doppman is often called upon in an official capacity to interpret for Chinese crime victims, and has been instrumental within his unit communicating with Korean women who have become prostitutes in the United States.
Dealing with civil rights issues of Chinese-Americans is the main agenda at the Organization of Chinese Americans in Hicksville, a 24-year-old national group whose primary objective is to promote active participation of Chinese-Americans in civic and national matters.
"It's not easy to maintain a group like ours -- especially without a language school.," said Ed Kang, the organization's Long Island director. "We do have educational outreach but it extends to AIDS awareness, immigration laws and fair employment practices. The Chinese community is very conservative; they understand the concept of a language school because it keeps the culture going, but political activism is not something Chinese like to get involved with."
For Dr. Kang and others, the simple acceptance that Chinese language schools and cultural organizations enjoy within Long Island's landscape is not enough. To them, an ideal future for Chinese Long Islanders will be one of proactive socioeconomic and cultural commerce.
Toward this end, Henry Chang of the Chinese Cultural Association of Long Island has created, along with two co-executive directors and the Chinese-American Development Association of Long Island, a long-term plan to promote Nassau County's international image and ties to the Asian Pacific rim. The project seeks to advance economic exchange between East and West -- a goal the group hopes will come to fruition in the form of a Chinese-American shopping mall on Long Island.
"We want to create a commerce venue that opens up Chinese, and, hopefully, in the long run, all Asianculture to the local community in a practical way," Mr. Chang said. "In addition to stores, there will be a museum and learning space as well."
The mall is seen as the vehicle to keeping up Nassau County's part of a larger agreement adopting China's Taichung County as a sister district and actively marketing economic and business ties between the two regions.
"We've really come into our own as part of the local population and have been recognized as such by both county and state legislators," said Mr. Chang, who noted that Chinese schools had played a large part in that recognition, as have the publicity that adoptions from China have generated.

HEADLINE: Getting Credit for Being White

BYLINE: By Margaret Talbot; Margaret Talbot is a senior editor of The New Republic. This is her first article for the Magazine.

 BODY:
At the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, teaching part time on the faculty, there is a young academic who calls herself White Trash Girl. She's a performance artist of sorts: think Roseanne hopped up on post-structuralist theory, Larry Flynt toting an M.F.A. In a faux hillbilly accent, she will tell you all about her fictional identity as "an inbred biological disaster turned superhero," the product of "a 14-year-old girl and her funny uncle." She parades around the blue-collar neighborhood where she lives in tacky resplendence: white cowboy hat, T-shirts bearing slogans like "I'm baby soft," short, tight skirts. She makes White Trash Girl videos and trading cards, and is quick with pronouncements about the provocative importance of her own work, which, as it turns out, has as much to do with whiteness as it does with trashiness.
Laura Kipnis, an associate professor at Northwestern, interviewed White Trash Girl for a recent anthology called, yes, "White Trash." The interview gave White Trash Girl (whose real name is Jennifer Reeder) the opportunity to tell the world why embracing and exploring a white identity was an entirely justifiable pursuit. "I think a lot of people have this white guilt, so any reference to white culture becomes about white supremacy," she said., whereas she sees her whiteness as a fact that should never be ignored and that determines her point of view on just about everything. "It describes a certain esthetic, but I think it's also a socioeconomic situation, and a way of perceiving the world around you and your own place in the world." Reeder revels in white trashery -- and applauds herself for doing so. "I am busty, and I am loud, and I love bad taste. I am bad taste." 
 White Trash Girl represents an extreme -- the far shore where fanzine culture and art-school self-indulgence and identity-chic meet. Yet she is also perfectly representative, the mascot of a new, very hot academic field called whiteness studies. As a discipline in progress, whiteness studies offers many things, but among them is the promise that no groovy young theorist need ever be "just this white girl" or "just this white boy" again. For in taking as its subject white culture and white privilege, it accords whites the same kind of critical, even obsessive scrutiny that self-defined marginalized groups have long trained on themselves.
The emergence of whiteness studies has all the hallmarks of cutting-edge research in the humanities today: a casual disdain for liberalism and a romance with political extremes; a fondness for the confessional mode of writing; a serious infatuation with pop culture. The discipline, like a lot of trendy new scholarship, has produced some worthwhile history -- and a lot of silly posing. It is often fractured and incoherent; its central values have unintended and sometimes disturbing implications, and for all of these reasons, it offers a cautionary tale of sorts for life in academia now.
Intellectual trends move quickly on campus, almost as quickly as the pop culture to which they are often responding. And whiteness studies, whatever else it may turn out to be, is the academic trend du jour. Like porn studies a few years ago and queer theory before that, whiteness is furiously generating conferences and panels and dissertations and an entire cottage industry of textbook-style readers like "Critical White Studies" (Temple University Press, 1997); anthologies of modish, theory-driven essays like "Displacing Whiteness" (Duke University Press, 1997); carefully researched and often-illuminating historical studies of 19th-century America like Noel Ignatiev's "How the Irish Became White" and Grace Elizabeth Hale's forthcoming "Making Whiteness," an exploration of how whites in the post-slavery South remade the idea of white superiority.
There is even, in suburban New Jersey, a Center for the Study of White American Culture, which sponsors talks with titles like "Turn a Whiter Shade of Pale: The Search for an Alternate Albinity" and offers diversity consulting and sensitivity training to corporations. It promotes the idea that "consciousness on the topic of whiteness" helps "white Americans participate in building a multiracial society."
Contrary to the worst fears of conservative critics, academic courses on whiteness studies -- or porn studies or queer theory, for that matter -- have not yet replaced Beowulf or Chaucer, Austen or Dickens. They have merely taken their place alongside the canonical subjects. Liberal-arts departments today are like bazaars in which a little of everything is available and no one school of thought predominates.
In any case, nobody really wants to see whiteness honored with a department of its own; the whole idea is too politically sensitive. "If you got money for something like that, you'd wonder what the donor's motivations were," says Annalee Newitz, a Berkeley graduate student who co-edited White Trash" and spoke at a whiteness-studies conference on campus last May. "It's so open to misinterpretation and it's so easy to move in the direction of, 'Hey, let's hear it for white culture. Isn't Spam great?' "
Tucked into the undergraduate curriculum, whiteness studies might in time mean seminars on the history of blackface, the social geography of trailer parks, or the politics, such as they are, of white kids who love hip-hop. For now, it tends to mean asking white students to cogitate about being white, so that they might have some hope of shaking off what Sartre called the privilege of "seeing without being seen." At Macalester College in St. Paul, for example, an associate professor of anthropology named Anna Meigs teaches a class called "Race, Race Privilege, Whiteness" in which students interview their classmates about their experiences of racism and whiteness.
Of course, if whiteness studies is an academic whirligig, it is also the product of the world beyond the campus gates. Is it only coincidence that the scholarly preoccupation with so-called white trash has emerged now -- when we have an Elvis-imitating, fried-food-loving, quasi-good-ol'-boy from Arkansas in the White House? In some ways, whiteness studies can be seen as a means of smuggling considerations of class -- besmirched in recent decades by association with crude Marxism -- into the analysis of American society and culture. Maybe a period of economic prosperity like the one we're in now affords greater license to think about the class divisions that persist.
Then too, whiteness studies is almost certainly a symptom of the kind of agonized muddle that well-meaning white Americans tend to find themselves in when it comes to racial politics. Wouldn't it be easier to retreat into transfixed contemplation of one's own racial identity than to try to breathe new life into the project of integration? More charitably, might the first goal somehow serve the second? Some of the undergraduates who take whiteness studies courses seem to think so. For them, the classes offer the kind of consciousness-raising lessons they might get from, say, an African-American studies class, if they ever took one. "I went to high school in Lincoln, Nebraska, and I'd never really thought about the fact that almost all of the people I was surrounded with were white," says Amelia Buttress, a junior at Macalester who was in Professor Meigs's course last spring. "In the class we talked a lot about that kind of thing. Why are some places all white? Why, if you're white, don't you notice?"
Whiteness scholars say they want to examine what it means to be white in this country because they want to purge themselves of any remnants of racism. The goal, as they would put it, is to "problematize" whiteness. Yet the whole enterprise gives whites a kind of standing in the multicultural paradigm they have never before enjoyed. And it involves them, inevitably, in a journey of self-discovery in which white people's thoughts about their own whiteness acquire a portentous new legitimacy.
While ethnic studies and women's studies were premised on the assumption that their subjects were chronically understudied -- orphans of history to be brought in from the cold -- whiteness studies can hardly make the same claim, and it doesn't. The idea isn't that "European Americans" have not been studied enough; it is that they are always being studied, under another name. But ethnic studies has a certain logic, bequeathed to it by the idea of marginalized people moving to the center, and whiteness studies cannot entirely escape that logic -- the sense that in naming a new field of scholarship it is bestowing attention, and even validation, on the hitherto neglected. The risk is that by trying to limn something called white culture, you make a fetish of it.
"There's a suspicion among African-Americans that whiteness studies is a sneaky form of narcissism," says Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of African-American studies at Columbia University whose next book will be partly devoted to whiteness. "At the very moment when African-American studies and Asian-American studies and so on are really coming into their own, you have whiteness studies shifting the focus and maybe the resources back to white people and their perspective."
Not that the field of whiteness studies can really be described as a coherent whole. Though only a few years old, it has already given rise to hostile camps. There are those -- mostly younger, post-structuralist-type scholars -- who clearly adore the idea of white trash culture, for example. And there are those who think that it is naive and maybe dangerous to say there is any such thing as white culture.
In the former camp, you could include Annalee Newitz and Matt Wray, who together edited "White Trash," which along with the interview with White Trash Girl includes essays on slasher movies, Elvis worship, hillbilly lore and country music. And in the latter camp, you find scholars like Noel Ignatiev, a historian who edits a truculent little journal called "Race Traitor" (motto: "treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity").
For Ignatiev, studying whiteness is merely a necessary stage en route to what he calls "the abolition of whiteness" -- just as, in Marxist analysis, class consciousness is a necessary stage en route to the abolition of class. "Abolishing whiteness" would seem to decree not, say, a cult-style mass suicide of America's palefaces, but a mass renunciation of all the perks that come with being one. And until the day of renunciation comes, in the view of the rather ascetic Ignatiev -- a former steel-mill worker and 60's radical who is a fellow at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute at Harvard -- nobody ought to be having too much fun with whiteness.
Not surprisingly, Ignatiev scoffs at the idea of claiming, let alone celebrating, any sort of white culture. "There is youth culture and drug culture and queer culture; but there is no such thing as white culture," Ignatiev said in a talk at the Berkeley conference. He went on, "Without the privileges attached to it, the white race would not exist, and white skin would have no more social significance than big feet." To the field's post-modern types, Ignatiev is something of a relic, and a worrisome one at that. He and the other so-called new abolitionists bum the younger crowd out. They are asking us "to demonize whiteness rather than to deconstruct it," complains Newitz, who is 28 and likes to call herself "biethnic" because her father is Jewish and her mother is a white Southerner and former Methodist.
Autobiographical details matter a great deal to the whiteness theorists. What might be seen as precursors of whiteness studies -- essays like "The Souls of White Folk" by W.E.B. Du Bois (1920), or "What America Would Be Like Without Blacks" by Ralph Ellison (1970) -- were written by blacks, working in a tradition of belle-lettristic social criticism. Today, most of the academics identified with the field are white, and they sometimes seem to be writing what amounts to a therapeutic collective memoir, an exquisitely self-conscious chronicle of coming out as white guys and gals. "There is so much writing out there by people of color about their personal daily struggles, but very little writing by white people about how their racial identity feels to them minute by minute, hour by hour," says Newitz. "I mean: What does it feel like to to have people relate to you as a racial stereotype?"
A number of whiteness-studies scholars have taken this kind of admonition to heart and are turning out work that is conspicuously first-person. The "White Trash" anthology alone contains a rather charming recollection of growing up in a trailer park in Bayonne, N.J.; a memoir, by a self-described "Okie," of marrying up and hating herself for it, and an essay that attempts to reconcile the author's childhood memories of religious revivalism in his New Hampshire town with socioeconomic theory about the white underclass.
Actually, this confessional mode is part of what marks whiteness studies as an of-the-moment academic discipline. In some schools of thought, especially those influenced by feminist theory, writing in the first person is supposed to serve the important political function of disclosing the writer's position, which is to say the race/gender/sexual preference/class that shapes and even determines her vision of the world. (Whiteness scholars refer to this social position as your "location," a word they tend to repeat with the fervor of real-estate agents making a pitch.) And, political reasons aside, a lot of academic writing has caught the pants-down confessional bug that animates so many current memoirs and so much daytime TV. The result is a strange hybrid: prose that lurches between Jenny Jones-style self-revelation and undigested social theory.
The other distinguishing characteristic that many whiteness scholars have in common is a deep disdain for American liberalism. Indeed, you can find prominent scholars in both main camps -- the whiteness-as-culture and the whiteness-as-power crowd -- who profess to see greater hope for the future of race relations in, say, the militia movement than in liberal anti-racism. Liberalism, for them, is a pack of pieties about the progress we've made in improving the lives of African-Americans.
When I interviewed Noel Ignatiev in his sparsely furnished town house not far from Harvard Square, he spoke vaguely but hopefully of making contact with home-grown fascists. "The only thing that can win these people away from this nightmare vision is something that is as highly oppositional as the fascist vision, but that is antiracial. To reach them, you have to be as angry as they are. And what is called modern liberalism, multiculturalism, they see -- correctly -- as allied with the establishment."
Even scholars less likely to play the role of professional provocateur will sound much the same note. "Why object so strongly to the militias when it's just as true that the liberal center is white supremacist?" asks Eric Lott, an associate professor of English and American Studies at the University of Virginia and the author of "Love and Theft," a widely praised history of blackface minstrelsy.
Partly, of course, such rhetoric is meant to be shocking; it's the way that professors who'd like to be firebrands say boo! Then again, it suggests how far the most self-consciously avant-garde of them have moved from what was once the liberal consensus on racial politics.
The premium on provocation may be unavoidable. Here, after all, is a field in which the American obsession with race, the new scholarly commitment to commenting swiftly on pop culture and the stresses of the academic job market all conspire to fizz up and speed along the process by which ideas become books become paradigms.
In a job market where last year less than half the newly minted English Ph.D.'s landed teaching positions, graduate students labor to set themselves apart from the pack by publishing early and often. "Given the current job market," says Matt Wray, 33, who is working on his Ph.D. in ethnic studies at Berkeley, "it's very hard not to sort of see the whiteness stuff as something you should grab ahold of and say, 'This is my meal ticket.' Academics like to believe that they have relative autonomy from market forces, but none of us is immune."
This goes along with a publishing environment in which prestigious academic presses snatch up manuscripts on pop cultural ephemera like bargain hunters at a jumble sale. One result is books that seem ill equipped to stand the test of time, dedicated to phenomena that perhaps our deeper thinkers needn't have troubled with. (Consider, for example, "Women on Ice," a collection of scholarly essays about the "Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle.")
The twist is that some of the academics who chase hardest after the hippest and the hottest subjects seem fated to produce work that looks worthy-but-dull to the very next cohort of graduate students. Sure, Madonna studies is "past its prime now," Matt Wray told The Wall Street Journal; but, he added respectfully, "a lot of good work was done on the significance of Madonna."
In whiteness studies, the imperative to publish has meant that it is much easier to find criticism on whiteness in the media or literature than it is to find empirical research on actual white people. Both fieldwork and statistical studies -- the kind of work done, often slowly, in sociology or anthropology departments -- is pretty sparse. (An exception is the scholarship of John Hartigan Jr., an anthropologist and historian who has extensively interviewed whites living in inner city Detroit about their racial attitudes.)
And the faddishness of much of this research has meant that some of the more discomfiting questions about the field remain unanswered. What social good does it serve, for example, to heighten Caucasian awareness if in doing so you run the risk of swelling Caucasian pride? Conversely, isn't it disingenuous to argue, as Ignatiev and company do, that "whiteness" is something to be abolished, whereas "blackness" is not? "In their view," says Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at Princeton University, "whiteness is implicitly the racial category that is evil, and blackness is just a response to it. It's black nationalism by another means."
Ultimately, it is hard to say precisely what whiteness means to whiteness scholars. Their common refrain is that race is not a biological fact but "a social construction." Yet in many ways, they are profoundly invested in the idea of racial categories -- so much so that, even without intending to, they could end up making those categories seem immutable.

GRAPHIC: Photos: 'To be acknowledged as white, it was not enough for the Irish to have a competitive advantage over Afro-Americans in the labor market; in order for them to avoid the taint of blackness it was necessary that no Negro be allowed to work in occupations where Irish were to be found.' -- Noel Ignatiev, How the Irish Became White; 'White Trash Girl doesn't feel any inhibitions about her body and its power, there's no denial of her body functions. They have this incredible power, and she's still really smart and overtly sexy and all that.' -- Jennifer Reeder, from White Trash; 'Growing up poor, white and religious, I learned to believe that the world was essentially an evil and unjust place.' -- Matt Wray, from White Trash; 'Whiteness describes, from Little Big Horn to Simi Valley, not a culture but precisely the absence of culture. It is the empty and therefore terrifying attempt to build an identity based on what one isn't and on whom one can hold back.' -- David Roediger, Towards the Abolition of Whiteness; 'Whites are said to consider themselves a neutral universal category, hence nonracial and superior to "racialized" others. Their self-image as whites is thus both underdeveloped and yet extremely presumptuous.' -- Annalee Newitz, from White Trash (Tom Maday; Michelle Andonian; Ken Miller; Keri Pickett for The New York Times)
