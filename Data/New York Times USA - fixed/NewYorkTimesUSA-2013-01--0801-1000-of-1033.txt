HEADLINE: Assembly Leader Softens on Placing Casino in New York City

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, said he remained opposed to a casino with table games in Manhattan, but would be open to one in other areas of the city. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Thursday that he was open to a Las Vegas-style casino in some parts of New York City, as he continued to soften his opposition to the idea of casino development within the five boroughs. 
Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he remained opposed to a casino with table games in Manhattan, but would be open to the idea in other areas of the city, specifically naming Coney Island and Willets Point, as well as the Aqueduct racetrack - sites that he has reportedly been considering for some time. 
He also said Thursday that the Legislature wanted to have a say in the siting of any full-scale casinos, challenging a plan by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to put the power in the hands of a new gambling commission. 
"The Legislature would like to have a role in geographic selection," he said in comments outside his Albany office.
Mr. Silver has historically been the biggest opponent of casino gambling in New York City, and has been reluctant to consider casino development even on the city's fringes. But his tone has been moderating over the last several months. 
"I don't believe densely populated areas of the state should have a casino," Mr. Silver said. "I don't believe that people should be able to go on their lunch hour and have the ability to lose a week or a month's pay on their lunch hour, so we should look at destinations that are not in densely populated areas."
"There are parts of the city that would qualify for that," he added. "Manhattan would not, for example. Central Brooklyn would not. Central Queens would not. But there are places that can qualify as destinations within the city, whether it's Willets Point or Aqueduct or Coney Island." 
There are already nine racetrack slot parlors and five tribal casinos in New York. State lawmakers, acting at Mr. Cuomo's urging, last year took the first step toward asking voters to allow up to seven full-scale, nontribal casinos in the state; the Legislature will consider the matter again this year, and if a measure passes, it will go before voters in November. 
Mr. Cuomo said this month that he would propose phasing in expanded gambling, at first allowing the development of only three casinos, none of them in New York City, in an effort to lift the upstate economy. He has not said where he thinks casinos should be located after that first phase. 
The casino industry has been eager to develop in New York because of its large population, concentrated wealth and high level of tourism. A slot parlor at the Aqueduct racetrack has already proved to be highly lucrative, both for the state and its operator; a full-scale casino would bring table games and even more revenue. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been resistant to the idea of a casino in New York City, but his third term ends this year, and he will most likely be out of office by the time the matter is decided. 
Last year, Mr. Silver said of casino development: "I would prefer to stay out of the city, but certainly at best the fringes of the city, in order to avoid the social ills that come with casino gaming. I'm not a fan of casino gaming, and I think generally our conference is not a fan of casino gaming."
But on Thursday, he seemed much more at ease with the idea of a casino in the city. 
"I mentioned Willets Point because it's basically a bunch of junkyards right now, and there's some talk of revitalizing it," he said. 
"Aqueduct is again something that's not in the densely populated part of the city, Coney Island has a tradition of being a resort area to some extent; obviously it needs some revitalization to do it, but I say I wouldn't rule those out."

HEADLINE: In India, a Rise of Private Universities and Liberal Arts Programs

BYLINE: NOOR BRARA


HIGHLIGHT: If you are a student interested in taking a variety of university courses and having time to narrow your career options, then a liberal arts education may be ideal for you. 

 BODY:
If you are a student who is interested in taking a variety of university courses and having time to narrow your career options, then a liberal arts education may be an ideal fit for you.
A number of new private universities with liberal arts programs have sprung up in India. There were fewer than 20 such schools in 2005, and there are more than 100 now, according to a report by Shiv Nadar University. 
According to the report, since 2008 India has seen a 40-percent increase in students choosing to enroll in private universities instead of public schools, which require students to choose a discipline for admission (and are increasingly difficult to get into). 
Private universities offer more choice, but they come at a much higher price. Annual tuition can run as high as 40,000 rupees, compared with 360 rupees at Delhi University's St. Stephen's College, for example. That is because these private universities - which are often started by entrepreneurs and investors - are generally for-profit businesses, unlike the government schools, which are highly subsidized. Private university owners say the for-profit models gives them the ability to provide students with experienced, well-paid professors. 
One of the newest of these private schools is Shiv Nadar University in Noida, a suburb of Delhi. The university, when it opened its doors last year, offered programs in engineering, math and natural sciences to its first batch of 274 students. This year, it began its School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the student population has risen to 574. As at liberal arts schools in the United States, students at Shiv Nadar University are required to take a core curriculum of varied subjects, regardless of their major. 
In this week's installment of The Choice on India Ink, we're taking a look at the rise of private universities and liberal arts programs in India. We sat down with Nikhil Sinha, the vice chancellor at Shiv Nadar University, and Sanjeev Agrawal, the dean of studies, to find out more about why the university has chosen its interdisciplinary approach over the specializing method of most other Indian universities.

Some questions and answers have been edited, including for space and style.
 Q. 
 Why do you feel it's necessary for students to study a wide variety of subjects? 
 A. 
 Mr. Agrawal: Whether you're an economics or English major, you still have to take courses in things like history, biology and psychology in order to say you've had a well-rounded education. We aim for our students to be global citizens who are knowledgeable about many subjects, not just one. 
 Q. 
 Where do your professors come from? 
 A. 
 Mr. Sinha: Despite the fact that the school is still in its early stages, professors from universities outside of India - from places like Harvard and Berkeley in the United States to Oxford in the United Kingdom - currently teach and continue to express interest in teaching at S.N.U. It's an initiative that many want to be a part of building. Over 70 percent of our incoming faculty and half of our current faculty have either taught or studied abroad.
You can devise the right curricula, but unless you have the professors to back it up, you won't get anywhere. I think many of them want to see this work.
 Q. 
 Your students are required to do some kind of work over summer vacation. Can you tell us why that is? 
 A. 
 Mr. Agrawal: We want our students to apply their studies to real-life situations, so they can also see where all their hard work is going. We feel the best way that can be done is through some kind of experience over the summer, whether that's at an internship or doing research for a professor at the university or summer classes.
We want them to be able to compete alongside students from other universities in an international sense, and since many of those students are furthering their interests and working over summer while on break, we thought we'd make it a required part of our program so that they can have the same opportunities once they graduate.
 Q. 
 Tell us a little bit about your plans for exchange programs. 
 A. 
 Mr. Sinha: We've begun plans to collaborate with colleges in the United States for exchange programs and dual degrees, since that's definitely something we'd like to offer our students and students abroad. We've been in contact with a few universities about students attending our university and theirs, and graduating with degrees from both schools. This will provide the students with experience both in India and overseas, and they'll also have an easier time working abroad if that's what they prefer. We want foreign students to look to S.N.U. one day as a place to come to study for all four years, not just for one year as exchange students.
For members of the Shiv Nadar University team, the road ahead is still long, but they feel it will be worth the wait.
"It will take some time before we're able to offer everything we'd like to," Mr. Agrawal said. "But our current students are really enjoying their courses, and the fact that they're able to contribute to the making of the school curriculum and vision. A lot of feedback comes from them, and as long as they remain engaged and interested, we know we're on the right track. Other universities are also beginning to be aware of that."
This may be true. As the number of private universities continues to grow, public universities are beginning to follow their lead by offering interdisciplinary programs to their students. Examples of these universities include the Jawaharlal Nehru University and the University of Delhi, which announced the opening of its four-year liberal arts program, Meta College, at the start of this semester.
According to The Indian Express, University of Delhi admissions officers received an "overwhelming response" from students eager to get into the program.
"We received over 100 applications just two days after making the announcement," said the program co-coordinator, Madar Chaturvedi. 
Over all, the S.N.U. team is confident that this new trend will continue to grow within India.
"It's important that students aren't forced to commit to a field of study right out of eighth grade," Mr. Sinha said. "They should have choices, and they should be familiar with the kinds of opportunities that are out there for them. Not just in India, but all over the world."

HEADLINE: Moving From Wall Street to the Tech Sector Proves Tricky

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: As more financiers jump to the technology sector, some find that big investors are skeptical that they have what it takes to nurture a young company. 

 BODY:
When Vinicius Vacanti set out to make a pitch for a local deals start-up to investors, he figured he understood the process given his four years on Wall Street.
But minutes into his first meeting with a venture capitalist, Mr. Vacanti realized he would be rejected. The investor quickly pointed out the flaws, including the site's lack of users. As Mr. Vacanti rode the bus back to New York from Boston, he considered scrapping the project and starting over.
"The skills you build on Wall Street don't correlate to a start-up," said Mr. Vacanti, 31, a founder of the daily deal aggregator Yipit, who previously worked at the private equity firms Blackstone Group and the Quadrangle Group. While some of those skills are useful, he said, "a couple of those are actually bad." 
As more financiers jump to the technology sector, some are finding that their background, typically considered an asset in the corporate world, can be a liability. Some do not know how to write computer code. Others are ill-prepared for the penny-pinching and frustration of start-up life. In short, they have trouble persuading the Silicon Valley establishment that they have what it takes to nurture a young company.
"We start a little skeptical of someone from a finance background," said Eric Paley of Founder Collective, the investor who declined to back Mr. Vacanti's original idea. "It's the lack of having to create something for a customer, find the market opportunity and persevere through it with very, very low economics."
The challenge has become particularly acute as big investors become more discerning with their money. While the technology scene has boomed in recent years, venture capitalists are showing signs of pulling back, especially after the struggles of Facebook, Groupon, Zynga and other former Internet darlings.
Last year, venture capitalists invested $1.78 billion in 302 deals in New York City. That compares with $2.27 billion in 317 deals in 2011, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, which use Thomson Reuters data.
"There's definitely fewer dollars available" for young companies that need an additional round of financing, said David Pakman, a New York-based partner at the venture capital firm Venrock. "Capital is tight and getting tighter."
For young Wall Street professionals contemplating a bleak job market, the lure of working at a start-up - with its cachet and prospects for riches - can be powerful. But many financiers are finding it difficult to make the switch.
When Evan Rose left his job at the hedge fund Dynamic Capital Management to start an online night life service, he did not know how to write code. At first, he tried to outsource the programming for the site to Web developers in India. But he had to throw out the final product. "It was pretty much gobbledygook," said Mr. Rose, 25.
After that, he started from scratch, learning to write code using Google and online forums. It took him a year to create the finished product.
When he eventually took the project to investors, he was excited about the idea, which he called an "OpenTable for night life." But the site, NiteFly, had a chilly reception. "Although to him it was a novel concept, we'd heard it before," said Kyle Widrick, a venture capitalist at Burch Creative Capital who heard the pitch.
To be taken seriously, Mr. Rose realized that he would need a deeper knowledge of the intended industry. So he abandoned NiteFly to work on a different start-up, eCruit, which aims to connect corporate recruiters to college students through online video conferences.
He worked with a human resources employee at a big bank, who used his contacts to attract recruiters to the service. With a seed investment from Ted Dintersmith, a partner emeritus at Charles River Ventures, eCruit is now planning its inaugural recruiting sessions for this year.
Some first-time entrepreneurs turn to mentorship programs like Y Combinator and TechStars to gain experience and tap into sources of financing.
Olga Vidisheva, the founder of the online fashion company Shoptiques, had a classic Wall Street background when she entered Y Combinator, having spent two years at Goldman Sachs before going to Harvard Business School. Two of her earliest investors were friends from Goldman, and her first employee came from the buyout firm Providence Equity Partners.
With no technical background, Ms. Vidisheva, 27, used the opportunity at Y Combinator to find a programmer. After the three-month-long program, she also ended up raising $2 million from prominent venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Benchmark Capital.
Only a handful of "Wall Street refugees" have gone through Y Combinator, said Paul Graham, a founder of the incubator, adding that the number of applicants from finance has been growing in the last couple of years. "What we like about them is they tend to be pretty fierce," Mr. Graham said. "You can point them at any problem, and if they don't know how to solve it, they'll figure out how to solve it and then solve it."
Others are trying to bring their Wall Street experience to the Web, rather than entering a completely new field.
Nick Sedlet, a former quantitative strategist at Goldman Sachs, and Elli Sharef, a former management consultant at McKinsey & Company, started HireArt, a site that connects qualified job seekers with employers. They modeled the program on the in-depth interview process at Goldman and McKinsey, which require applicants to tackle math and logic problems. Prospective employees might be asked to design a marketing campaign for a fitness start-up, or calculate the amount of capital that a chief executive should invest in new property.
"McKinsey and Goldman are two institutions that have really thought about how to assess people," said Mr. Sedlet, 27. "We saw a very easy way to make that methodology available online."
Keenly aware of the challenges of start-up life, Mr. Vacanti, of Yipit, now writes a blog chronicling his experiences and sometimes speaks at gatherings for young professionals considering a similar path. After the disappointing meeting in 2010, Mr. Vacanti took the investor's advice to heart and decided to "pivot," in tech parlance, moving from offering local discounts to aggregating daily deals from sites like Groupon. In 2010, Yipit raised $1.3 million from investors; in 2011, it raised $6 million.
Last March, in response to one of Mr. Vacanti's blog posts, Mr. Paley commented on their meeting. "Glad I could help," Mr. Paley wrote on Twitter. "Should have invested in the pivot!"

HEADLINE: Timothy Geithner's Legacy

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: A recent reunion at the Treasury Department underscored Timothy F. Geithner's successes in taming the financial crisis of 2008-9. 

 BODY:
NEARLY four years after we were enlisted to fight the financial and auto-industry crisis, a small band of Treasury veterans returned one recent evening to the department's imposing building in Washington, a neo-Classical-style structure bookended by statues of Alexander Hamilton and Albert Gallatin and a stone's throw from the White House.
The occasion was a reunion hosted by the departing Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to thank the now mostly dispersed recruits whose efforts had been central to saving the nation's financial system and, by extension, the economy. 
Tim, whose last day in the job is today, may have been the host, but in the minds of the 30 or so attendees, the reception was implicitly about his leadership. After all, it was his superb judgment, deep well of experience and extraordinary work ethic that ultimately extinguished the conflagration of 2007-9.
As we mingled over cocktails and canapés in the ornate Diplomatic Reception Room, the mood was mostly relaxed, a sharp contrast to the fear and occasional moments of near panic that had pervaded the building four years earlier.

In those early days, the financial system was near collapse as banks struggled to finance themselves, the stock market hit repeated new lows, and each dawn seemed to bring only fresh terrors.
Tim and his team methodically chipped away at the dizzying array of challenges as they faced skepticism in the markets and criticism from all fronts. As I watched the group at work, the familiar lines from Tennyson - "cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them" - reverberated through my head.
Conservatives brayed that government should stay out of the private sector; liberals bleated for nationalizing the banks. Fortunately, Tim kept his head while all around him, others were losing theirs.
After a round of handshakes and hugs as we became reacquainted, the remarks commenced. As happens at most celebratory events, each speaker began with a mix of anecdotes and humor. But at this one, every speaker concluded with a deadly serious reiteration of the importance of the work that we had done and an expression of gratitude for the sacrifices, personal and professional, that were made.
The rhythms in the room shifted with the speakers: lighthearted during the telling of anecdotes, self-satisfied at having proved the naysayers wrong, and somber as each of us reflected back on that extraordinary period of our recent history.
I stood a bit apart, as my job - leading the 14-member task force to rescue the auto industry team - seemed, in hindsight, easy compared with the work of others. Mostly unencumbered by the need to deal with Congress or other agencies, our task force was able to operate much like a private-sector firm, reporting every day or so to Tim and our other boss, Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist who was then the head of President Obama's National Economic Council.
I barely knew Tim when he asked me to join him at the Treasury Department. We never developed a social friendship. But I quickly realized why his depth of experience and straightforward manner inspired such loyalty and respect.
Tim had slid into the Treasury seat after a grueling tenure as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a time marked by the crash of the housing market in 2007, which tipped the national economy into recession by the end of that year.
Like most others, economic experts in President George W. Bush's administration and at the Federal Reserve had been late in recognizing the magnitude of the problem, which quickly spread to engulf some of the country's largest financial institutions. But as we now know from recently released transcripts of the Fed's policy arm, Tim was ahead of many of his colleagues at the Fed in calling for action.
"I believe the arguments work in favor of doing more now rather than less," he said at a September 2007 meeting of the policy body, known as the Federal Open Market Committee.
Fifteen months later, Tim had left the Fed for the new president's cabinet, and the early reviews were tough. He had spent most of his career as the consummately capable, technocratic inside player - earning his stripes at the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration and then working at the International Monetary Fund. His boyish looks and low-key manner didn't immediately inspire confidence.
And much of the country was understandably furious about the bank bailouts (even though they ultimately produced a profit for taxpayers). In retrospect, perhaps more could have been done to penalize the management and stakeholders of the financial institutions.
But unlike General Motors and Chrysler, the banks did not have an organized bankruptcy or other forced restructuring mechanism available to them, because of the intricate and interlocking obligations of the financial system.
In addition, policy makers under Presidents Bush and Obama had agreed that a financial rescue, on reasonable terms, was needed to help the banks rebuild their capital positions.
To be sure, Tim's successes were not unalloyed. With limits to his authority and the toxic political environment, his team was not able to do much to ameliorate the housing collapse or to untangle the two collapsed mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the hands of Congress, the needed overhaul of financial regulation became an unwieldy mess; the 398 separate regulations required by Dodd-Frank will ultimately be judged to go well beyond what was needed. Of course, the problems of high unemployment and slow growth remain worrisome.
But as Tim stood before us that winter evening, we all thought back to the financial crisis and how thoroughly he had been vindicated by its denouement. Tim would never gloat; characteristically, he stuck to the high road, praising his team and thanking the members for their service.
Leaving the reception, I walked past the portraits of previous Treasury secretaries that line the building's wide hallways and mused about how history would assess Tim. Near great? Without a doubt. Great? Certainly warranted, in my estimation.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: On the Front

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
The days of serving unacknowledged on the front lines of war are coming to an end for many soldiers: The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it would lift its official ban on women serving in combat roles. Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker write that the move will open up hundreds of thousands of jobs for women in the armed forces because combat roles are seen as crucial to career advancement. 
Now that the House has passed a bill to waive the country's borrowing limit until May without requiring offsetting spending cuts -- a measure that the Senate could take up and pass as early as next week -- lawmakers' attention now turns to a partisan fight over across-the-board spending cuts and a possible government shutdown in March, Jonathan Weisman writes.
Senate leaders are expected to announce new rules on Thursdayaimed at curbing use of the filibusterto stall or kill legislation or presidential nominations. Jeremy W. Peters explains that Republicans have tentatively agreed to a framework for changes that would speed up procedure in the Senate in exchange for a concession from Democrats on allowing amendments to bills once they reach the floor.
Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia has become a barometer among his colleagues on gun control, testing just how far lawmakers might be able to go without angering voters. Mr. Peters writes that the path to any new gun laws has to come through West Virginia and a dozen other states represented by Democrats in the Senate.
Summing up Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's long-awaited testimony before Congress about the Sept. 11 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, Michael Gordon writes while she explained what the State Department was doing to protect diplomats since the attack, she did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available to respond.
The surprisingly poor returns for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections this week have left him weakened and have set the stage for improvements in the chilly relationship between the Israeli leader and President Obama, Mark Landler writes.
 Around the Web: 
Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, are headed to Washington on Friday for a reception in their honor, according to The National Journal. They will also attend the Alfalfa Club dinner on Saturday, CNN reported.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic data expected today includes weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 a.m. by leading economic indicators for December and weekly mortgage rates.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing on Senator John Kerry's nomination to be secretary of state at 10 a.m.
Simultaneously, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will meet to discuss the country's mental health system.
At 11 a.m., members of Congress and a coalition of mayors, law enforcement officers, gun safety organizations and other groups will hold a news conference to introduce legislation on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition-feeding devices.
At 1:45 p.m., Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will participate in a live videoconference about the administration's efforts to curb gun violence. The conversation will be hosted by Google+ and streamed live at http://whitehouse.gov.
At 4:35 p.m., Mr. Obama will meet with Secretary Clinton.

HEADLINE: Mary Jo White's Greatest Hits

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mary Jo White, President Obama's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, brings experience as both a prosecutor and a defense lawyer. Here are some of her most memorable cases. 

 BODY:
Mary Jo White, President Obama's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, brings experience as both a prosecutor and a defense lawyer.
A partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, she has defended some of the biggest Wall Street names. But as the United States attorney in Manhattan, she went after a Japanese bank for fraud. Here are some of her most memorable cases:
 Defense Lawyer 
 2012: N.F.L | Ms. White was hired by the N.F.L. to look into allegations that the New Orleans Saints carried out a bounty system for hurting opponents.
 2010-2012: JPMorgan Chase | Ms. White represented JPMorgan Chase in cases stemming from the financial crisis.
2011: News Corporation | Independent directors of the media company hired Ms. White amid a phone-hacking scandal.
2010: Kenneth Lewis | Ms. White represented Bank of America's former chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, when he was sued by the New York attorney general. Mr. Lewis was accused of defrauding investors in the bank's acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
2008: Siemens | Siemens paid $1.6 billion to resolve a federal bribery investigation. The German company had retained Ms. White to conduct an internal investigation.
2007: HCA | Ms. White represented the hospital chain HCA in an investigation by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department into whether Senator Bill Frist violated insider trading laws when he sold his stake in the company. The investigation was closed with no charges filed.
2005: Morgan Stanley | Ms. White was retained by the board of Morgan Stanley to vet John J. Mack for the job of chief executive. She attracted some controversy in that role, when she sought information from the director of enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
2004: Tommy Hilfiger | Ms. White represented the clothing company as it was being investigated for possible tax violations.
 Prosecutor 
2002: Presidential Pardons | When Ms. White stepped down as United States attorney, she left behind an unfinished investigation into whether there was any wrongdoing in President Bill Clinton's 177 final pardons and commutations.
2002: Campaign Finance | Ms. White wrapped up a three-year investigation into campaign contributions to Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, deciding not to file charges.
2001: United States Embassies in Africa | Four followers of Osama bin Laden were convicted for their roles in the bombing of American embassies in Africa in 1998. Over all, Ms. White's office announced 10 criminal indictments of bin Laden and his followers.
2001: Los Angeles International Airport | Ms. White's office won the conviction of an Algerian man in a plot to blow up the airport.
1999: Financial Fraud | Patrick R. Bennett was convicted in a financial scheme that prosecutors said cheated investors out of nearly $700 million.
1996: Jetliner Plot | Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was convicted in a failed plot to blow up a number of American jetliners as they flew over the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Yousef was also convicted the following year for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
1995: Daiwa Bank | Ms. White announced the indictment of the Japanese firm Daiwa Bank, forcing it to close its operations in the United States. The bank was accused of illegally covering up $1.1 billion in trading losses.
1993: United Nations Plot | Ms. White's office prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind Egyptian cleric, in connection with a plot to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks. Mr. Abdel Rahman and nine others were convicted in 1995.
1993: World Trade Center Bombing | The year she took office as the United States attorney in Manhattan, Ms. White oversaw a prosecution stemming from the Feb. 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center. That resulted in four convictions the following year.
1992: John Gotti | As the chief assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Ms. White led the successful prosecution against John Gotti, who was convicted of murder and racketeering.

HEADLINE: Video of Kerry's Confirmation Hearing

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Senator John Kerry returns to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to answer questions at his confirmation hearing as secretary of state. 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts, returns Thursday morning to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he was once the chairman, to answer questions at his confirmation hearing as secretary of state. 
In his prepared testimony, Mr. Kerry told the Foreign Relations Committee that "foreign policy is economic policy." 
"I would add that I'm particularly aware that in many ways the greatest challenge to America's foreign policy will be in your hands, not mine," he said. "Because while it's often said that we can't be strong at home if we're not strong in the world, in these days of fiscal crisis, and as a recovering member of the supercommittee, I am especially cognizant of the fact that we can't be strong in the world unless we are strong at home - and the first priority of business which will affect my credibility as a diplomat working to help other countries create order, is whether America at last puts its own fiscal house in order."
Mr. Kerry was nominated by President Obama to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton, who gave testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Inside A.I.G.'s Decision Not to Sue

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A.I.G.'s lawyers warned the board about the dangers of joining a lawsuit against the government, a court filing shows. | Court documents shed new light on what bankers knew at the height of the housing bubble. | Goldman Sachs won a legal fight over its role in the doomed sale of Dragon Systems to Lernout &#038; Hauspie. | Neel T. Kashkari is planning to run for government office. 

 BODY:
It was not just lawmakers and taxpayers who expressed concern when the board of the American International Group met this month to consider joining a lawsuit against the government agencies that rescued the insurer during the financial crisis. The company's lawyers, too, delivered a stark warning to the board, with one saying the lawsuit had only a 20 percent chance of success, according to a letter filed on Wednesday.
 The directors also worried that joining the lawsuit could harm A.I.G.'s reputation, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. The lawsuit, which was brought by the insurer's former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, and the firm he now runs, Starr International, "threatened to destroy much of the good work that A.I.G. and its employees had done rebuilding A.I.G. and its name and reputation," the directors feared, according to the letter by Paul Curnin, the lawyer who advised A.I.G. The directors also learned that at least one state insurance regulator had called to urge them not to join the case, the letter says. 
A 'NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST' ASSET, CREATED BY MORGAN STANLEY | Documents released in a lawsuit shed new light on what bankers knew at the height of the housing bubble and how they used that knowledge, Jesse Eisinger writes in DealBook. The case centers on a $500 million collateralized debt obligation created in the first half of 2006 that Morgan Stanley sold to a Chinese bank - an asset that employees, in e-mail, jokingly referred to as "Subprime Meltdown," "Hitman" and "Nuclear Holocaust." The documents raise a larger concern, that "people across the bank understood that the American housing market was in trouble," Mr. Eisinger writes. "They took advantage of that knowledge to create and then bet against securities and then also to unload garbage investments on unsuspecting buyers."
"Bankers were getting information from fellow employees conducting and receiving private assessments of the quality of the mortgages that the bank would purchase to back securities. These reports weren't available to the public. It would be crucial information for trading in securities backed by those kinds of mortgages." Morgan Stanley, for its part, contends that the buyers of the asset were sophisticated, that the firm disclosed its strategy and that any shorting of the deal was part of a larger array of trades.
GOLDMAN CLEARED OVER SALE GONE WRONG | Goldman Sachs emerged victorious on Wednesday from a legal fight over its role in the doomed sale of Dragon Systems to Lernout & Hauspie for $580 million. A federal jury in Boston found that the investment bank was not negligent in arranging the deal, which went awry 13 years ago when the buyer collapsed in a huge accounting fraud, Reuters reports. The plaintiffs, including Dragon's founders, Jim and Janet Baker, had sought several hundred million dollars in damages.
Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, received word of the verdict in Davos, Switzerland, where he showed up sporting a beard, according to Lionel Barber of The Financial Times.
ON THE AGENDA | Among the companies reporting earnings on Thursday evening are Microsoft, AT&T, E*Trade Financial and Starbucks. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m. Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs's president, is on Bloomberg TV at 11 a.m. Glenn Hutchins of Silver Lake, the firm discussing a possible buyout of Dell, is on CNBC at 11:10 a.m. The chief executive of Citigroup, Michael L. Corbat, appears on CNBC at 3 p.m.
IN SHORT: NEW PAPER FROM RESEARCH AGENCY | The Office of Financial Research, an agency created under the Dodd-Frank law to monitor risks to the financial system, has released a paper on bank stability. It's called "CoCos, Bail-In, and Tail Risk."
KASHKARI PLANS A RETURN TO PUBLIC SERVICE | The man who was the initial overseer of the Treasury Department's bank bailout program, Neel T. Kashkari, is planning to leave his job at Pimco to run for government office. "As much as I have enjoyed my time at Pimco, I feel an obligation and a desire to serve my community through public service," Mr. Kashkari said in a statement. Mr. Kashkari, who would run as a Republican, has created a Web page outlining his ideas. DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes: "Running for office would take Mr. Kashkari into perhaps his most public role since the financial crisis, when he gained attention for his role as the Treasury Department's interim assistant secretary for financial stability. A former Goldman Sachs employee, he was only 35 at the time, with six years of experience in finance and government." He was nicknamed "the $700 billion man" in reference to his work on the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

HEADLINE: The Great Migration

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
One of the features of the Obama years is that we get to witness an enormous race, which you might call the race between meritocracy and government. On the one side, there is the meritocracy, which widens inequality. On the other side, there is President Obama's team of progressives, who are trying to mitigate inequality. The big question is: Which side is winning?
First, there is our system of higher education, which is like a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks up some of the smartest people from across the country and concentrates them in a few privileged places. 
Smart high school students from rural Nebraska, small-town Ohio and urban Newark get to go to good universities. When they get there they often find a culture shock.
They've been raised in an atmosphere of social equality and now find themselves in a culture that emphasizes the relentless quest for distinction -- to be more accomplished, more enlightened and more cutting edge. They may have been raised in a culture that emphasizes roots, but they go into a culture that emphasizes mobility -- a multicultural cosmopolitanism that encourages you to go anywhere on your quest for self-fulfillment. They may have been raised among people who enter the rooms of the mighty with the nerves of a stranger, but they are now around people who enter the highest places with the confident sense they belong.
But the system works. In the dorms, classrooms, summer internships and early jobs they learn how to behave the way successful people do in the highly educated hubs. There's no economic reason to return home, and maybe it's not even socially possible anymore.
The highly educated cluster around a few small nodes. Decade after decade, smart and educated people flock away from Merced, Calif., Yuma, Ariz., Flint, Mich., and Vineland, N.J. In those places, less than 15 percent of the residents have college degrees. They flock to Washington, Boston, San Jose, Raleigh-Durham and San Francisco. In those places, nearly 50 percent of the residents have college degrees.
As Enrico Moretti writes in ''The New Geography of Jobs,'' the magnet places have positive ecologies that multiply innovation, creativity and wealth. The abandoned places have negative ecologies and fall further behind.
This sorting is self-reinforcing, and it seems to grow more unforgiving every year. One small study caught my eye. Robert Oprisko of Butler University found that half of the jobs in university political science programs went to graduates of the top 11 schools. That is to say, if you have a Ph.D. from Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and so on, your odds of getting a job are very good. If you earned your degree from one of the other 100 degree-granting universities, your odds are not. These other 100 schools don't even want to hire the sort of graduates they themselves produce. They want the elite credential.
Barack Obama (Occidental, Columbia, Harvard) benefited from this sorting system. So did his wife (Princeton, Harvard). So did most people in his administration. So did many people who read this newspaper and many of us who write for it.
Members of the administration have worked reasonably hard to mitigate the inequality that their own rise has produced. They've worked reasonably hard to redistribute money from the rich people in the magnet areas to the poorer people in the flight areas. For example, the health care law increases taxes on the top 1 percent by about $20,000 per household. It increases benefits for the working class by between $400 and $800 per household. The recent tax increases will do more of the same.
The first problem with the effort is that it's like shooting a water gun into a waterfall. The Obama measures, earned after a great deal of political pain, simply aren't significant enough to counteract the underlying trends.
The second problem is the focus on income redistribution. Recently, there's been far more talk about tax increases than any other subject. But the income disparities are a downstream effect of the human capital and geographic disparities. Pumping a few dollars into San Joaquin, Calif., where 2.9 percent of the residents have bachelor's degrees and 20.6 percent have high school degrees, may ease suffering, but it won't alter the dynamic.
The final problem is that, in an effort to reduce the economic concentration of power, the administration is concentrating political power in Washington. If the problem is that talent is fleeing blighted localities, it's hard to see how you make that better if decision-making and resources are concentrated faraway in the nation's capital.
This is not to make a partisan point. The Republicans do not have a better approach. It's simply to say that the liberal agenda is not very good at addressing the inequality problem it seeks to solve. The meritocracy is overwhelming the liberal project.

HEADLINE: As California Bounces Back, Governor Calls For Lofty Goals

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- Emboldened by a brighter fiscal horizon, Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday recommitted himself to two ambitious projects, a high-speed rail line and a huge water tunnel system, in an optimistic State of the State speech that sought to secure California's long-term future as well as the three-term governor's legacy.
Grasping at California's vision of itself as a land of opportunity and a model for the rest of the nation, Mr. Brown said the state was rebounding financially after a difficult period. In a speech citing sources as varied as the Bible, Montaigne and Yeats, Mr. Brown said the state's budget was now sound, but he also warned of profligacy, a remark that seemed directed at the Democratic lawmakers listening to him in the State Capitol here. 
''The message this year is clear: California has once again confounded our critics. We have wrought in just two years a solid and enduring budget,'' Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said in his third State of the State address since returning to office in 2011. ''Against those who take pleasure, singing of our demise, California did the impossible.''
Mr. Brown spoke of wanting to reform school financing by empowering local school districts, and of continuing to lead efforts to fight climate change, like the cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions that went into effect recently.
Recalling the big infrastructure projects in the state's past, Mr. Brown also voiced strong support for two big-ticket items that have drawn strong opposition: a bullet train that would eventually link Los Angeles and the Bay Area, and two tunnels that would funnel water directly from Northern California to more populated areas in the south.
''The London Olympics lasted a short while and cost $14 billion, about the same cost as this project,'' he said of the tunnels. ''But this project will serve California for hundreds of years.''
Mr. Brown's speech came at what many are describing as a turning point for California after years of economic turmoil. The state's economy is continuing to show signs of strengthening, with job growth and a housing market revival.
Fiscally, after years of ballooning budget deficits, the state is now projecting a balanced budget. In November, Mr. Brown surprised many by winning a hard-fought campaign to pass Proposition 30, a temporary tax surcharge that will pour $6 billion a year into the state treasury for the next seven years.
Still, Mr. Brown has repeatedly warned about the need to control spending. With Democrats now having supermajorities in the Senate and the Assembly, they can pass tax increases unilaterally. As experts predict that Democratic legislators will face pressure to increase spending, many are now describing Mr. Brown, long known as ''Governor Moonbeam'' for his eccentricities, as the only adult in the room.
Citing the story of Genesis and Pharaoh's dream of seven cows, he said: ''The people have given us seven years of extra taxes. Let us follow the wisdom of Joseph, pay down our debts and store up reserves against the leaner times that will surely come.''
In interviews, Mr. Brown, who served two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983, has brushed aside talk of his legacy. But in recent months, Mr. Brown, 74, who was treated recently for prostate cancer, has spoken about his mortality, mentioning the death of a close friend.
''This is my 11th year in the job, and I have never been more excited,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Assembly Leader Softens Stance Toward Casinos

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY - Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Thursday that he was open to a Las Vegas-style casino in some parts of New York City, as he continued to soften his opposition to the idea of casino development within the five boroughs.
Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he remained opposed to a casino with table games in Manhattan, but would be open to the idea in other areas of the city, specifically naming Coney Island and Willets Point, as well as the Aqueduct racetrack - sites that he has reportedly been considering for some time. 
He also said Thursday that the Legislature wanted to have a say in the siting of any full-scale casinos, challenging a plan by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to put the power in the hands of a new gambling commission.
"The Legislature would like to have a role in geographic selection," he said in comments outside his Albany office.
Mr. Silver has historically been the biggest opponent of casino gambling in New York City, and has been reluctant to consider casino development even on the city's fringes. But his tone has been moderating over the last several months.
"I don't believe densely populated areas of the state should have a casino," Mr. Silver said. "I don't believe that people should be able to go on their lunch hour and have the ability to lose a week or a month's pay on their lunch hour, so we should look at destinations that are not in densely populated areas."
"There are parts of the city that would qualify for that," he added. "Manhattan would not, for example. Central Brooklyn would not. Central Queens would not. But there are places that can qualify as destinations within the city, whether it's Willets Point or Aqueduct or Coney Island."
There are already nine racetrack slot parlors and five tribal casinos in New York. State lawmakers, acting at Mr. Cuomo's urging, last year took the first step toward asking voters to allow up to seven full-scale, nontribal casinos in the state; the Legislature will consider the matter again this year, and if a measure passes, it will go before voters in November.
Mr. Cuomo said this month that he would propose phasing in expanded gambling, at first allowing the development of only three casinos, none of them in New York City, in an effort to lift the upstate economy. He has not said where he thinks casinos should be located after that first phase.
The casino industry has been eager to develop in New York because of its large population, concentrated wealth and high level of tourism. A slot parlor at the Aqueduct racetrack has already proved to be highly lucrative, both for the state and its operator; a full-scale casino would bring table games and even more revenue.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been resistant to the idea of a casino in New York City, but his third term ends this year, and he will most likely be out of office by the time the matter is decided.
Last year, Mr. Silver said of casino development: "I would prefer to stay out of the city, but certainly at best the fringes of the city, in order to avoid the social ills that come with casino gaming. I'm not a fan of casino gaming, and I think generally our conference is not a fan of casino gaming."
But on Thursday, he seemed much more at ease with the idea of a casino in the city.
"I mentioned Willets Point because it's basically a bunch of junkyards right now, and there's some talk of revitalizing it," he said.
"Aqueduct is again something that's not in the densely populated part of the city, Coney Island has a tradition of being a resort area to some extent; obviously it needs some revitalization to do it, but I say I wouldn't rule those out."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Benefit Applications Fall to 5-Year Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in five years, evidence that employers were cutting fewer jobs and may step up hiring. 
The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly unemployment benefit applications dropped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 330,000. That is the fewest since January 2008.
The four-week average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure, fell to 351,750. That is also the lowest in nearly five years.
The decline may reflect the government's difficulty adjusting its numbers to account for layoffs after the holiday shopping season. Layoffs spike in the second week of January and then plummet. The department seeks to adjust for those seasonal trends, but the figures can still be volatile.
If the trend holds up, fewer applications would suggest that the job market is improving.
''Encouraging news on the U.S. jobs front, even when you remove all of the noise,'' said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets. ''Weekly data are noisy, particularly at this time of year, so keep that in mind.''
Applications are a proxy for layoffs. They have fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 for most of last year. At the same time, employers added an average of 153,000 jobs a month. That has just been enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points last year to 7.8 percent in December. The government will issue its January employment report at the end of next week.
The number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits is also falling. Nearly 5.7 million people were receiving unemployment aid in the week ended Jan. 5, the latest data available. That is down from almost 5.9 million in the previous week.
Separately, a measure of the American economy intended to signal future activity increased in December from November, suggesting growth might strengthen in early 2013.
The Conference Board said on Thursday that its index of leading indicators rose 0.5 percent in December, the best showing since September. In November, the index was unchanged.
The gauge is meant to forecast economic conditions three to six months out.
A decline in applications for unemployment benefits, stock market gains on Wall Street and increases in applications for building permits drove the index higher in December.
Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said the rebound in the leading indicators suggested an improving outlook, in contrast to a few months ago when the expectations were not so optimistic.
''Housing, which has long been a drag, has turned into a positive for growth, and will help improve consumer balance sheets and strengthen consumption,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''However, for growth to gain more traction we also need to see better performance on new orders and an acceleration in capital spending.''

Previews and Openings
'All in the Timing' (in previews; opens on Feb. 12) Fresh from his well-reviewed Broadway production of ''A Christmas Story, the Musical,'' John Rando directs the 20th-anniversary revival of this collection of six one-act comedies in which David Ives brings his playful perspective and wizardry with language to matters romantic and existential. The cast for the Primary Stages production includes Jenn Harris, Carson Elrod and Matthew Saldivar. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (David Rooney) 
'All the Rage' (opens on Wednesday) Martin Moran won an Obie Award in 2004 for ''The Tricky Part,'' based on his own memoir about persevering after suffering sexual abuse as a child. The intervening years have apparently provided Mr. Moran and his ''Tricky Part'' director, Seth Barrish, with enough material for another autobiographical solo show and then some. Among the topics included here: political asylum, a Las Vegas funeral, the origins of man, South Africa and a furious stepmother. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Eric Grode)
'Clive' (in previews; opens on Feb. 7) After directing Jonathan Marc Sherman's ''Things We Want'' for the New Group, Ethan Hawke reunites with that playwright and company to stage this premiere inspired by Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal.'' Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D'Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Fiorello!' (opens on Wednesday) Has it really been 19 years since City Center's Encores! series began poking around in the less familiar corners of the Broadway musical canon, unearthing underrated gems like ''One Touch of Venus,'' ''Juno'' and ''Chicago''? The series begins its 20th season by revisiting its first production, the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1959 ode to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York. (Not so coincidentally, he is credited with saving City Center from the wrecking ball.) Danny Rutigliano stars in the title role, and Shuler Hensley and Emily Skinner are among his co-stars. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'Isaac's Eye' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Feb. 9) It's ''Amadeus'' with optics! Once again an enterprising playwright (Lucas Hnath, in this case) has attempted to look at centuries-old culture by having a young genius (and partly named title character) do battle with an older contemporary, rising to far greater notoriety when all is said and done. It worked for Mozart, and now it's Isaac Newton's turn, with the scientist Robert Hooke filling in as the embittered eminence destined to relative obscurity. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Grode)
'Katie Roche' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 25) To the extent that New York theatergoers know anything about the 20th-century Irish playwright Teresa Deevy, it is because of the Mint Theater. The enterprising theater, which is also publishing two volumes of her writings, wraps up its three-play Deevy retrospective with this 1936 drama about a wildly ambitious servant girl. The Abbey Theater brought it to America in 1937, but this is the first American production. The Mint's artistic director, Jonathan Bank, directs once again. 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'Luck of the Irish' (previews start on Monday; opens on Feb. 11) Kirsten Greenidge made a splash in 2011 with her Obie Award-winning play ''Milk Like Sugar,'' about teenage pregnancy. Her new play may sound familiar to ''Clybourne Park'' fans; it also looks at race relations, filtered through the eyes of black and white inhabitants of the same house over multiple generations. Ms. Greenidge's play is about the tensions that rise when an Irish family, which is paid to ''ghost buy'' a house in an all-white Boston neighborhood for a black family in the 1950s, comes back to claim the house. Her ''Milk'' director, Rebecca Taichman, returns for this one. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Grode)
'Moose Murders' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) Last year saw high-profile New York productions of ''Carrie'' and ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' two bombs of the 1980s. Now it's time for this one-performance debacle, which sent critics running for their thesauruses to describe scenes like the one in which a mummified paraplegic rises from his wheelchair to kick a guy in the groin. Oh, and the guy is wearing a moose costume. The one who is kicked, not the paraplegic. Anyway, it's back, courtesy of the Beautiful Soup Theater Collective. One worrisome note: The playwright, Arthur Bicknell, ''has significantly rewritten and revised 'Moose Murders' for this new production.'' What's the fun in that? Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (888) 718-4253, beautifulsoup.showclix.com. (Grode)
'Really Really' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 19) The premise of the play sounds less than groundbreaking: College pals turn on one another after a boozy party. But this new play by Paul Downs Colaizzo has plenty going for it, including a good track record (it was a smash for the Signature Theater in Washington last year), TV darlings in the cast (Zosia Mamet of ''Girls,'' Matt Lauria of ''Friday Night Lights'') and, most intriguing of all, the infinitely resourceful director David Cromer (''Tribes,'' ''Our Town''). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)
'Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella' (previews start on Friday; opens on March 3) The 1957 television musical of ''Cinderella'' was a runaway smash and almost immediately began spawning stage incarnations, starring Eartha Kitt, Everett Quinton and Jean Stapleton (though they weren't cast in the title role). But this staging is the property's first appearance on Broadway, complete with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane (''Sister Act,'' ''The Little Dog Laughed'') and four fairly obscure songs added from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog. Laura Osnes stars as Cinderella, and she is surrounded by a formidable trio of scene stealers: Harriet Harris, Victoria Clark and Ann Harada. Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' (in previews; opens on Feb. 9) Every time a new jukebox assembly appears, musical theater purists complain that the form is being dumbed down into elaborate karaoke. The creators of this show thumb their noses at such charges. This immersive experience allows audiences to time-travel through the 1980s and '90s and back to the present, joining the party of celebrity excess and pop mash-up. (Saturdays only.) Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rooney)
'The Vandal' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Since wrapping up his sitcom role on ''The New Adventures of Old Christine,'' Hamish Linklater has impressed on New York stages in ''Seminar'' and ''School for Lies.'' He follows other actors who have recently ventured into playwriting, like Jesse Eisenberg, Zach Braff and Zoe Kazan, with this enigmatic encounter between a woman and a boy who swap stories one cold night at a Kingston, N.Y., bus stop. Jim Simpson directs a cast that includes Zach Grenier, Deirdre O'Connell and Noah Robbins. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Rooney)
'Women of Will' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 3) Quick: How many of William Shakespeare's title characters are women? The answer is three, though Juliet, Cressida and Cleopatra each have to share the marquee with a guy. By comparison, four different Henrys alone warrant title billing. Tina Packer, the founding artistic director of Shakespeare & Company in Massachusetts, looks to rectify this imbalance with her 15-years-in-the-making exploration of the Shakespearean canon through the eyes of his female characters. Nigel Gore stars with Ms. Packer, but expect the focus to be on Beatrice, Portia, Viola, Lady Macbeth and many other women.

Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' A four-alarm urgency infuses Scarlett Johansson's performance in Rob Ashford's oxygen-starved revival of Tennessee Williams's 1955 drama of sex and lies. If Ms. Johansson is oddly un-feline as Maggie the Cat, she sure has presence. The rest of the cast, including Benjamin Walker and Ciaran Hinds, gets lost in the heavy atmospherics (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow and -- aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Other Place' Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White's clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life -- disloyal husband (Daniel Stern), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) -- threatens to implode. Joe Mantello's nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood)
'Picnic' A torso stars in Sam Gold's stultifying revival of William Inge's time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms. Those being stirred include Maggie Grace, Elizabeth Marvel, Ellen Burstyn and the excellent Mare Winningham (2:05). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bare' Stafford Arima directs this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Bethany' A single mother (the terrific America Ferrera) fights to win back custody of her child -- lost to foster care when she became homeless -- in Laura Marks's smart, compassionate play, featuring a fine supporting cast and sensitive direction by Gaye Taylor Upchurch (1:30). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Le Cid' When Rodrigue's father is insulted, Rodrigue must seek vengeance. Inconveniently, his target happens to be his future father-in-law. It is the original Corneillian dilemma, named for this 1636 play by Pierre Corneille, of a choice between honor and love. The infatuations with face-saving veer from the tragic to the comic, usually by design. An uneven cast struggles with some of the meatier roles, but the rarely produced masterwork is still worth seeing (1:55). Theater of the Church of Notre Dame, 405 West 114th Street, at Morningside Drive, Morningside Heights, (212) 868-4444, stormtheatre.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'In Acting Shakespeare' What began as an homage to Ian McKellen's one-man show ''Acting Shakespeare'' has become a boisterous, agreeable and somewhat glib tale of acting Shakespeare. The eager-to-please James DeVita charts his progress from histrionics to honesty, interwoven with bits of Shakespeare biography and plenty of dog-eared soliloquies (1:45). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)
'The Jammer' Rolin Jones's thin comic strip of a play finds a humble Everyman from Brooklyn (the fine Patch Darragh) leaving behind his beloved girl to chase a dream of becoming a roller derby star (1:30).

'Life and Times: Episodes 1-4' An epic journey through the life of a young woman growing up in Rhode Island, as recollected at Wagnerian length in the disjointed, disorganized language of everyday speech. (The script is a literal transcription of several phone conversations.) Pavol Liska and Kelly Copper, directors of the Nature Theater of Oklahoma, have created a magnum opus that seeks to transform trivial material into magical theater. They more or less succeed, though only those with affection for endurance-test theater will leave cheering rather than exhausted (Episode 1: 3:15; Episode 2: 2:00; Episode 3 and 4: 2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Not by Bread Alone' This singular touring production from the Nalagaat Theater of Israel is performed entirely by deaf and blind actors. Directed by Adina Tal, the show is strongest when its cast members describe the sensory content of their lives. The flashier diversions (slapstick, dance, comic vignettes) cater bluntly to a hearing and seeing audience (1:30). New York University Skirball Center, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org. (Brantley)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Suit' Devastation by enchantment, courtesy of the great director Peter Brook and the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord. Even as it draws you in like the gregarious host of a spirited party, this simply told tale of adultery in apartheid South Africa is quietly preparing to break your heart. Four actors and three musicians make beautiful magic together (1:15). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Water by the Spoonful' Quiara Alegría Hudes's moving collage of lives in crisis, the 2012 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the second part of a trilogy centering on the Ortiz family. Elliot (the fine Armando Riesco), a former Marine injured in Iraq, struggles with the loss of the aunt who raised him and a tempestuous reconnection with the ex-crack-addict mother who abandoned him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
Off Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)

Last Chance
'Evita' (closes on Saturday) This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'The Fig Leaves Are Falling' (closes on Saturday) This musical about infidelity in suburbia, with a book and lyrics by Allan Sherman (he of ''Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh''), flopped on Broadway in 1969 but has been revived in a crisp production by UnsungMusicalsCo. Despite some exceptional singing and smooth choreography, this chronicle of a ''Mad Men''-era executive's temptation by his young secretary disappoints because of the weak source material (1:15). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, unsungmusicals.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Job' (closes on Monday) The professionally confrontational Thomas Bradshaw (''Burning'') revisits the Old Testament's most famously afflicted figure in this short, sharp and joltingly funny work, which lets us see a familiar tale through wise virgin eyes. Benjamin H. Kamine ably steers a bright young cast through Mr. Bradshaw's unsparingly graphic vision of heaven and earth (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Brantley)
'Midsummer [a play with songs]' (closes on Saturday) Though it sometimes pretends not to be, David Greig's lively two-character show is a full-fledged rom-com, in which a mismatched couple (Matthew Pidgeon and Cora Bissett) tumble from bed into adventure and finally into love on the streets of rainy Edinburgh. It's a proper date play, executed with theatrical ingenuity (1:30). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Seagull (Thinking of You)' (closes on Saturday) Tina Satter's present-tense riff on an immortal Chekhov drama blurs all possible boundaries (between actors and their roles, reality and fiction, parody and sincerity) into a chic-looking puzzle of a production that recalls vintage Calvin Klein fragrance commercials. This show, part of Performance Space 122's Coil Festival, might be appropriately subtitled: ''Chekhov, the Perfume. Smell the Melancholy.'' New Ohio Theater, 143 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org. (Brantley)

Museums
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultra-minimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Go: a community-curated open studio project' (through Feb. 24) Inspired by ArtPrize, an art competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., that awards money to artists based on votes by the public and by local open-studios programs, the Brooklyn Museum created a contest in which the award was a spot in this exhibition. More than 1,800 artists registered with the museum; visitors went out to their studios and voted; and the Top 10 artists were whittled down to 5 by Brooklyn Museum curators. The results are less than stellar. ''Go'' has not unearthed any hidden masters of the borough, but it does raise questions about who should choose what appears in museums and what constitutes ''great'' art. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 17) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through April 14) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French Modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Ken Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Fantasy and Invention: Rosso Fiorentino and Sixteenth-Century Florentine Drawing' (through Feb. 3) With just under 30 works, including an unfinished Rosso painting on loan from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, a Rosso drawing from the Metropolitan Museum and a smattering of drawings and letters by other Italian masters in the Morgan's collection, this small exhibition is a fine little introduction to the eccentricities of Florentine Mannerism and to one of the style's quirkiest practitioners, who was lauded by Vasari as ''bold and well grounded in draftsmanship, graceful in manner, sublime in the highest flights of the imagination.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early Modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2012' (through Feb. 4) In her pellucid photographs, Anne Collier contemplates old record album covers and an Edward Weston photograph in an old MoMA date book. In montages by Michele Abeles we see the bodies of naked men through spaces between grids and stripes cut from other printed materials. Shirana Shahbazi's abstractions picture alluring colors and light of photography itself. Zoe Crosher recycles amateur snapshots by a woman who worked as an escort in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The two members of a team known as Birdhead use nondigital cameras and black-and-white film to shoot scenes in their hometown, Shanghai. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Feb. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (through March 10) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened the dynamite group exhibition ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. The latest edition, ''Fore'' -- organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax -- covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- is familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s.

&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Feb. 9) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way.

Paul Laffoley: 'The Boston Visionary Cell' (through March 9) Judging by his mandala-type compositions on usually square canvases, Mr. Laffoley has yet to encounter a system of mystical thought he could not absorb into his own project. Profusely annotated with press-on vinyl letters, his works refer to a dizzying array of mental adventurers from Socrates to the Theosophist charlatan Madam Blavatsky. This show is an excellent introduction to one of the most unusual creative minds of our time. Kent Fine Art, 210 West 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 365-9500, kentfineart.net. (Johnson)
'Cellblock I' and 'Cellblock II' (through Feb. 2) This pair of strenuously cerebral group shows, both organized by the scholar Robert Hobbs, envision the artwork as a kind of prison (formalist and otherwise). ''Cellblock I,'' in the main gallery, includes large paintings by Peter Halley, plans for underground mazes by Alice Aycock, works from Robert Motherwell's ''Open'' series and Kelley Walker's canvases printed with images of brick walls. The livelier ''Cellblock II,'' in the gallery's new project space down the street, gathers smaller works by some of the same artists in ''Cellblock I,'' along with others like Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman and Nancy Holt. Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
John A. Parks: 'Paint and Memory' (through Feb. 16) The strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on the artist's childhood memories and painted with his fingers. The loosely Pointillist, somewhat Vuillardian hazes of color, light and form that result demarcate trees, gardens, brick buildings, puffy clouds and, above all, scrambling children, whose feral energy and natural subversiveness are vividly conveyed. The distinction between illustration and painting is rendered moot by the teeming quality of both surface and subject. 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel, 532 West 25th Street, (917) 701-3338, 532gallery.com.

&#x2605; 'Anything Can Substitute Art: Maciunas in SoHo' (through Feb. 2) Decades before there was Occupy, there was the artist George Maciunas (1931-78). Born in Lithuania, he came to New York City in the late 1940s, graduated from Cooper Union in 1952 with a multitasking degree in art, graphic design and architecture. Inspired by Dada and Zen Buddhism, he helped conceive the giant nebula of international collective activity known as Fluxus, which was to propose a new kind of art that was open to everyone and that was a sly send-up of corporate culture. The archival show beautifully catches his anarchist-existentialist spirit. 41 Cooper Union Gallery, 41 Cooper Square, East Village, (212) 353-4100, cooper.edu. (Cotter)
'Beat Memories: The Photographs of Allen Ginsberg' (through April 6) During two periods in his life -- from the early 1950s to about 1964 and from the early '80s until his death in 1997 -- the poet Allen Ginsberg made photographs and added handwritten captions. Images of his now famous pals, including the writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as Neal Cassady, their logorrheic muse, make this show required viewing for Beat fans. (A panel of scholars will discuss Ginsberg's work in photography, film and sound on Thursday at 6:30 p.m.) Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
Nathaniel Robinson: 'Outer Air' (through Feb. 9) Mr. Robinson's transporting, walk-in poem of an installation revolves around a watering hole for animals, whose simulated feces are scattered about, on an urban rooftop covered by asphalt paper. Its themes regarding nature, culture and consciousness may be heavy, but Mr. Robinson's deft way with metaphor, which calls to mind the early Robert Gober, keeps things light and fresh.

&#x2605; 'Rooms of Wonder: From Wunderkammer to Museum, 1599-1899' (through Feb. 2) The propulsive force of human curiosity is captured in this lavish repast of rare illustrated books and ephemera. They examine the history of wunderkammers, or cabinets of curiosity -- those hodgepodge collections of strange and beautiful objects both natural and manufactured -- that apothecaries, scholars and the odd nobleman or king began to amass in the 16th-century and vividly trace their evolution into all sorts of contemporary museums, including art, natural history, medicine and wax.

&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best.

&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (closes on Sunday) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s, when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (closes on Sunday) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (closes on Sunday) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great, considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (closes on Sunday) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (closes on Sunday) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Bob Mizer: 'Artifacts' (closes on Sunday) Bob Mizer (1922-92) was a photographer and filmmaker whose entrepreneurial talents led him to form a one-man empire in the field of homoerotica beginning in the 1940s. This engrossing show, which includes examples of photographs along with promotional catalogs and handouts, as well as handwritten lists of models noting their physical appearance, is an essay in midcentury American concepts of masculinity, a record of changing mores, and a tribute to a pre-Stonewall pioneer. Invisible-Exports, 14A Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 226-5447, invisible-exports.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (closes on Monday) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (closes on Monday) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Trisha Baga: Plymouth Rock 2' (closes on Sunday) ''Plymouth Rock 2,'' a single-room installation by a young up-and-comer, consists of seemingly random video scenes projected on one wall and banal, shadow-casting objects on the floor. Images of heaving ocean swells shot from a swimmer's point of view and of a beachcomber with a metal detector imply some kind of quest like a search for the Holy Grail, which turns out to be Plymouth Rock, the boulder whereon, legend has it, the Pilgrims first alighted in the New World, now a sadly nondescript tourist attraction.

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GEORGE BELLOWS': (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents -- including ''New York,'' above, from 1911 -- for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein-air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Focus at a Mayoral Forum

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
This year's campaign for New York City mayor was expected to turn on police tactics, education policy and economic development.
On Thursday, six of the leading candidates in the race found themselves discussing something different: mold.
The hazardous fungus, and its proliferation in homes and neighborhoods damaged by Hurricane Sandy, took center stage at a Brooklyn church during a forum on housing policy, an early clash in a race whose candidates are still looking for ways to stand out.
When a Brooklyn homeowner raised concerns about toxic mold buildup, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, used the opportunity to compare Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's storm response to President George W. Bush's raising a ''Mission Accomplished'' banner during the war in Iraq. 
''The city likes to say the crisis is over,'' said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. ''We will treat this as a public health crisis, because it is a public health crisis.''
Tom Allon, a Republican hopeful who is rarely invited to appear alongside his better-known Democratic rivals, criticized the health department for ''chasing after people who are drinking 32-ounce soft drinks'' instead of looking at health problems related to the hurricane.
But John C. Liu, a Democrat who is city comptroller, earned the loudest laughter of the night with his reply: ''It's quite possible that Mayor Bloomberg doesn't know what mold is.''
The forum, sponsored by The Daily News and the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a community activist group, touched on troubles with public housing and the plight of working-class New Yorkers facing higher housing costs.
But in a race in which the ideological spectrum is notably narrow -- even one of the Republicans supports legalizing marijuana -- the stylistic differences among the candidates stood out, as each turned to personal histories and community ties as selling points for the predominantly black crowd.
William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller, made sure to mention that his mother once led a Brooklyn agency for the aging. Another Democrat, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, emphasized her experience with housing and described her immigrant grandfather, a firefighter, eking out a living with the help of a rent-controlled apartment in Upper Manhattan.
The event was the first time that Joseph J. Lhota, former head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, appeared publicly with the other mayoral candidates since he entered the race as a Republican this month.
Despite his reputation for bluntness, Mr. Lhota was relatively subdued in his remarks, discussing the minutiae of New York's housing bureaucracy and appearing every bit the budget director that he was in the Giuliani administration.
Mr. Lhota's most surprising moment came toward the end, when he suggested that the city help pay for housing improvements by creating retail spaces for delis and dry cleaners in public housing complexes. That idea drew a tepid response.
The audience seemed more impressed by Mr. Thompson's proposal to throw out the current Housing Authority board and replace it with a system allowing more direct accountability to the mayor.
Mr. Allon came prepared with zingers, criticizing John B. Rhea, the public housing chief. His praise for former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a divisive figure for many black residents, however, drew a cooler response.
The stormiest words came from Mr. de Blasio, who has made ''tale of two cities'' a rallying cry of his campaign events. On Thursday, he worked to channel the frustration of New Yorkers who find it ''hard to make ends meet,'' and he suggested that biases among House Republicans had led to less federal money for urban housing programs.
Ms. Quinn cited several programs she had put in place as speaker to improve housing options in the city. And she directed some light criticism toward her usual political ally, Mr. Bloomberg, poking fun at his idea to build micro-unit apartments for young professionals, calling it ''a contest to build itty-bitty housing on the East Side of Manhattan.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending and Inequality Denial

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Summarizing the latest bait and switch. 

 BODY:
I've been debating rising inequality with the usual suspects for a couple of decades (despite what it says on this piece, it was actually published in 1992). And what you always encounter from the right is a sort of defense in depth: claims, based on tortured statistics, that it isn't happening; claims, based on similarly tortured statistics, that it doesn't matter; and claims that anyway it's a good thing. You might think that people would have to choose one of these lines: you can't simultaneously say that inequality isn't rising and that the rise is a good thing, can you? Well, yes you can; we're engaged in a political defense of the 1% here, not research.
So, the latest is a piece by Donald Boudreaux and Mark Perry purporting to debunk the notion of middle-class stagnation. Their key piece of evidence is the claim that spending on "basics" has been steadily falling as a share of income, showing that people are finding it ever easier to meet the essential demands of middle-class life. 
Jim Tankersley at Wonkblog does a partial debunking of the debunking, pointing out that the Boudreaux-Perry definition of "basics" is more than a bit dubious: 
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, spending by households on many of modern life's "basics"-food at home, automobiles, clothing and footwear, household furnishings and equipment, and housing and utilities-fell from 53% of disposable income in 1950 to 44% in 1970 to 32% today. 
So, as Tankersley notes, autos but not gas to drive them; only food at home, in a two-earner-family society where at least some eating out has become a necessity; no mention of medical care or education.
But there's a much bigger bait and switch here. Remember, the question is what's happening to the middle class. Nobody questions the fact that America has grown richer over the past several decades. The question is whether that growing wealth has trickled down to ordinary families, or gone mainly to a small elite. Yet when Boudreaux and Perry invoke consumer data, it's data for all households -- in effect, mixing the top quintile (and the top 1 percent) with the middle class.
Does this make a difference? I've done a quick and dirty cut at the Consumer Expenditure Survey data, which unfortunately run only back to 1984, but which do give us spending patterns by income quintile. If you define "basics" as food, shelter, clothing, and transportation, it turns out that these basics accounted for 70.9 percent of overall spending in 1984, but fell to 67.0 percent in 2011 -- suggesting some progress. But what's driving that decline is the top quintile, whose spending on basics fell from 67.5 percent to 62.2 percent. The middle quintile's spending share on basics was basically unchanged, going from 69.7 percent to 69.8 percent.
I'm sure that others can do a more careful and better cut here. But just consider what's going on here: Boudreaux and Perry deny that the middle class is facing stagnation, and then they offer evidence that, on the face of it, is really telling us only that a growing share of income is going to the very affluent, who -- surprise! -- spend only a relatively small share of their high incomes on necessities.
I mean, if we had data for Ancien Regime France, I'd bet we'd find a relatively large share of total income going to things that weren't necessities -- wigs, formal gowns, servants, chateaux. Clearly, the French middle class was thriving in the 1780s!
The BR piece is, in short, a complete non sequitur -- which, given the way the inequality debate has run all along, should come as no surprise.

HEADLINE: Making Sense of Wall Street's Trading Revenue

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Trading results are good place to start when assessing whether banks release sufficient information about their financial results. 

 BODY:
Traders at the top Wall Street firms racked up nearly $80 billion of revenue last year. But understanding how they produced all that money is far from simple. 
The financial crisis revealed the dangers of banks having murky balance sheets. And some investors think banks' disclosures are still inadequate. "The major financial institutions in the U.S. and around the globe are utterly opaque," Paul Singer, the founder of a large hedge fund called Elliott Management, said last year. 
At a conference this week, Mr. Singer clashed with Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, over the subject of bank transparency. In the exchange, Mr. Dimon said hedge funds were hardly transparent and added that JPMorgan's annual report was 400 pages long. 
Trading results are good place to start when assessing whether banks release sufficient information. 
At large banks, sales and trading is a major source of revenue, often dwarfing the fees that they earn from arranging deals or managing other people's money. For instance, Goldman Sachs had sales and trading revenue of $18 billion last year, compared with $5 billion from activities like advising on mergers and handling initial public offerings. 
Shareholders benefit from good disclosures because they can better assess what value to place on a bank's business. Trading revenue is not only large - it can also be extremely volatile, bolstering profits one quarter, then hurting them the next. With the right data, investors can do a better job of identifying what drives revenue up and down.
Another dynamic effects trading these days: regulation. Revenue from trading could decline as new rules stamp out certain types of bets. Tougher capital rules could also make the trading that is allowed more costly for the banks.
When it comes to sales and trading, Wall Street firms have differing levels of disclosure.
Bank of America's investment bank, which contains some Merrill Lynch operations, arguably has the clearest breakdown of what goes into its trading revenue. 
Like all big Wall Street firms, Bank of America says that the vast majority of its trading relates to servicing clients who want to trade in and out of stocks, bonds and derivatives. To facilitate the activity, banks keep such financial assets on their balance sheets to meet customer orders. 
Each quarter, Bank of America provides the main contributors to trading revenue in a reasonably easy-to-read format.
The most recent disclosure shows Bank of America's traders booked revenue of $11.8 billion in 2012. Of that, $3.3 billion came from net interest income, which is the interest and other income earned on the securities that Bank of America holds for market-making, minus the bank's cost of financing those positions. The revenue also included $1.8 billion from commissions and fees. 
The largest contributor in this area is called "trading," which was responsible for $5.7 billion of revenue last year. For the sake of clarity and consistency, it makes sense to relabel this type of revenue "market-making." That's because it mainly represents the gain Bank of America makes when it buys securities and sells them on to clients at a higher price. 
It also includes any gains or losses that occur when the bank marks up or reduces the value of the trading assets that it holds on its balance sheet. For instance, when mortgage-backed bonds rallied in the second half of 2012, banks holding such bonds would have booked nice profits as the market price of those bonds went up. 
As clear as Bank of America's disclosures are, it would be helpful to get more details, like which type of securities or derivatives provided the bulk of market-making revenue in any given quarter. 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs appear to come second in the disclosure stakes. 
With some minor number crunching, it's possible to roughly create a Bank of America-style presentation for both firms that show the three main components of sales and trading revenue. And something stands out about Morgan Stanley. 
The interest income component of sales and trading is negative at Morgan Stanley. It was minus $1.79 billion last year. That suggests it costs the bank more to finance its trading business than the interest it earns on the securities and derivatives it holds for trading. Goldman Sachs, however, showed positive net interest income last year. 
One interpretation is that Morgan Stanley, which has a lower credit rating, has to pay more to finance its positions, putting it at an economic and competitive disadvantage. But the negative number may also be because Morgan Stanley holds fewer higher-yielding assets, and therefore earns less interest than others. 
At JPMorgan and Citigroup, disclosures are too generalized to clearly see what the three main contributors are to sales and trading revenue. This makes it far harder for outsiders to judge whether market-making is driving revenue gains, or commissions, or higher interest income. 
Expect the opacity debate to continue.

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, Putting Shareholders Second

BYLINE: ANTONY CURRIE


HIGHLIGHT: If the financial crisis made anything clear, the author contends, it's that banks should be forced to defend their business models and corporate governance -- regularly. 

 BODY:
Wall Street has found a new way to put shareholders second. While many banks are finally bowing to pressure to restrain compensation, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are now trying to stifle investors from voting on legitimate matters at their upcoming annual meetings. 
Goldman has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to omit a proposal that would require it to appoint an independent chairman. JPMorgan, meanwhile, wants the regulator to let it remove from its proxy an initiative to have the board of directors explore "extraordinary transactions that could enhance stockholder value" - in other words, a breakup.
Both suggestions are rational topics for debate. Calling for a bank to split the roles of chairman and chief executive is hardly a new concept. Last year, Goldman and Lloyd Blankfein, who holds both titles, negotiated their way out of putting the issue to shareholders by striking an agreement with aggrieved investors to revise slightly board oversight of executives.
Meanwhile, shareholders seeking ways to improve returns aren't revolutionary either. Headline-making activists like William Ackman and Daniel Loeb do it all the time. Sure, JPMorgan performs better than many of its rivals, delivering an 11 percent return on equity last year despite a $6.2 billion trading loss. Even so, the bank's shares still trade just below book value, a figure that essentially represents what the disparate parts should fetch if sold off.
Yet both Goldman and JPMorgan are claiming the ballot initiatives are, among other things, too "vague." That can happen with flighty individual investors, but isn't typically the case from established investors like union adviser CtW and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which put forward the two questions this year.
What's odd is that both banks have made their cases before. JPMorgan's chief, Jamie Dimon, regularly addresses why he thinks carving up big institutions isn't the answer, including in his annual missives to shareholders. Goldman, like others, reviews its leadership structure each year.
If the crisis made anything clear, it's that banks should be forced to defend their business models and corporate governance - regularly. Fighting to suppress such questions only makes it sound like these supposedly master sellers are afraid they can't close.

HEADLINE: On Lookout in Davos for Next Growth Story in Emerging Markets

BYLINE: LIZ ALDERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: An economic renaissance in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru has become the focus in Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa has also flashed signs of promise. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- With Europe in a sharp slowdown and the United States forging only a slow recovery, the business and academic elites gathering here are scouring the global landscape for any new economic success story. And a number of countries are stepping forward here at the World Economic Forum to peddle their tales - even if the smart money knows that betting on emerging markets continues to be risky.
Just a few years ago, Brazil and Argentina generated much of the buzz here in Davos, as their growth rates exceeded 7 percent. There was talk of a new economic engine that could help offset lagging growth in the United States and Europe.
Fast forward to today, and Brazil and Argentina have stumbled. It is an economic renaissance in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru that has become the focus in Latin America. 
Half a world away, sub-Saharan Africa has also flashed onto the radar screen, with an average 5 percent growth rate that many hope will improve in the coming decade as investment deepens, perhaps finally fostering a new middle class.
Whether those trends are sustainable, though, remains an open question.
As far as the opinion-makers here are concerned, Africa is coming of age. At a dinner Thursday night feting ''Africa's Promise,'' the economist Lawrence H, Summers of Harvard waved an iPhone at the audience. ''By the end of the decade, half the African people will have this,'' he predicted. ''Africa can leapfrog in terms of economic growth.''
Joe Saddi, chairman of the global management consultancy Booz, is equally bullish. ''The buzz in the business community is that the time of Africa is coming soon,'' he said. ''Everyone is interested in exploring it.''
But others at the dinner, which gathered many African heads of state, acknowledged that the road could be rocky.
''There is no doubt that Africa is on the move and making progress, but there will also be trouble spots,'' President Paul Kagame of Rwanda said. ''We can't talk about Africa versus China, when Africa is still a place in which each country is on its own.''
Kandeh Yumkella, director-general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in Vienna, said the region was turning heads because of its 5 percent growth rate. ''But it's almost entirely from a commodities boom,'' he said. ''There is no creation of high-value growth.''
Africa still sorely needs infrastructure and an industrial base so that it can export more than just oil and minerals to markets around the world, African officials say. What is lacking is a cohesive industrial policy that investors can grasp. ''I don't see a strategic vision being forged for Africa,'' Mr. Yumkella said.
Small loans that are typically aimed at financing cottage industries are simply not enough to lift sub-Saharan Africa into an emerging-market powerhouse, he added. ''Microfinance is basically poverty management,'' he said of that tactic. ''We define poverty alleviation for Africans as basket weaving. Lending someone $50 a month will not create large numbers of jobs for the future.''
But with lingering corruption and poor governance, significant flows of private investment may be slow in coming. ''As long as the priority of African heads of state is to have bank accounts in Europe, there will be hurdles,'' President Alpha Condé of Guinea said. ''The problem with Africa is the leaders of Africa.''
Pointing to the deadly conflict in Mali, they fretted that all of Africa tends to be painted with the same brush.
''People say there was a terrorist event in Mali, so don't come to Africa,'' Prime Minister Raila Amolo Odinga of Kenya said. ''But when things deteriorate in Venezuela, people don't say, 'Don't invest in Latin America.' Africa is held to a different standard.''
Latin America, though, is going through some turbulence of its own, as growth in its two largest economies trails off sharply after several boom years, as exports wane and as domestic demand slackens. In Brazil, global uncertainties and earlier fiscal tightening had an impact larger than expected, especially on private investment, the International Monetary Fund said in a recent report on Latin America.
Argentina, for its part, recently turned toward economic nationalism and retaliatory protectionism after growth slumped.
Widespread controls in Latin America on imports and foreign exchange are also adversely affecting investment and consumer confidence, the I.M.F. said.
Growth in Venezuela has been slowed by a number of factors. ''The problems there are aggravated by an absent president, an impossible macroeconomic situation with ridiculous fiscal deficit, and rising inflation,'' said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard.
Latin American officials say the region is divided into several markets with divergent trends. ''It's absolutely clear that there are two speeds in Latin America,'' Finance Minister Felipe Larraín Bascuñán of Chile said in an interview. ''The question is what is sustainable.''
His country has experienced an average growth rate of 5 percent for the last three years. As in Africa, much of that success has been based on exports of commodities, especially to China.
He cited Chile as an example of an economy that is modifying its contours for the future. Among other things, Mr. Larraín said, private investment has become the main driver of growth after the government amended tax laws to make it easier for small and medium-size businesses to operate.
Smaller Chilean companies that reinvest in themselves pay little or no corporate taxes. A credit tax on loans was slashed to 0.4 percent from 1.2 percent. The middle class has been gaining ground in Chile. And unemployment, around 6 percent, is near its lowest level in a decade, while wages are rising.
''It's a virtuous circle'' Mr. Larraín said. Still, he added, ''we don't want this to be a big fiesta'' where growth is driven only through consumption. ''We are working to make this sustainable.''
Investors have also been prowling Mexico after President Enrique Peña Nieto pledged a series of energy and tax measures to lift growth and began a crackdown on violence.
Luis Videgaray Caso, finance minister of Mexico, said the changes were bearing fruit. ''We are attracting investments that 10 years ago went to China,'' he said at a forum on Latin America. ''The feeling now is that China is a complement, not a competitor.''
Still, the risks of a slowdown remain, given how sharply growth has been curbed not only in the United States, but also in Europe and in major emerging economies, including the powerhouses of Latin America.
While South America's more nimble economies have profited by opening their markets and cutting regulations, ''some countries are starting to ask if they should put in more protectionist measures,'' José Luis Silva Martinot, Peru's trade and tourism minister, said at the same forum. ''In Peru we want to continue with a free market.''
And despite the problems afflicting the region's biggest economies, he added, ''what happens in one country will not lead to contagion - unlike in Europe.''

HEADLINE: How Bright Horizons Took Care of Bain Capital Over the Years

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bright Horizons' successful initial public offering on Friday was the latest chapter in the day care center chain's long and lucrative relationship with Bain Capital. 

 BODY:
For nearly three decades, the day care center chain Bright Horizons Family Solutions has taken care of children. It has also taken very good care of Bain Capital. 
Bright Horizons shares surged on Friday after the company sold shares in a successful initial public offering, closing the day up 29 percent to $28.32 a share. But in the case of Bright Horizons, the term "initial public offering" is something of a misnomer. This was the second time that Bright Horizons had sold shares in an I.P.O. And in both transactions, Bain has been a primary beneficiary. 
Herewith is a brief financial history of Bright Horizons, starring Bain, the Boston-based private equity firm co-founded by the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney: 
In the mid-1980s, Roger H. Brown, an former executive at the consulting firm Bain & Company, and his wife, Linda Mason, came up with the idea to start a chain of day care centers servicing large companies. They went around, hat in hand, to raise money for the venture and approached Mr. Romney, who had just helped start Bain Capital, an investment firm spun off from the Bain consultancy. 
Bain's financing helped the company grow rapidly. From its founding in 1986 through 1997, the company grew to operate about 130 centers, providing care and education to more than 11,000 children, according to company filings.
Bain profited in 1997 when it sold its shares in an I.P.O., listing its stock on the Nasdaq. Two years later, Bright Horizons merged with another newly public day care company, CorporateFamily Solutions, creating the country's largest child care business. Today, the company operates 776 child care and early education centers, and companies including Citicorp, Merck and Boeing employ their services. 
Bright Horizons, based in Watertown, Mass., remained a publicly traded business for about dozen years. But Bain continued to keep a close eye on the company. Josh Bekenstein, a Bain partner, has sat on the company's board since its inception. 
Then, in 2008, more than 20 years after Bain first invested in Bright Horizons, the firm took the company private in a $1.3 billion leveraged buyout. Bain contributed about $590 million of its funds' money to pay for the acquisition, borrowing the rest from banks. Over the past four years, Bright Horizons has struggled through difficult economic conditions, but Bain continued to expand the business, positioning it for its second I.P.O. Mr. Romney even used the company's success during the presidential campaign to counter the image of private equity as job-destroying corporate vultures.
On Friday, Bain's stake in Bright Horizons was worth about $1.4 billion, more than two times its original investment. 
For now, those are gains are just on paper; Bain did not sell any stock in the I.P.O. but instead issued new shares. Bain still controls about 85 percent of the company, and will surely look to cash out its stake over time. If nothing else, Bain's profits on the deal have been anything but child's play.

HEADLINE: A Place That Makes New York Real Estate Look Cheap

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In Beijing, it costs 22.3 times the typical household income to buy a home. The most comparable number for New York is 6.2. 

 BODY:
Think it's expensive to buy a home in New York? Try moving to China.
That chart comes from the International Monetary Fund (and was brought to my attention by Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank). It shows the ratio of house prices to annual household income: that is, how many years' worth of income it would take to buy the typical house in a given city. 
As you can see, the median house price in New York was equal to 6.2 years' worth of the median pretax household income in 2011. The most comparable data we have for an array of Chinese cities -- shown in red above -- suggests that homes in New York are a steal compared to those in urban parts of the Middle Kingdom.
The Chinese data (which use a slightly different metric: the price of a 70-square-meter home divided by average annual pretax household income) show that in Shanghai it would cost 15.9 times the typical household income to buy a standard home. In Beijing, the ratio is even higher, at 22.3.
Real estate prices are so high in China, Mr. Slok explains, because people have few options for parking their savings.
The savings rate is phenomenally high in China. The consumer banking sector, however, is not nearly as built out as those in most developed countries, partly because the Chinese government restricts entry of foreign service-providing companies like financial institutions. So people have been investing their savings in a local sector that has had big returns -- real estate -- chasing home prices ever higher.
I should note, by the way, that housing prices in China began to fall in 2011 as the government tried to curb speculative real estate investment. Home prices then picked up again in the middle of last year and continue to rise.

HEADLINE: Ascendant Latin America Seeks to Recast European Ties

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: With the economies of Latin America continuing to grow and those of Europe stagnating, leaders of the two regional blocs meet this weekend to discuss rebalancing a long-standing relationship. 

 BODY:
LONDON - There was a time when Europe regarded Latin America as a stagnant economic backwater, dependent on selling its natural resources to pay its debts and ruled over by a variety of disagreeable despots.
These days, it is the Latin economies that are moving ahead while their European counterparts are struggling to dig themselves out of debt and recession.
Leaders from Latin America and Europe are meeting in Santiago, Chile, this weekend to discuss updating a close and longstanding relationship to better reflect the new global economic realities. 
At a summit meeting of the Community of Latin America and the Caribbean States (CELAC) and the European Union, government leaders from Europe will face calls for a more equal partnership in what has in the past been seen as a one-sided relationship.
Sebastián Piñera, the Chilean president and host of the summit talks, told members of parliament from the two blocs this week: "What we are seeking is a new strategic alliance, a new era in the relations between the two continents."
The Europeans have traditionally been big investors in Latin economies, with the European Union accounting for 40 percent of the total in the past decade, or around $30 billion a year.
However, faced with a harsh economic climate, countries like Spain are now the ones looking for investment from Latin America, while European job seekers are looking for a brighter future in places like Brazil.
Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, told my colleague Raphael Minder in November: "For years you had capital going from north to south and immigration going from south to north and what we are increasingly going to see is a reverse of the flows."
Despite signs of a slowdown in Brazil, Latin American economies are forecast to grow by 3.6 percent this year compared with a 0.2 percent contraction in the 17-member euro zone.
Alicia Bárcena Ibarra of Mexico, the executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, warned ahead of the Santiago summit meeting that Europe could be facing the kind of "lost decade" that Latin American countries confronted 30 years ago.
In those days, countries in the region found themselves deep in debt after taking on loans from Western banks that were eager to recycle petrodollars from oil producers whose coffers were overflowing in the wake of the 1970s oil price explosion.
"The South is no longer the same," Ms. Bárcena said. "Europe is going to find a different and a changed Latin America. That means taking on new global challenges with responsibility and dealing with issues such as climate change and financial security."
Outlining Latin America's agenda, for a more balanced relationship with Europe, she said: "We want foreign investment that helps us modernize our production structure, that contributes to employment, that helps us care for the environment and that respects social rights."
Europe also has an interest in bolstering the relationship. Although the E.U. ranks as the region's second largest trading partner after the United States, China is expected to overtake it in the coming years.
"Europe needs new markets, and Latin America needs European-style small and medium-sized enterprises," The Guardian said in an editorial last month.
Despite recent economic advances in Latin America, parts of the region continue to suffer from extremes of poverty and underdevelopment. 
Álvaro Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian commentator who asked this week what was the purpose of the summit meeting, pointed out that the region's growth rate hid some huge differences among states, as did their separate development models.
"What Cuba and Venezuela understand by democracy has nothing to do with how it is understood by Mexico or Colombia," he wrote. "What Argentina understands as the market economy is almost the opposite of how Colombia understands it."

HEADLINE: Hurricane Victims Granted Extension to Apply for Federal Aid

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted a 30-day extension to apply for federal assistance for home repairs and other needs at the request of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. 

 BODY:
New Yorkers whose homes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Sandy have been granted a 30-day extension to apply for federal assistance for home repairs and other needs and to the Small Business Administration for loans, officials announced Friday. 
The Transitional Sheltering Assistance program will also be extended an additional two weeks, allowing those who were forced from their homes to continue staying in participating hotels or motels. The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted the extensions at the request of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. 
"We remain committed to assisting all victims of Hurricane Sandy, ensuring that they have the shelter they need, especially in this cold weather," Gov. Cuomo said in a statement. "The Transitional Sheltering Assistance program will continue to provide shelter to those New Yorkers who do not have homes to return and help others with critically needed funding to rebuild."
To be eligible for FEMA programs, people must first apply for federal assistance through FEMA by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov; registering via smartphone or tablet by using the FEMA app or going to m.fema.gov; or calling 800-621-FEMA (3362).

HEADLINE: Con Ed Seeks Rate Increase

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Con Edison had delayed asking for a rate increase after Hurricane Sandy left hundreds of thousands of the company's customers without power. 

 BODY:
 For Consolidated Edison, the pause after the storm in asking for utility rate increases is over.
 On Friday, Con Edison asked state regulators to allow it to collect about $400 million more from customers next year. The increase, if approved, would translate to about $3 more per month for the typical electric customer and more than $2.50 per month for homes that are supplied gas from the company. 
 Con Edison delayed asking for the rate increase after Hurricane Sandy left hundreds of thousands of the company's customers without power, many of them for as long as two weeks. Along with the rate increase, the company asked the state's Public Service Commission for permission to spend $1 billion over the next four years to protect its equipment from another storm like Hurricane Sandy.
 Most of that money - $800 million - would go toward making parts of the electricity-distribution system more water-resistant: raising some equipment off the ground or surrounding it with higher floodgates and burying some overhead wires, the company said. Con Ed provides power throughout all five boroughs of New York City and in most of Westchester County, where almost all of the lines are strung on poles.
 The request would have to be approved by the commission.
 Con Ed said the increases would be the smallest in several years. But that claim did not appease some officials who have been critical of how the company prepared for recent storms and repaired the damage from them.
 Robert Astorino, the Westchester County executive, said he thought the timing was poor, given the weak economy. But he added that the commission should not approve an increase unless it would result in the upgrading of Con Edison's network and improvements in the company's communication with customers during widespread failures.
 "I'm sure nobody wants to pay more to Con Ed, but if the rate does go through and is used to invest in the infrastructure, bury some of the power lines and create a better contact with the customers, then at least it will be money well spent," Mr. Astorino said.
 Con Edison already charges some of the highest rates of any utility in the country. It said the proposed increase of about 3.3 percent would raise the monthly bill for a typical residential electricity customer in the city to $84.55 from $81.64 and for a customer in Westchester to $118 from $114.41.
 For gas customers, the increase would be smaller, about 1.3 percent overall. The monthly bill for the typical residential gas customer would rise to $190.35, from $187.68. 
 Parts of Con Edison's system were ruined by floodwaters from Hurricane Sandy. After the storm, the company said it would spend $250 million over two years to protect its equipment from similar damage. 
 Now, the company wants to quadruple that investment. In a letter to the commission, Craig S. Ivey, the president of Con Edison, said the improvements would be designed to "reduce the size and scope of service outages from major storms, as well as to improve responsiveness and expedite the recovery process."

HEADLINE: Derelict 19th-Century Building Continues Its Decline

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: A wall collapsed this month at 502 Canal Street in Lower Manhattan, to which the Buildings Department had barred entry in November after flooding from Hurricane Sandy. 

 BODY:
"Down on its luck" was how John M. Weiss, the deputy counsel for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, described the derelict hulk of 502 Canal Street in Lower Manhattan in November after flooding from Hurricane Sandy prompted the Buildings Department to bar entry. 
Two months later, its luck is running out.
The nearly 200-year-old, three-story building has deteriorated even more, despite the landlord's promise to make repairs as required by the commission.
This month, a wall collapsed, spilling a metal roll-down gate onto the sidewalk and prompting complaints from neighbors and preservationists, among them George Calderaro of the Historic Districts Council, who called the situation "demolition by neglect." 
In 2003, the building appears to have been bought for over $3 million by an owner connected to the Ponte family, which is also affiliated with the restaurant F. Illi Ponte around the corner (a yellow sign on the second floor of 502 Canal beckons prospective diners there). A phone call to the owner was not returned.
On Nov. 19, the landmarks commission issued a permit for shoring and bracing work on the building. The city says the owner plans to stabilize it, remove the Canal Street facade by hand and then restore it with the original bricks.

HEADLINE: Five Questions for: Aminatta Forna

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI BAGRI


HIGHLIGHT: The 2011 Commonwealth Writers' Prize winner on her writing rituals, including a special mug. 

 BODY:
 Aminatta Forna's most recent novel, "The Memory of Love," won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best Book Award for 2011. 
 Her previous novels include the "The Devil that Danced on the Water" and "Ancestor Stones," which won the 2007 German Liberaturpreis, the Hurston Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction in 2007 and the Aidoo-Snyder Book Prize in the United States in 2010. India Ink interviewed her at the Jaipur Literature Festival. 
 Q. 
What are the occupational hazards of being a writer?
 A. 
I don't have a pension plan! I love it so much I can't say that there are any but I think that a lot of people can write - some people write one book and never write another - and the reason that writers continue to write is that we are people who are capable of living in a room on our own with imaginary friends for the rest of our life. If you can do that, then you can be a writer but many people find they can't do that.
 Q. 
What is your everyday writing ritual?
 A. 
Most writers I know go for word counts, and I used to be a journalist so I guess that's ingrained. But if you do something you have to have a goal. Some writers deny it but I think most people feel they have to have some sort of goal. We bought a house about 10 years ago and did up this whole room exactly the way I thought I wanted it as a writer and I discovered I couldn't write a word in it. I had to go and write the whole book in the British library. Now I do work in that room.
I don't have very many little fetishes but the one I do have is that I like a particular mug to drink out of. It's just a small china cup and I get very upset if my husband moves it. He just can't understand why it matters so much. And of course I've got a hoard of displacement activities - all the things you do when you should be writing. I put on the wash, I do the dishes, and I organize things. But they're part of the ritual so at the beginning of a book the house is always very, very clean. But then once I've got past the end of the beginning as it were, once the book has got a certain momentum, then the house gets increasingly untidy because the writing takes over. But I firmly believe that all of those activities are part of the process of thinking. But nobody can talk to you while you do them. Which my husband does understand and the lady who cleans my house also understands.
 Q. 
Why does the Jaipur Literature Fest matter to you?
 A. 
These festivals are just burgeoning all over the world and that's really good because books are apparently under threat and we always hear that the publishing industry is dying yet there's quite obviously a very strong interest in books and the ideas that books contain. But Jaipur in particular matters because it is away from what was once the center - it is the shifting of the center from outside the West and into these emerging cultural and economic powerhouses like India. Kenya's now got a wonderful book festival, people are talking about maybe locating one in West Africa. The reason I come is because I can talk to audiences who are not the kind of people I find walking down the street in London.
 Q. 
How do you deal with your critics?
 A. 
Well I understood quite early on that if I was going to accept the good ones I would have to accept the bad ones too so I try and take it on the chin. But when I did your job I went to interview Vikram Seth, and his response to me was, "It's one person's opinion."
 Q. 
Why should we read your latest book, 'The Memory of Love'?
 A. 
Increasingly there are those of us who write from outside the center and those are the writers that I'm most interested in because they bring me into worlds that I did not previously know. And that as a writer is what I try to create. To both look at the particular of a world that other people might not know and look at the extremes that people face but also find the universality of that.
It's also a good story.

HEADLINE: Antonio Frasconi, 93, Master of the Woodcut

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
In 1953, Time magazine called Antonio Frasconi America's foremost practitioner of the ancient art of the woodcut. Four decades later, Art Journal called him the best of his generation.
Mr. Frasconi did not reach this pinnacle by adhering to orthodoxies. He found inspiration in comic books as well as the old masters. He decried art education, saying the average student does not learn the pertinent questions, much less the answers. He abhorred art that dwelt on aesthetics at the expense of social problems. He repeatedly addressed war, racism and poverty, and devoted a decade to completing a series of woodcut portraits of people who were tortured and killed under a rightist military dictatorship in his home country, Uruguay, from 1973 to 1985.
''A sort of anger builds in you, so you try to spill it back in your work,'' he said in a 1994 interview with Americas, a magazine of the Organization of American States. 
Mr. Frasconi, who died on Jan. 8 at 93, illustrated more than 100 books, and his work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library, the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian. His woodcuts appeared on album and magazine covers, holiday cards, calendars and posters, and in exhibitions around the world. Several of his children's books won awards. In 1963 he designed a stamp to honor the centennial of the National Academy of Sciences.
In 1968 he represented Uruguay at the Venice Biennale, exhibiting prints from 20 years of work.
Much of that work was done in the studio at his home in Norwalk, Conn., where the views of migrating birds and passing seasons from the window influenced his art. He built the house in 1957, and his son Miguel said he died there.
Mr. Frasconi's was patient and meticulous in his art, which involves making an impression on paper from a design carved in a block of wood. Before producing a woodcut titled ''Sunrise -- Fulton Fish Market'' in 1953, he spent three months wandering Lower Manhattan's wharves and the holds of fishing boats. He spent hour upon hour studying ''just how a man lifts a box,'' he said.
He then spent three weeks carving five wood blocks, each to apply a different color, as they are stamped successively on the same sheet of paper. He said the capricious nature of wood governed many artistic decisions. He loved the hands-on experience of working with wood, some of which he gathered from the beach in front of his home.
''Sometimes the wood gives you a break,'' he told Time in 1963, ''and matches your conception of the way it is grained. But often you must surrender to the grain, find the movement of the scene, the mood of the work, in the way the grain runs.''
Mr. Frasconi said he took up the art after being attracted to the idea of making multiple prints, in part so he could offer art to people at reasonable prices. The woodcuts of Paul Gauguin were an enormous influence, he said.
Antonio Rudolfo Frasconi was born to Italian immigrant parents on April 28, 1919, in Buenos Aires; a few weeks later his family moved to Uruguay. His father was frequently unemployed, and his mother worked in a restaurant and as a seamstress. He dropped out of art school at 12 because he was bored with copying from plaster casts of classical sculpture and became a printer's apprentice. On his own, he made posters deriding Franco and Hitler, which he signed ''Chico.''
In 1945 he came to New York on a one-year scholarship to the Art Students League, and the next year he had a show at the Brooklyn Museum. After moving to California, he worked as a gardener and as a guard at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, where he had an exhibition.
Returning to New York, he collaborated with the adapter Glenway Wescott and the book designer Joseph Blumenthal on ''12 Fables of Aesop,'' which was published by the Museum of Modern Art and honored by the American Institute of Graphic Arts as one of the year's 50 best books. He illustrated a poem by Federico García Lorca on the brutality of Franco's police.
A later political work about the Vietnam War superimposed bombsights on terror-stricken peasants. He illustrated selections from the poems of Herman Melville to comment on the Ohio National Guard's killing of students at Kent State University in 1970.
For many years Mr. Frasconi, a citizen of both Uruguay and the United States, taught at Purchase College of the State University of New York.
His first marriage, to Rene Farmer, ended in divorce. His second wife, Leona Pierce, a noted woodcut artist, died in 2002 after 50 years of marriage. In addition to his son Miguel, Mr. Frasconi is survived by another son, Pablo, and a granddaughter.
Some of Mr. Frasconi's work was devilishly playful. His 1952 book, ''The World Upside Down,'' pictured a bull butchering a human, a man in a bird cage while a bird cavorts outside, and a sheep herding a flock of humans. A dog sleeps in bed, while a man slumbers in a doghouse on the floor. A fire hydrant is nearby, apparently in case the man needs it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds: A Puzzling Allure

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at the BAM Alliance. His book, "The Behavior Gap," was published last year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog.
People seem to be sticking with hedge funds, despite another terrible year in a terrible decade of performance, according to The Economist: 
"The S&P 500 has now outperformed its hedge-fund rival for 10 straight years, with the exception of 2008 when both fell sharply. A simple-minded investment portfolio, 60 percent of it in [stock] shares and the rest in sovereign bonds, has delivered returns of more than 90 percent over the last decade, compared with a meager 17 percent after fees for hedge funds."
On top of that, investors are paying through the nose for the privilege of investing in hedge funds. Felix Salmon points out:
"Steve Cohen's SAC Capital, marred by insider trading investigations, made it to the top of Bloomberg Markets' ranking of the most profitable hedge funds this year, not because of performance but because of fees. Instead of the usual 2 and 20 fee structure, SAC reportedly charges a 3 percent management fee and as much as 50 percent of its clients' profits."
The question that I can't stop asking myself is why?
Why, despite this body of evidence and our experience to the contrary, do people think that once you have a bunch of money you've somehow outgrown the simple, low-cost investment tools that most academics think you should use, like broadly diversified index funds and basic, safe fixed-income instruments?
I can think of a few possible reasons.
First, that's just what rich, smart people do, right? It's just another piece of (bogus) investing folklore: Once you have a big pile of money to invest, the solution must be complicated. And the more complicated and secretive and exclusive it is, the better.
Second, people want to believe there's a better way of investing that's only available to a select few. This idea of using plain old mutual funds is for the common folk. People think, "I've got to get access to the best minds in the industry, and they're in the heads of people who go manage hedge funds, right?"
Finally, there's a perverse belief that if something is more expensive, it simply has to be better.
But when it comes to investing, as Vanguard Group's founder, John Bogle, said, "You get what you don't pay for."
This is just cold, hard math. If an investment earns 10 percent, and you're paying a 3 percent management fee plus 50 percent of profits (or even 2 and 20), you're going to keep a lot less of your money than with an investment that earns 10 percent and only charges a management fee of 0.5 percent or 0.25 percent, like an index mutual fund or exchange-traded fund might.
I once worked with an attorney who represented a large family endowment that wanted a new investing strategy. So I walked him through a simple, well-diversified, low-cost portfolio. I gave him the returns and the risk numbers. They were impressive. But this was just a plain vanilla portfolio.
Three other groups made pitches. Those folks came with two-inch-thick proposals and flew people in to give presentations. Their strategies were pretty complicated with lots of bells and whistles. But their performance numbers weren't quite as good.
Not long after the pitches, the lawyer called to say that his client had decided to go in different direction. He told me it was because my plan seemed too basic.
I knew this attorney pretty well. I waited a few days, and then I took the same numbers from my too-basic portfolio and moved the return number down a little, bumped the risk number up a little and charged a slightly higher fee.
I sent the numbers to the lawyer and called him and said something like, "Hey, did you look at those numbers? The strategy involves a proprietary fund run by some of the smartest people I've ever met. They won't even reveal their process because it's basically rocket science in a box."
His response? "Wow, we'd like to hear more about that."
I'm curious: Why do you think people still invest in hedge funds? What am I missing?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Where Banking Crisis Raged, Trust Is Slow to Return

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
''WHAT have you done to me lately?''
For banks around the world, the answer to that question seems to be the determining factor in whether banks are largely trusted. In countries whose financial systems did not blow up during the worldwide recession, trust has remained high. But in some European countries where the banks were generally viewed as having caused the crisis, trust plunged and has not recovered.
The accompanying charts show the results of online surveys of ''informed publics'' in 26 countries around the world by people hired by Edelman, a public relations firm. Respondents were asked how much they trusted banks ''to do the right thing,'' on a scale of one -- ''do not trust them at all'' -- to nine -- ''trust them a great deal.'' The figures in the charts show the proportion in each country who chose one of the four highest numbers, six to nine. 
In the 2013 survey, conducted in October and November and released this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, more than two-thirds of the respondents in seven areas -- all but one of them in Asia -- thought the banks were worthy of trust. They were Indonesia, India, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico.
At the other end of the spectrum, fewer than a third of the respondents in six countries -- all in Europe -- thought bankers could be trusted. They were Ireland, Spain, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Italy.
Those questioned were limited to well-educated successful people; they had to be college graduates age 25 to 64 with income in the top quartile of their age group who said they followed the news regularly.
In the United States, trust in banks plunged after it became clear that bad lending practices played a major role in the housing boom that led to a bust.
In the 2008 survey, taken in the fall of 2007 just before the American recession began, banks had the trust of 71 percent of the people polled. By the 2011 survey, taken in 2010, that figure was down to 25 percent. But in the current survey, it was back up to 50 percent and the United States had the largest recovery in trust for bankers among the countries surveyed.
That revival came despite continuing bad publicity over mortgages, both in lending during the boom and in foreclosure policies after the collapse. The American economy has been slowly recovering, though, unlike those in many European countries, and that may have helped.
But the fact that half of those questioned now have at least some trust in banks does not mean people think the banks are doing a good job. Asked how banks were performing in six areas, more than half of the American respondents said they were doing a good or excellent job in only one of them, ensuring privacy and security of customers' personal information.
In each of the other areas -- small-business lending, mortgage lending, credit cards, trading and investing in government bonds and overseeing initial public offerings for companies -- less than 40 percent thought performance was good or excellent.
In Britain, the figure was under 40 percent in all six areas. In China, a majority voiced approval for the performance of the banks in five of the areas, the exception being initial public offerings, where slightly less than half gave positive responses.
Canada, a country whose banking system largely emerged unscathed from the crisis, is remarkable in how little variation there has been in the rankings, which have been from 50 to 60 percent throughout the period.
In China and India, whose growth continued when most countries fell into recession, at least three-quarters of the respondents trusted the banks every year. At the other end of the spectrum, the last three surveys have shown that banks were trusted by less than 20 percent of respondents in Ireland, which experienced a housing bust that led the government to go deeply into debt to bail out the banks.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Who Trusts the Banks: As the financial crisis recedes, bankers are growing less unpopular in the United States, but are still trusted far less than bankers in emerging economies. In Western Europe, there is still little trust. The charts show the percentage of ''informed publics'' in each country who believe banks could be ''trusted to do what is right.'' Respondents were asked to rate banks on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 indicating ''do not trust them at all'' and 9 indicating ''trust them a great deal.'' The percentages shown reflect the number choosing the top four categories, 6 to 9. (Source: Edelman Trust Barometer)

HEADLINE: Con Edison Is Seeking Higher Rates

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
For Consolidated Edison, the pause after the storm in asking for utility rate increases is over.
On Friday, Con Edison asked state regulators to allow it to collect about $400 million more from customers next year. The increase, if approved, would translate to about $3 more per month for the typical electric customer and more than $2.50 per month for homes that are supplied gas from the company. 
Con Edison delayed asking for the rate increase after Hurricane Sandy left hundreds of thousands of the company's customers without power, many of them for as long as two weeks. Along with the rate increase, the company asked the state's Public Service Commission for permission to spend $1 billion over the next four years to protect its equipment from another storm like Hurricane Sandy.
Most of that money - $800 million - would go toward making parts of the electricity-distribution system more water-resistant: raising some equipment off the ground or surrounding it with higher floodgates and burying some overhead wires, the company said. Con Ed provides power throughout all five boroughs of New York City and in most of Westchester County, where almost all of the lines are strung on poles.
The request would have to be approved by the commission.
Con Ed said the increases would be the smallest in several years. But that claim did not appease some officials who have been critical of how the company prepared for recent storms and repaired the damage from them.
Robert Astorino, the Westchester County executive, said he thought the timing was poor, given the weak economy. But he added that the commission should not approve an increase unless it would result in the upgrading of Con Edison's network and improvements in the company's communication with customers during widespread failures.
"I'm sure nobody wants to pay more to Con Ed, but if the rate does go through and is used to invest in the infrastructure, bury some of the power lines and create a better contact with the customers, then at least it will be money well spent," Mr. Astorino said.
Con Edison already charges some of the highest rates of any utility in the country. It said the proposed increase of about 3.3 percent would raise the monthly bill for a typical residential electricity customer in the city to $84.55 from $81.64 and for a customer in Westchester to $118 from $114.41. For gas customers, the increase would be smaller, about 1.3 percent overall. The monthly bill for the typical residential gas customer would rise to $190.35, from $187.68.
Parts of Con Edison's system were ruined by floodwaters from Hurricane Sandy. After the storm, the company said it would spend $250 million over two years to protect its equipment from similar damage.
Now, the company wants to quadruple that investment. In a letter to the commission, Craig S. Ivey, the president of Con Edison, said the improvements would be designed to "reduce the size and scope of service outages from major storms, as well as to improve responsiveness and expedite the recovery process."

HEADLINE: On Lookout in Davos For Next Growth Story In Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- With Europe in a sharp slowdown and the United States forging only a slow recovery, the business and academic elites gathering here are scouring the global landscape for any new economic success story. And a number of countries are stepping forward here at the World Economic Forum to peddle their tales - even if the smart money knows that betting on emerging markets continues to be risky.
Just a few years ago, Brazil and Argentina generated much of the buzz here in Davos, as their growth rates exceeded 7 percent. There was talk of a new economic engine that could help offset lagging growth in the United States and Europe.
Fast forward to today, and Brazil and Argentina have stumbled. It is an economic renaissance in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru that has become the focus in Latin America. 
Half a world away, sub-Saharan Africa has also flashed onto the radar screen, with an average 5 percent growth rate that many hope will improve in the coming decade as investment deepens, perhaps finally fostering a new middle class.
Whether those trends are sustainable, though, remains an open question.
As far as the opinion-makers here are concerned, Africa is coming of age. At a dinner Thursday night feting ''Africa's Promise,'' the economist Lawrence H, Summers of Harvard waved an iPhone at the audience. ''By the end of the decade, half the African people will have this,'' he predicted. ''Africa can leapfrog in terms of economic growth.''
Joe Saddi, chairman of the global management consultancy Booz, is equally bullish. ''The buzz in the business community is that the time of Africa is coming soon,'' he said. ''Everyone is interested in exploring it.''
But others at the dinner, which gathered many African heads of state, acknowledged that the road could be rocky.
''There is no doubt that Africa is on the move and making progress, but there will also be trouble spots,'' President Paul Kagame of Rwanda said. ''We can't talk about Africa versus China, when Africa is still a place in which each country is on its own.''
Kandeh Yumkella, director-general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in Vienna, said the region was turning heads because of its 5 percent growth rate. ''But it's almost entirely from a commodities boom,'' he said. ''There is no creation of high-value growth.''
Africa still sorely needs infrastructure and an industrial base so that it can export more than just oil and minerals to markets around the world, African officials say. What is lacking is a cohesive industrial policy that investors can grasp. ''I don't see a strategic vision being forged for Africa,'' Mr. Yumkella said.
Small loans that are typically aimed at financing cottage industries are simply not enough to lift sub-Saharan Africa into an emerging-market powerhouse, he added. ''Microfinance is basically poverty management,'' he said of that tactic. ''We define poverty alleviation for Africans as basket weaving. Lending someone $50 a month will not create large numbers of jobs for the future.''
But with lingering corruption and poor governance, significant flows of private investment may be slow in coming. ''As long as the priority of African heads of state is to have bank accounts in Europe, there will be hurdles,'' President Alpha Condé of Guinea said. ''The problem with Africa is the leaders of Africa.''
Pointing to the deadly conflict in Mali, they fretted that all of Africa tends to be painted with the same brush.
''People say there was a terrorist event in Mali, so don't come to Africa,'' Prime Minister Raila Amolo Odinga of Kenya said. ''But when things deteriorate in Venezuela, people don't say, 'Don't invest in Latin America.' Africa is held to a different standard.''
Latin America, though, is going through some turbulence of its own, as growth in its two largest economies trails off sharply after several boom years, as exports wane and as domestic demand slackens. In Brazil, global uncertainties and earlier fiscal tightening had an impact larger than expected, especially on private investment, the International Monetary Fund said in a recent report on Latin America.
Argentina, for its part, recently turned toward economic nationalism and retaliatory protectionism after growth slumped.
Widespread controls in Latin America on imports and foreign exchange are also adversely affecting investment and consumer confidence, the I.M.F. said.
Growth in Venezuela has been slowed by a number of factors. ''The problems there are aggravated by an absent president, an impossible macroeconomic situation with ridiculous fiscal deficit, and rising inflation,'' said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard.
Latin American officials say the region is divided into several markets with divergent trends. ''It's absolutely clear that there are two speeds in Latin America,'' Finance Minister Felipe Larraín Bascuñán of Chile said in an interview. ''The question is what is sustainable.''
His country has experienced an average growth rate of 5 percent for the last three years. As in Africa, much of that success has been based on exports of commodities, especially to China.
He cited Chile as an example of an economy that is modifying its contours for the future. Among other things, Mr. Larraín said, private investment has become the main driver of growth after the government amended tax laws to make it easier for small and medium-size businesses to operate.
Smaller Chilean companies that reinvest in themselves pay little or no corporate taxes. A credit tax on loans was slashed to 0.4 percent from 1.2 percent. The middle class has been gaining ground in Chile. And unemployment, around 6 percent, is near its lowest level in a decade, while wages are rising.
''It's a virtuous circle'' Mr. Larraín said. Still, he added, ''we don't want this to be a big fiesta'' where growth is driven only through consumption. ''We are working to make this sustainable.''
Investors have also been prowling Mexico after President Enrique Peña Nieto pledged a series of energy and tax measures to lift growth and began a crackdown on violence.
Luis Videgaray Caso, finance minister of Mexico, said the changes were bearing fruit. ''We are attracting investments that 10 years ago went to China,'' he said at a forum on Latin America. ''The feeling now is that China is a complement, not a competitor.''
Still, the risks of a slowdown remain, given how sharply growth has been curbed not only in the United States, but also in Europe and in major emerging economies, including the powerhouses of Latin America.
While South America's more nimble economies have profited by opening their markets and cutting regulations, ''some countries are starting to ask if they should put in more protectionist measures,'' José Luis Silva Martinot, Peru's trade and tourism minister, said at the same forum. ''In Peru we want to continue with a free market.''
And despite the problems afflicting the region's biggest economies, he added, ''what happens in one country will not lead to contagion - unlike in Europe.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Home Sales at Highest Level Since 2009

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell in the United States in December, although the median sales price rose and the sector still appears to be a bright spot in the country's economic recovery. 
The Commerce Department said on Friday that sales dropped 7.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 369,000-unit annual rate. That was below analysts' forecasts of a 385,000-unit annual pace.
Government data for new home sales are subject to substantial revisions. Indeed, the Commerce Department raised its estimate for sales in November by 22,000, to a 398,000-unit rate, making the pace of sales in November the fastest since April 2010.
The housing sector has been a point of relative strength in the economy over the last year and is expected to help offset the economic damage from tax hikes enacted this year.
The median price for a new home rose to $248,900 in December from $245,600 in November, according to figures that are not adjusted for seasonal swings. Rising prices are seen as a sign of improving health in the housing market.
Economists generally believe home building added to economic growth last year for the first time since 2005. Friday's report showed 367,000 new homes were sold last year, the most since 2009.
Still, that number remains about a third of the record number sold in 2005, before a housing collapse helped trigger the 2007-9 recession.

HEADLINE: Greek Opposition Leader Seeks Conference on Debt

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The 38-year-old leftist opposition leader in Greece who could become its next prime minister on a wave of simmering popular fury over the government's austerity measures, called on Friday for a European summit meeting to ease the crushing debts that threaten not only his country but all of Europe.
The opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, whose criticism of international bailouts propelled his party, Syriza, to win the second biggest bloc of parliamentary seats in the June 2012 elections, also said he did not believe Greece would be forced to withdraw from the group of 17 countries that use the euro currency. Greece's heavy indebtedness has raised fears that the country could leave or be expelled from the euro zone, a possibility that many economists regard as a threat to the euro's survival. 
''They say I am the most dangerous man in Europe,'' Mr. Tsipras said in an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times. ''What I feel is dangerous is the policy of austerity in Europe. The Greek people have paid a heavy price.''
Mr. Tsipras was in New York as part of a trip to the United States that has included meetings in Washington with the International Monetary Fund and the Treasury Department. The trip is part of a campaign intended to bolster his credibility as a politician and to counter what his aides call the fictional portrayals of him as a financial bomb-thrower in Greece's mainstream news media, controlled by the so-called oligarch families of privilege in the country who fear Syriza's ascent to power.
Given the fragility of the conservative-led coalition that took over after the June elections, any no-confidence vote in Parliament could lead to new elections that give Mr. Tsipras the latitude to form a government. Recent polls put Syriza's popularity at nearly 30 percent, about the same as the current coalition leader, the conservative New Democracy party.
This month Mr. Tsipras also visited Germany, Europe's most powerful economy, which has been the driving force behind the insistence that Greece must endure sacrifices and impose fiscal discipline in exchange for help on its debt burden. Mr. Tsipras has argued that the strategy has not only been an expensive failure but has also increased Greece's indebtedness relative to the size of its economy, where joblessness and cuts in wages and benefits have stoked widespread anger.
After six years of recession in Greece, he said, ''we are witnessing a humanitarian crisis.''
The symptoms were on display this week in Athens, where striking subway workers, outraged over pay cuts, paralyzed a transit system that carries one million riders a day. The government on Friday used an emergency decree to halt the strike.
Mr. Tsipras said he would like to see a summit meeting that would result in an end to the austerity approach, which he said is needed to restart growth and avert a deeper economic malaise.
''We are suggesting an overall plan for a European solution,'' he said. ''A European conference on debt that would include all of the countries of the region facing a significant debt issue.''
He drew an analogy to the London Debt Agreement of 1953, in which postwar Germany's debt was cut by 50 percent and the repayment spread over 30 years.
Mr. Tsipras said the German government, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, has held the possibility of expulsion from the euro zone over Greece as leverage for enforcing its austerity solution, but that in his view neither Germany nor its supporters want to see Greece exit the euro.
''The constant threats, that they will kick us out of the euro zone, is a strategy with no foundation,'' he said. ''It's just a way to blackmail us.''

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Companies Lobbying Against Europe's Data Privacy Proposals

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
Silicon Valley technology companies and the United States government are pushing hard against Europe's effort to enact sweeping privacy protection for digital data.
Several proposed laws working their way through the European Parliament could give 500 million consumers the ability to block or limit many forms of online Web tracking and targeted advertising. All the major American tech companies have directed their lobbyists in Brussels, where the Parliament is based, to press to weaken or remove these proposals from the European provisions.
And the United States Commerce Department is lobbying on behalf of the Obama administration, which is concerned that sweeping new privacy controls could hurt the United States tech industry in Europe. This week, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Friends of Privacy U.S.A., an offshoot of the London-based Privacy International, weighed in with a different message: Europe needs to pass tough restrictions to save the digital economy, not destroy it. 
The dispute has brought into the open how much Europe and the United States differ on privacy rights and their role in the digital economy.
Barry Steinhardt, the chairman of Friends of Privacy, founded last year, called it a ''titanic clash.'' ''The rest of the world is looking to see who will prevail because the Asians, Latin Americans and Africans all need to do business with the U.S. and Europe,'' Mr. Steinhardt said. ''So this is extraordinarily important for Americans.''
Mr. Steinhardt and his allies in the battle -- Susan Grant, the director of protection for the consumer federation, and Ben Wizner, a lawyer who focuses on speech, privacy and technology at the A.C.L.U. -- argued their case at a meeting this week with European members of Parliament.
''We are here to correct the record,'' Mr. Wizner said. ''Certainly the U.S. government has been making misleading statements about the state of electronic privacy law in the U.S., how consumer protections are as strong in the U.S. as in Europe. But that is simply not the case.''
Mr. Wizner said the United States had no equivalent to Europe's general data protection law. American law, he said, guarantees consumer privacy only in specific cases, like medical and financial records, but permits online companies to conduct unfettered data mining with only take-it-or-leave-it privacy controls.
Under the European proposals, Web businesses would be unable to perform basic collecting and profiling of individual computer users unless they gave their explicit consent as part of policies that allow them to specify what kinds of information could be collected and for what purpose. Businesses would also have to permanently remove and delete personal information upon request, and national regulators would gain the ability to fine companies up to 2 percent of their annual sales for not complying.
The proposals are before the European Parliament and a council of 27 European Union justice ministers, who are trying to put together consensus positions. Parliament is expected to complete its draft by late April and would then enter negotiations with the justice ministers over the remainder of the year, with adoption expected in early 2014.
The outcome of the debate is critical to United States technology companies, which typically generate a third or more of their sales in the European Union.
During a speech in Brussels on Dec. 4, the United States ambassador to the union, William E. Kennard, urged lawmakers to amend parts of the legislation that would require businesses to obtain explicit consent from consumers before collecting and mining data and to remove all traces of personal data from the Internet upon request.
Proposals to weaken the restrictions on collecting data have been submitted by eBay and Amazon, as well as by industry groups like Digital Europe, a Brussels association whose members include Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, I.B.M., Oracle, the Google subsidiary Motorola Mobility, Texas Instruments and Dell, along with European and global tech companies. Some of the lobbying efforts have already borne fruit.
Faced with the United States industry opposition, some supporters of the proposals are worried about the prospects of producing meaningful changes.
''The outcome is very unclear at this point,'' said Jérémie Zimmermann, a spokesman for a French digital rights group, La Quadrature du Net. ''The U.S. lobbying on this has been very effective so far. It is impossible to tell what will happen.''

HEADLINE: An Afghanistan Write-Off Isn't an Option

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KEATING and MATT WALDMAN

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Obama recently said that by the end of next year the war in Afghanistan ''will come to a responsible end.''
A responsible approach must recognize the dynamics on the ground. Violence and predation in the country are deeply rooted. Even in the winter fighting ''lull,'' there are an average of 50 insurgent attacks a day across the country.
What is urgently required is a realistic assessment by the United States and its allies about the challenges ahead, a more political approach, and a commitment to remain engaged in Afghanistan well beyond 2014. 
This will not be easy. Disillusionment about Afghanistan in Washington and other capitals is growing. The vast military and civilian enterprise -- the United States alone has spent $83 billion in assistance since 2001 -- has been shaped more by Western security imperatives than by an understanding of the country's complex social fabric, political economy, or, for that matter, its peoples' priorities.
The impact of civilian aid has been mixed. Significant progress has been made in areas such as infrastructure, girls' education and health, but funds have also contributed to cronyism, corruption and insecurity.
Accelerated drawdown of international forces is ratcheting up anxiety both inside the country and in the region. Meanwhile, the Taliban remain strong; warlords are reported to be rearming; and many Afghans that can are leaving or getting their money out. More than 32,000 Afghans made asylum applications in 2012 -- more than any other nationality worldwide.
Relapse into civil war would be disastrous -- for the long suffering population and for the wider region.
The early 1990s provides a terrible precedent. Once the Russians withdrew their backing for Najibullah in 1992, his regime collapsed and the country descended into violent upheaval, causing thousands of deaths and disappearances.
A responsible international approach now is the best defense against a repeat of history. What is required above all is a multilayered political strategy that reduces uncertainty and fosters stability.
Only Afghans can reconcile their differences. But the international community can play a critical role in creating the conditions in which this can happen. It should be rooted in ground realities and Afghan interests. It must ensure that international policies do not unwittingly intensify local or national power struggles or undermine stability.
Insecurity and uncertainty are pervasive, rooted in lawlessness, abuse of power, and lack of economic opportunities for men and women. This is compounded by doubts among Afghans about the depth and durability of the West's commitment to Afghanistan.
The international approach must seek to reinforce security in its broader sense, over the long term. A U.S.-Afghanistan security agreement would send an important signal to Afghans and to regional players that this time -- unlike the 1990s -- the West will not turn its back on Afghanistan. Aid must be used shrewdly to create jobs, especially for young people, and promote sustainable livelihoods. It must strengthen, not undercut, accountability in the government and its police and security forces.
A reduction in civilian aid is inevitable, and there is a strong case that more can be done with less. But large scale, uncoordinated cuts would be damaging, and reinforce unpredictability.
A stable political transition requires presidential elections in 2014 that are seen by Afghans as legitimate. Electoral complications abound: The lessons from the flawed 2009 elections must be taken on board, including by the international community.
Ultimately, there is a need for a more inclusive, functional and responsive political system that empowers citizens and entrenches checks and balances at the national level.
Above all, political transition requires a more systematic and broad-based reconciliation process. Efforts remain fragile and inchoate. But Pakistan says it will support the process, the United States has backed the establishment of a Taliban office in Doha, and the Taliban say they are open to dialogue.
It is no mystery what needs to happen next: structured talks about core issues between all the parties to the conflict. Given the mistrust between the parties and complexity of the issues, it will require mediation. And the process must be as wide as it is deep: In due course that dialogue must be expanded to include all Afghanistan's social and political groups, as well as its neighbors.
The United States and its allies can use their influence to help chart a way ahead and correct the corrosive sense of uncertainty. Drawdown must not mean write-off. There are no shortages of potential pitfalls, but progress is possible. It will require political acuity, honesty about the challenges ahead, and a shared determination to address them.

HEADLINE: A First Step With Iran

BYLINE: By RAY TAKEYH

 BODY:
AS diplomacy once more reclaims its place in U.S.-Iran relations, a peculiar psychological barrier continues to bedevil prospects of a settlement.
The great powers are busy imposing sanctions on Iran that they will amend only if Tehran dismantles key aspects of its nuclear program. In the meantime, Iran is hesitant to make concessions, aware that the expansion of its nuclear capability enhances its bargaining power. In the search of negotiating advantage, neither side is willing to part with what they consider to be their leverage.
The best means of breaking this vicious cycle is not to search for a grand deal, but a limited one that breaches the wall of mistrust and potentially sets the stage for further-reaching arms control measures. 
The basic U.S. strategy has rested on the notion that increased economic penalties can produce a reliable interlocutor prone to negotiating a viable agreement.
The intriguing aspect of this policy is that it is burdened by its own partial success. The American sanctions policy has triumphed beyond the anticipation of its many detractors, as Washington has convinced a large segment of the international community to abjure Iranian commerce. And yet, ironically, the more the sanctions policy succeeds, the more reluctant the great powers become to exchange any of their gains for a modest compromise.
The Islamic Republic has been bedeviled by its own accomplishments. It is the conviction of the clerical state that America is not interested in its atomic program, but is cynically using Iran's nuclear ambitions to foster regime change. By steadily increasing the size and scope of its nuclear infrastructure, Tehran believes that it is in a better position to extract concessions from the international community.
The clerics are trapped in their own achievement: The more their nuclear program advances, the less inclined they are to concede its core features.
The danger of such unimpeded proliferation is that as Iran's program crosses successive technological thresholds, a constituency is emerging within the regime that argues that an Iran with a bomb maybe in a better position to renegotiate its re-entry into the global economy.
The Iranian and American narratives do occasionally coincide on one issue: Iran's production of 20 percent enriched uranium.
The United States has long identified Iran's higher-grade enrichment as its most dangerous and destabilizing activity. On various occasions, the Islamic Republic has seemingly been open to an agreement that addresses its high-grade enrichment program.
The Iranians' claim has always been that they were compelled to move to higher levels of enrichment because the international community had failed to provide them with sufficient fuel for the operation of Tehran's medical research reactor. Whatever the merits of Iran's assertions, it does establish the precedent for ceasing 20 percent enriched uranium production for a measure of sanctions relief.
The critics of an agreement that focuses solely on 20 percent enriched uranium will correctly stress that cessation of such efforts would not significantly curb Iran's nuclear trajectory. They will also argue, reasonably, that an agreement will not undo Iran's mastery of complex nuclear technologies.
But the principal aim of such a bargain would be to nudge the two sides away from their existing narratives. An accord -- however modest and tentative -- may convince the Western powers that Iran can indeed be an arms-control interlocutor. Moreover, a cessation of 20 percent enriched uranium production can still extend the timeline of Iran's nuclear program and ease some of the anxieties in Western capitals and Israel. An agreement may also help to move the Islamic Republic away from its corrosive perception that diplomacy is merely a ruse to increase pressure on its regime.
Although the nuclear dispute between Iran and the United States is often portrayed as a disagreement over technical issues, it is important to break the psychological barriers to deal-making.
Although various grand bargains and proposals have been contemplated, the level of mistrust is simply too high to facilitate comprehensive settlements. A modest compromise may not fundamentally alter the technical complexion of Iran's nuclear program, but it may change the political milieu that has thus far obstructed an accord. Only then can the great powers and Iran move toward a more fundamental resolution of their lingering dispute.

HEADLINE: In Mozambique, a Test for an Italian Energy Company

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
MILAN -- Tucked away in a building on the outskirts of Milan is the ''nirvana room,'' so called perhaps because of the good tidings it contains. There, geologists working for the Italian oil company Eni don 3-D glasses to contemplate fluorescent images of underground geological formations and try to divine which might be worth tens of millions of dollars in exploratory drilling.
The mood around Eni has been nirvana-like lately as the company's explorers have made some lucrative enlightened guesses. Beginning in 2010, Eni and a rival, the Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum, made a series of finds off Mozambique, a country in East Africa, that add up to the largest natural gas discovery of recent years -- the equivalent of about 16 billion barrels of oil.
Eni controls the largest share of the Mozambique findings, with 70 percent of an offshore block in the Indian Ocean called Area 4, in what is known as the Rovuma Basin. 
Eni's chief executive, Paolo Scaroni, said the discoveries had come after Eni spent five years studying East Africa, where very little oil and natural gas had been found. When Mozambique made exploration blocks available in 2006, Eni bid and got the one it wanted.
The challenge now will be to fully capitalize on that opportunity, which will require the company to help manage Mozambique's transition into a major energy exporter. And building multibillion-dollar plants in remote areas to turn natural gas into liquids for transport on specialized ships will also test Eni's skills.
These days, oil and natural gas exploration is an industry as fraught with geopolitical risks as it is with geological ones, as the recent hostage-taking attack in Algeria has made clear. And Eni is as aware as any European energy company of the dangers of politically volatile North Africa, given its own extensive operations in Algeria and Libya.
But for now, at least, Mozambique is not one of Africa's trouble spots. And in any case, energy companies tend to follow opportunities wherever they can find them.
''Although Mozambique was a new country, we thought the chances were reasonable, about 20 percent,'' of finding something, Mr. Scaroni said during an interview in Milan. ''Of course it was high-risk, high-reward.''
It was after Anadarko, a U.S. independent, announced a discovery in an adjacent tract that Eni, which had been preparing to drill in another part of its block, decided to put its first well near Anadarko's tract.
Mr. Scaroni, a graduate of Columbia Business School in New York with a master's degree in business administration, took the top job at Eni in 2005 after spending much of his career outside Italy and the oil business. He has been gradually reshaping the company into more of a machine for finding and producing oil and natural gas and less of the lumbering state conglomerate that had toiled in the second tier of global oil giants.
Mr. Scaroni, 66, also has the crucial task of maintaining Eni's relationships with a group of fossil-fuel-rich but prickly host countries that include Iraq, Libya, Russia, Venezuela and, elsewhere in Africa, Angola and the Republic of Congo. He regularly turns up in places like Baghdad or Brazzaville that might give other chief executives pause.
During the interview, the Zubair field in Iraq was on his mind. ''We have a company with 150 expatriates in Iraq, with a huge effort for security, and the economic result for us is very little, since we are paid $2 per barrel,'' he said. ''From time to time, we ask ourselves: Is it worth it?''
Eni is the largest foreign producer of oil and gas in both Algeria and Libya. Eni executives say they were surprised and shocked by what happened to BP and Statoil, which are partners in the Algerian plant that was seized, and are tightening up their own security measures. They note that Eni already has large numbers of Algerian troops inside the perimeters of its Algerian sites, while troops apparently were not posted inside the seized complex at In Amenas.
So far, Mr. Scaroni has smoothly sailed Eni through Libya's chaotic transition from the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to a new government that is still trying to find its balance. Unlike most other oil companies, Eni thrived under the Qaddafi regime, developing new fields and building a $9 billion facility at Mellitah, west of Tripoli, to pipe natural gas under the Mediterranean.
Mr. Scaroni was quick to go to Benghazi in April 2011 to meet the rebel leadership, even before Colonel Qaddafi's fall. Since then, Eni has restored most of its Libyan production, which represents 14 percent of Eni's oil and natural gas output.
But Mr. Scaroni knows he cannot be complacent. The Wafa field, an important Eni site in Libya, is 35 kilometers, or 22 miles, east of In Amenas. The Libyans do have a special incentive for protecting the field: It keeps the lights on in that country, producing 50 percent of the gas that fuels Libyan power plants.
In gaining early access to Mozambique, Eni trumped other major oil companies, which have been shut out of the country, even though it was the scene of four of the five largest finds worldwide last year.
''We missed East Africa,'' Mike Daly, BP's head of exploration, lamented at a recent conference. ''Eni are the people who have been the most successful there.''
With the finds in Mozambique, along with others in the Barents Sea and off Indonesia, Mr. Scaroni has leeway to do what one of Eni's big shareholders, Knight Vinke Asset Management, an activist fund manager based in Monaco, has been urging: focus on exploration and production and get rid of extraneous assets.
He is gradually selling Eni's holdings in other businesses, including SNAM, a regulated natural gas distribution business in Italy, and a 33 percent holding in GALP, a Portuguese oil company. Those deals have raised about &#x20ac;7.4 billion, or $9.9 billion, and have helped cut net debt. ''We are preparing the balance sheet to be ready to develop all the discoveries we have made,'' Mr. Scaroni said, noting that Eni faced a ''season of big capital expenditure'' before reaping the rewards of added production.
Given the new focus, Mr. Scaroni has resisted selling Eni's controlling stake in Saipem, a drilling and engineering subsidiary. That is despite Saipem's having embarrassed Eni in December when Milan prosecutors said they were investigating company executives over suspicions of corruption in Algeria.
As part of that episode, Saipem's chief executive resigned; so did Eni's chief financial officer, who had previously been finance chief at Saipem.
The combination of discoveries and disposals plus the prospect of a buyback of as much as &#x20ac;6 billion of the company's stock helped lift Eni's share price 15 percent last year. That was the second-best stock performance among major oil companies, after Rosneft of Russia, according to Bernstein Research, an investment analysis firm. Eni's stock is up an additional 5.6 percent so far in January.
For investors, that is a welcome change for a company that had previously lagged behind its peers. ''We have to give them credit for executing,'' said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein in London.
To keep up the strong performance, though, Eni faces some difficult tasks and decisions. A big question is whether Eni -- or Anadarko, for that matter -- has what it takes to manage Mozambique's likely transition from a small onshore producer to potentially one of the world's leading natural gas exporters, on a scale with Australia and Qatar. To export to the Asian customers that are the most likely buyers, Mozambique will need huge liquefied natural gas plants for preparing the gas for shipping, as well as other facilities that do not yet exist.
Neither Eni nor Anadarko has strong credentials in processing and shipping liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., which requires skills beyond those required for conveying natural gas via pipelines. Another complexity will be the remote location of the facilities.
''Northern Mozambique is pretty much a frontier area lacking any infrastructure; this will add to the challenges of developing Mozambique L.N.G.,'' said Mansur Mohammed, an analyst in Edinburgh for Wood Mackenzie, an energy and mining research firm. Mr. Mohammed estimated the cost of the initial phase of the projects at about $50 billion.
Mr. Scaroni said that Mozambique would become larger than any investment Eni had previously made. He acknowledged that he was talking to other companies about selling potential stakes, though he said Eni preferred to do more exploration and initial development before bringing in partners.
On Dec. 21, Eni and Anadarko signed an agreement to build L.N.G. facilities together, which could help cut costs.
A logical partner would be Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world's leading L.N.G. players. Shell agreed last year to buy Cove Energy, a small British company that holds an 8.5 percent stake in Anadarko's Mozambique block. But Shell was outbid by PTT Exploration & Production of Thailand, which paid about £1.2 billion, or $1.9 billion.
Based on the Cove sale, Eni figures that its share of Mozambique natural gas is valued in the $15 billion range.
Mr. Scaroni said that under its president, Armando Guebuza, Mozambique had devised a ''very reasonable'' program for developing its oil and natural gas resources with the aid of advisers from Norway, a country whose petroleum system has become a model for new producers. The government of Mozambique seems to have little problem with its foreign partners making profits, but it wants to make sure that natural gas is used for the country's development.
''The government seems to signal that it wants the commercial companies to make a good profit but not to give them the lion's share,'' said Bjorn-Erik Leerberg, a partner at Simonsen, a Norwegian law firm that has been advising Mozambique.
Mozambique is not expected to start producing the offshore natural gas until late in this decade at the earliest. Bernstein has said it expects Mozambique to yield very high returns on investment, close to 30 percent, for its gas developers. Of course, achieving that sort of profit would require a stable government; continued high prices for natural gas in Asia, which have yet to be affected by the shale gas boom in the United States; and smooth and efficient operations.
Eni's track record on major projects has not always been stellar. Delays and cost overruns have reduced returns to an estimated 7 percent on the giant Kashagan project in Kazakhstan, where Eni was the operator until 2008, according to Bernstein. That is below Eni's 8 percent cost of capital. The estimated $48 billion first phase of the project is about eight years behind schedule.
Eni is considered a major producer, with output equivalent to about 1.7 million barrels a day. Its output is double that of a large independent like Anadarko. While it is only half the size of Shell, by any other standard, Eni is huge: 79,000 employees and net profit of &#x20ac;6.3 billion for the first nine months of last year. The Italian government holds a 30 percent stake.
The corporate credo is that it is a ''two-flag'' company -- one that tries to work as a cooperative partner with its host countries. In the case of the Republic of Congo, Eni yielded to the president's request that Eni expand one power plant and build another for the country, which was short of generating capacity.
Mr. Scaroni has also been supportive of Russian energy projects including Southstream, a proposal for bringing Russian natural gas to Western Europe by means of a pipeline under the Black Sea, bypassing countries like Ukraine. That cooperation has helped Eni obtain a foothold in the Russian Arctic through a venture with the state oil company Rosneft in the Barents Sea, where Eni has already had success on the Norwegian side.
As for Mozambique, Mr. Scaroni said he had visited the country seven or eight times, once during the Christmas holiday in late 2011. A picture in his office shows his son with a fish he caught during that visit.
''I meet the president every time I go there,'' he said of Mr. Guebuza. ''I am keeping him informed about potential partners; every change in the consortium has to have their approval.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Worries Ebb, Small Investors Propel Markets

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER; Floyd Norris contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans seem to be falling in love with stocks again.
Millions of people all but abandoned the market after the 2008 financial crisis, but now individual investors are pouring more money than they have in years into stock mutual funds. The flood, prompted by fading economic threats and better news on housing and jobs, has helped propel the broad market to within striking distance of its highest nominal level ever.
''You've got a real sea change in investor outlook,'' said Andrew Wilkinson, the chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak Associates.
While the rising market may lift the nation's collective spirits, it will not necessarily restore everyone's portfolios. In good times and bad, many individual investors tend to buy and sell at precisely the wrong moments. They dump stocks after the market falls and buy stocks after the market rises, the opposite of what investors aim to do. 
Some market experts worry that might be happening this time, too. People who got out as stocks plummeted in 2008 and early 2009 have already missed a remarkable rally. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has soared 120 percent since March 2009, passing the 1,500 milestone. This year alone, the main indexes are up 5 percent. Now, the investing public seems more afraid of missing out than of misreading Wall Street again.
Americans' latest stock-market romance is young, and it could easily fade before it becomes something more serious. Some market watchers warn that given the big run-up in prices, the market is already ripe for at least a brief correction.
Still, the optimism that has pervaded the market in recent weeks is a drastic change from recent years. Until recently, many investors had continued to shy away from stocks in the face of a trio of hovering problems -- the potential breakdown of the euro zone, fears of a stalling Chinese economy and political brinkmanship in Washington that threatened to drive the economy into a new recession.
One after another, these threats appear to have dissipated. This week Congress found at least a short-term way around the nation's debt ceiling, sidestepping Republican threats to let the government default when it reached a self-imposed borrowing limit in February or March.
As the fog of crisis has cleared, investors have more clearly focused on the cascade of good economic data pointing to a growing housing market, shrinking unemployment and corporate earnings that were stronger than expected.
''The last few weeks represent the belief that there will be no existential threat to any large global economy in 2013,'' said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at BNY ConvergEx group.
Jim Cole, a 52-year-old employee at the Bank of the West in San Francisco, had most of the money in his individual retirement account in cash at the end of 2012 as he awaited a bad outcome to the fiscal negotiations in Washington. Since Congress reached its agreement, he has put almost all of that money to work in stocks.
''I just bought some more stock this morning,'' Mr. Cole said Friday. ''There doesn't seem to be this swirl of impending doom hanging over the U.S. economy or the world economy looking out six to 12 months from now.''
The optimism about the economy and corporate profits has helped fuel eight straight positive days for the S. & P. 500, the longest such run since 2004. The S.& P. 500 finished Friday up 8.14 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,502.96.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,895.98, near its high. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 19.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,149.71, still well below its peak in 2000.
There is no surefire data to use to gauge the behavior of retail investors. Some of those who left stock-focused mutual funds in recent years have put the money instead into specific stocks or exchange-traded funds, which hold baskets of stocks. But analysts agree that most indicators point to rising confidence in the market.
The level of bullishness among small investors has nearly doubled just since mid-November, according to a weekly survey conducted by the American Association of Individual Investors.
In the last three weeks, the market data company Lipper reported that $14.9 billion had gone into all stock-focused mutual funds, the most in any three-week period since 2001. Mutual funds focused specifically on American stocks have collected $6.8 billion since the new year, the most in all but one comparable period since the financial crisis.
This comes after investors had removed $416 billion from stock-focused mutual funds since the start of the financial crisis, according to Lipper. Those outflows continued even as the market climbed over the last few years.
Many retail investors leaving stocks have put their money into bonds, which have historically been less risky. There is now concern that those people could face losses if professional investors sell their bonds and buy stocks, which would push up interest rates and make current bond holdings less valuable. Interest rates were higher on Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 27/32, to 97 4/32 and the yield rose to 1.95 percent from 1.85 percent late Thursday.
Since the market bottomed in March 2009, professional investors have bid up the price of American stocks, partly in response to bumper profits at American companies. The Federal Reserve has also tried to encourage investors to move into riskier assets like stocks by pushing interest rates lower, which makes bank deposits and new bonds less attractive. The S.& P. 500 is close to its nominal high of 1,565 but remains below its record high -- reached in 2000 -- after adjusting for inflation and taking dividends into account.
But many investors have been hesitant about entering the market because of the slow recovery of the economy. Now, a number of recent data points suggests that the recovery may be gaining traction. This week, new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in five years.
Even many optimistic strategists say that a short-term break from the market rally is likely until there are more indications that the economy is growing. And given that January is historically a strong month for stocks, more bearish analysts have said the recent rally is likely to fade. One drag on growth could come from the recent increase in payroll taxes.
There is also a sizable contingent of investors who think that the European debt crisis and United States fiscal position still represent significant threats.
But Russ Koesterich, the chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said that the current threats were ''mundane'' in comparison to what investors faced the last few years. ''We're not talking about big crises anymore,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Prison Population Can Shrink When Police Crowd the Streets

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Now that the United States has the world's highest reported rate of incarceration, many criminologists are contemplating another strategy. What if America reverted to the penal policies of the 1980s? What if the prison population shrank drastically? What if money now spent guarding cellblocks was instead used for policing the streets?
In short, what would happen if the rest of the country followed New York City's example?
As the American prison population has doubled in the past two decades, the city has been a remarkable exception to the trend: the number of its residents in prison has shrunk. Its incarceration rate, once high by national standards, has plunged well below the United States average and has hit another new low, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced recently. And crime in the city has fallen by more than 75 percent, almost twice as much as in the rest of the country. 
Whatever has made New York the safest big city in America, that feat has certainly not been accomplished by locking up more criminals.
''The precise causes of New York's crime decline will be debated by social scientists until the Sun hits the Earth,'' said Michael Jacobson, a criminologist who ran the city's Correction and Probation Departments during the 1990s and is now the president of the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice research group. ''But the 50,000-foot story from New York is that you can drive down crime while decreasing your jail and prison population -- and save a huge amount of money in the process.''
New York's singular success has attracted attention across the country from public officials whose budgets have been strained by the prison boom. The 2.3 million people behind bars in America, a fifth of the world's prisoners, cost taxpayers more than $75 billion a year. The strict penal policies were intended to reduce crime, but they have led to a historic, if largely unrecognized, shift in priorities away from policing.
''The United States today is the only country I know of that spends more on prisons than police,'' said Lawrence W. Sherman, an American criminologist on the faculties of the University of Maryland and Cambridge University in Britain. ''In England and Wales, the spending on police is twice as high as on corrections. In Australia it's more than three times higher. In Japan it's seven times higher. Only in the United States is it lower, and only in our recent history.''
Before the era of mass incarceration began in the 1980s, local policing accounted for more than 40 percent of spending for criminal justice, while 25 percent went to prisons and parole programs. But since 1990, nearly 35 percent has gone to the prison system, while the portion of criminal justice spending for local policing has fallen to slightly more than 30 percent.
New York, while now an exception to the mass-incarceration trend, also happens to be the place that inspired it. When New York State four decades ago commissioned an evaluation of programs to rehabilitate criminals, the conclusions were so discouraging that the researchers were initially forbidden to publish them.
Eventually one of the criminologists, Robert Martinson, summarized the results in 1974 in the journal Public Interest. His article, ''What Works? Questions and Answers About Prison Reform,'' was soon known as the ''nothing works'' thesis. Dr. Martinson concluded that rehabilitation strategies ''cannot overcome, or even appreciably reduce, the powerful tendencies of offenders to continue in criminal behavior.''
An outgrowth of the study was a consensus to eliminate parole for many offenders and to mandate long sentences determined by formulas rather than rely on the discretion of judges and parole boards.
Dr. Martinson wrote an article in 1979 recanting his ''nothing works'' conclusion, but by then it was too late. The trend toward tougher sentences continued, causing prison populations to grow rapidly in the 1980s throughout the country, including in New York. When crime kept rising anyway, sentences often were further lengthened.
But New York diverged from the national trend in the early 1990s, when it began expanding its police force and introduced a computerized system to track crimes and complaints. Officers also aggressively enforced laws against guns, illegal drugs and petty crimes like turnstile jumping in the subways. Arrests for misdemeanors increased sharply.
Yet serious crime went down. So though more people were being locked up for brief periods -- including many who were unable to make bail and were awaiting trial -- the local jail population was shrinking and fewer city residents were serving time in state prisons.
''Even with more people coming into the system, the overall bed count was declining because people weren't staying as long,'' Dr. Jacobson, who was correction commissioner from 1995 to 1998, recalled.
''It was a nightmare to administer because there was so much churning and turnover, but it was good news for the city.''
Saving $1.5 Billion a Year
Even as the city grew by nearly a million people in the last two decades, the number of New Yorkers behind bars fell by a third, to below 40,000 today.
If the city had followed the national trend, nearly 60,000 additional New Yorkers would be behind bars today, and the number of city and state correction officers would have more than doubled since 1990, said Franklin E. Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California, Berkeley.
By not expanding the jail and prison populations, he calculates in his 2011 book, ''The City That Became Safe,'' the city and the state have been saving $1.5 billion a year, more than twice as much as it cost to finance the additional police officers in the 1990s.
The crime decline, which has lasted for two decades, has been so striking that some critics wonder if the police stopped reporting some offenses. The police vehemently deny that, and numbers have continued dropping even for crimes that are difficult to hide -- homicides, most notably.
Policing, of course, is not the only possible explanation for the safer streets. A shift in demographics, the arrival of new immigrants, the waning of the crack epidemic, and other economic and social changes had an impact on neighborhoods in New York -- and in the rest of the country, where crime also declined in the 1990s.
But the drop was much steeper and more prolonged in New York than elsewhere. And while researchers attributed about a quarter of the decline in the rest of America to the stricter penal policies, that explanation did not apply to a city that was locking up fewer people. Something else was responsible, and criminologists have been trying to figure out how to repeat it.
''The intellectual tragedy of the New York crime miracle is that it had no experiments to identify just what worked,'' Dr. Sherman said.
His frustration is shared by David Weisburd, a criminologist at George Mason University in Virginia and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
''As long as crime is going down, New York's police don't seem to want to know which strategies are working and which aren't,'' Dr. Weisburd said. ''When I proposed an experiment to one police official in the last administration, he replied, 'You could only bring me bad news.' ''
Elsewhere, studies have shown that crime drops when more police officers are hired, so it is not surprising that the expansion of New York's police force in the 1990s by more than a third was accompanied by a drop in crime. But during the past decade, the force has shrunk by 15 percent, and yet crime has mostly continued falling.
When Dr. Zimring and other criminologists look at this trend, and compare it with the fluctuating crime rates in other cities, they conclude that the retreat in crime in New York is not just a matter of the number of police officers. Those officers must be doing something right, but what exactly?
The most likely answer is a shift in strategy called hot-spot policing.
In the 1970s, research had shown that a small percentage of criminals committed a large share of crimes, so it had seemed logical to concentrate on catching repeat offenders and locking them up.
But after computerized crime mapping was introduced, it turned out that crime was even more concentrated by place than by person.
In city after city, researchers found that half of crimes occur within about 5 percent of an urban area -- a few buildings, intersections and blocks, often near transit stops and businesses like convenience stores, bars and nightclubs.
The criminal population keeps changing as men in their 30s drop out and are replaced by teenagers, but crimes keep occurring at the same places.
A Focus on Hot Spots
Researchers suggested: Perhaps the authorities should pay less attention to individual criminals and more attention to the hot spots where they operate.
Dr. Sherman, Dr. Weisburd and colleagues have tested the idea in randomized experiments in Jersey City; Houston; Kansas City, Mo.; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; Sacramento; and cities in Britain and Australia.
Typically, a list of hot spots was identified, and then half were randomly chosen to receive extra police attention, like more frequent patrols. Other strategies were also used, like improving street lighting, fencing vacant lots or arresting people for minor violations.
As hoped, there were fewer crimes and complaints at the hot spots chosen for extra attention than at those that were not. And once police officers started to show up often and at unpredictable intervals, they did not need to stay more than 15 minutes to have a lasting impact.
Nonetheless, the hot-spot strategy was initially met with skepticism by police veterans.
''We assumed that if we hit one area hard, the crime would just move somewhere else,'' said Frank Gajewski, a former police chief of Jersey City, who worked with Dr. Weisburd on the experiments there.
But Dr. Weisburd won over Mr. Gajewski and other skeptics -- and also won the 2010 Stockholm Prize, criminology's version of the Nobel -- by showing that crime was not simply being displaced. Moreover, he and his colleagues reported a ''spatial diffusion of crime prevention benefits'' because crime also declined in adjoining areas, as the police in Jersey City had observed.
''Crime doesn't move as easily we thought it did,'' Mr. Gajewski said. ''If I'm a robber, I want to be in a familiar, easily accessible place with certain characteristics. I need targets to rob, but I don't want people in the neighborhood watching me or challenging me. Maybe I work near a bus stop where there are vacant buildings or empty lots. If the police start focusing there, I can't just move to the next block and find the same conditions.''
After more than two dozen experiments around the world, criminologists generally agree that hot-spot policing is ''an effective crime prevention strategy,'' in the words of Anthony Braga, a criminologist at Harvard and Rutgers who led a review of the research literature last year.
Many experts also see it as the best explanation for the crime drop in New York. Although the city's police did not participate in randomized experiments, they did use computerized crime mapping to focus on hot spots in the 1990s. This strategy was intensified with a program called Operation Impact, which was started in 2003 by Raymond W. Kelly, then and now the police commissioner.
Commissioner Kelly gives the strategy credit for the continued decline of crime despite the reduced police force.
There is supporting evidence from Dennis C. Smith, a political scientist at New York University who led an analysis of trends in the dozens of precincts where the city's police focus on ''impact zones,'' as the hot spots are called. Rates of murder, rape, grand larceny, robbery and assault declined significantly faster in precincts with hot-spot policing than in those without it.
The Stop-and-Frisk Debate
One part of the hot-spot strategy in New York has been highly controversial: the stopping and frisking of hundreds of thousands of people each year, ostensibly to search for weapons or other contraband.
Some critics say that the tactic has been used so often and so brusquely in New York that it has undermined policing by arousing disrespect for the law, especially among young black and Latino men, who are disproportionately stopped and searched. Research shows that people who feel treated unfairly by the police can become more likely to commit crimes in the future.
''The million-dollar question in policing right now is whether there are ways to get the benefits of stop-and-frisk without the collateral costs,'' said Jens Ludwig, an economist who directs the University of Chicago Crime Lab. He found benefits from the tactic -- a decline in gunshot injuries -- in an experiment with the Pittsburgh police.
''Getting the police to stop people more often and search them for illegal guns does help keep guns off the street and reduce gun violence,'' Dr. Ludwig said. ''That's not to say whether or not stop-and-frisk is worth the costs that the practice imposes on society. But there's a complicated trade-off here that needs to be acknowledged.''
Defenders of stop-and-frisk, including Mayor Bloomberg, argue that when it is done properly and politely, the practice prevents crimes that disproportionately hurt the city's minorities.
''If New York went back to the policing of the 1980s,'' Dr. Smith said, ''there would be hundreds of thousands more victims of serious crimes every year, and the great majority of them would be African-American and Hispanic.''
Police officials note that if the homicide rate of the 1980s persisted, 1,200 additional New Yorkers, most of them black or Latino men, would have been killed last year -- when the police recorded 417 murders. Further, if the city's incarceration rate had followed the national trend, an additional 100,000 black and Hispanic men would have been sent to prison in the past decade, Dr. Zimring calculates.
Whether or not other cities adopt New York's specific stop-and-frisk tactics, social scientists say the rest of the country could benefit by adding police officers and concentrating on hot spots.
Dr. Ludwig and Philip J. Cook, a Duke University economist, calculate that nationwide, money diverted from prison to policing would buy at least four times as much reduction in crime. They suggest shrinking the prison population by a quarter and using the savings to hire another 100,000 police officers.
Diverting that money to the police would be tricky politically, because corrections budgets are zealously defended in state capitals by prison administrators, unions and legislators.
But there is at least one prison administrator, Dr. Jacobson, the former correction commissioner in New York, who would send the money elsewhere.
''If you had a dollar to spend on reducing crime, and you looked at the science instead of the politics, you would never spend it on the prison system,'' Dr. Jacobson said. ''There is no better example of big government run amok.''
That is the same lesson that William J. Bratton draws from his experience as New York's police commissioner in the 1990s. ''We showed in New York that the future of policing is not in handcuffs,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''The United States has locked up so many people that it has the highest incarceration rate in the world, but we can't arrest and incarcerate our way out of crime. We need to focus on preventing crime instead of responding to it.''

HEADLINE: As Republicans Debate Future Direction, One Senator Decides He Will Step Aside

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jeff Zeleny reported from Charlotte, and Jonathan Weisman from Washington.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The next round of Republican primary fights is not far away, which prompted Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana to offer a blunt warning this week: ''We've got to stop being the stupid party.''
With bruising defeats from the last two election cycles still fresh in his mind, particularly the races that helped cost Republicans control of the Senate, Mr. Jindal's stern message to his party highlighted the divisions among Republicans as they try to restore their brand and rebuild.
The critiques many Republicans have about their party are rooted in the divisive primary campaigns that have knocked out veteran lawmakers, only to produce flawed candidates who have uttered highly charged statements that have alienated many voters.
The challenge was highlighted anew on Friday as Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, announced his intention to step down next year. In doing so, he avoids a contentious ideological battle that has toppled several fellow Republicans seen in Washington as steady and valuable members of the party's mainstream. 
The difficulties facing the Republican Party are framed by Mr. Jindal's urgent plea, which he delivered here Thursday evening to a meeting of the Republican National Committee, and the retirement of Mr. Chambliss. Mr. Chambliss had faced bracing criticism -- and a possible primary challenge on his right flank -- for his work with Democrats to find a bipartisan deficit reduction plan that would have included added tax revenues as well as spending cuts.
Party elders also argue that the recurring fiscal brinkmanship in Washington has been wrongheaded for Republicans, who often seem to be willing to risk the nation's economy simply to get their way. At the same time, some Republicans expressed dismay at the inability of conservative House members to see the end-of-year tax deal as a victory since it made permanent nearly all the Bush-era tax cuts, though it raises taxes on the most affluent.
Republicans also came under criticism this week for what some saw as clumsy and ill-informed questioning of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during hearings on the attack on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, initially questioned whether Mrs. Clinton's emotional response at the Senate hearing to the four American deaths was manufactured to duck questions. He later said he should not have speculated, but some conservatives applauded the aggressive line.
The competing schools of thought illustrate the conflicting currents pulling the Republican Party in opposite directions: Even as Mr. Jindal and an array of leaders are encouraging the party to temper its tone and appeal to a broader set of voters, its core conservative voters continue to punish Republicans who do just that. For his deficit negotiations with seven other senators, Republican and Democrat, Mr. Chambliss had raised the ire of Tea Party groups and other conservatives, who actively promoted primary challenges.
Reince Priebus, who was re-elected on Friday to a second term as chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it was imperative for the party to expand its appeal to a wider cross-section of voters. He said the party did not need to dilute its principles, but should raise its tolerance.
''There is one clear, overriding lesson from November: We didn't have enough votes,'' Mr. Priebus said. ''We have to find more supporters. We have to go places we haven't been and invite new people to join us.''
The message is complicated by the divisions inside the Republican Party. Those were underscored in Georgia, where Mr. Chambliss faced potential challenges from Representative Tom Price, a leading conservative voice in the House, or Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state who lost her run for the governorship, despite the backing of Sarah Palin.
In his retirement announcement, Mr. Chambliss expressed confidence that he would have beaten such foes, even as he voiced his frustration that compromise was increasingly impossible in Washington.
''I have no doubt that had I decided to be a candidate, I would have won re-election,'' he said. ''Instead, this is about frustration, both at a lack of leadership from the White House and at the dearth of meaningful action from Congress.''
Party leaders debated the future of the Republican Party with an air of humility after losing the White House and seats in the House and the Senate. In interviews here over the last three days, the state officials said they intended to try to bring more discipline to the primary campaigns in 2014 to avoid ending up with a nominee who has little hope of winning a general election.
They widely applauded Mr. Jindal's terse admonition to the party.
''He's right,'' said Lenny Curry, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. ''We have allowed the message to get out that the Republican Party is the party of no and doesn't care about diverse groups of people. It's just nonsense.''
But the conservative groups that have fueled such primary challenges have shown little willingness to back down. The Tea Party movement is watching the fiscal debate carefully and already placing Republicans on notice.
Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, who is based in Georgia, said she was Mr. Chambliss's 2008 re-election chairwoman in Cherokee County, an outer suburb of Atlanta.
After his vote for the Wall Street bailout that year, she said she could not get Republican activists to take her yard signs. Her own husband refused to vote for him. With Mr. Chambliss's work on the deficit, conservative activists turned on him en masse, she said.
''Georgia's a solid Republican state where the people elected as Republicans should be sticking with the principles of fiscal responsibility,'' she said. ''When you increase the debt limit, when you raise taxes and haven't cut even a single penny, that's not responsible.''
Ms. Martin, whose group has actively sought primary challengers for Republican veterans, bristled at Mr. Jindal's criticism of candidates like Richard E. Mourdock of Indiana and Todd Akin of Missouri.
But others in the party latched on to Mr. Jindal's entreaties.
Tom Davis, a former congressman who once headed the Republican's House campaign arm, said the problem went beyond the party's failure to win over minority voters. Educated and affluent suburban voters who were once the Republican Party's backbone have drifted to the Democrats, he said. In their absence, the party is attracting a more populist, less educated core.
''Everybody says it's changing demographics. It's not just that,'' Mr. Davis said. ''A lot of former Republicans are voting Democratic.''

HEADLINE: How Much Law School Is Enough?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Make Law Schools Earn a Third Year,'' by Daniel B. Rodriguez and Samuel Estreicher (Op-Ed, Jan. 18), argued that legal education should be reduced from the traditional three years to two. Even as a second-year law student (saddled with loans and still not in sight of graduation), I find this effort to make law school more affordable misguided.
In any law school, the first year is devoted entirely to broad survey courses. The second and third, by contrast, combine more of the same with opportunities for practical experience and interdisciplinary study. Compressing these years into one would require the retention of the survey courses (needed to pass the bar) and the reduction or elimination of the rest. A result would be all breadth and no depth. 
Yet the J.D. was originally intended to encompass not just the study of law but the whole social context in which law takes place, the study of ''the whole field of man as a social being,'' as one university president ambitiously put it.
In a world that already conceives of lawyers as failing to look past laws and cases to the human beings they govern, such depth should be required, not optional.
BILL WATSON Chicago, Jan. 18, 2013
To the Editor:
Hurray for Daniel B. Rodriguez and Samuel Estreicher's plea to let students take the New York State bar exam after two years of law school rather than three. Law firms today regularly hire after a summer internship following the second year. But the students must return to school, forgoing perhaps $100,000 in earnings and increasing debt by $50,000.
The third year is claimed to offer ''clinical'' expertise and studies in a specialty. But real practice teaches clinical skills, and the specialty pursued is often that of a professor. Midcareer, when a lawyer finally knows his specialty, would be a good time to return for further training.
So let the market decide whether law students who pass the bar exam after two years' study are ready to be hired.
FRANCIS DUMMER FISHER Austin, Tex., Jan. 18, 2013
The writer, a lawyer, is a senior research fellow at the L.B.J. School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin.
To the Editor:
The problem with law schools (and I see this from a vantage point of practicing law for more than 40 years and hiring lawyers just out of law school) is not one of economics -- the price of a third year of law school. Rather, the problem is one of students not getting value for their money.
Law schools have never figured out a way to train law school graduates so that they are ready to practice law. Law school graduates often do not know the way to the courthouse and everything that comes before the courthouse. Today, a recent law school graduate is able only to be a clerk for a United States Supreme Court justice, but not able to practice law in any real sense.
Other professional schools have figured out a way to obtain competent and experienced professors who can transmit their skills to the students. Not so in law schools. The law school graduate is fit to perform virtually none of the basic things that a lawyer must do.
Adding to the problem is that judges, who are among the most overworked and underpaid professionals in the country, will have to spend their time in on-the-job training.
Frankly, law school is a waste of money for the students and their parents, and is best equated to the price one must pay to belong to a union.
RAOUL LIONEL FELDER New York, Jan. 22, 2013
To the Editor:
Penny-wise and pound-foolish best describes the proposal for two years of law school instead of three.
As Daniel B. Rodriguez and Samuel Estreicher correctly note, the first two years of law school are largely taken up with courses that are intended to provide knowledge that every lawyer must have. But all lawyers are not alike.
Some will practice admiralty law, some patent law, and some will specialize in leveraged lease transactions. Only in the third year of law school is there time for students to roam various legal fields and find -- perhaps unexpectedly -- the one most suitable to them.
By putting economic pressure on them to forgo that opportunity, we would impoverish not just them and their future employers but, most critically, their clients.

HEADLINE: Japan's Role in Making Batteries for Boeing's 787

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
As the search for the cause of smoldering batteries in Boeing's grounded 787 Dreamliner continues, investigators and Congressional oversight committees may want to look into a related and potentially sensitive issue: how was the Japanese company GS Yuasa chosen to manufacture the innovative but now suspect lithium-ion batteries on the 787?
No one has claimed that GS Yuasa was chosen for the 787 on anything but merit. But Boeing has long been dogged by suspicions that in return for its awarding major contracts to Japanese companies, which also receive subsidies from Japan's government, the country's airlines buy Boeing aircraft almost exclusively.
Such arrangements are banned by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, signed by the United States and Japan, which requires that aircraft purchases be made solely on the basis of ''commercial and technological'' factors and that procurement contracts should be entered into only on the basis of ''competitive price, quality and delivery.'' The agreement is intended to ensure that purchase decisions are based ''strictly on technical and commercial factors,'' according to the United States trade representative. 
''The world has made tremendous progress'' at eliminating political influence from the sale of aircraft and components, Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace and aviation analyst for the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Washington, told me this week. ''And then, there's Japan. All the normal ways of doing things are upended.'' Is there a quid pro quo? ''Yes, absolutely. But no one will talk about it, and no one can prove it,'' he said.
A former Boeing executive confirmed this when we spoke this week. After asking not to be named because of the diplomatic fragility of the topic, he said: ''Let me put it this way: we knew the Japanese market would be Boeing's in return for our selecting these Japanese partners. It was a silent understanding, and there was nothing in writing.'' He added that Boeing's Japanese suppliers had received low-interest loans from the Japanese government repayable only out of future profits.
Although the Japanese airlines and suppliers are independent companies, ''in Japan there's a unique relationship between the airlines, the suppliers and the government,'' according to the former Boeing official. ''It's cultural. The officials all went to the same schools and have close personal relationships. The government supported the airlines and the industries and they developed together. The government has enormous influence. They all work together.''
As a Boeing vice president and former Boeing Japan president, Nicole Piasecki, told the company magazine in 2008: ''These aren't just relationships with people in business. The Japanese government is a powerful and important part of all economic activity and industrial development. So part of relationship building is negotiating these two important spheres of influence in Japan and understanding it's all tied together.''
Mr. Aboulafia agreed that Japan was unique. ''This is the way things used to be in the days before free trade,'' he said. ''Japan is the last unreconstructed believer in industrial policy writ large.''
The Japanese External Trade Organization referred questions to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which had no immediate comment.
In response to my questions, Boeing declined to address the specific choice of GS Yuasa for the 787 batteries, but said, ''In general, internal and external suppliers of the 787 program were selected based on their ability to do the work with the high quality, affordability and reliability that customers expect from Boeing and that Boeing demands of its partners.'' Boeing added that ''GS Yuasa provides the batteries under subcontract to Thales,'' the French company responsible for the 787's electrical systems, but confirmed that Boeing approved the choice and that all subcontractors had to meet Boeing's quality standards.
Nonetheless, there's circumstantial evidence to support suspicions that quality and price may not be the only factors affecting the choice of Boeing's Japanese partners. Japan's market for commercial aircraft is dominated by Boeing to a degree unrivaled by any other country. Over the last decade, Boeing supplied over 80 percent of the aircraft ordered by Japanese customers. The nation's flagship airline, Japan Airlines, has never ordered a plane from Airbus, Boeing's rival. The Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways flew the 787's maiden commercial flight and has placed an initial order for 50 aircraft. Boeing said that over the last 50 years, Japanese carriers had ordered 900 Boeing aircraft, making Japan one of its top markets by dollar volume.
Airbus has struggled to gain traction in the Japanese market. Evidently taking a page from the Boeing playbook, it said it invested an estimated $4.6 billion with Japanese suppliers for its jumbo A380. But $4.6 billion is a drop in the bucket compared with Boeing's spending over the decades. Airbus has since booked four orders for the A380 from the low-cost Japanese carrier Skymark Airlines. Airbus has long accused the Japanese government of engaging in improper subsidies to Boeing; an Airbus executive called the 787 the most heavily subsidized civil aircraft in history.
China hasn't signed the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, and aviation analysts have been watching closely to see if it will follow Japan's lead or embrace a free trade approach. Airbus has invested more heavily than Boeing in China, where Airbus built its first assembly line outside of Europe. But so far, its market share in the rapidly growing Chinese market has remained about the same as Boeing's. China is also trying to develop its own domestic aircraft industry to compete with Boeing and Airbus.
Boeing patronage has certainly brought benefits to Japan. Its three giant ''heavy'' industries -- Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji -- have been significant partners with Boeing since the development of the 767. According to Boeing, they supply major components of the 767 and 777 airframes and were closely involved in the 777's design. The company said its Japanese partners designed and developed 35 percent of the 787 airframe structure, including the main wing box, which is the first time Boeing has ever entrusted such a critical design component to another company. Under their agreements with Boeing, they produce components almost exclusively for Boeing. Mitsubishi is now manufacturing its own regional jet thanks in part to what it learned from working with Boeing.
Boeing said that more than 65 Japanese companies were suppliers for both commercial and military products. Boeing said it directly or indirectly employed 22,000 people in Japan, or 42 percent of the country's aerospace work force. Boeing also has close ties to Japan's Defense Ministry, and the company said the two had ''a long history of working together to meet Japan's defense needs.''
Besides pursuing aviation and aerospace, Japan announced last July, as part of its ''Rebirth of Japan'' strategy, that battery technology would be one of its top areas for development and investment. GS Yuasa makes no secret of the fact that its money-losing lithium-ion battery operation has received subsidies from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, most recently 318.7 billion yen (or about $3.5 billion) to begin mass production of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicles. (Japan is hardly the only country subsidizing the battery industry. A123 Systems, a manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries based in Massachusetts, filed for bankruptcy last year despite a $249 million grant from the Energy Department.)
Landing the 787 contract was a huge boost for GS Yuasa and for Japan's efforts in aviation technology. Though not well known outside of Japan, the company describes itself as Japan's leading manufacturer of batteries and said it had supplied lithium-ion batteries for over 50 satellites ''without anomaly or failure.'' Still, this was its first effort in commercial aviation. ''I had never heard of Yuasa in the aviation context,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. GS Yuasa has since been chosen to supply lithium-ion batteries for the International Space Station. Although Pratt & Whitney nominally chose the company, Boeing is the prime contractor on the space station.
There were better-known and more experienced suppliers of lithium-ion batteries for aviation uses when GS Yuasa was chosen, including the Saft Group of France, Mr. Aboulafia said. Saft describes itself as ''the premier battery supplier to the aviation industry,'' and Airbus is using Saft lithium-ion batteries for its new A350 aircraft.
GS Yuasa may well have been the best choice for the 787. Still, all of this raises the question of whether GS Yuasa was chosen to design and manufacture the 787 batteries solely on the criteria of ''price, quality and delivery'' called for by the World Trade Organization agreement, or whether other political and commercial interests played a role. The latter ''sounds all too plausible to me,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''That doesn't mean they're incompetent. The Japanese respect engineering expertise. You can't argue that the Japanese heavy industries shouldn't have played a role in the design and development of the 787. So far, their work has been very good.''
And any questions about GS Yuasa may be premature. Although the batteries are suspected in the fires that grounded the 787 fleet, no one yet knows for sure. Both Thales, the French company responsible for the broader electrical system, and Securaplane, an American subsidiary of the British engineering firm Meggitt that makes the battery chargers, are also being investigated.
But whatever the outcome, experts said that with so many lives at stake, the design and manufacture of new aircraft should be based solely on legitimate issues of cost and quality, and the selection process for suppliers should be transparent and untainted by other commercial or political concerns.
''The greatest enemy of good aircraft is people who interfere with the freedom to shop for the highest quality,'' Mr. Aboulafia said.

HEADLINE: Work With China, Don't Contain It

BYLINE: By JOSEPH S. NYE Jr.. 
Joseph S. Nye Jr., a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and a former Pentagon official, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era.''

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
CITING an escalating dispute over islands in the East China Sea, The Economist warned last week that ''China and Japan are sliding toward war.'' That assessment may be too alarmist, but the tensions have bolstered the efforts of some American analysts who have urged a policy to ''contain'' China.
During a recent visit to China, I was struck by how many Chinese officials believe such a policy is already in place and is the central purpose of President Obama's ''pivot'' toward Asia. ''The pivot is a very stupid choice,'' Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations, declared publicly. ''The United States has achieved nothing and only annoyed China. China can't be contained,'' he added. 
Containment was designed for a different era, and it is not what the United States is, or should be, attempting now. At the start of the cold war, containment meant economic isolation of the Soviets and regional alliances like NATO to deter Moscow's military expansion. Later, to the chagrin of George F. Kennan, the father of containment, the doctrine led to the ''domino effect'' theory behind the escalation of the Vietnam War.
Cold war containment involved virtually no trade and little social contact. But China now is not what the Soviet Union was then. It is not seeking global hegemony, and the United States not only has an immense trade with China but also huge exchanges of students and tourists.
When I worked on the Pentagon's East Asia strategy in 1994, during the Clinton administration, we rejected the idea of containment for two reasons. If we treated China as an enemy, we were guaranteeing a future enemy. If we treated China as a friend, we kept open the possibility of a more peaceful future.
We devised a strategy of ''integrate but hedge'' -- something like Ronald Reagan's ''trust but verify.'' America supported China's membership in the World Trade Organization and accepted Chinese goods and visitors. But a 1996 declaration reaffirmed that the postwar United States-Japan security treaty was the basis for a stable and prosperous East Asia. President Clinton also began to improve relations with India to counterbalance China's rise.
This strategy has enjoyed bipartisan support. President George W. Bush continued to improve relations with India, while deepening economic ties with China. His deputy secretary of state, Robert B. Zoellick, made clear that America would accept the rise of China as a ''responsible stakeholder.''
Mr. Obama's ''rebalancing'' toward Asia involves moving naval resources to the Pacific, but also trade, human rights and diplomatic initiatives. As his national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, said in November, the American-Chinese relationship ''has elements of both cooperation and competition.''
Asia is not a monolith, and its internal balance of power should be the key to our strategy. Japan, India, Vietnam and other countries do not want to be dominated by China, and thus welcome an American presence in the region. Unless China is able to attract allies by successfully developing its ''soft power,'' the rise in its ''hard'' military and economic power is likely to frighten its neighbors, who will coalesce to balance its power.
A significant American military and economic presence helps to maintain the Asian balance of power and shape an environment that provides incentives for China to cooperate. After the 2008-9 financial crisis, some Chinese mistakenly believed that America was in permanent decline and that this presented new opportunities. A result was that China worsened its relations with Japan, India, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines -- a misstep that confirmed that ''only China can contain China.''
But America's rebalancing toward Asia should not be aggressive. We should heed Mr. Kennan's warning against overmilitarization and ensure that China doesn't feel encircled or endangered. The world's two largest economies have much to gain from cooperation on fighting climate change, pandemics, cyberterrorism and nuclear proliferation.
With China becoming more dependent on Middle Eastern energy, we should discuss maritime regulations to ensure free passage of ships and include China in Pacific naval exercises. We should help China develop domestic energy resources like shale gas and encourage China and Japan to revive their 2008 plan for joint undersea gas exploitation. And we should make clear that if China meets certain standards, it can join the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free-trade agreement around the Pacific Rim.
Containment is simply not a relevant policy tool for dealing with a rising China. Power is the ability to obtain the outcomes one wants, and sometimes America's power is greater when we act with others rather than merely over others.

HEADLINE: A.W. Clausen, 89, a Bank of America Chief

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
A. W. Clausen, who rose from a part-time position counting cash to become chief executive of Bank of America and to lead the World Bank in the 1980s, died on Tuesday in Burlingame, Calif. He was 89. 
The cause was complications of pneumonia, family members said.
Mr. Clausen, who was known by his nickname, Tom, was chief executive of Bank of America from 1970 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1990. He was president of the World Bank in the intervening years. When he returned to Bank of America for his second term, it was in far worse shape than when he had left.
Huge loan losses, both domestically and in Latin America, were weighing heavily on the bank's balance sheet, and it was suffering from low morale and antiquated technology.
Historically, Bank of America had rarely reached out of its inner circle to find new talent, but Mr. Clausen recruited four vice chairmen from crosstown San Francisco rival Wells Fargo to help turn things around.
''It had been the gold standard, but when he came back, it was a different bank,'' said Richard M. Rosenberg, one of the four recruited Wells executives. Mr. Clausen fought off a takeover attempt by First Interstate Bancorp, cut jobs, sold businesses to raise cash and overhauled the organization.
By the time he left, Bank of America had posted a $1 billion annual profit and was ''within shouting distance of being an excellent bank,'' Mr. Clausen said in an interview with The New York Times upon stepping down in May 1990.
Mr. Rosenberg, who succeeded Mr. Clausen as chief executive, recalled him as a serious, sober manager. ''He was not a gregarious individual; he was very intense,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''I don't think he had any hobbies. He was truly focused on the bank and running it with integrity.''
Mr. Clausen was chosen by President Jimmy Carter to lead the World Bank shortly before Mr. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan in 1980, but the new administration supported Mr. Clausen's nomination.
His tenure at the World Bank was clouded by a deep recession in the United States and criticism that the institution should have done more to ease debt problems in emerging economies.
Alden Winship Clausen was born in Hamilton, Ill., on Feb. 17, 1923, and got the nickname Tom from a character he played in a school play. His father, Morton Clausen, owned and edited the local weekly newspaper, The Hamilton Press.
The younger Mr. Clausen attended Carthage College in Illinois before serving as a flying meteorological officer in the Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946.
After receiving his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1949, Mr. Clausen took a part-time job at Bank of America while studying for the California bar and courting Mary Margaret Crassweller, who had moved to Los Angeles from Minnesota.
Soon after securing a spot in the bank's $225-a-month job training program, he married Ms. Crassweller. She died in 2001. The next year, he wed Helen Higgins, who had been his secretary at Bank of America and the World Bank.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Clausen is survived by two sons, Eric and Mark, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: An Inaugural That Spelled Evolution

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- For a measure of how the United States has changed in two generations, think about this: Most of the eminences who spoke or performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration would probably not have been able to land an advertising job at the fictional agency portrayed on the television series ''Mad Men.''
Not Mr. Obama, since he's black and his middle name is Hussein. Not Senator Charles E. Schumer, who's Jewish. Not Myrlie Evers-Williams, who gave the invocation, or Beyoncé Knowles, who sang, because they're both black and female. Speaking of female, not Kelly Clarkson, the singer -- nor Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court, who, as a Hispanic, would have been doubly problematic. Speaking of Hispanic, not the Rev. Luis Leon -- nor the inaugural poet, Richard Blanco, who is both Cuban-blooded and gay. 
Reactions to the inauguration have dwelled on Mr. Obama's ringing defense of modern liberalism. But the theater of the day was at least as telling as the speeches.
The ceremony seemed designed to expand, complicate, tie-dye the very definition of American, while suggesting an underlying unity. It celebrated, without explicitly announcing, a changing of the cultural guard -- the transition to a country no longer lorded over by the white, the male, the heterosexual, the Protestant, the native-born and the native English-speaking.
Many things about the day evoked a nation passing into new hands -- the people onstage and Mr. Obama's address, to be sure, but also the smaller gestures and moments.
You could see it in the faces on the National Mall, packed with people who, at the nation's founding, would have been thought, on account of their pigment, fit for little more than hard labor or slavery. You could hear it when Mr. Obama became the first president to utter ''gay'' at an inauguration, and spoke of a 1969 raid on a gay bar in sanctifying language normally reserved for battlefields like Lexington and Normandy. You could feel it when Justice Sotomayor, a hero to many Hispanics, received the kind of cheers that Supreme Court justices simply don't get. Or when the gay poet said that Americans live beneath ''one sky'' and switched his accent to pronounce ''Colorado'' in Spanish.
As data from the election last November showed, if you are a woman, or black or brown, or gay, or not Christian, you're more likely to take to this vision of America as multiplicity. But, as the country has seen time and again, millions of people will not take to it, will instead feel threatened and excluded by all the talk of inclusion.
In parts of America where demographic and social change have been slower in coming, that inaugural stage can symbolize an ominous future: the United States as an increasingly centrifugal nation, made up of tribes spinning ever further from a center of shared culture and values. On the political right, there is an anxiety about its becoming a nation defined by ''victimization'' and by ''lifestyle choices'' -- by the 47 percent who don't pay federal income tax, by Americans arbitrarily deciding what heritage to claim, gender to identify as, sexuality to pursue, religion to practice and family structure, if any, to adopt. (That many of these may not, in fact, be choices is considered irrelevant.)
The rainbow coalition, as so many called it this past week, has its internal contradictions, too. Mr. Obama's coalition is, in some ways, a coalition of the insufficiently enfranchised. But shared exclusion doesn't resolve the many tensions among the members: between religious African-Americans and gays, who want to frame their cause as the next civil rights struggle; between union workers and the Hispanic immigrants whom they regard as depressing their wages; between the young, who'd benefit from investment in education and new industries, and the old, who want scarce federal money to shore up their pension funds.
A further complication is that this massive internal shift in demographics -- the very real arc from ''Mad Men'' to that inaugural stage -- coincides with the realities of a globalizing era, in which jobs flee to far-off places and a former Communist backwater like China is suddenly called a replacement superpower. Globalization has a tendency to make people feel acted-upon by distant, intangible forces. If you're among those who feel alienated by that colorful inaugural stage, you might find yourself projecting your frustration over all the changes you can't see onto people like Mr. Obama, who embody those changes that you can.
About globalization Mr. Obama spoke only passingly at the inauguration. It might seem a curious omission, given the immense challenge of competitiveness that the United States faces. But he did argue that a society that protects its people nourishes the most avid risk-taking, while calling for the kind of education system that allows a country to find and harness its best talent.
As citizens of a tolerant, hardworking, many-hued country, the president said, ''We are made for this moment.'' But the plain emphasis was on social justice, not economic dynamism. Whether that pursuit of justice fosters such dynamism or inhibits it, whether it unites America or intensifies its divides -- these are things we'll know only when Mr. Obama, already grayer after four years, is all salt and no pepper up there.

HEADLINE: Obama Reaches Out, but Not Very Far, to Build New Team

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As he heads into a second term with sweeping ambition in an era of gridlock, President Obama is assembling a new White House team that looks much like the old one, choosing familiarity over freshness even at the risk of insularity.
Mr. Obama installed his longtime aide Denis R. McDonough on Friday as his fifth White House chief of staff and announced a host of other selections that suggested more stirring than shaking up his West Wing. Of 10 appointees named on Friday, all came from inside the administration or re-election campaign. 
While aides played musical chairs, moving up and moving around to new positions, the overall continuity suggested that Mr. Obama felt no need to inject new energy into a team that brought him through re-election last year. Buffeted by one crisis after another, the president prefers to stick with the circle of advisers he has come to trust through four tumultuous years in office, wary of introducing new personalities after some unsuccessful experiments in his first term.
Outside the White House itself, the president's cabinet selections have so far been a mix of administration veterans and new faces, although even there the outsiders have generally been close allies, like Senator John Kerry at the State Department. Appointments to come may bring more people from outside Mr. Obama's orbit, including a new budget director. But Friday's announcements made it clear that most of the faces Mr. Obama will see each day will be well known to him.
With stability comes some danger, a fact that Mr. Obama's advisers said they recognized.
Veterans of his administration and its predecessors said one of the biggest concerns for a second-term president is listening to the same people so much that contrary voices from the outside are too easily dismissed. Moreover, the bone-crushing, 14-hour-plus days and six- or seven-day weeks wear down even the hardiest White House officials and, over time, can erode judgment.
Advisers to Mr. Obama said they hoped to avoid such pitfalls. ''Our staffing, our cabinet selections, are not done, so I think you've got to wait for the full picture to evaluate,'' said David Plouffe, the president's departing senior adviser, whose last day on the job was Friday. ''But this core White House team, I think, is going to be extraordinarily strong and cohesive.''
Mr. Plouffe and other Democrats said that moving veterans to new positions by itself would have a rejuvenating effect without the mistakes that invariably come from on-the-job training required of inexperienced newcomers.
''Working in the White House is like landing on an alien planet,'' said Joel P. Johnson, who was brought in as a counselor to President Bill Clinton in his second term. ''You just can't bring somebody from the business community or private sector or a think tank and be assured they're going to function at the level required in that kind of environment.''
To lead his second-term team, Mr. Obama turned to one of his closest advisers, Mr. McDonough, the latest to hold the corner office after Rahm Emanuel, Pete Rouse (as an interim chief), William M. Daley and Jacob J. Lew, who is leaving to become Treasury secretary if confirmed by the Senate.
Mr. McDonough, 43, has wielded influence that belied his title as principal deputy national security adviser. When he advocated a position, other officials understood that he was almost certainly channeling Mr. Obama, and no one is a fiercer defender of the president. Mr. McDonough has at times left bruised feelings elsewhere in the administration, particularly in the Pentagon and the State Department, where he is viewed by some as a brusque enforcer. But he is popular within the West Wing, where his loyalty and work ethic are highly valued.
The president called Mr. McDonough ''one of my closest friends'' and an ''indispensable member of my national security team'' who was central to every major foreign policy decision of the past four years, including the troop withdrawal from Iraq, the response to the earthquake in Haiti and the lifting of limits on service in the military by openly gay people.
''I have been counting on Denis for nearly a decade,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I relied on his intellect and good judgment, and that has continued ever since.''
Mr. McDonough's ascension was greeted by warm applause from colleagues in the East Room on Friday, and the president poked fun at his round-the-clock work habits. ''I actually began to think Denis likes pulling all-nighters,'' he said. ''The truth is nobody outworks Denis McDonough.''
Succeeding him will be Antony Blinken, the national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Lisa Monaco, the assistant attorney general for national security, will move to the White House to succeed John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, who will take over as director of the Central Intelligence Agency if confirmed by the Senate. Ms. Monaco's appointment makes her one of the most prominent women in a male-dominated national security team.
Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director and another early Obama aide, will succeed Mr. Plouffe as senior adviser. His deputy will be David Simas, a former White House aide who headed polling and focus-group research for the re-election campaign. Succeeding Mr. Pfeiffer as communications director will be his deputy, Jennifer Palmieri, a veteran of the Clinton White House.
Moving up to deputy chief of staff, succeeding Nancy-Ann DeParle, who is leaving, will be Rob Nabors, currently the president's legislative affairs chief. Succeeding Mr. Nabors will be Miguel Rodriguez, the Senate liaison for the White House.
Christopher P. Lu, another longtime Obama aide serving as White House cabinet secretary, the liaison to government departments, is leaving. Succeeding him will be Danielle Gray, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council. Katy Kale will become the president's assistant for management and administration, moving up from deputy.
Mr. Lu's departure underscored Mr. Obama's determination to keep people he already knows around him. The president issued a statement praising Mr. Lu and making it clear that he was lobbying him to come back in another capacity. ''After he enjoys some time off,'' Mr. Obama said, ''I hope he will consider those opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Populism, Republican Style

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A unique definition. 

 BODY:
The recent speech by Bobby Jindal, Louisiana's governor, has drawn a fair bit of attention. Conservatives would have you believe that it marks the start of real GOP reform; but the reality, as Andy Rosenthal says, is that Jindal wants to change the jingle in the commercial without changing the product. 
And if you want a clear demonstration of that point, compare Jindal's words and deeds. Here's what he just said:
We must not be the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys. We have to be the party that shows all Americans how they can thrive. We are the party whose ideas will help the middle class, and help more folks join the middle class. We are a populist party and need to make that clear.
And here's what he recently did:
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal (R) recently rolled out a plan to replace his state's personal income and corporate taxes with an increased sales tax. Such a move would shift taxes from the rich to the poor, who are disproportionately hit by the sales tax.
According to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Jindal's plan will raise taxes on the bottom 80 percent of Louisianians, while cutting them for the richest 1 percent:
 - The bottom 80 percent of Louisianans in the income distribution would see a tax increase from repealing the personal and corporate income taxes and replacing them with a higher sales tax.
 - The poorest 20 percent of taxpayers, those with an average income of $12,000, would see an average tax increase of $395, or 3.4 percent of their income, if no low income tax relief mechanism is offered.
 - The middle 20 percent, those with an average income of $43,000, would see an average tax increase of $534, or 1.2 percent of their income.
 - The largest beneficiaries of the tax proposal would be the top 1 percent-a group with an average income
 of well over $1 million. Louisianans in the top 1 percent would see an average tax cut of $25,423, or 2.3 percent of their income under the plan described above.
I guess there is some innovation here: finally, Republicans have stopped being the party that only want tax cuts, and have started becoming the party that wants to cut taxes for the rich while raising them on ordinary families. Populism!

HEADLINE: The Rise of the Permanent Temp Economy

BYLINE: ERIN HATTON


HIGHLIGHT: To avoid union opposition, the postwar temp industry exploited cultural ambivalence about middle-class white women's work. Then it became a model for corporate America. 

 BODY:
Politicians across the political spectrum herald "job creation," but frightfully few of them talk about what kinds of jobs are being created. Yet this clearly matters: According to the Census Bureau, one-third of adults who live in poverty are working but do not earn enough to support themselves and their families.
A quarter of jobs in America pay below the federal poverty line for a family of four ($23,050). Not only are many jobs low-wage, they are also temporary and insecure. Over the last three years, the temp industry added more jobs in the United States than any other, according to the American Staffing Association, the trade group representing temp recruitment agencies, outsourcing specialists and the like.
Low-wage, temporary jobs have become so widespread that they threaten to become the norm. But for some reason this isn't causing a scandal. At least in the business press, we are more likely to hear plaudits for "lean and mean" companies than angst about the changing nature of work for ordinary Americans. 
How did we arrive at this state of affairs? Many argue that it was the inevitable result of macroeconomic forces - globalization, deindustrialization and technological change - beyond our political control. Yet employers had (and have) choices. Rather than squeezing workers, they could have invested in workers and boosted product quality, taking what economists call the high road toward more advanced manufacturing and skilled service work. But this hasn't happened. Instead, American employers have generally taken the low road: lowering wages and cutting benefits, converting permanent employees into part-time and contingent workers, busting unions and subcontracting and outsourcing jobs. They have done so, in part, because of the extraordinary evangelizing of the temp industry, which rose from humble origins to become a global behemoth.
The story begins in the years after World War II, when a handful of temp agencies were started, largely in the Midwest. In 1947, William Russell Kelly founded Russell Kelly Office Service (later known as Kelly Girl Services) in Detroit, with three employees, 12 customers and $848 in sales. A year later, two lawyers, Aaron Scheinfeld and Elmer Winter, founded a similarly small outfit, Manpower Inc., in Milwaukee. At the time, the future of these fledgling agencies was no foregone conclusion. Unions were at the peak of their power, and the protections that they had fought so hard to achieve - workers' compensation, pensions, health benefits and more - had been adopted by union and nonunion employers alike.
But temp leaders were creating a new category of work (and workers) that would be exempt from such protections.
To avoid union opposition, they developed a clever strategy, casting temp work as "women's work," and advertising thousands of images of young, white, middle-class women doing a variety of short-term office jobs. The Kelly Girls, Manpower's White Glove Girls, Western Girl's Cowgirls, the American Girls of American Girl Services and numerous other such "girls" appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Business Week, U.S. News & World Report, Good Housekeeping, Fortune, The New York Times and The Chicago Daily Tribune. In 1961 alone, Manpower spent $1 million to put its White Glove Girls in the Sunday issue of big city newspapers across the country.
The strategy was an extraordinary success. Not only did the Kelly Girls become cultural icons, but the temp agencies grew and grew. By 1957, Kelly reported nearly $7 million in sales; in 1962, with 148 branches and $24 million in sales, it went public. Meanwhile, by 1956 Manpower had 91 branches in 65 cities (and 10 abroad) and, with sales at $12 million annually, employed some 4,000 workers a day. In 1962, Manpower also went public, boasting 270 offices across four continents and over $40 million in sales.
The temp agencies' Kelly Girl strategy was clever (and successful) because it exploited the era's cultural ambivalence about white, middle-class women working outside the home. Instead of seeking to replace "breadwinning" union jobs with low-wage temp work, temp agencies went the culturally safer route: selling temp work for housewives who were (allegedly) only working for pin money. As a Kelly executive told The New York Times in 1958, "The typical Kelly Girl... doesn't want full-time work, but she's bored with strictly keeping house. Or maybe she just wants to take a job until she pays for a davenport or a new fur coat."
Protected by the era's gender biases, early temp leaders thus established a new sector of low-wage, unreliable work right under the noses of powerful labor unions. While greater numbers of employers in the postwar era offered family-supporting wages and health insurance, the rapidly expanding temp agencies established a different precedent by explicitly refusing to do so. That precedent held for more than half a century: even today "temp" jobs are beyond the reach of many workplace protections, not only health benefits but also unemployment insurance, anti-discrimination laws and union-organizing rights.
By 1967 Manpower employed more workers than corporate giants like Standard Oil of New Jersey and the U.S. Steel Corporation. Manpower and the other temp agencies had gained a foothold, and temporary employment was widely considered a legitimate part of the economy. Now eyeing a bigger prize - expansion beyond pink-collar work - temp industry leaders dropped their "Kelly Girl" image and began to argue that all employees, not just secretaries, should be replaced by temps. And rather than simply selling temps, they sold a bigger product: a lean and mean approach to business that considered workers to be burdensome costs that should be minimized.
For example, in 1971 the recently renamed Kelly Services ran a series of ads in The Office, a human resources journal, promoting the "Never-Never Girl," who, the company claimed: "Never takes a vacation or holiday. Never asks for a raise. Never costs you a dime for slack time. (When the workload drops, you drop her.) Never has a cold, slipped disc or loose tooth. (Not on your time anyway!) Never costs you for unemployment taxes and Social Security payments. (None of the paperwork, either!) Never costs you for fringe benefits. (They add up to 30% of every payroll dollar.) Never fails to please. (If your Kelly Girl employee doesn't work out, you don't pay.)"
Around the same time, the New York agency Olsten Temporary Help Services announced a new product: "The Semi-Permanent Employee." Comparing its innovation to the wireless, the phonograph and the telephone, company leaders presented the "Semi-Permanent" as "a new kind of temporary employee...not for days or even weeks, but for two- and three-month periods to help your business grow more profitably." This new "invention," Olsten told businesses, would boost profits by shrinking the payroll (to "a slim, trim personnel budget, not one which chokes profitability"); by smoothing over the ebb and flow of the business cycle ("you needn't carry 'dead wood' for months when business is slow"); and by cutting training costs (employers would get "trained personnel without having to engage in expensive and unprofitable retraining").
By peddling products like the "Semi-Permanent Employee," the "Never-Never Girl" and more, temp industry leaders promoted a model in which permanent employees were a "costly burden," a "headache" that needed relief. "Stop paying help you don't use," Western Services advised in 1969. It even urged employers to convert their own permanent employees to temps, as in a 1971 advertisement in The Personnel Journal: "Just say goodbye... then shift them to our payroll and say hello again!"
According to the temp industry, workers were just another capital investment; only the product of the labor had any value. The workers themselves were expendable.
Paradoxically, this model ran counter to the conventional management wisdom of the day. The same year that the "Never-Never Girl" appeared in the pages of national business journals, one of the best-selling management books was "Up the Organization: How to Stop the Organization From Stifling People and Strangling Profits," in which the former Avis Rent-a-Car president Robert Townsend argued for treating workers as valuable assets rather than headaches to be squelched. The "human relations" school of management touted employee satisfaction as the best route to boosting profits.
But temp industry leaders continued to encourage companies to "rent" workers rather than "buy" them. And perhaps even more persuasive than their arguments were the practical tools they were able to offer: thousands of low-cost temps, without the hassle of having to hire, train, supervise and fire them. Becoming lean and mean had never been easier, and thousands of companies began to go the temping route, especially during the deep economic recessions of the 1970s. Temporary employment skyrocketed from 185,000 temps a day to over 400,000 in 1980 - the same number employed each year in 1963. Nor did the numbers slow when good times returned: even through the economic boom of the '90s, temporary employment grew rapidly, from less than 1 million workers a day to nearly 3 million by 2000.
The temp industry's continued growth even in a boom economy was a testament to its success in helping to forge a new cultural consensus about work and workers. Its model of expendable labor became so entrenched, in fact, that it became "common sense," leaching into nearly every sector of the economy and allowing the newly renamed "staffing industry" to become sought-after experts on employment and work force development. Outsourcing, insourcing, offshoring and many other hallmarks of the global economy (including the use of "adjuncts" in academia, my own corner of the world) owe no small debt to the ideas developed by the temp industry in the last half-century.
A growing number of people call for bringing outsourced jobs back to America. But if they return as shoddy, poverty-wage jobs - jobs designed for "Never-Never Girls" rather than valued employees - we won't be better off for having them. If we want good jobs rather than just any jobs, we need to figure out how to preserve what is useful and innovative about temporary employment while jettisoning the anti-worker ideology that has come to accompany it.

HEADLINE: Mining the Deep Sea and Outer Space for a Mineral Bonanza

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Ambitious plans to mine the mineral wealth of asteroids recalls the buzz that surrounded an earlier enterprise to raise billions of tons of metals from the bottom of the sea. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Whatever happened to manganese nodules?
As newly announced plans to mine the mineral wealth of asteroids generate a mixture of excitement and skepticism, it is worth recalling the fate of an earlier craze to exploit a potential metals bonanza somewhat closer to home.
From the early 1970s, the prospect of hauling up a boundless harvest of metal rich nodules from the deepest ocean beds was touted as the answer to the world's increasing hunger for diminishing resources. 
The potato-size rocks that carpet the deep seabed - commonly known as manganese nodules - also contain a mix of other elements, including copper, cobalt and nickel.
Governments and private companies joined the treasure hunt as explorations were launched to determine whether projects to vacuum the nodules from miles below the ocean's surface were commercially viable.
Lockheed Martin led a consortium of companies in an effort to develop a commercial mining operation, collecting thousands of nodules from an area of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico as part of an effort that would today cost more than $500 million.
Howard Hughes, the reclusive American tycoon, fueled the frenzy with the launch of the Glomar Explorer, a 618-foot ship he said was built to mine the manganese nodules. (It was, in fact, cover for a secret C.I.A. project to raise a sunken Soviet submarine.)
The potential "gold rush" was a factor that led to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that aimed to ensure that the seabed's wealth outside territorial limits would be shared between developed and developing states.
However, a collapse in the international nickel price between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s shattered the prospects of instant wealth from the billions of tons of ore that lay just beyond the limits of technology available at the time.
The lure of the manganese nodule faded from public consciousness. As an article on the University of Texas's Science and the Sea Web site stated in 2009: "A fortune is sitting at the bottom of the world's oceans. And for the foreseeable future, at least, it's likely to stay there."
Interest has been revived, however, by the increasing demand for so-called rare earth metals that are used in many modern high-tech products such as fiber optics, memory chips and liquid-crystal screens.
Studies by Lockheed Martin and others have determined that seabed nodules could provide an alternative source of such metals in a market presently dominated by China. 
A Chinese embargo on rare earth metal shipments in 2010 was described by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the U.S. secretary of state, as a "wake-up call" for the world to find new resources. 
Interest in manganese nodule exploitation may have subsided since the 1970s but it never quite disappeared. 
In the latest initiative this month, G-TEC Sea Mineral Resources, a private Belgium company signed a 15-year contract with the International Seabed Authority to prospect the central Pacific Ocean. The contract was backed by the Belgian government.
The Jamaica-based global body, which organizes and controls exploration of the seabed beyond national territorial limits, has granted a dozen such contracts since it established its Nodule Regulations in 2000.
Three months before, it signed a similar contract with Russia for prospecting and exploring in the Atlantic Ocean.
So, as nodule fever appears to be making a comeback, how about outer space?
Deep Space Industries, a California-based company has just announced its plans to inspect small asteroids that pass by Earth as potential mining targets.
That followed the announcement of plans by another company, Planetary Resources, to send an unmanned robotic mining mission to the asteroid belt, as my colleague Kirk Johnson reported from Washington State last month.
The prospect of mining asteroids was a sci-fi dream of the 1970s, just around the time of the manganese nodule craze.
Its revival has excited space fans, but others are skeptical about the projects.
In a down-to-earth column in The Economist entitled "Fool's Platinum?," the business magazine suggested the economic case for asteroid mining was far from obvious.
"A doubling of supply from space might, for instance, exert such downward pressure on the price of platinum on Earth as to undermine the whole business case for the venture," it wrote.

HEADLINE: Getting More Women in Leadership

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: A few more thoughts to go with my column on why we don't see more women leaders -- and how we change that. 

 BODY:
My Sunday column is from Davos and uses Sheryl Sandberg's forthcoming book to look at the persistent gender gap in the US and around the world. Sandberg's book is going to rub some women the wrong way, because she says that part of the problem is women not being assertive enough. But I think it's an excellent and important book that spotlights a good point that has to be part of the conversation -- as long as it doesn't distract us from a relentless focus on making the workplace more accommodating to women and families. 
If I'd had more space, one point I would have made is that one of the key factors for women to succeed is a flexible and supportive partner. Sandberg argues, and I think she's right, that the most important career decision a woman makes is when she chooses her spouse. If a woman is stuck doing all the household chores and child-raising, she just can't have a top-flight career. The great Rosabeth Kanter of Harvard Business School once was asked what men could do to advance women's leadership, and she replied: "The laundry."
As my column also notes, though, I'm skeptical of one of the main arguments that people make for women leaders -- that they are more nurturing or more supportive of other women. When Sheryl WuDunn and I were writing Half the Sky, we looked at heads of government around the world and found zero correlation between a female head of government and efforts to get more girls in school or to improve maternal mortality. But I do think that we need more women on top for other reasons -- to change gender stereotypes and to achieve more diverse and better decision-making. Here's a column I wrote a few years ago, also from Davos, on that topic.
Incidentally, Adrian Monck of the World Economic Forum made a fair point when I tweeted sarcastically that I had attended a good gender session at Davos, but that the Forum exemplified the problem with its 17 percent female participation. He tweeted back: "16.6% of @nytimes columnists are #women. Mote in both our eyes. Needs addressing." He's right that my own domain -- opinion journalism -- is one that is hugely dominated by men.
Read the column and post your thoughts!

HEADLINE: How to Get a Seat Out of Your Miles

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
On a slow day over the holidays, I added up how many frequent flier miles I had in various accounts -- more than 250,000 -- and realized I should start cashing in those miles for free trips.
Yes, I know how difficult this can be. When I called British Airways in November to see if I could use points for a Christmas trip to Ireland, the agent laughed and said, ''I doubt that.'' 
But for all those who think it's impossible to book award flights, there are plenty who disagree. In fact, one study comparing award availability on different airlines found that it has actually gotten a little easier to find seats in recent years.
''When the economy does poorly, cash bookings go down, and that creates more opportunity for reward travelers,'' said Jay Sorensen, president of the IdeaWorks Company, a travel consulting firm that compiles an annual ranking of award availability based on thousands of attempts to book seats on popular routes.
Last year's study found that Southwest had the best availability (among domestic airlines), followed by United and JetBlue, then American and US Airways toward the bottom of the list. Delta ranked last.
Your results in trying to land a trip may vary. The following tips from frequent fliers who obsess over these programs can help you beat the odds.
WAIT FOR LAST-MINUTE TICKETS
While many frequent fliers score seats by booking a year in advance, airlines don't release all award seats that early, which means you may have better luck with a last-minute trip. Mr. Sorensen said his company tried booking award tickets 5 to 15 days in advance, and generally found better availability than searching months ahead. Except for holiday travel, my experience confirms that tip: after my mother broke her arm last January, I cashed in 25,000 Delta miles for a ticket from New York to Traverse City, Mich., to visit her two weeks later. Just after my trip, my sister had a baby in Los Angeles, so my parents flew there a few days later using United miles (37,500 each) -- Mom's arm still in a cast.
A drawback of last-minute awards: American, United and US Airways charge up to $75 for booking less than 21 days in advance, which may be waived if you have elite status. Delta doesn't charge a late fee.
LOOK FOR REDUCED AWARD LEVELS
Each airline has a complicated chart outlining how many miles you need for a free ticket from Point A to Point B -- ''free'' being a misnomer because you often have to pay taxes and fees. But if you use your miles to fly at off-peak times, some airlines let you book your trip using fewer miles.
Scott Grimmer, founder of Milevalue, which offers advice on award tickets, said American and US Airways have some of the most generous reduced awards. American lets AAdvantage members book off-peak economy tickets to Europe for 40,000 miles round trip for travel from Oct. 15 to May 15; the rest of the year, that ticket requires at least 60,000 miles. American also posts award discounts available to members who carry one of its Citi AAdvantage credit cards at aa.com/reducedmileageawards.
US Airways lets its Dividend Miles members book off-peak round-trip award tickets to Europe for 35,000 miles, compared with at least 60,000 miles, but it's a smaller travel window: Jan. 15 through Feb. 28. Sign up for Mr. Grimmer's e-mail updates at Milevalue to get alerts about these discounts. He also offers award booking services for $99 a ticket.
BOOK A FREE STOPOVER
One benefit of award travel is the opportunity to book a free stopover. ''Each airline has its own rules,'' Mr. Grimmer said. ''But you can always get at least one stopover on your round-trip international award.''
On American, that stopover has to be at a gateway city in North America, so if you're flying to South America, you could spend a few days in Miami before continuing to, say, Buenos Aires. Other airlines allow you to book a free stopover abroad, meaning you could book an award ticket on United from New York to Frankfurt, spend a few days in Germany and then fly to Venice.
ACCEPT A LESS THAN IDEAL ITINERARY
The last time I flew to Europe using award miles, the only seats I could find back from London included a connection in Frankfurt. It wasn't a stopover, it was a time-wasting detour. Fortunately, a United agent at Heathrow let me switch to a direct flight to Kennedy Airport, without charging a change fee. You can't count on that courtesy, or a seat on a direct flight opening up, but some airlines let customers change an award ticket for no cost, as long as your travel dates, departure city and destination stay the same. Otherwise, changes typically cost $75 to $150.
It can also be worth accepting an award ticket to a city near your destination. Rick Ingersoll, who posts frequent-flier advice at Frugal Travel Guy, said he booked an award ticket to Dublin, then paid about $40 for a flight on a low-cost carrier to his destination, Edinburgh. ''The issue is getting across the pond,'' Mr. Ingersoll said. ''Take what you can get with your miles, then fly Ryanair or Air Berlin or EasyJet to your destination -- or they've got a fantastic train system in Europe.''
CHECK PARTNER AVAILABILITY
Most frequent flier programs let you use miles earned on one airline (say, United) to book award tickets on partner carriers. Until recently, that meant calling the airline and pleading with an agent to look for seats on partners' flights, but more carriers are updating their Web sites to let customers do these searches online. American's search tool now shows available seats on Alaska, Hawaiian, British Airways, Qantas, Finnair and Air Berlin. United's site shows award flights on 34 partners, including Lufthansa and Air China.
Another option is to check a third-party site, like Expert Flyer, which displays award seats for about 70 airlines. It has a five-day free trial, then costs $5 to $10 a month; the higher price gets you e-mail alerts to find out when an award seat becomes available on the flight you want.
But Chris Lopinto, Expert Flyer's co-founder, said there are still times when you must call, especially if you're using Delta miles. ''Sometimes you have to call the carrier in order to get partner inventory,'' he said. ''It's very frustrating.''

HEADLINE: Any Engine You Like, But Only if It's a Hybrid

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
BERKELEY, CALIF. -- For many Americans, the basic compact car stands as a matter of sacrifice -- to financial constraints, to fuel economy demands, to the exigencies of urban crowding. But what if the design of small cars could be reformulated to transcend their size?
For an answer, Ford Motor looked to Europe, where small cars, like small apartments and un-Gulplike beverage servings, are accepted realities of life. The company found a solution in its C-Max, a five-seat people mover it has sold in Europe since 2002 but began offering in the United States only last fall.
Ford made a bet that American drivers would get used to, and even come to like, the high-roof design of the C-Max. Its tall proportions create a spacious interior in a small format -- a layout common on the other side of the Atlantic but one that has struggled for acceptance in this market.
Then, one might say, Ford went ''all California'' and remade the American-market C-Max into the company's first exclusively hybrid model. There is no gasoline-only C-Max offered in the United States, only hybrids: a standard gas-electric C-Max Hybrid and a plug-in version, called the C-Max Energi, that can recharge from the power grid. 
Though it shares its basic dimensions with a Ford sibling, the Focus, the C-Max is more spacious and comfortable; tall passengers gape in amazement at its generous headroom.
That was the experience of Jim Hough, a 6-foot-4, 250-pound Navy veteran who leased a C-Max Hybrid in October. Mr. Hough, from San Jose, Calif., considered his 2007 Ford Taurus ''too confining'' but appreciates the accommodations of his new car. ''I can open the door of the C-Max and simply get in it like I'm in my living room chair,'' he said.
The C-Max is bigger and bulkier than a compact -- the Energi plug-in, with its larger battery, weighs a substantial 3,900 pounds -- but is smaller than a crossover. The doors feel exceptionally heavy and solid for a car this size, closing with a thud. Visibility is excellent, and the horn is a loud baritone.
Though the car's space-maximizing proportions may be more functional than typical compacts, they don't stir strong emotions. Still, the C-Max is pleasing enough to the eye, even if it is seems slightly large for its frame, like an attractive person who is described as big-boned. The dashboard layout, as on many other Ford vehicles, is a mishmash of levels, bevels and angles.
The C-Max's road manners bear little resemblance to the way typical gas-electric models respond. The Hybrid's 188 total horsepower (the combined output of the 2-liter 4-cylinder gas engine and a 118-horsepower electric motor) reveals itself in a guttural roar during highway passing, the only time I could detect the presence of a combustion engine. Ford engineers have perfected the art of hybrid smoothness.
The downside of the C-Max not driving like a hybrid is that its fuel economy can also be unlike a hybrid. In the week I spent with the C-Max Hybrid, followed by a week with the C-Max Energi plug-in, the gas mileage varied wildly.
In my first 175 miles with the C-Max Hybrid, I managed only 35.9 miles per gallon. That's shamefully below the E.P.A. rating of 47 m.p.g. for both highway and city driving, something noted by reviewers and owners (and has resulted in a class-action suit against Ford in California).
But then, on two occasions I used only a single gallon of gasoline to complete a 50-mile highway trip, handily beating the E.P.A.'s estimate. Mr. Hough said his mileage averaged in the low 40s.
Consumers who want a more certain leap in mileage should consider the C-Max Energi, which went on sale in October. For the Energi -- Ford's tag for plug-in models, also applied to a coming version of the Fusion sedan -- the 1.4 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack used in the Hybrid is swapped for one with a 7.6 kilowatt-hour capacity that is recharged from the grid.
The larger pack can be replenished in less than two-and-a-half hours through a 240-volt outlet, enough for about 20 miles of all-electric range. Total output for the Energi plug-in rises to 195 horsepower because of the larger battery pack's greater ability to deliver electricity to the motor. Otherwise, the gas engine and continuously variable transmission are identical to those used in the C-Max Hybrid. The E.P.A. combined mileage rating for the C-Max Energi is 100 m.p.g.e., or miles per gallon equivalent.
It was fascinating to see how long after a full charge I could maintain the maximum 999 m.p.g. reading on the dashboard. That startling number -- a misleading way of showing that no gas was being consumed -- usually lasted about 17 miles. Then, with the gas engine starting, the number would drop to 400, 300, 200 and lower.
Ford provides three modes to the C-Max Energi driver, aptly named EV Now, EV Later and EV Auto. The choices are refreshingly straightforward (unlike the car's maddening Sync interface for infotainment systems), and, I think, would logically become a standard way of offering multiple modes in plug-in hybrids.
Think of the Energi's 7.6-kilowatt-hour battery pack and its 14-gallon gas tank as two separate, interchangeable sources of energy. In the EV Now mode, the car uses only electricity as long as the battery pack has remaining charge and you drive at highway speeds. By choosing EV Later, the driver elects to only use gasoline, reserving the electricity for a different time; with EV Auto, efficiency-minded sprites in the car's software make the decisions.
One of my days with the C-Max Energi required 24 miles of travel, of which 21.6 miles were battery-powered, using 6 kilowatt-hours of electricity.
For a 59-mile journey from Berkeley to the San Francisco airport and back -- three times what the battery pack can deliver for electric-only propulsion -- I returned home with a reading of 67.7 m.p.g. That number takes into account the initial miles on battery power and the gas used once the Energi's battery was depleted.
At that point, the C-Max Energi provided the same fuel economy as the C-Max Hybrid -- about 40 m.p.g. around the city and close to 50 m.p.g. on the highway -- despite being some 260 pounds heavier.
But keep in mind that if most driving is within the Energi's 20-mile real-world E.V. range, as it was for me, the C-Max would effectively serve as an electric vehicle.
With the Energi's plug-in benefits come compromises, however. First, the copious cargo room that is among the C-Max's best features is seriously reduced to make room for a larger, awkwardly placed battery pack that is about the size of a large suitcase. With the rear seats folded flat, the cargo capacity drops to 42.8 cubic feet in the C-Max Energi, from 52.6 cubic feet of cargo for the C-Max Hybrid.
Moreover, in its battery-only mode the C-Max Energi is short about 70 horsepower that would normally come from the gas engine. It is still smooth, fairly quick and incredibly quiet, but not as much fun to drive as a Nissan Leaf and certainly not in the same league as a Tesla Model S.
Despite its higher base price, the buyer's cost to acquire a C-Max Energi may prove to be lower than it would be for a C-Max Hybrid when federal and state incentives are considered. The basic C-Max Hybrid SE starts at $25,995. A loaded Hybrid SEL with features like premium audio and heated seats tops $30,000.
By comparison, my Energi SEL test car carried a window sticker of $36,635. The C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid has a base price of $33,745. Subtract a federal tax credit of $3,750 and the price drops to $29,995. California buyers qualify for a $1,500 cash rebate, reducing the price of the Energi in that state to $500 below the Hybrid SEL.
Why would anybody, except those who can't stretch beyond the barest C-Max Hybrid trim, or are unable to live with 10 fewer cubic feet of cargo space, not opt for the plug-in Energi? For those who can splurge, I'd recommend the option package with Active Park Assist , just to experience this ''look ma, no hands'' feature.
Regardless of whether the fuel economy is simply good or truly outstanding, car buyers will be hard pressed to find as much efficiency, utility and innovative technology in a package as small and affordable as the C-Max models.

HEADLINE: Fascination With a Medium, and the Lives of Women

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- In an 1890 letter famous among scholars of the period, Mary Cassatt urged the painter Berthe Morisot, her friend, ''You must see the Japanese -- come as soon as you can.'' The Japanese she was referring to was an exhibition of 725 woodblock prints and albums at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. But Cassatt was writing from a particular perspective: she was obsessed with prints and printmaking. ''In the Company of Women: Prints by Mary Cassatt,'' an exhibition of 23 prints at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum here, offers a snapshot of Cassatt's engagement with the medium.
Cassatt (1844-1926) wasn't always partial to prints. Painting was the premier form in Europe and America during her lifetime. Trained in Philadelphia before moving permanently to Paris in 1874, she devoted her early career to mastering it. But in the 1870s, she experienced a shift. 
A table in the current exhibition laid out with books and catalogs provides some context. In one essay, the art historian and curator Nancy Mowll Mathews argues that Cassatt was influenced by an etching revival driven by artists like James McNeill Whistler and by the interest in prints among her inner circle of artists, which included Edgar Degas and Camille Pissarro. But there was also the ''semicommercial'' impulse to create works that were cheaper than paintings, easier to distribute and would ''stimulate the sale of the larger, more expensive pieces,'' according to Ms. Mathews.
And then there were the Japanese, whose ukiyo-e woodblock prints had inspired painters from Manet to Degas. Ms. Mathews describes another conduit for Cassatt's fascination with Japanese prints: French literature. In the novel ''Manette Salomon'' (1867), by the Goncourt Brothers, there is an artist-character who, confronted with a gray winter day in Paris, picks up an album of Japanese prints and loses himself in their bright colors and bold compositions.
The show at the Zimmerli starts with black-and-white drypoint prints that Cassatt made in the late 1880s before pursuing what she considered the Holy Grail of printmaking: color. The most significant ''work'' on view is actually a series of 12 drypoint prints -- a rare, intact version held in the Zimmerli's collection of what is called the ''Set of Twelve'' (1889-1890). ''Tea'' from the ''Set of Twelve'' shows a young woman sitting at a table with a teapot and cup, a large fan in her hand. More significant than the title subject, however, is the young woman's gaze, which is fixed on something (or nothing) outside the picture frame, and establishes her as a thinking subject -- no longer a mere object to be portrayed by an artist.
Mothers and children were becoming a signature theme for Cassatt. ''Mrs. Gardner Cassatt and Her Baby Seated Near a Window'' (1889) features the artist's sister-in-law and nephew in the first visit in which Mary Cassatt met the baby, who had suffered health problems in his early months of life. From the ''Set of Twelve,'' ''The Stocking'' and ''The Mirror'' show other interactions between mothers and young children. But ''Nursing'' feels particularly relevant for our age, in which breast-feeding has become a stage for political battles -- about doing it in public, but also about its value in comparison to formula and bottle-feeding. In Cassatt's image, a mother with bared breast stares off into the distance as she nurses her child, suggesting the boredom of a repeated chore. And yet, in her right hand she cradles the foot of the nursing baby, underscoring the emotional, as well as the physical, connection between mother and child.
The show of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts opened in April 1890, and by that time Cassatt was already deeply invested in her own printmaking -- and headed toward color. Morisot had made some color lithographs in 1888, and Cassatt bought a printing press in 1889, which she installed in her apartment-studio in Paris. She started making color intaglio prints first, then a series of aquatints that she exhibited in April 1891.
''In the Omnibus'' (1890-91), a drypoint and aquatint from that series, is a rare outdoor scene that shows two women and a child -- and the flat application of color and sharp divisions of space familiar from Japanese woodblock prints. ''The Fitting'' (1890-91) includes patterns and a line cutting diagonally across the lower portion of the picture that echoes ukiyo-e prints, but also looks forward to Art Nouveau and pattern-obsessed painters like Matisse.
Two of the later works in the show, ''By the Pond'' (1896) and ''Under the Horse-Chestnut Tree'' (1896-97), depict mothers and children, but also reveal a deeper saturation of color in their process, as well as Cassatt's approach to printmaking, derived from painting, which Ms. Mathews describes as ''a love of the manipulable surface and variety of tone and texture.''
Accompanying the works is a complicated story of economics and politics. Cassatt's art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, did not support her printmaking; she also objected to his putting her work in shows devoted to female artists. So she ended up selling her prints to Ambroise Vollard, a young, upstart dealer who would go on to represent Picasso and other modernists.
In 1911, Cassatt's eyesight began to decline, and her production waned. However, in this show, you see a significant aspect of her oeuvre that is often overlooked. For if Cassatt is known as a unique figure among 19th-century artists -- both as a successful female artist and the only American to exhibit with the French Impressionists -- she also worked in a medium that was marginal and ripe for revival and experimentation. What she learned from other artists and passed on to younger ones can be seen here, even in this small selection of 23 prints on the wall at the Zimmerli.
''In the Company of Women: Prints by Mary Cassatt'' runs through March 3 at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum, 71 Hamilton Street, New Brunswick. Information: (732) 932-7237 or zimmerlimuseum.rutgers.edu.

HEADLINE: Skills Honed When the River Was Still the Highway

BYLINE: By SUSAN HODARA

 BODY:
WHITE PLAINS -- It is easy to imagine a brisk breeze blowing and lapping water buoying the wooden boats that fill the gallery of ArtsWestchester's Arts Exchange as part of ''From Shore to Shore: Boat Builders and Boatyards of Westchester and Long Island.'' The exhibition presents a multimedia exploration of boat building in the region. It includes a 15-foot-long illustrated timeline, graphic panels, videos, models and half-models and a selection of well-worn tools. Interspersed are actual boats -- a flat-bottom fishing skiff, a couple of rowing boats, six handcrafted kayaks and a 16-foot melonseed catboat, its single gaff-rigged sail unfurled.
''We are covering more than 200 years of boat building,'' said Tom van Buren, director of ArtsWestchester's Folk Arts program and co-curator of the show with Nancy Solomon, executive director of Long Island Traditions, a cultural preservation organization based in Port Washington. ''Our region is surrounded by waterways that have been crucial to making New York the city it is,'' Mr. van Buren said. ''We are looking at boat building from the perspective of those working in the field.'' 
The builders in ''From Shore to Shore'' have worked on watercraft ranging from powerboats and yachts to patrol vehicles, fishing boats and ferries; many yards were commissioned to produce military vessels during World War II. Some of their stories are recounted in 18 short videos, accessible on an interactive iPad and projected inside the former bank building's vault; they are also viewable online on ArtsWestchester's YouTube channel. In each, a builder reflects on his background and his trade.
Gilbert Melo made his way to the United States from the Azores. Trained as a carpenter, he is now the production manager at Derecktor Shipyards in Mamaroneck. Maurice Piot, the owner of Maurice's Yacht Service in New Rochelle, grew up in Switzerland, where, at 16, he became an apprentice at a boatyard on Lake Geneva. Henry Gourdine, who died in 1997 at 94, had roots closer to home; born at Croton Point, he was a lifelong Hudson River seine fisherman as well as an expert boat builder.
''These are craftsmen who have accumulated tremendous knowledge,'' Mr. van Buren said, ''and who, in some cases, can trace that knowledge back generations.''
Several of those generational links can be seen on the timeline, which highlights milestones that shaped the boat building industry both regionally and nationally. It begins in 1800, when boats played an essential role in transportation and commerce. The completion of a railway line between New York and Albany, a few decades later, changed that. ''Until then, the river was the highway,'' Mr. van Buren said.
Other significant developments were the creation, in 1935, of fiberglass, which changed the nature of boat construction; the decline of commercial fishing in the latter half of the 1900s because of polluted waters and regulations against overfishing; and the recent recession, which has reduced the demand for recreational craft.
Nevertheless, the yards and builders presented in ''From Shore to Shore'' remain active, having substituted repairs and restoration for construction work. ''There have been many recessions and depressions throughout the course of this story,'' Mr. van Buren said, ''but people committed to getting on the water will get there one way or another.''
Among those water devotees are kayakers. The mezzanine-level Shenkman Gallery focuses on the Yonkers Paddling and Rowing Club, a descendant of the Yonkers Canoe Club, which was founded in 1886. In addition to its boating activities, the club offers an annual workshop in which participants construct a skin-on-frame kayak.
Also upstairs, ''Views From the Shore'' contains 27 photographs, prints and paintings by six artists inspired by local shorelines. Curated by Kathleen Reckling, ArtsWestchester's gallery director, the exhibition includes Joseph Squillante's black-and-white photographs of sailing ships on the Hudson, and watercolors and pastels by Heinz Emil Salloch, a German-born artist who lived and worked in Montauk.
Two years in the making, ''From Shore to Shore'' represents ArtsWestchester's commitment to documenting and preserving the region's folkloric traditions. It also frames the expertise involved, and the objects that result, as an art form.
''I like to think of boats as floating sculptures,'' Mr. van Buren said. ''The art of it is the mastery of the materials and methods to produce a thing that is functional -- that handles itself safely and gets from point A to point B and delivers its crew and cargo efficiently and comfortably -- but that also is beautiful.''
''From Shore to Shore: Boat Builders and Boatyards of Westchester and Long Island'' runs through March 9 at the Arts Exchange, 31 Mamaroneck Avenue, White Plains. The exhibit will also be on view in Port Jefferson in July and August. For more information: artswestchester.org or (914) 428-4220.

HEADLINE: Rio's Exploding Manholes Menace Residents and Highlight Aging Infrastructure

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and TAYLOR BARNES; Lis Horta Moriconi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- David McLaughlin was thrilled to be in Brazil. He had arrived here from Ohio State University on a Fulbright grant to research Brazilian hip-hop music with his wife, Sarah Lowry, a scholar of Russian literature. The graduate students, newlyweds, set out one morning in June 2010 to search for an apartment in the beachfront neighborhood of Copacabana.
Then, while crossing a bustling avenue, the asphalt under their feet started to tremble. A fireball surged suddenly from a manhole, enveloping Ms. Lowry in flames. Mr. McLaughlin leapt on her and extinguished the fire. But Ms. Lowry had burns on 80 percent of her body and spent 70 days in the hospital here. Mr. McLaughlin was burned on 35 percent of his body. 
''The explosion was one of the most traumatic experiences I can imagine,'' Mr. McLaughlin, 34, said in a telephone interview from New York, where he and his wife now live. ''Almost three years later, recovering is made more complicated every time we learn there's been a new explosion on the streets of Rio.''
Since 2010, manhole explosions here have shattered windows, flattened cars and injured passers-by. An explosion in 2012 killed a worker at Rio's port. While the rate of explosions has slowed, the city was rattled yet again in December after a manhole erupted behind the Copacabana Palace, the neo-Classical-style gem that is arguably Rio's most luxurious hotel. A motorcyclist narrowly escaped the recent blast, filming with his cellphone his motorcycle going up in flames.
Such explosions are not unique to Rio. Indeed, engineering experts say few large cities are immune. Gas from any number of sources can collect underground. Electrical cables, often running in the same pipes, can fray with age, producing a spark that can set off an explosion, shooting up fire and flinging hundred-pound cast-iron manhole covers high into the air.
But Moacyr Duarte, a senior researcher on the city's infrastructure at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said dozens of explosions here, which often occurred in densely-populated areas, had ''clearly gone beyond what it is statistically reasonable,'' before recently declining.
The explosions have set Cariocas, as the residents of this traditionally relaxed city are known, on edge, and the blasts point to the broader problem of dilapidated infrastructure even as Rio emerges from a long economic decline.
As Rio prepares for its cameo as host of the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, the expansion of offshore oil production has pumped life into its economy. The city has sought to revitalize neglected areas with projects like a new cable car system in Complexo do Alemão, a patchwork of slums, while a real estate boom has attracted the likes of Donald J. Trump, who plans to build five skyscrapers.
At the same time, Rio's resurgence has only added to the stress on its aging infrastructure.
While passenger traffic at Rio's international airport climbed 20 percent last year, it has been plagued by blackouts in recent weeks, escalators and elevators work sporadically, and vultures have descended through holes in the airport's roof.
Rio's car fleet grew 56 percent in the last decade, but road building and public transportation improvements failed to keep pace, intensifying traffic jams. Last year in downtown Rio, a 20-story office building just collapsed one night, knocking down two other buildings and killing 17 people.
Amid such challenges, erupting manholes have endured as just one more bizarre and potentially dangerous feature of the cityscape.
Some Cariocas have found dark humor in the sheer randomness. A video game for Facebook, ''Rio Boom-eiro Challenge,'' involves the nimble avoidance of sidewalk explosions.
Others have found artistic inspiration. Fábio Maia, an advertising executive, has been putting stickers in the shape of a lighted fuse alongside manholes. The idea came to him one day after he was dodging manholes while out with his son in a stroller. ''I started asking myself, 'What kind of craziness is this?' '' he said.
Mr. Duarte, of Federal University, said many of the manhole eruptions have been caused by leaks of gas or oil into overloaded underground networks, some built as far back as the 1920s.
After a surge in street explosions in 2010 and 2011, Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes, and prosecutors pressured utility companies into agreeing to pay fines of about $50,000 for each explosion, in addition to damages to victims.
(The electric company, Light, said it had not yet reached an agreement to pay damages to Mr. McLaughlin and Ms. Lowry.)
Mr. Paes's office said in a statement that the ''worst phase'' of the manhole crisis was over, explaining that an emergency operation in 28 neighborhoods that ended last year identified 314 manholes with a great risk of explosion, and that crews were sent to fix each one.
Still, the mayor's office acknowledged that the issue ''hasn't been completely addressed,'' prompting Mr. Paes to raise the fine for each explosion to $250,000 and to advance a project mapping the city's entire underground network.
Light said it had undertaken a $115 million investment program in the last two years aimed at preventing more explosions.
The company declined to provide figures on how many explosions had occurred recently on Rio's streets, but it argued that they had become less frequent. ''Eventualities in subterranean chambers occur around the world,'' the company said.
Manholes continue to explode. The mayor's office acknowledged that at least five blasts occurred in 2012, leaving one person dead and several injured. The explosion in December in Copacabana, one of Rio's most populous districts, sowed panic among passers-by.
Antônio Carlos Costa, president of Rio de Paz, a human rights group that has painted Rio's manhole covers red to bring attention to their potential danger, said the blasts offered a view into the perils that the new economic climate has been unable to resolve.
''In Brazil we have two types of violence,'' he said, ''intentional violence and violence that is a product of neglect. This is a type of violence that is more subtle, but is very present in Brazilian culture. The country is economically strong, but we do not have a culture of protecting human life.''

HEADLINE: Mixing, Matching and Charging Less

 BODY:
AN Android smartphone with unlimited calls, unlimited texting, unlimited data and no contract, all for $19 a month? Really?
When I first saw this offer from Republic Wireless, I rubbed my eyes and looked for an asterisk leading to fine print that detailed a huge catch. But Republic, a division of a telecom company called Bandwidth.com, delivers exactly what it advertises. It can do so because the handset technology is a curious hybrid: it uses Wi-Fi when the customer is in a Wi-Fi area and Sprint Nextel's 3G network when it is not.
The concept brings together the best of two worlds: the low cost of voice calls carried over the Internet and the convenience of making calls to any phone number using a major carrier's cellular network when Wi-Fi isn't available.
In my own case, on a typical day, I use my mobile phone mostly when I'm not actually mobile: I'm either at home or at work, perfectly positioned to use Wi-Fi at both locations. And I don't even use the phone as a phone all that much. I use it mainly for e-mail and texts, neither of which requires enough bandwidth to benefit from the power of the fastest data networks. 
If you walk into a Verizon Wireless store and buy an iPhone 5, you'll pay $60 or more a month for an unlimited talk and texting plan, depending on the data allocation for Internet use that you select to go with it. Some of that monthly charge goes toward repaying the carrier for the discounted price that makes a $649 iPhone seem as if it costs only $200. But most of the charge is for gaining access to the carrier's wireless network.
''We were looking at a mobile industry that had begun to charge extraordinary amounts of money, and we saw an industry opportunity that everybody else was missing: Wi-Fi is the new mobile,'' says David Morken, co-founder and chief executive of Bandwidth, based in Raleigh, N.C.
Smartphone apps that offer voice calls using data plans, not minutes allocated for calls, are plentiful. Just last month, Facebook quietly added an option that lets users of the iPhone version of Facebook Messenger place free voice calls to other Messenger users. But using those apps to make a call means the recipient has to run the same app, an irksome requirement that never comes up when using phones alone.
Republic buys access to Sprint's network on a wholesale basis for calls made outside of Wi-Fi areas. Its business model assumes, however, that Wi-Fi carries the load a majority of the time its phones are used. The company says that its service, even at $19 a month, is a profitable operation on a per-customer basis.
''We don't have to force people, or even ask people, how to behave,'' Mr. Morken says. ''Over 60 percent of the time that the phone is being used, on average, our users are using Wi-Fi and that number is only going up.''
Last month, I tested a Republic handset, a Motorola Defy XT. It's a light smartphone with a small screen, acceptable sound quality and great battery life.
Republic's Web site gently warns against acting like a ''data hog'' and encourages its customers to ''play nice and try to use Wi-Fi as much as you can.'' But scolding isn't needed: Wi-Fi is faster than 3G, so users have an incentive to opt for Wi-Fi wherever it is available.
The Motorola handset is the only one now offered by Republic, and it costs $259. The phone runs an older version of Android, and it has some first-generation glitches, like losing a connection when a caller starts out on a Wi-Fi network and then leaves the coverage area. (With a click, the call is resumed using Sprint's cellular network.)
Today most Wi-Fi access requires a logon. But that shouldn't prove a great inconvenience: you can simply set up the phone once with Wi-Fi at home, then once more at the office. At other locations, users can ignore Wi-Fi availability and use 3G instead.
Mr. Morken says a solution to the Wi-Fi-to-cellular handoff problem has been worked out in the company's lab, and should be available midyear. Later this year, he also expects to offer more handset models, including one at the high end; he says they will run the latest version of Android.
Matt Carter, president of the Global Wholesale and Emerging Solutions division at Sprint, asserted that the company was happy to serve as Republic's supplier. When I asked whether Republic's Wi-Fi-centric model, with its drastically lower price to the consumer, would pose a serious threat to the incumbent carriers, including Sprint, he said, ''If the world operated based on just economic decisions, people wouldn't go buy the most expensive cars on the planet, right?''
Mr. Carter listed reasons that most consumers would prefer the wireless service obtained directly from a major carrier: a wider range of devices and the convenience of placing a call without having to tinker with Wi-Fi setup.
Republic ''will resonate with a sliver of the marketplace,'' Mr. Carter said. He compared wireless carriers to the major airline carriers, which still control a majority of the market despite low-priced upstarts like JetBlue or Southwest, which he described as appealing only to ''a certain segment of the population.''
Philip Cusick, a J.P. Morgan analyst who covers telecommunications, says he doesn't expect a major shift of customers to Republic Wireless. The price difference isn't as great as it first appears, he says, when one considers that 80 percent of customers of AT&T and Verizon are on family or employer-related discount plans.
MR. MORKEN of Bandwidth.com says he knows that his company must lower the price of its handset -- the industry rule-of-thumb for no-contract wireless services is that a simple handset cannot cost more than $99 and a smartphone, $149. But if Republic can offer me an Android phone with a generously sized screen for a reasonable price, I don't see why, with Wi-Fi available at work and home, I should continue to pay an expensive-sports-car price for my wireless service.
''There's a reason why the carriers around the world don't want you using Wi-Fi for voice and text,'' Mr. Morken says. ''You will soon realize you shouldn't have to pay what you're paying today.''

HEADLINE: 'Most Israelis Are Not Listening'

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- The Oscar-nominated documentary ''The Gatekeepers'' braids the recollections and reflections of six former chiefs of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, into a disturbing narrative of their country's occupation of the Palestinian territories since 1967. In the United States the confessions of these tough terrorist hunters have startled and provoked audiences, fueling the criticism among Jewish liberals of the right-leaning Israeli government's expansion of settlements in the West Bank.
But one of the subjects of the film, Ami Ayalon -- who followed his Shin Bet tenure with several years in Parliament -- worries that the film will have less impact where it is most important, because ''most Israelis who saw it are Israelis who are convinced.''
''Most Israelis are not listening,'' Mr. Ayalon, who ran the Shin Bet from 1996 to 2000, said in an interview. ''When it is too tough, the easiest way to deal with it is to close our eyes and to close our ears.'' 
The big question is whether the 97-minute, $1.5 million ''Gatekeepers'' will change that. It has already captured the attention of the world: at least 10 American film critics, including two from The New York Times, put it in their best-of-2012 lists, and Israel's Foreign Ministry gets inquiries almost daily from its embassies about how to handle the reaction in countries where ''The Gatekeepers'' will soon be screened. (After an Oscar-qualifying run last year the movie opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday.)
Here in Israel the film has received positive reviews and praise by newspaper columnists since its festival premiere last summer and opening on Jan. 1 but has not exactly started a revolution. The issues it raises were not, for example, a factor in the elections on Tuesday. By last Sunday about 22,000 people here had seen the film -- a lot for an Israeli documentary but still a tiny fraction of the population of nearly eight million.
The message of ''The Gatekeepers,'' formed from the collective wisdom of the six living former Shin Bet leaders, is this: The occupation is immoral and, perhaps more important, ineffective. Israel should withdraw from the West Bank as it did from the Gaza Strip in 2005. And the prospect of a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict diminishes daily, threatening the future of Israel as a Jewish democracy.
(The film also confronts internal Jewish terrorism, including the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and a plot to blow up the Temple Mount in the 1980s.)
While public opinion polls show most Israeli Jews still support the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, increasing numbers have lost faith that it could happen in their lifetimes.
''The question is whether those people who believe there is no one to talk with, nothing to talk about, and we are condemned to go on fighting and killing for the next 10 generations -- and they are supported and empowered by our political community -- whether they will be open to see the different view,'' Mr. Ayalon said. ''Probably it is too difficult.''
Dror Moreh, the 51-year-old director of the film, said over coffee recently that its power is not so much the message as the messengers. He got the idea for ''The Gatekeepers'' while working on a 2008 documentary about former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whose chief of staff described a 2003 article in an Israeli newspaper that quoted Shin Bet leaders as critical in persuading Mr. Sharon, once called the father of the settlements, to evacuate those in the Gaza Strip. ''The Fog of War,'' Errol Morris's 2003 documentary about the lessons that Robert S. McNamara, the former United States defense secretary, learned during Vietnam, was also a source of inspiration.
One or two dissenters from the security establishment can be dismissed as having gone soft or having an ax to grind, Mr. Moreh said, but not all six former chiefs of the Shin Bet since 1980. They talk with a mix of pride and shame about brutal interrogations and deadly operations, with one referring to a particular assassination as ''very clean and elegant.'' They are not your typical peaceniks. (Though the film's opening title card says the men had never been interviewed before, that is not technically true. Four of them broke their agency's code of silence for the 2003 article, and the others have spoken out since.)
''They know better than anybody else,'' Mr. Moreh said of his subjects. ''They have been there, they have done the work.'' He added, ''Any Israeli who is not corrupted ideologically, who when he looks in the mirror he doesn't say the mirror is crooked, will have to listen eventually to what they are saying.''
What are they saying? ''In the war against terror forget about morality.'' That's Avraham Shalom, who resigned in disgrace in 1986 after ordering the killing of two Palestinians who had hijacked a bus. ''You can't make peace using military means,'' says Avi Dichter, who ran the agency from 2000 to 2005 and is now home front minister.
Mr. Ayalon: ''You ask yourself less and less where to stop.''
Mr. Shalom again: ''There was no strategy, just tactics.''
Yaakov Peri, who was elected to Parliament last week as a member of the new centrist There Is a Future party: ''When you leave the Shin Bet, you become a bit of a leftist.''
Mr. Moreh said that as a child in the tough Jerusalem neighborhood Kiryat Yovel he ''used to run from school to a cinema that showed three movies in one sitting.''
He devoured westerns, science fiction, and monster movies, he recalled, ''just to forget about everything and go into this charm of being in the cinema and allow myself to be sucked into a completely new reality, a completely new world of whatever I wanted to see.''
Yet when he became a filmmaker he turned his lens on the reality around him. ''Look, I live in Israel,'' he said. ''To do movies like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and, let's say, 'The Hobbit,' is something that you do out of pleasure. The troubles going on in Israel oblige you to create films that seem more, I would say, important.''
Besides the Sharon documentary he also directed a 2003 documentary about an Israeli journalist in the Iraq war. He is turning ''The Gatekeepers'' into a five-part series for Israeli television and a book.
''The Gatekeepers'' is actually one of two Israeli films about the occupation to be nominated for the best documentary Oscar this year. The other, ''Five Broken Cameras,'' is a $250,000, intimate movie mostly of video shot by a Palestinian who spent years at weekly protests of Israel's separation barrier encroaching on his West Bank village. Mr. Moreh's, in contrast, is slick and makes rare documentary use of computer-generated imagery.
As the Shin Bet directors describe operations, viewers often see a bank of monitors seemingly tracking the movement of suspected terrorists via drone cameras; they were created for the film. Ditto with the supposed Shin Bet file cabinets, dossiers and maps of collaborator locations. The video of the bus hijacking was invented digitally from a handful of still photographs shot by journalists that night.
''I won't tell you when it is real and when it is recreated,'' Mr. Moreh said. ''When you see the film nobody can tell.''
The Israeli press has mostly praised the film. Uri Klein, film critic of the liberal daily Haaretz, called it ''one of the most intelligent, mature and self-disciplined documentaries that have been made here recently.'' Ariel Rubinstein, a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University and a longtime activist in the peace movement, described it in an essay in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot as ''the dream document of those who wish to convince by the power of words just how devastating the occupation is.''
But Aluf Benn, the editor of Haaretz, wrote in a recent column that the film is ''convenient for the Shin Bet,'' painting its chiefs as victims of the political leadership and going light on their own bending of the law. Palestinians, Mr. Benn complained, ''are depicted in the film as stereotypes: an Arab and a donkey in black and white, youths throwing stones, a screaming mob running behind an ambulance.''
Ofra Ben Yaacov, an official in the Foreign Ministry's culture division, said she considered the movie a must-see for Israeli ambassadors and their aides abroad, despite its devastating criticism of government policy, if only so that they can engage critics.
''Of course it's a little problematic if you're talking from the point of hasbarah,'' Ms. Ben Yaacov said, using a Hebrew term for propaganda. ''If we are trying to export our art in all different fields, the question is whether it will be better to take only things that are good to Israel, that don't ask any questions, that don't raise any dilemmas. From my point of view the answer is not -- you have to be open and not be a censor.''
A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the prime minister had not seen ''The Gatekeepers'' and had no plans to. Mr. Moreh, whose dream ''is to go to the White House and show the film to Obama,'' said Mr. Netanyahu had also not sent a message of congratulations about the Oscar nomination.
And if he wins?
''I'm not expecting him to call me,'' Mr. Moreh said. ''I would ask him to go and see the film and to think over what is said in the film from the people who are most responsible for the security of the state of Israel.''

HEADLINE: The Rise of the Permatemp

BYLINE: By ERIN HATTON. 
Erin Hatton is an assistant professor of sociology at the State University of New York, Buffalo, and the author of ''The Temp Economy: From Kelly Girls to Permatemps in Postwar America.''

 BODY:
Politicians across the political spectrum herald "job creation," but frightfully few of them talk about what kinds of jobs are being created. Yet this clearly matters: According to the Census Bureau, one-third of adults who live in poverty are working but do not earn enough to support themselves and their families.
A quarter of jobs in America pay below the federal poverty line for a family of four ($23,050). Not only are many jobs low-wage, they are also temporary and insecure. Over the last three years, the temp industry added more jobs in the United States than any other, according to the American Staffing Association, the trade group representing temp recruitment agencies, outsourcing specialists and the like.
Low-wage, temporary jobs have become so widespread that they threaten to become the norm. But for some reason this isn't causing a scandal. At least in the business press, we are more likely to hear plaudits for "lean and mean" companies than angst about the changing nature of work for ordinary Americans. 
How did we arrive at this state of affairs? Many argue that it was the inevitable result of macroeconomic forces - globalization, deindustrialization and technological change - beyond our political control. Yet employers had (and have) choices. Rather than squeezing workers, they could have invested in workers and boosted product quality, taking what economists call the high road toward more advanced manufacturing and skilled service work. But this hasn't happened. Instead, American employers have generally taken the low road: lowering wages and cutting benefits, converting permanent employees into part-time and contingent workers, busting unions and subcontracting and outsourcing jobs. They have done so, in part, because of the extraordinary evangelizing of the temp industry, which rose from humble origins to become a global behemoth.
The story begins in the years after World War II, when a handful of temp agencies were started, largely in the Midwest. In 1947, William Russell Kelly founded Russell Kelly Office Service (later known as Kelly Girl Services) in Detroit, with three employees, 12 customers and $848 in sales. A year later, two lawyers, Aaron Scheinfeld and Elmer Winter, founded a similarly small outfit, Manpower Inc., in Milwaukee. At the time, the future of these fledgling agencies was no foregone conclusion. Unions were at the peak of their power, and the protections that they had fought so hard to achieve - workers' compensation, pensions, health benefits and more - had been adopted by union and nonunion employers alike.
But temp leaders were creating a new category of work (and workers) that would be exempt from such protections.
To avoid union opposition, they developed a clever strategy, casting temp work as "women's work," and advertising thousands of images of young, white, middle-class women doing a variety of short-term office jobs. The Kelly Girls, Manpower's White Glove Girls, Western Girl's Cowgirls, the American Girls of American Girl Services and numerous other such "girls" appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Business Week, U.S. News & World Report, Good Housekeeping, Fortune, The New York Times and The Chicago Daily Tribune. In 1961 alone, Manpower spent $1 million to put its White Glove Girls in the Sunday issue of big city newspapers across the country.
The strategy was an extraordinary success. Not only did the Kelly Girls become cultural icons, but the temp agencies grew and grew. By 1957, Kelly reported nearly $7 million in sales; in 1962, with 148 branches and $24 million in sales, it went public. Meanwhile, by 1956 Manpower had 91 branches in 65 cities (and 10 abroad) and, with sales at $12 million annually, employed some 4,000 workers a day. In 1962, Manpower also went public, boasting 270 offices across four continents and over $40 million in sales.
The temp agencies' Kelly Girl strategy was clever (and successful) because it exploited the era's cultural ambivalence about white, middle-class women working outside the home. Instead of seeking to replace "breadwinning" union jobs with low-wage temp work, temp agencies went the culturally safer route: selling temp work for housewives who were (allegedly) only working for pin money. As a Kelly executive told The New York Times in 1958, "The typical Kelly Girl... doesn't want full-time work, but she's bored with strictly keeping house. Or maybe she just wants to take a job until she pays for a davenport or a new fur coat."
Protected by the era's gender biases, early temp leaders thus established a new sector of low-wage, unreliable work right under the noses of powerful labor unions. While greater numbers of employers in the postwar era offered family-supporting wages and health insurance, the rapidly expanding temp agencies established a different precedent by explicitly refusing to do so. That precedent held for more than half a century: even today "temp" jobs are beyond the reach of many workplace protections, not only health benefits but also unemployment insurance, anti-discrimination laws and union-organizing rights.
By 1967 Manpower employed more workers than corporate giants like Standard Oil of New Jersey and the U.S. Steel Corporation. Manpower and the other temp agencies had gained a foothold, and temporary employment was widely considered a legitimate part of the economy. Now eyeing a bigger prize - expansion beyond pink-collar work - temp industry leaders dropped their "Kelly Girl" image and began to argue that all employees, not just secretaries, should be replaced by temps. And rather than simply selling temps, they sold a bigger product: a lean and mean approach to business that considered workers to be burdensome costs that should be minimized.
For example, in 1971 the recently renamed Kelly Services ran a series of ads in The Office, a human resources journal, promoting the "Never-Never Girl," who, the company claimed: "Never takes a vacation or holiday. Never asks for a raise. Never costs you a dime for slack time. (When the workload drops, you drop her.) Never has a cold, slipped disc or loose tooth. (Not on your time anyway!) Never costs you for unemployment taxes and Social Security payments. (None of the paperwork, either!) Never costs you for fringe benefits. (They add up to 30% of every payroll dollar.) Never fails to please. (If your Kelly Girl employee doesn't work out, you don't pay.)"
Around the same time, the New York agency Olsten Temporary Help Services announced a new product: "The Semi-Permanent Employee." Comparing its innovation to the wireless, the phonograph and the telephone, company leaders presented the "Semi-Permanent" as "a new kind of temporary employee...not for days or even weeks, but for two- and three-month periods to help your business grow more profitably." This new "invention," Olsten told businesses, would boost profits by shrinking the payroll (to "a slim, trim personnel budget, not one which chokes profitability"); by smoothing over the ebb and flow of the business cycle ("you needn't carry 'dead wood' for months when business is slow"); and by cutting training costs (employers would get "trained personnel without having to engage in expensive and unprofitable retraining").
By peddling products like the "Semi-Permanent Employee," the "Never-Never Girl" and more, temp industry leaders promoted a model in which permanent employees were a "costly burden," a "headache" that needed relief. "Stop paying help you don't use," Western Services advised in 1969. It even urged employers to convert their own permanent employees to temps, as in a 1971 advertisement in The Personnel Journal: "Just say goodbye... then shift them to our payroll and say hello again!"
According to the temp industry, workers were just another capital investment; only the product of the labor had any value. The workers themselves were expendable.
Paradoxically, this model ran counter to the conventional management wisdom of the day. The same year that the "Never-Never Girl" appeared in the pages of national business journals, one of the best-selling management books was "Up the Organization: How to Stop the Organization From Stifling People and Strangling Profits," in which the former Avis Rent-a-Car president Robert Townsend argued for treating workers as valuable assets rather than headaches to be squelched. The "human relations" school of management touted employee satisfaction as the best route to boosting profits.
But temp industry leaders continued to encourage companies to "rent" workers rather than "buy" them. And perhaps even more persuasive than their arguments were the practical tools they were able to offer: thousands of low-cost temps, without the hassle of having to hire, train, supervise and fire them. Becoming lean and mean had never been easier, and thousands of companies began to go the temping route, especially during the deep economic recessions of the 1970s. Temporary employment skyrocketed from 185,000 temps a day to over 400,000 in 1980 - the same number employed each year in 1963. Nor did the numbers slow when good times returned: even through the economic boom of the '90s, temporary employment grew rapidly, from less than 1 million workers a day to nearly 3 million by 2000.
The temp industry's continued growth even in a boom economy was a testament to its success in helping to forge a new cultural consensus about work and workers. Its model of expendable labor became so entrenched, in fact, that it became "common sense," leaching into nearly every sector of the economy and allowing the newly renamed "staffing industry" to become sought-after experts on employment and work force development. Outsourcing, insourcing, offshoring and many other hallmarks of the global economy (including the use of "adjuncts" in academia, my own corner of the world) owe no small debt to the ideas developed by the temp industry in the last half-century.
A growing number of people call for bringing outsourced jobs back to America. But if they return as shoddy, poverty-wage jobs - jobs designed for "Never-Never Girls" rather than valued employees - we won't be better off for having them. If we want good jobs rather than just any jobs, we need to figure out how to preserve what is useful and innovative about temporary employment while jettisoning the anti-worker ideology that has come to accompany it.

IT'S the annual conclave of the presumed powerful, the World Economic Forum in Davos, with the wealthy flying in on private jets to discuss issues like global poverty. As always, it's a sea of men. This year, female participation is 17 percent.
Perhaps that's not surprising, considering that global business and political leaders are overwhelmingly male. In America, only 17 percent of American Fortune 500 board seats are held by women, a mere 3 percent of board chairs are women -- and women are barely represented in President Obama's cabinet. 
Indeed, I'm guessing that the average boardroom doesn't have much better gender equality than a team of cave hunters attacking a woolly mammoth 30,000 years ago.
So what gives? A provocative answer comes from Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, who has written a smart book due out in March that attributes the gender gap, in part, to chauvinism and corporate obstacles -- but also, in part, to women who don't aggressively pursue opportunities.
''We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in,'' Sandberg writes in the book, called ''Lean In.''
''We internalize the negative messages we get throughout our lives, the messages that say it's wrong to be outspoken, aggressive, more powerful than men. We lower our own expectations of what we can achieve. We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care. We compromise our career goals to make room for partners and children who may not even exist yet.''
Sandberg and I discussed the issue on a panel here in Davos, and I think that there is something real and important in what she says. When I lecture at universities, the first questions are invariably asked by a man -- even at a women's college. When I point at someone in a crowd to ask a question, the women in the area almost always look at each other hesitantly -- and any man in the vicinity jumps up and asks his question.
A McKinsey survey published in April found that 36 percent of male employees at major companies aspired to be top executives, compared with 18 percent of the women. A study of Carnegie Mellon M.B.A. graduates in 2003 found that 57 percent of the men, but only 7 percent of the women, tried to negotiate a higher initial salary offer.
Sandberg, one of the most prominent women in corporate America, is not known as a shrinking violet. She confesses that when she was in elementary school, she trained her younger brother and sister to follow her around, listen to her give speeches and periodically shout: ''Right!''
Yet she acknowledges that she has harbored many insecurities, sometimes shedding tears at the office, as well as doubts about her juggling of work and family.
When she joined Facebook as its No. 2, she was initially willing to accept the first offer from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder. She writes that her husband and brother-in-law hounded her to demand more, so she did -- and got a better deal.
''I am hoping that each woman will set her own goals and reach for them with gusto,'' Sandberg writes. ''And I am hoping that each man will do his part to support women in the workplace and in the home, also with gusto.''
Yet I wish that there could be two versions of Sandberg's book. One marketed to young women would encourage them to be more assertive. One marketed to men (and women already in leadership) would emphasize the need for structural changes to accommodate women and families.
Is Sandberg blaming the victim? I don't think so, but I also don't want to relax the pressure on employers to do a much better job of recruiting and promoting women.
Nature and social mores together make motherhood more all-consuming than fatherhood, yet the modern job was built for a distracted father. That's not great for dads and can be just about impossible for moms -- at least those who don't have great wealth or extraordinary spouses.
Sandberg famously leaves the office at 5:30 most days to be with her kids, but not many women (or men) would dare try that.
Some people believe that women are more nurturing bosses, or that they offer more support to women below them. I'm skeptical. Women can be jerks as much as men.
But we need more women in leadership positions for another reason: considerable evidence suggests that more diverse groups reach better decisions. Corporations should promote women not just out of fairness, but also because it helps them perform better. Lehman Brothers might still be around today if it were Lehman Brothers & Sisters.
So, yes, let's encourage young women to ''lean in,'' but let's also change the workplace so that when they do lean in and assert themselves, we're directly behind them shouting: ''Right!''

HEADLINE: Lincoln's School of Management

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
The legacy of Abraham Lincoln hangs over every American president. To free a people, to preserve the Union, ''to bind up the nation's wounds'': Lincoln's presidency, at a moment of great moral passion in the country's history, is a study in high-caliber leadership.
In this season of all things Lincoln -- when Steven Spielberg is probably counting his Oscars already -- executives, entrepreneurs and other business types might consider dusting off their history books and taking a close look at what might be called the Lincoln school of management.
Even before ''Lincoln'' the movie came along, there was a certain cult of leadership surrounding the 16th president. C.E.O.'s and lesser business lights have long sought inspiration from his life and work. But today, as President Obama embarks on a new term and business leaders struggle to keep pace with a rapidly changing global economy, the lessons of Lincoln seem as fresh as ever. They demonstrate the importance of resilience, forbearance, emotional intelligence, thoughtful listening and the consideration of all sides of an argument. They also show the value of staying true to a larger mission. 
''Lincoln's presidency is a big, well-lit classroom for business leaders seeking to build successful, enduring organizations,'' Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, said in an e-mail. Lincoln, he said, ''always looked upward and always called American citizens to a higher road and to a purpose bigger than themselves. He did this by listening carefully to those both inside and outside of his immediate circle and sphere of influence. Listening, always being present and authenticity are essential leadership qualities whether one is leading a country in wartime or a company during a period of transformation.''
As a historian at Harvard Business School, I have been a student of Lincoln for more than a decade. I have written a case study and several articles about his presidency and talked extensively about him to business executives and entrepreneurs. The film ''Lincoln,'' which follows his efforts to ensure the passage of the 13th Amendment, making slavery unconstitutional, offers ample evidence of his ability to lead. But to me, his earlier experience in drafting and issuing the Emancipation Proclamation offers one of the best ways to appreciate his strengths as a leader.
Before and after he signed the proclamation, 150 years ago this month, Lincoln confronted a string of military setbacks, intense political opposition and his own depression and self-doubts. In the summer of 1862, Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee attacked ''repeatedly, relentlessly, with a courage bordering on recklessness,'' as the historian James M. McPherson has written. Union supporters realized that the Civil War -- originally envisioned as a short, swift conflict -- would be much longer and bloodier than imagined.
Northern newspapers and politicians assailed the administration for incompetence. The number of Union Army volunteers dwindled. Abolitionists, who since the war's start had urged Lincoln to move aggressively against slavery, grew increasingly frustrated.
All of this bore down on the president. When he learned that George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, had retreated after a series of conflicts known as the Seven Days' Battles, Lincoln described himself ''as nearly inconsolable as I could be and live.'' And, personally, the death of his 11-year-old son, Willie, five months earlier still weighed heavily on both the president and his wife.
Yet despite all of his mental suffering, Lincoln never gave way to his darkest fears. His resilience and commitment to preserve the Union helped sustain him.
The ability to experience negative emotions without falling through the floorboards is vital to entrepreneurs and business leaders. Ari Bloom, a strategic adviser to consumer-related companies and a former student of mine, put it this way: ''Nothing prepares you for the emotional ups and downs that come with starting a business. There will be obstacles, big and small, that come at you every day, from personnel issues to supplier delays, to late payments or even hurricanes.'' Throughout, entrepreneurs must maintain their professional composure while staying true to their vision and their integrity, he said.
''Lincoln is striking because he did all this under extremely difficult circumstances,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''Some of his ability to navigate such difficult terrain was about emotional intelligence and the deep faith he nurtured about his vision. But some of it was also about how he gathered advice and information from a wide range of people, including those who did not agree with him. This is important in building a business because you have to listen to customers, employees, suppliers and investors, including those who are critical of what you are doing.''
Lincoln had long opposed the expansion of slavery, declaring it wrong, morally and politically, because it violated the rights of all people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness set forth in the Declaration of Independence. But he had also made it clear that preserving the Union was more important than trying to abolish slavery head on.
In the early summer of 1862, events conspired to change his perspective. There was McClellan's humiliating retreat, the mounting overall toll of the war and growing support in the North for attacking slavery. His earlier concerns were overridden by exigency.
''Things had gone on from bad to worse,'' Lincoln recalled later, ''until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game!''
Lincoln's ability to shift gears during hard times -- without giving up his ultimate goal -- is a vital lesson for leaders operating in today's turbulence. When I teach the case, many executives comment on the importance of shaping one's tactics to changing circumstances.
Sometime in late June or early July of 1862, Lincoln began drafting what would become the Emancipation Proclamation. On July 22, he told his full cabinet that he had ''resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to ask their advice,'' but rather ''to lay the subject matter of a proclamation before them.'' He had decided that, as of Jan. 1, 1863, all people held as slaves in states in rebellion against the United States government would be declared forever free.
Lincoln had always been a slow, deliberate thinker, examining an issue from all sides. The cabinet was divided over the proclamation, but at this point he was unlikely to be dissuaded. Nevertheless, when Secretary of State William H. Seward suggested that the president wait for a Union victory before issuing the proclamation, lest it seem ''the last measure of an exhausted government, a cry for help,'' Lincoln agreed.
In mid-September 1862, after a bloody victory at Antietam in which more than 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded, Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation public. Practically, it would free none of the almost four million slaves held in the Confederacy, where it could not be enforced; it made no claims to liberate slaves held in the border states that were not in rebellion against the United States. And it did not free slaves held in certain parts of the Confederacy occupied by Union forces.
But as Lincoln understood, the proclamation was a radical act. In declaring certain slaves free as an act of military necessity, it transformed the meaning and stakes of the Civil War. What started as a conflict to save the Union as it had existed since the 1787 Constitutional Convention had become a contest to save a new, different kind of United States -- one in which slavery was permanently abolished.
Americans reacted strongly to the proclamation. Abolitionists greeted it with acclaim, but many in Lincoln's own party called it unconstitutional. Union Democrats condemned it; the Democratic-leaning New York World said Lincoln was ''adrift on a current of radical fanaticism.''
In the South, President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy called the proclamation an effort to incite servile insurrection, saying it supplied additional reasons for the Confederacy to fight for its independence. Foreign response was also critical, partly because the proclamation posed a potential threat to cotton supplies. That November, the effects of the Emancipation Proclamation, the war's huge casualties and the government's deteriorating military fortunes combined to hand the president's party major reverses in the midterm elections.
Faced with these and other setbacks, Lincoln grew more depressed, but his commitment to the proclamation did not waver. When he signed the final document into law, he knew he was altering a landscape that had become much larger than when he became president. And he realized that he must communicate his own steadfast commitment to a larger purpose.
Throughout the war, Lincoln was able to experience a range of emotions without acting on them rashly or in other ways that compromised his larger mission. This ability offers another powerful lesson for modern leaders.
Consider Lincoln's emotional state after the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863: Lee's retreating forces had escaped south into Virginia and out of the Union Army's reach. Lincoln was frustrated and furious. He composed an angry letter to Gen. George C. Meade, who had commanded the Union forces at Gettysburg, writing him that Lee ''was within your easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war.'' He added: ''Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.''
But Lincoln decided not to mail the letter. Instead, he placed it in an envelope labeled ''To Gen. Meade, never sent or signed.'' There is no question that Lincoln had cause to lament the general's inaction, especially in the larger context of the president's early experience with Union Army officials, but he recognized that he couldn't afford to alienate him at such a crucial time.
When I work with executives, I often say: ''Imagine if e-mail had existed in Lincoln's time and he had hit 'send' because he was distressed. The course of history might have taken a very different turn.''
It is crucial for today's leaders to practice this kind of forbearance. Much of what leaders experience every day is emotionally difficult. Instantaneous, round-the-clock communication like e-mail, texting and social media often stir up even more turbulence within.
Executives face the challenge of navigating their own and others' emotions with forethought and consideration. As Lincoln realized, the first action that comes to mind is not always the wisest.
In November 1863, at the new cemetery in Gettysburg, Lincoln outlined the important moment in which America found itself and which he had helped create. In 272 words, he laid out the stakes of the Civil War, asserting that its bloody toll was necessary in order that ''government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.''
When I discuss the Gettysburg Address with executives and entrepreneurs, they often compare the huge changes wrought by the Civil War to aspects of organizational transformation and their own roles in communicating with stakeholders.
Executives including Anne M. Mulcahy, the former C.E.O. of Xerox, often find that decisions made in the best long-term interest of a company often conflict with the shorter-term demands of shareholders. In 2000, against the counsel of advisers, Ms. Mulcahy refused to declare bankruptcy as Xerox ran up nearly $18 billion in debt. She faced criticism and skepticism as she worked to reinvent the organization, but she remained focused on restoring company profitability, innovation, competitiveness and efficiency.
Lincoln often traveled to battlefields to visit Union troops, and he held open ''office'' hours in the White House to receive interested citizens -- and their countless requests. Like Lincoln, Ms. Mulcahy knew she could not lead from behind closed office doors. She often went into the field to speak with executives, employees and, most important, customers. ''Even while Rome was burning,'' she said in a 2006 speech, ''people wanted to know what the city of the future would look like.''
Today she is credited with leading a very successful business turnaround.
Executives often point to the strength that Lincoln found to bear the death and destruction of the war and to weather intense opposition and still not relinquish his mission. If there is one point when Lincoln discovered his own leadership backbone, it was surely in conceiving and issuing the Emancipation Proclamation and then committing himself and the country to its broader consequences.
When I discuss my Lincoln case study with executives, that is one of the most powerful lessons they take away. As Kelly Close, founder and president of Close Concerns, a health care information firm, said in an e-mail, ''Being responsible for even a small company and all the people and issues involved in such management forces you to come to terms with yourself and whether you can rise to the challenge -- not once but many times.'' Lincoln, she added, ''was able to do this in a way that amazes and inspires me.''
On April 9, 1865, at Appomattox, Va., Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, head of the Union forces. Six days later, Lincoln was dead. And the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect two years earlier, would become part of a broader process of emancipation that culminated in ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865.
Lincoln, said Mr. Schultz of Starbucks, ''taught us that whether you are a business leader, an entrepreneur or a government official, one's foremost responsibility is to serve all of the people,'' and not just one's self-interest. ''Lincoln knew that success is best when shared.''
Lincoln was able to learn and grow amid great calamity. His story, like no other, demonstrates that leaders do not just make the moment; they meet it and, in the process, are changed by it.

HEADLINE: Merry Old Efficiency

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
Free-associate on ''older middle-class housing'' and ''New York City,'' and an image most likely comes to mind of a cluster of redbrick buildings indistinguishable from one another.
But the candy dish of details on each tower of Tudor City, on the far East Side of Manhattan, proves that a master-planned complex doesn't have to be bland -- and can even live up to its English name.
Lanterns hang from brackets on Woodstock Tower, a co-op on East 42nd Street, giving the entrance a regal feel. The lobby of Tudor Tower takes on the hue of a chapel, with stained-glass windows memorializing the city's official seal: windmill blades, beavers and barrels of flour. And the facade at Essex House, on East 41st Street, seems to herald a gathering at the Round Table, with a line of stone crests depicting stags, lions and eagles.
Below them, in calligraphic lettering, is a reminder that this merry old enclave was developed, beginning in the late 1920s, by Fred E. French, who believed that office workers should be able live close to their Midtown jobs without having to endure an aged tenement. 
Gary Roth, a sound engineer at the United Nations across First Avenue, moved from New Jersey for similar reasons, in the early 1980s. He had been commuting by bus to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, then walking across town to the United Nations. One morning he happened upon Tudor City.
''It had a different feel to it than the craziness of Times Square,'' Mr. Roth said. ''It was like a whole new dimension.''
After renting for a few years in adjacent Turtle Bay, he finally entered that dimension, buying a one-bedroom at 2 Tudor City Place around the time it went co-op. In 1984, the 800-square-foot unit, in one of the rare postwar buildings, cost $145,000.
Since then his commutes go something like this: walk two blocks, descend a flight of outdoor stairs to First Avenue, cross the street. Total travel time: five minutes. And since the mid-2000s, when he married and bought the unit next door for $425,000, he has had more space. After the apartments were joined, the second kitchen became a closet for his three bikes, he said. And in 2010, Jonathan, his son from an earlier marriage, joined him as a Tudor City owner, buying a studio at Windsor Tower, also known as 5 Tudor City Place.
That unit, like many in the complex, is tiny. Pullman kitchens give them the air of efficiency motel rooms -- though with hardwood floors. Still, the unit cost $210,000, so Jonathan had money left over for new, larger appliances. ''Now he can cook up a storm,'' Mr. Roth said.
For others, Lilliputian proportions are beside the point. Apartments serve the same purpose they did 80 years ago: as basic but stylish crash pads for those who have business nearby. Mary Ann Hallenborg, who bought a 325-square-foot studio last fall for $220,000, says her kitchenette is used mainly for pouring wine and setting out cheese; meals are eaten out.
And that's fine, because Ms. Hallenborg, a professor at the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate on 42nd Street, is there only during the week. On weekends she and her husband, Neil, a film producer, escape to the suburban colonial in New Jersey where they have lived for a decade.
What You'll Find
Tudor City is set apart from the street grid. East 41st and 43rd Streets end in cul-de-sacs, forcing traffic to go around, and East 42nd passes under a bridge. There are also four shaded parks; two of them are technically private, but open to the public -- unlike Gramercy.
Most of the neighborhood, which takes up six blocks, has landmark status, though newer apartments, like the Hamilton, a 21-story brown-brick co-op on East 40th Street, loom on the edges. This Second Avenue corridor could eventually get taller, as it falls in the planned Grand Central rezoning area.
A few buildings survive from the pre-French era, like the well-kept limestone town house at 337 East 41st, which adds an Italianate note to the English landscape.
With the exception of 333 East 41st, the Tudor-style buildings began life as rentals, though all have since been converted to co-ops, mostly in the 1980s, after a court halted a plan by the developer Harry B. Helmsley to put up towers in the two private parks.
Still, renters abound, encouraged by liberal sublease policies at many ownership buildings.
In fact renters make up 60 percent of residents at 45 Tudor City Place, or Prospect Tower, the building with the ''Tudor City'' sign on its roof, says Steve Corcoran, a broker who lives and sells there. About the same percentage reside at Nos. 25 and 5 Tudor City Place, he added, though other buildings, like Woodstock Tower, forbid subletting.
Units in those three towers are mostly studios and one-bedrooms, except for the penthouses. The three don't have much in the way of east-facing windows, either; before the United Nations was built, the area east of Tudor City was home to slaughterhouses.
Yet even if they may not be able to gaze across at it, many residents are worried about a tower that the United Nations wants to build at 42nd Street and First Avenue, in the Robert Moses Playground.
Proceeds from the sale of the playground to the United Nations would help pay for a new riverfront park nearby, officials say.
But that tower, which still lacks zoning approval, would block the morning light that so many residents rhapsodize over, as well as eliminate a popular open space. ''Do I believe in the mission of the U.N.?'' said Raissa Katona Bennett, who has lived in Tudor City 14 years. ''Absolutely. But we need to preserve open space anytime we can.''
What You'll Pay
In mid-January there were 51 units for sale, at an average of $584,000, according to Streeteasy. The average overall sale price last year in Manhattan was about $1.5 million, brokers say.
The priciest unit in the complex -- a renovated triplex co-op, with two bedrooms and two and a half baths, in Windsor Tower -- was listed at $5.895 million.
The cheapest, in the same building, was a 300-square-foot studio listed at $160,000, though it comes with a rent-stabilized tenant, according to its listing.
Sales have in some ways moved inversely to the city's, with activity falling while prices have climbed.
In 2012, there were 104 closings, at an average of $515,000, according to a Streeteasy analysis. By contrast, in 2008, in the thick of the recession, there were 126 closings, at an average of $441,000, the data show.
Mr. Corcoran, the broker, says the median -- which hasn't shifted much in five years -- may be more relevant. A recent streak of sales of penthouses, which offer private terraces and wood-burning fireplaces, may be skewing the averages upward. ''They're pretty extravagant,'' he said.
What to Do
Each summer for the last five years, one of the private parks has hosted a concert series organized in recent times by Ms. Bennett. Performers at the shows, which raise money for park maintenance, have included Neil Sedaka.
Shops, some quirky, like a balloon store, occupy the storefronts of 5, 25 and 45 Tudor City Place.
Cyclists from across the city pedal to Conrad's Bike Shop, at No. 25. But Convivio, a restaurant at No. 45, closed abruptly in 2011 and is still dark.
The Commute
The closest subway stop, for the 4, 5, 6, 7 and S, is Grand Central, about a 10-minute walk. The M42 bus runs on 42nd Street, the M15 on Second Avenue.
The Schools
A new grade school will open in September at First Avenue and 35th Street. Meanwhile, an option through fifth grade is Public School 116, the Mary Lindley Murray School, on East 33rd.
Last year 77 percent of third graders met standards in English and 80 percent in math, versus 49 and 57 percent citywide.
A middle school nearby is Simon Baruch, at East 21st Street, which enrolls 1,000 students.
And a high school is Norman Thomas, at Park Avenue and 33rd Street, with 2,000 students. SAT averages last year were 370 in reading, 379 in math and 359 in writing, versus 377, 371 and 360 statewide.
The History
The slaughterhouses appear to have been part of an East Side meatpacking zone. Near shops selling veal and mutton was a three-story brick tenement where, in the late 1800s, an Edward Marscheider sold hooks and racks for butchers, according to records. Since the early 2000s, that building has housed the Permanent Mission of Bhutan.

HEADLINE: French Capture Strategic Airport in Move to Retake North Mali

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN and SCOTT SAYARE; Lydia Polgreen reported from Konna, and Scott Sayare from Paris. Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
KONNA, Mali -- French special forces took control of the airport in the Islamic rebel stronghold of Gao, the French government said Saturday, meeting ''serious resistance'' from militants even as they pressed northward.
Gao is one of three main northern cities in Mali that has been under rebel control for months, and the capture of the main strategic points in Gao represents the biggest prize yet in the battle to retake the northern half of the country.
French airstrikes have been pounding the city since France joined the fight at Mali's request on Jan. 11. French troops also took control of a bridge over the Niger River on Saturday, and the capture of the airport allowed a company of French soldiers to be airlifted in on Saturday afternoon, according to Col. Thierry Burkhard, the French military spokesman. 
Another French company was on the road to Gao from Sévaré on Saturday night, and Malian and other African forces had begun to arrive, he said.
He stepped back from an earlier statement by the French Defense Ministry that declared the city freed by French forces, acknowledging that the statement was ''a bit overdone.'' Noting Gao's 70,000 inhabitants, he added, ''it's not with a detachment of special forces that you take over a city.''
But with reinforcements streaming in, the battle for Gao appeared imminent.
Soldiers from Chad and Niger are expected to arrive soon, the French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said in a statement. They will be part of a contingent of 1,900 African troops who have already arrived in Mali, fighting alongside the 2,500 French soldiers deployed here.
Gao's mayor, who had fled to Bamako, the capital, returned to his city on Saturday, Mr. Le Drian said.
In Washington, the Pentagon said Saturday that the United States would provide aerial refueling for French warplanes. The decision increases American involvement, which until now had consisted of transporting French troops and equipment and also providing intelligence, including satellite photographs.
Gao, 600 miles northeast of the capital, had been under the control of the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Al Jazeera broadcast a statement from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in which the group said it had withdrawn temporarily from some cities it held, but would return with greater force.
Little information has come from the other two main cities under rebel control -- Timbuktu, the fabled desert oasis, and Kidal, northeast of Gao -- for the past 10 days because mobile phone networks have been down.
Konna was overrun by Islamic fighters on Jan. 10, prompting France to intervene, and a clearer picture has begun to emerge of the fighting. Residents and officials here said that at least 11 civilians had been killed in French airstrikes.
Charred husks of pickup trucks lined the road into the town, and broken tanks and guns littered the fish market, where the rebels appeared to have set up a temporary base.
Because of France's sudden entry into the fray, the United Nations and the regional trade bloc known as Ecowas, the Economic Community of West African States, have been scrambling to put together an African-led intervention force that has been in the planning stages. The Mali Army, which has struggled to fight the Islamist groups, has been accused of serious human rights violations.
From Konna, it is easy to see why the Malian government pleaded for French help after the Islamist fighters took control of the town. Just 35 miles of asphalt separate Konna from the garrison town of Sévaré, home to the second-biggest airfield in Mali and a vital strategic point for any foreign intervention force.
Residents said their town fell to the rebels when 300 pickup trucks of fighters, bristling with machine guns, rolled in and pushed back the Malian Army troops who had been guarding the town after a fierce battle.
Amadou Traore, 29, a tire repairman, said residents had heard that the Islamist rebels had surrounded the town before the attack, but he had been confident that the army would keep them at bay.
''We thought there was no way for them to enter into the town,'' he said. ''But they came in the night. They told us, 'Tomorrow we will go to Sévaré.' ''
A woman who lived in his compound was hit by a bullet, he said. They tried to take her to the town clinic, but the doctor had fled. ''After two days, she died,'' Mr. Traore said.
Baro Coulibaly fled her house along the main road into town, moving with her husband and six children to the relative safety of the town center, where they stayed with her in-laws for days. They heard French bombs and rebel bullets ricocheting around the mud-walled dwellings.
''Nobody could get in or out,'' Ms. Coulibaly said. ''We were so afraid we barely ate or slept.''
Residents said they heard that the fearsome Tuareg leader of the Islamist group Ansar Dine, Iyad ag Ghali, had led the attack on their town, but no one saw him. The rebels spoke many languages, the residents said. Some were light-skinned Arabs and Tuaregs, a nomadic people, while others were dark-skinned people who spoke the local languages of Niger, Nigeria and Mali.
Boubacar Diallo, a local political leader, said that only a few rebel fighters came at first. Later, hundreds more joined them, overwhelming the Malian soldiers based here. He said he never saw them pray and scoffed at their assertion that they would teach the Muslim population a purer form of Islam.
''They say they are Muslims, but I don't know any Muslim who does not pray,'' Mr. Diallo said.
The fighters took down the Malian flag and raised a banner of their own, a white piece of paper printed with words in Arabic -- ''Assembly for the Spiritual Ideology to Purify the African World'' -- and pictures of machine guns.
After the Islamist fighters fled, Mr. Diallo took it down and replaced it with the Malian flag.

HEADLINE: With a Departure, a Job Is Again Redefined

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Most White House jobs are self-explanatory: Chief of staff. Press secretary. National security adviser. Then there is the job of ''senior adviser'' -- as influential as any, and more than most, but the sort of post whose duties change with each new occupant and his times.
And so it is now that President Obama has tapped as his new senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who follows in the hard-to-follow steps of the two Davids most closely associated with Mr. Obama's rapid rise, election and re-election: first David Axelrod, who left the White House two years ago, and then David Plouffe, whose final day there was Friday. 
The transition last week draws attention to a West Wing office that at once has been crucial to Mr. Obama's presidency yet was nearly eliminated once he was re-elected and Mr. Plouffe (pronounced Pluff) kept to his plans to leave the administration.
For the president's first two years, Mr. Axelrod, 57, who is extroverted and disorganized, was the protector of the Obama brand, overseeing the president's shift from campaign platform to governing agenda on all issues -- and doing so amid an economic crisis that forced unanticipated actions like an $800 billion stimulus package and an overhaul of financial industry regulations.
For the past two years, the introverted and hyper-disciplined Mr. Plouffe, 45, served as what he called ''the connective tissue'' between the administration and the re-election campaign, making sure that the actions of one did not threaten the success of the other.
In November, with the president re-elected and his second-term agenda defined, Mr. Obama and close advisers initially wondered whether he needed a successor to Mr. Plouffe. Mr. Obama decided that he did -- someone who could continue to take the long view, while others managed the daily distractions of their particular portfolios, domestic or international.
''The president does want someone who's thinking down the road a little bit -- it's hard to describe,'' Mr. Plouffe said in an interview. ''The role is really to make sure you're thinking about things strategically, you're thinking about the next move or two or three, you're providing some guidance on messaging.''
Of Mr. Pfeiffer, who is 37 and has been Mr. Obama's communications director, Mr. Plouffe said: ''Ultimately Dan's going to be someone who's going to be looked at most authoritatively to describe how a certain strategy would unfold, what the downsides are, what the trap doors are. You can't really look at it as a direct replacement. Even Axe and I, we didn't do exactly the same thing.''
The job of senior adviser -- equal parts counselor, confidant, strategist and truth-teller -- is not new to the Obama White House, yet it is a relatively modern invention.
The presidential historian Michael Beschloss cites as an early model Louis Howe, who guided the polio-stricken Franklin D. Roosevelt back into politics and ultimately the presidency and was so close a White House counselor that he stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom. But Mr. Beschloss said the role of an in-house strategist took root with President Richard M. Nixon and his reliance on his longtime aides H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.
More recent examples that he and others cite include George Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala, who were aides to President Bill Clinton, and President George W. Bush's advisers Karen Hughes, Karl Rove and Dan Bartlett.
The near institutionalization of the job reflects ''the whole idea of the permanent campaign,'' Mr. Beschloss said. ''Presidents have come to recognize that they do not have to worry about politics and their message only in election years.''
By definition, a common attribute of these advisers seems to be enjoying a relationship of trust and familiarity, even intimacy, formed with a president by shared experience on the bumpy road to the White House.
''An important thing is to view decisions through the prism of 'Is this true to who we are?' '' Mr. Plouffe said. ''And that's kind of an instinctive thing, a judgment on 'Is this consistent with what we campaigned on, and who he is?' ''
While Mr. Plouffe and Mr. Axelrod have worked longer for Mr. Obama, Mr. Pfeiffer is one of ''the originals,'' as aides refer to those who have been with the president since at least January 2007, when he began his race to the White House. Fewer remain for the second term -- among them Denis McDonough, designated as the new chief of staff; Alyssa Mastromonaco, deputy chief of staff; and the presidential assistants Valerie Jarrett and Pete Rouse -- which lent weight to the argument for keeping a senior adviser, someone with institutional memory, aides said.
While the stylistic differences between Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Plouffe were evident, Mr. Pfeiffer is similar enough to Mr. Plouffe -- reserved, competitive and obsessed with how Americans get information online -- that White House colleagues joke, ''You're going from one guy from Delaware with lots of P's and F's in his name to another.''
Mr. Obama, in a surprise public farewell to Mr. Plouffe on Friday, said that ''were it not for him, we would not have been as effective a White House, and I probably wouldn't be here.''
In the interview, Mr. Plouffe said, ''The first thing I'm going to do is go spend a lot of time with my family,'' including taking his son, Everett, 8, and his daughter, Vivian, 4, to and from school. Then he will give speeches, consult with private sector clients ''and leave time to help him'' -- the president -- ''from the outside, unofficially.''
While Mr. Plouffe is likely to be courted by Democrats running for the presidential nomination in 2016, he said he was done with presidential campaigns: ''I think that -- and I presume David would say the same thing -- you'll never top this.''

HEADLINE: The Preppers Next Door

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, on a leisurely Sunday afternoon, 40 people gathered at a church in Washington Heights for a show-and-tell session sponsored by the New York City Preppers Network. One by one, they stood in front of the room and exhibited their ''bug-out bags,'' meticulously packed receptacles filled with equipment meant to see them through the collapse of civilization.
Onto a folding table came a breathtaking array of disaster swag: compasses and iodine pills, hand-cranked radios and solar-powered flashlights, magnesium fire-starters and a fully charged Kindle with digital road maps of the tristate region. Many of the items on display went far beyond the ''10 Basic Pillars of Bug-Out Gear'' that Jason Charles, the network's leader, had passed out in advance through the Internet. A good number were tweaked to fit their owners' needs and interests. A locksmith in the group had a lock-picking set. A vegetarian had a stash of homemade dehydrated lentils. One man had a condom designed to serve as an emergency canteen; another had a rat trap -- to catch and eat the rats. 
After showing off his own bag (parachute cord, a bivy sack, a two-week supply of Meals Ready to Eat), Mr. Charles, a New York City firefighter, told the group that he had just bought a dog. ''So now I have to implement his plan, too,'' he said a little worriedly. With a pause and a sheepish look, he added, ''That's weird, right?''
New York hardly seems like a natural location for what has become known as the prepper movement, but in fact the city's prepping community is not only large and remarkably diverse, its leaders say, it's also growing rapidly.
To the unprepared, the very word ''prepper'' is likely to summon images of armed zealots hunkered down in bunkers awaiting the End of Days, but the reality, at least here in New York, is less dramatic. Local Preppers are doctors, doormen, charter school executives, subway conductors, advertising writers and happily married couples from the Bronx. They are no doubt people that you know -- your acquaintances and neighbors. People, I'll admit, like myself.
It isn't easy being a Prepper these days. The discipline has taken blows from TV programs like ''Doomsday Preppers,'' which -- despite its record ratings and recent episodes, like ''Escape From New York'' -- is more or less a weekly invitation to laugh at lunatics tunneling into mountainsides to escape a Russian nuclear attack. Last month, a chill went through the movement when it turned out that the mother of Adam Lanza, the shooter in the Newtown, Conn., killings, was a Prepper. Even though prepping is increasingly visible in the culture -- through meet-up groups, books, films and weekend retreats at which canning skills are learned -- it continues to be thought of as a marginal and unseemly business, something on par with believing that the Bilderberg Group controls world events or that the government is hiding aliens at Area 51.
MY OWN ATTEMPTS at prepping started at a point between the fall of Lehman Brothers and the corresponding rise of quantitative easing, when it occurred to me -- as, of course, it did to many -- that the financial system was appallingly unstable and that the realm of the possible now included a disruptive reduction in the value of our money. Egged on by admittedly heated readings of doomsday authors like John Mauldin and Charles Hugh Smith, I began to form a picture of the world as a system of unsustainable systems, a rickety Rube Goldberg machine in which the loss of any one piece -- cheap oil, say -- could derail the whole contraption, from truck transportation to the distribution of food.
In the wake of these insights, I called a family friend in Ohio, himself half-a-Prepper, and he advised me to purchase a quantity of Silver Eagle coins as an inflation hedge, which I did. Not long after came the hundred-dollar, home-delivered month's supply of freeze-dried food -- in the standard and the vegetarian options -- from Costco.com. I bought my wife, which is to say, myself, John Seymour's homesteading classic, ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It.'' I began the conversation about acquiring a gun.
While close friends visiting my home might be allowed a look at my haphazard bug-out bag, I mostly kept quiet about prepping, aware of the embarrassment I was courting. It was, therefore, with a measure of relief that I found myself this month among brethren Preppers who intuitively understood my desire to have at hand a packed supply of power bars or a LifeStraw personal drinking tool. You do meet Preppers in New York who are preparing for extreme events like solar flares or an eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera, but most say their concerns are more immediate, more local: chief among them being terrorist attacks, natural disasters and economic collapse.
''The Earth isn't going to crash into Planet X and the Mayan thing never happened'' is how Mr. Charles put it when I introduced myself at the show-and-tell. ''But I'll tell you this,'' he added. ''People here definitely used their preps during Sandy.''
Not surprisingly, the storm attracted numerous recruits to his group and joined a list of totemic prepping moments that already included the much-hyped Y2K fiasco, 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. I learned that New York Preppers prep for reasons as varied as their anxieties and experience. ''It was a pragmatic response to certain things I know,'' said Robert Segal, a wine salesman between jobs, who once worked as an electrical technician on a nuclear submarine. ''As an engineer, I'm sort of a student of how things fall apart.''
I found this practicality attractive. I liked how Preppers were given to debate (bear spray or baseball bats? Water purification or water filtration?) and how they were versed in esoteric areas of knowledge (fish antibiotics, New York City knife laws). I was especially enamored of the jargon: ''GOOD'' (Get Out of Dodge) or ''TEOTWAWKI'' (The End of the World as We Know It). And yet, I must confess, there were moments that gave me pause.
During his presentation, Mr. Charles suggested that a well-prepared bug-out bag was only part of the equation; just as important was knowing where to go. ''Bugging out will not be easy,'' he explained. ''It might take three or four hours to get out of the city. If the bridges are blocked, you might have to use a raft to get across the river. Everyone's situation will be different.''
Then, as the show-and-tell ended, he gave the prize for Best Bag to a precocious young Prepper whose kit included a fishing line, a seat belt cutter, ready-start fuel cubes, several types of multi-tools and a smoke hood. The winner had come with his mother and had dutifully prepared a bag for her. I wanted to talk with him, but when I approached, he asked if I was ''press'' and suspiciously refused to give his name.
I later found out that he was 12.
EARLY IN MY TRAVELS, I was told the man to see for a deeper understanding of prepping in New York was Aton Edwards, founder of the International Preparedness Network and author of the emergency survival guide ''Preparedness Now!'' Mr. Edwards, 51, is often called the city's foremost expert in personal disaster preparation -- he has appeared on the ''Today'' show, has taught his ''Ready Up!'' seminars to hundreds of participants with partners like the Red Cross and has set up, as part of the National Urban Self-Reliance and Preparedness Program, ''incident command centers'' across New York, like the one he recently created for the hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa in the Bronx.
Mr. Edwards has sufficient recognition in the prepping world that just last month someone calling himself Hudson Valley Prepper left a message on Preppergroups.com warning that one day in the not-too-distant future he might head north. ''This guy Aton Edwards,'' the message read, ''a dangerous man in his own right, is currently holding prepper training in New York City and has stated that the number one goal is to get out of the city. Do you think you could stop Aton and his followers once he has been on the road for a week and is starving?''
When I met Mr. Edwards in Brooklyn this month, I found a hulking man dressed entirely in black, sitting in front of a laptop and giving an Internet tutorial on bug-out-bag preparedness to members of Evolver. net, the ''global community of cultural creatives'' established by Daniel Pinchbeck, a proponent of last year's Mayan apocalypse phenomenon. In between displaying items like his Chinese-made survival shovel with the saw blade and nail-puller, Mr. Edwards said: ''Daniel just wants his people to be ready. Even if you're cosmically conscious, you still need to prepare for what it'll be like with no food or water.''
As I got to know him better, Mr. Edwards told me the story of his own interest in disaster preparation, which began, he said, in 1972, when he went to see ''Deliverance'' on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. (''I thought it was a camping movie.'') He entered the theater as a relatively normal 10-year-old, but emerged as a Prepper: ''I said to myself, 'Gee, I should get to learning everything possible to prevent that situation from occurring.' ''
Acquiring skills over the next two decades from military manuals and from Soldier of Fortune magazine, he said he went one day to a course in civil defense hosted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and recalled being horrified that the government was still relying on ''cold war supplies of vienna sausages and five-pound bags of sugar.'' His disillusionment led in 1989 to the founding of I.P.N., which seeks to train civilians to be ready for emergencies like cyber attacks and flu pandemics.
It was not by chance, Mr. Edwards said, that prepping first took root in New York in the black community: he himself is black, and in the 1990s he became a frequent guest on ''The Open Line,'' a call-in radio show on the ''urban adult'' station WBLS. Around the same time, he started giving classes in disaster preparation at the National Action Network, the Rev. Al Sharpton's civil rights group. ''Obviously,'' Mr. Edwards said, ''because of our history, black folks know that bad things happen.''
These days, he added, the prepping movement is ''the strangest mishmash of people you could ever find -- black, white, men, women, everyone. It looks like America.''
In his professional opinion, the next big development in prepping will be the arrival of entrepreneurial capitalists, and this made me think of Fabian Illanes and Roman Zrazhevskiy, two men in their 20s I met at the show-and-tell. Former classmates at George H. Hewlett High School on Long Island, Mr. Illanes and Mr. Zrazhevskiy have been prepping since their teens and recently created Readytogosurvival.com, a Prepper Web site that sells prepacked bug-out bags with paramilitary names like the Tactical Traveler ($439.99) and the Covert Defender ($629.99). They told me that they had been visiting Prepper meetings across the New York region in order ''to discover their customers.''
Mr. Edwards has also entered the Prepper market, and one day I accompanied him to Westchester to observe a consultation he was doing (at $120 an hour) for Jeff and Joanna Lee Doster, a couple in their 50s recently transplanted from Manhattan. The Dosters -- he is a retired marketing executive, and she is the author of ''Celebrity Bedroom Retreats'' -- found themselves without a home during Hurricane Sandy after the poorly timed sale of their apartment on West 57th Street.
''We felt so helpless,'' Ms. Doster said as we arrived. ''That's why we called Aton.''
After examining their new house -- ''Decent elevation, but not too solar-friendly'' -- Mr. Edwards issued his analysis. The Dosters rely on electric power for their heat and water, and given the prevalence of long winter power failures in their town, Mr. Edwards recommended a 60-gallon Aquatank water-storage mattress for under the bed. He also suggested at least 10 boxes of Nuvona emergency food and advised the couple to invest in two electric bicycles, energy-saving lights (''If you want to get jiggy with it, try the LEDs'') and a rooftop windmill for alternate generation.
''Now your worst-case scenario is that something goes down at Indian Point,'' he said, referring to the nuclear reactor in Buchanan, N.Y., 30 minutes away. ''You're in the peak-injury zone. You'd get a pretty serious dose of radioactive particulates.''
The Dosters looked terrified.
''The good part?'' Mr. Edwards reassured them. ''This is a rental.''
PREPPING IS THE BIG SHORT: a bet not just against a city, or a country or a government, but against the whole idea of sustainable civilization. For that reason, it chafes against one of polite society's last remaining taboos -- that the way we live is not simply plagued by certain problems, but is itself insolubly problematic.
It seemed important to know if this all-encompassing negativity was histrionic or appropriate -- that is, if the hard-core Preppers I had met were crazy or were, in fact, on to something. Just before the show-and-tell, I came across a news report about Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, whom Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had recently named to lead a commission investigating how ready the state was for another Hurricane Sandy-like emergency. I arranged an interview, figuring that he, if anyone, could answer my question.
Although he had a cold when we met at his office in Harlem, Dr. Redlener was a soothing presence -- bearded, erudite and open to the notion that ordinary people have a central role in emergency preparedness. The government, he told me, reacted decisively after 9/11, establishing the Department of Homeland Security, so why shouldn't everyday citizens react?
''It's impossible to forget that we live in a world vulnerable to hazards, man-made and natural,'' he said. ''So it's legitimate to ask: What is the impact on individuals?''
His answer was squarely in line with Prepper doctrine. Dr. Redlener said it was rational -- indeed, it was recommended -- to have a three-day supply of food and water, a working flashlight, a first-aid kit, a radio that runs without batteries and a plan in place to rejoin one's relatives after a disaster. He talked about situational awareness, a major Prepper mantra. ''A prepared citizen is someone who understands how to take care of himself,'' he said, ''who has amassed the necessary items, who has a plan.''
When I asked about some of those I had met along the way -- say, the geared-up 12-year-old, Leonardo Ruiz Jr., who, dropping his suspicions, later gave his name to a photographer -- he gave a forbearing smile. ''There's a spectrum,'' Dr. Redlener said. ''On one end is mindless complacency. On the other is paranoia. The challenge is to find that place in the middle where you understand that bad things can happen, but it doesn't consume your life.''
Then he surprised me. I had never heard even a quasi-government official admit that the authorities would not respond promptly in an emergency, but Dr. Redlener said that ''gaps'' existed during ''mega-disasters,'' hours, even days, when there might not be an official response.
''The well-being of many, many people in harm's way will be dependent in those gaps on social networks, on community and on individual preparedness,'' he said.
He added, aphoristically, ''We are all first responders.''

HEADLINE: New Hampshire Police Chiefs Hold a 31-Gun Raffle for a Training Program

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
NEWPORT, N.H. -- When the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police was looking to raise money for an annual cadet training program, it sold raffle tickets for $30 apiece. The drawing was scheduled for May, but by Jan. 12 all 1,000 tickets had been sold.
The prize: 31 guns, with a new winner drawn each day of the month. 
The fund-raiser, sponsored by the association in partnership with two New Hampshire gun makers, Sig Sauer and Sturm, Ruger & Company, has prompted a chorus of protests from lawmakers and gun-control advocates questioning why the police are giving away guns, even in the name of a good cause.
Some in law enforcement have also raised questions. When Chief Nicholas J. Giaccone Jr. of Hanover pulled up information about the raffle on the Internet, he said, he was flabbergasted.
''I looked at the first weapon and Googled that one,'' said Chief Giaccone, who recalled using an expletive when he pulled up information about the Ruger SR-556C, a semiautomatic weapon. ''It's an assault rifle.''
In a letter to the editor of The Eagle-Tribune, which covers southern New Hampshire, Richard J. O'Shaughnessy of Salem wrote, ''People who should know better are adding to the glorification of the gun culture in this state.''
And referring to the shootings last month at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, State Representative Sharon L. Nordgren, a Hanover Democrat, said, ''They're just the same kind that were used in Newtown.''
The Ruger that caught Chief Giaccone's attention is an AR-15-style rifle, which is the most popular style of gun in America, according to dealers, and was the type used by Adam Lanza to kill 20 children and six adults at the elementary school. Another gun in the raffle, the Sig Sauer P226 handgun, was also carried by Mr. Lanza, according to the Connecticut State Police.
''It's just ironic that that would be their choice of the kind of gun that they're raffling,'' Ms. Nordgren said.
Organizers of the raffle are standing firm. In a statement released this month, Chief Paul T. Donovan of Salem, the president of the association, defended the fund-raiser, saying that all winners would be required to meet all applicable rules for gun ownership.
''While this raffle falls on the heels of the recent tragedy in Newtown, Conn., the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police extends their deepest sympathies to the families and first responders,'' Chief Donovan wrote. ''New Hampshire Chiefs of Police feel the issues with these tragic shootings are ones that are contrary to lawful and responsible gun ownership.''
The proceeds from the raffle go toward a cadet program involving participants ages 14 to 20 who are given instructions in various kinds of police skills and procedures. Some of them go on to pursue careers in law enforcement.
The guns will be distributed through another raffle partner, Rody's Gun Shop, a windowless outpost here in Newport, a town that comes to life when employees of Ruger, which is one of its main employers, leave work for the day.
''Around here, most people are into guns,'' said Michael Gaffney, an employee of a nearby hardware store who won a rifle in a raffle years ago. ''You get a chance to win a free gun! It's like any raffle, very much akin to trailer raffles, snowmobile raffles or turkey raffles.''
On a recent weeknight, the Rody's parking lot was filled with idling cars, their occupants waiting for the store to open at 6 o'clock. The store filled up immediately. Customers, some with their children in tow, browsed the shotguns and rifles on the walls and discussed the possibility of gun bans. While the shop's owner would not comment on the raffle, his customers were nonchalant.
''Honestly, I don't see what the big deal is -- they're just talking about it because of Sandy Hook,'' said Lorraine Peterson of Litchfield. ''I don't mean to sound insensitive. This is New Hampshire. This is a sport.''
Gun raffles are business as usual here and in many other parts of the country -- frequently used by hunting clubs and sometimes by athletics booster clubs to raise money and anchor galas.
''We host raffles like this all the time,'' said Richard Olson Jr., the president of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation and the Londonderry Fish and Game Club. ''Anybody that's speaking up is using the Newtown massacre as a pretext to poke at the issue negatively.''
Mr. Olson said that he once planned a gun raffle to raise money for a fishing derby and that he was considering using one to raise money for the wildlife federation's conservation efforts on New England cottontail rabbits.
Shifting economic and political conditions have spread gun raffles to other spheres, too. Josh Harms, a Republican state representative in Illinois, intends to raffle three guns in March to raise money for his campaign treasury.
Greg Hay, a firefighter from Quincy, Ill., said his union decided last January to hold a gun raffle to replenish its accounts after a drawn-out arbitration. He said the sluggish economy had limited fund-raising from the union's annual country music concert.
''We didn't really want to have any more assessments, so we needed to start looking at better moneymakers,'' said Mr. Hay, who expects the union, Quincy Firefighters Local 63, to take home about $25,000 from the raffle, which started last June and awards one gun per week for a year.
The fund-raiser has been so successful that the union had planned to sponsor a second one until a recent increase in gun prices -- fueled by increased demand amid fears of gun bans in the wake of the Newtown shooting -- made the effort less promising.
''Maybe we'll hold off until gun prices go down and start to go back to a decent level,'' Mr. Hay said.
Opponents of the raffle in New Hampshire are quick to say it is not the guns they oppose, but the fact that the police are conducting it.
''I think in some respects it shows the wrong message,'' said State Representative Stephen Shurtleff, Democrat of Merrimack. ''For law enforcement, normally they're dealing with firearms in a negative way. For that reason, it's just not an appropriate thing. We're trying to get guns off the street.''

HEADLINE: Mexico: The New China

BYLINE: By CHRIS ANDERSON. 
The former editor of Wired and the author of ''Makers: The New Industrial Revolution.''

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO
IN November I quit my job as the editor of Wired to run 3D Robotics, the San Diego-based drone company I started with a partner as a side project three years ago. We make autopilot technology and small aircraft -- both planes and multirotor copters -- that can fly by themselves. The drones, which sell for a few hundred bucks, are for civilians: they don't shoot anything but photographs and videos. And they're incredibly fun to build (which we do with the ample help of robots). It wasn't a hard decision to give up publishing for this.
But my company, like many manufacturers, is faced with a familiar challenge: its main competitors are Chinese companies that have the dual advantages of cheap labor and top-notch engineering. So, naturally, when we were raising a round of investment financing last year, venture capitalists demanded a plausible explanation for how our little start-up could beat its Chinese rivals. The answer was as much a surprise to the investors as it had been to me a few years earlier: Mexico. In particular, Tijuana. 
Like many Americans, until recently, when I heard ''Tijuana'' I thought only of drug cartels and cheap tequila. ''TJ,'' though, is a city of more than two million people (larger than neighboring San Diego), and it has become North America's electronics assembly hot spot: most of the flat-screen TVs sold in the United States, from companies like Samsung and Sony, are made there, along with everything from medical devices to aerospace parts. Jordi Muñoz, the smart young guy who had taught me about drones and then started 3D Robotics with me, is from TJ -- and he persuaded me to build a second factory there to supplement the work we were doing in San Diego.
Shuttling between the two factories -- in San Diego, where we engineer our drones, and in TJ, where we assemble them -- I'm reminded of a similar experience I had a decade earlier. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I lived in Hong Kong (working for The Economist) and saw how that city was paired with the ''special economic zone'' of Shenzhen across the border on the Chinese mainland in Guangdong Province. Together, the two created a world-beating manufacturing hub: business, design and finance in Hong Kong, manufacturing in Shenzhen. The clear division of labor between the two became a model for modern China.
Today, what Shenzhen is to Hong Kong, Tijuana is becoming to San Diego. You can drive from our San Diego engineering center to our Tijuana factory in 20 minutes, no passport required. (A passport is needed to come back, but there are fast-track lanes for business people.) Some of our employees commute across the border each day; good doctors are cheaper and easier to find in TJ, as are private schools, although it's generally nicer to live in San Diego. In some ways, the border feels more like the notional borders of the European Union than a divide between the developed and developing worlds.
And it's not just TJ. To the east, in Juárez, Dell computers are built by Foxconn, the company that manufactures more than 40 percent of the world's electronics (including Apple's iPhone and iPad). To the south, in Querétaro, a factory builds the transmissions that General Motors installs in its Corvettes. The design of General Electric's GEnx turbine jet engine and the production of interior elements of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner also happen in Mexico. Manufactured goods are the country's chief export, with private investment in this sector among the highest in the world.
The notion that Mexico offers only cheap labor is just plain off the mark. Mexico graduates some 115,000 engineering students per year -- roughly three times as many as the U.S. on a per-capita basis. One result is that some machine specialists are typically easier to find in TJ than in many big American cities. So, for that matter, are accountants experienced in production economics and other highly skilled workers.
What all these pieces add up to is a model -- one that might hold the long-sought answer for how American manufacturers can compete with those in China, India and the next generation of economic powerhouses. That's because the TJ template isn't so much about outsourcing as it is quicksourcing. And that's also the way to create thousands of good jobs in the United States.
As any entrepreneur can tell you, the shorter and more nimble a supply chain is, the better.
First, a shorter supply chain means that a company can make things when it wants to, instead of solely when it has to. Strange as it may seem, many small manufacturers don't have that option. When we started 3D, we produced everything in China and needed to order in units of thousands to get good pricing. That meant that we had to write big checks to make big batches of goods -- money we wouldn't see again until all those products sold, sometimes a year or more later. Now that we carry out our production locally, we're able to make only what we need that week.
Second, there's less risk. If we make an error in a design, we've wasted at most a few days' worth of production. If there's something wrong in the production process itself, we can spot it fast. We control the component inventory, so we can see what's going into our goods and know that we're not being ripped off with used or pirated parts. And if we want to protect our intellectual property, we can do so without having to trust that other companies will uphold our interests above all others. And that's saying nothing about political risk, environmental risk or P.R. risk, all of which companies like Apple and Walmart have learned about in China the hard way.
Third, it's simply faster. We still order some parts from China, and even though we use FedEx, it always seems to take weeks, and sometimes months, longer than we'd planned. That's not a criticism of China; it's merely intrinsic to any arm's-length relationship between small buyers and big makers. If we were Apple, we'd get overnight service. But we're not, so we wait.
Finally, a short supply chain is an incentive to innovate. If you're outsourcing the manufacturing of huge parcels of a product, you can't change that product until you've sold all the ones you've already made (at least not if you want to stay in business). So that often means sitting on your hands, waiting for Version 1 to sell out before starting to make Version 2. But when you're doing just-in-time manufacturing, you can change the product every day if you want -- whether to take advantage of some better or cheaper component or to improve the design.
In the land of the long supply chain, meanwhile, things are changing, too. Inflation-adjusted labor costs in China have more than tripled in the past decade. Wages in China's southern cities are approaching $6 an hour, roughly what they are in Mexico.
Whether factors like these are enough to turn American businesses from outsourcers to quicksourcers remains an open question. But I'm betting my money that they will. The sense of possibility I felt when I first crossed from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in 1997 is what I now feel when I cross from San Diego to Tijuana. The trade routes of the 21st century don't have to follow Marco Polo from West to East. Indeed, in the new manufacturing landscape, the routes don't have to take you far at all.

HEADLINE: Dickens, Austen and Twain, Viewed in a Digital Lens

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
ANY list of the leading novelists of the 19th century, writing in English, would almost surely include Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Mark Twain.
But they do not appear at the top of a list of the most influential writers of their time. Instead, a recent study has found, Jane Austen, author of ''Pride and Prejudice, '' and Sir Walter Scott, the creator of ''Ivanhoe,'' had the greatest effect on other authors, in terms of writing style and themes.
These two were ''the literary equivalent of Homo erectus, or, if you prefer, Adam and Eve,'' Matthew L. Jockers wrote in research published last year. He based his conclusion on an analysis of 3,592 works published from 1780 to 1900. It was a lot of digging, and a computer did it. 
The study, which involved statistical parsing and aggregation of thousands of novels, made other striking observations. For example, Austen's works cluster tightly together in style and theme, while those of George Eliot (a k a Mary Ann Evans) range more broadly, and more closely resemble the patterns of male writers. Using similar criteria, Harriet Beecher Stowe was 20 years ahead of her time, said Mr. Jockers, whose research will soon be published in a book, ''Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History'' (University of Illinois Press).
These findings are hardly the last word. At this stage, this kind of digital analysis is mostly an intriguing sign that Big Data technology is steadily pushing beyond the Internet industry and scientific research into seemingly foreign fields like the social sciences and the humanities. The new tools of discovery provide a fresh look at culture, much as the microscope gave us a closer look at the subtleties of life and the telescope opened the way to faraway galaxies.
''Traditionally, literary history was done by studying a relative handful of texts,'' says Mr. Jockers, an assistant professor of English and a researcher at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska. ''What this technology does is let you see the big picture -- the context in which a writer worked -- on a scale we've never seen before.''
Mr. Jockers, 48, personifies the digital advance in the humanities. He received a Ph.D. in English literature from Southern Illinois University, but was also fascinated by computing and became a self-taught programmer. Before he moved to the University of Nebraska last year, he spent more than a decade at Stanford, where he was a founder of the Stanford Literary Lab, which is dedicated to the digital exploration of books.
Today, Mr. Jockers describes the tools of his trade in terms familiar to an Internet software engineer -- algorithms that use machine learning and network analysis techniques. His mathematical models are tailored to identify word patterns and thematic elements in written text. The number and strength of links among novels determine influence, much the way Google ranks Web sites.
It is this ability to collect, measure and analyze data for meaningful insights that is the promise of Big Data technology. In the humanities and social sciences, the flood of new data comes from many sources including books scanned into digital form, Web sites, blog posts and social network communications.
Data-centric specialties are growing fast, giving rise to a new vocabulary. In political science, this quantitative analysis is called political methodology. In history, there is cliometrics, which applies econometrics to history. In literature, stylometry is the study of an author's writing style, and these days it leans heavily on computing and statistical analysis. Culturomics is the umbrella term used to describe rigorous quantitative inquiries in the social sciences and humanities.
''Some call it computer science and some call it statistics, but the essence is that these algorithmic methods are increasingly part of every discipline now,'' says Gary King, director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard.
Cultural data analysts often adapt biological analogies to describe their work. Mr. Jockers, for example, called his research presentation ''Computing and Visualizing the 19th-Century Literary Genome.''
Such biological metaphors seem apt, because much of the research is a quantitative examination of words. Just as genes are the fundamental building blocks of biology, words are the raw material of ideas.
''What is critical and distinctive to human evolution is ideas, and how they evolve,'' says Jean-Baptiste Michel, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard.
Mr. Michel and another researcher, Erez Lieberman Aiden, led a project to mine the virtual book depository known as Google Books and to track the use of words over time, compare related words and even graph them.
Google cooperated and built the software for making graphs open to the public. The initial version of Google's cultural exploration site began at the end of 2010, based on more than five million books, dating from 1500. By now, Google has scanned 20 million books, and the site is used 50 times a minute. For example, type in ''women'' in comparison to ''men,'' and you see that for centuries the number of references to men dwarfed those for women. The crossover came in 1985, with women ahead ever since.
In work published in Science magazine in 2011, Mr. Michel and the research team tapped the Google Books data to find how quickly the past fades from books. For instance, references to ''1880,'' which peaked in that year, fell to half by 1912, a lag of 32 years. By contrast, ''1973'' declined to half its peak by 1983, only 10 years later. ''We are forgetting our past faster with each passing year,'' the authors wrote.
JON KLEINBERG, a computer scientist at Cornell, and a group of researchers approached collective memory from a very different perspective.
Their work, published last year, focused on what makes spoken lines in movies memorable. Sentences that endure in the public mind are evolutionary success stories, Mr. Kleinberg says, comparing ''the fitness of language and the fitness of organisms.''
As a yardstick, the researchers used the ''memorable quotes'' selected from the popular Internet Movie Database, or IMDb, and the number of times that a particular movie line appears on the Web. Then they compared the memorable lines to the complete scripts of the movies in which they appeared -- about 1,000 movies.
To train their statistical algorithms on common sentence structure, word order and most widely used words, they fed their computers a huge archive of articles from news wires. The memorable lines consisted of surprising words embedded in sentences of ordinary structure. ''We can think of memorable quotes as consisting of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns,'' their study said.
Consider the line ''You had me at hello,'' from the movie ''Jerry McGuire.'' It is, Mr. Kleinberg notes, basically the same sequence of parts of speech as the quotidian ''I met him in Boston.'' Or consider this line from ''Apocalypse Now'': ''I love the smell of napalm in the morning.'' Only one word separates that utterance from this: ''I love the smell of coffee in the morning.''
This kind of analysis can be used for all kinds of communications, including advertising. Indeed, Mr. Kleinberg's group also looked at ad slogans. Statistically, the ones most similar to memorable movie quotes included ''Quality never goes out of style,'' for Levi's jeans, and ''Come to Marlboro Country,'' for Marlboro cigarettes.
But the algorithmic methods aren't a foolproof guide to real-world success. One ad slogan that didn't fit well within the statistical parameters for memorable lines was the Energizer batteries catchphrase, ''It keeps going and going and going.''
Quantitative tools in the humanities and the social sciences, as in other fields, are most powerful when they are controlled by an intelligent human. Experts with deep knowledge of a subject are needed to ask the right questions and to recognize the shortcomings of statistical models.
''You'll always need both,'' says Mr. Jockers, the literary quant. ''But we're at a moment now when there is much greater acceptance of these methods than in the past. There will come a time when this kind of analysis is just part of the tool kit in the humanities, as in every other discipline.''

HEADLINE: 'At a Time When Women Can Be Free, Finally, To Move On to Something More'

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Excerpted from the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition of ''The Feminine Mystique,'' by Betty Friedan, to be published next month by W.W. Norton & Company.

 BODY:
Every writer yearns to create a book that will seize the moment -- to perfectly encapsulate the problem of an era before other people even notice the problem exists. Of course, that almost never happens. Mostly we're happy if we can manage to explain, in an interesting way, something people already know is going on. But Betty Friedan won the gold ring. When ''The Feminine Mystique'' emerged in 1963, it created a reaction so intense that Friedan could later write another book about the things women said to her about the first one (''It Changed My Life''). If there's a list of the most important books of the 20th century, ''The Feminine Mystique'' is on it. It also made one conservative magazine's exclusive roundup of the ''10 most harmful books of the 19th and 20th centuries,'' which if not flattering is at least a testimony to the wallop it packed. 
We're still reading it today. In ''A Strange Stirring,'' her book about ''The Feminine Mystique'' and its impact, Stephanie Coontz writes that her students ''responded viscerally'' to chapters like ''The Sexual Sell'' that spoke to their own feelings of being under pressure to buy consumer goods and ''to present themselves as objects to be consumed.'' And of course, if you want to understand what has happened to American women over the last half-century, their extraordinary journey from Doris Day to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and beyond, you have to start with this book.
Critics -- and many fans -- feel obliged to point out the things that ''The Feminine Mystique'' ignores, and they are right to be a bit flummoxed that although Friedan was writing during the civil rights movement, she barely mentions African-American women. Working-class women make their appearance mainly in a few suggestions that married women who want to work might want to hire a housekeeper or a nanny. Remarkably, Friedan managed to write a whole book indicting American society for its attitudes toward women without discussing its laws. In 1963, most women weren't able to get credit without a male co-signer. In some states they couldn't sit on juries; in others, their husbands had control not only of their property but also of their earnings. Although Friedan obsesses about women getting jobs, she does not mention that newspapers were allowed to divide their help-wanted ads into categories for men and women, or that it was perfectly legal for an employer to announce that certain jobs were for men only. Even the federal government did it.
In a strange way, all those deficits are the book's strength. ''The Feminine Mystique'' is a very specific cry of rage about the way intelligent, well-educated women were kept out of the mainstream of American professional life and regarded as little more than a set of reproductive organs in heels. It is supremely, specifically personal, and that's what gives it such gut-punching power. Friedan dropped out of her postgraduate studies because, she said, her academic success was threatening to her boyfriend. She was furious about the way the female college students of the next generation had been programmed to regard getting an MRS. degree as the be-all and end-all of their experience in higher education. She was enraged by the way the psychiatric profession regarded housewives' unhappiness as a symptom of an out-of-whack libido. She was angry at the way the economy appeared to see her entire sex as simple consumption machines who built national prosperity by buying new appliances for the kitchen and searching madly for the perfect laundry detergent.
And don't get her started on women's magazines. Friedan wrote for them, and she piles up one astonishingly awful example of the selling of the feminine mystique after another. There's one short story about a young woman who planned to ''be something,'' then married, wore out six copies of Dr. Spock's child-care book and wound up declaiming: ''I'm lucky! Lucky! I'M SO GLAD TO BE A WOMAN!'' You really can envision the team from the mental hospital strapping her to a gurney.
The postwar suburbs were either heaven or hell for their inhabitants -- endless stretches of brand-new houses on quarter-acre lots, occupied, during weekday hours, entirely by women and children. I grew up in one in Cincinnati, where the dads drove off to work every morning in what was then the only family car, leaving behind a land in which the only adult males were Tommy the milkman and Art, who drove an old bus outfitted with shelves of groceries that he sold to the stranded housewives. The moms were busy, mainly with the several small kids, but they were not overworked. The high point of the day came at 4 or 5, when the chores were done, dinner was in the oven and the women could congregate in someone's kitchen or on the back porch to drink and talk. In our house at least, that was followed by my father's arrival and a second cocktail hour, during which my parents discussed their day while the older children took the younger ones for endless walks in the stroller. Perhaps the only way Friedan's household resembled mine was in the drinking.
In ''The Feminine Mystique,'' Friedan tried to portray herself as the typical middle-class housewife of the early '60s. But really, the Smith graduate who worked for a series of left-wing and union newspapers in Manhattan before matrimony and motherhood was no such thing. She was from a smaller cadre of women who went to college holding two self-images simultaneously: the future stay-at-home housewife and the serious student who cared about grades and reading lists and serious discussions, who took the same courses as the men -- or who, like Friedan, went to Smith and presumed her courses were actually harder. Then she was off to graduate school until the boy she was dating took her for a walk in the Berkeley hills and said, ''Nothing can come of this, between us. Because I'll never win a fellowship like yours.'' Friedan gave up her academic career, came East and ''lived in the present, working on newspapers with no particular plan. I married, had children, lived according to the feminine mystique as a suburban housewife.''
Did that really happen? Did that one remark from a jealous suitor really send Friedan off to New York and marriage to an entirely different man? It doesn't actually matter. What matters is that as a housewife -- even one who kept writing freelance magazine articles on the side -- Friedan was bored out of her mind. The difference between her era and the past, she understood, was that the nature of housework had changed when Americans moved from the farm to the cities, and then the suburbs. The farm wife had a crucial economic role in the family, which depended on her to manufacture the clothes, the soap, the candles and the cheese; to grow the vegetables and raise the chickens; and to participate in the informal housewife economy where she could trade the things she made for other vital family supplies.
The suburban housewife had no economic point at all, and modern appliances had stripped her of most of the time-consuming chores of the past as well. A woman's sense of self, Friedan wrote, ''once rested on necessary work and achievement in the home.'' But that vanished in an era when housework ''is no longer really necessary or really uses much ability -- in a country and at a time when women can be free, finally, to move on to something more.''
Friedan's analysis of what was bothering her turned into ''The Feminine Mystique.'' And when it hit the stands, women who were feeling bored and trapped by their perfect homes and marriages picked up the book and mentally repositioned themselves in the world. ''Some of the women were outraged that 'The Feminine Mystique' placed their choices into question, and others, like myself, felt at last they had been understood,'' said Madeleine Kunin, who argued about it at her book club in Cambridge, Mass., where she was the wife of a medical student. Kunin later rejoined the working world herself. Like Friedan, she overachieved, and eventually she became governor of Vermont.
As far as I know, none of the moms in my neighborhood read ''The Feminine Mystique.'' If they ever questioned their choices, it was later, when an inherent flaw became apparent in the ideal suburban lifestyle that was celebrated in all those women's magazines that drove Friedan nuts. The feminine mystique was built around the central feminine role as mother, but the first generation of suburbanites had their babies young, and the children were grown and gone while their role-deprived moms were still in the primes of their lives. We looked back from our new homes at college dorms and understood that this was an emptiness we had to protect ourselves against. Later, when we got our late-arriving hands on ''The Feminine Mystique,'' it was an aha! moment. Friedan's obsession about having a career -- the one answer she seemed to grab at for every single problem -- made perfect sense.
''The Feminine Mystique'' became the kind of best seller that defines an author's life. In 1966, Friedan was researching another book in Washington when she wound up at a conference of state commissions on the status of women, where attendees were angry over the fact that the federal government had made it clear it had no intention of enforcing a law against job discrimination on the basis of sex that was included in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. (This is a good time to point out that ''The Feminine Mystique'' did not create the women's rights movement. Those commissions on the status of women were started by the Kennedy administration before the book was published, and the Civil Rights Act was being debated in Congress while American housewives were still just starting to pass Friedan's book around.)
It was in Friedan's hotel room that the angry conference-goers met to discuss what they should do when the Johnson administration showed no interest in pursuing the issue. (Friedan was universally known as a difficult personality, and at one point she locked herself in the bathroom and told everyone to go home, but no one did.) The next day, it was Friedan's coterie that angrily passed around notes at lunch, creating, on the spot, the National Organization for Women, which Friedan would head. It would be NOW, under Friedan, that would file suits on behalf of exactly the kind of average, unglamorous, working women that ''The Feminine Mystique'' is always criticized for ignoring. And in 1970, it was Friedan who called for the great march to celebrate the 50th anniversary of women's suffrage, creating a mass turnout in cities around the country that would drive home to the nation exactly how determined women were to transform their lives and their society. In New York, the marchers were denied a parade permit for Fifth Avenue and were told to keep to the sidewalks. Friedan, at the head of the pack, took the lead again. ''There was no way we were about to walk down Fifth Avenue in a little thin line,'' she wrote later. ''I waved my arms over my head and yelled, 'Take to the streets!' What a moment that was.''

HEADLINE: The Life Robotic

BYLINE: Interview by ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
As a futurist, you are famous for making predictions of when technological innovations will actually occur. Are you willing to predict the year you will die? My plan is to stick around. We'll get to a point about 15 years from now where we're adding more than a year every year to your life expectancy.
To clarify, you're predicting your immortality. The problem is I can't get on the phone with you in the future and say, ''Well, I've done it, I have lived forever,'' because it's never forever. 
You have described microscopic nanobots of the future that will be able to shape shift into anything, even gather into patterns that mimic familiar life-forms. So millions of nanobots will be running around that look just like Ray Kurzweil? This idea of creating a whole virtual body with nanobots, that's more like a 2050 scenario. But by the 2030s we'll be putting millions of nanobots inside our bodies to augment our immune system, to basically wipe out disease. One scientist cured Type I diabetes in rats with a blood-cell-size device already.
I'm curious what will happen to marriage if we become immortal. I think a lot of people look across the table at their spouse and think, 50 years is more than enough time to spend with any one person. The concept of marriage has changed. Fifty percent of marriages dissolve within a decade or two, and people already have second life spouses.
But what about you and your wife? Are you mated for eternity? We've been married 37 years. I made a commitment to my wife, and I have no intention of changing that. But I actually don't talk about the very long term. I'm focused on the challenges of the week and the year, maybe the decade.
Your critics like to say that in addition to foreseeing much that has come to pass -- like predicting in 1983 that a computer would dominate humans in chess by the late '90s -- you have also made plenty of erroneous predictions, like writing in 1999 that there would be continuous economic growth for the United States and a consistently rising stock market through 2019. But there has been continuous economic growth, every single year except one over the last decade.
Your father, a musical conductor, died when you were 22, and you insist that by using his DNA, as well as the music and writing he left, you can reanimate him. Will we literally find him on a car lot picking out a new Cadillac? By 2029, computers will have emotional intelligence and be convincing as people. This implies that these are people with volition just like you and I, not just games that you turn on or off. Is it my father? You could argue that it's a simulation. But it's not something you can play with. You don't want to bring someone back who might be very depressed because the world is very different than they expect and the people they know aren't around.
You predict that by 2045, computing will be somewhere in the neighborhood of one billion times as powerful as all the human brains on earth. But if these machines are so smart, won't they achieve some sort of dominion over us? It's not us versus them. We've created these tools to overcome our limitations, and we've integrated with them already. A.I. today is not in three or four dark federal intelligence agencies; it's in billions of mobile devices around the world.
You've said that if you woke up one day with a terminal disease, you'd be forced to invent a cure. Were you being serious? I absolutely would try. I'm working now on a cancer project with some scientists at M.I.T., and if I develop cancer, I do have some ideas of what I would do.
I imagine a lot of people would hear that and say, Ray, if you think you're capable of curing yourself, why don't you go ahead and start curing others? Well, I mean, I do have to pick my priorities. Nobody can do everything. What we spend our time on is probably the most important decision we make. I don't know if you're aware, but I'm joining Google as director of engineering.

 BODY:
The detective spread out the photographs on the kitchen table, in front of Nicole, on a December morning in 2006. She was 17, but in the pictures, she saw the face of her 10-year-old self, a half-grown girl wearing make-up. The bodies in the images were broken up by pixelation, but Nicole could see the outline of her father, forcing himself on her. Her mother, sitting next to her, burst into sobs.
The detective spoke gently, but he had brutal news: the pictures had been downloaded onto thousands of computers via file-sharing services around the world. They were among the most widely circulated child pornography on the Internet. Also online were video clips, similarly notorious, in which Nicole spoke words her father had scripted for her, sometimes at the behest of other men. For years, investigators in the United States, Canada and Europe had been trying to identify the girl in the images. 
Nicole's parents split up when she was a toddler, and she grew up living with her mother and stepfather and visiting her father, a former policeman, every other weekend at his apartment in a suburban town in the Pacific Northwest. He started showing her child pornography when she was about 9, telling her that it was normal for fathers and daughters to ''play games'' like in the pictures. Soon after, he started forcing her to perform oral sex and raping her, dressing her in tight clothes and sometimes binding her with ropes. When she turned 12, she told him to stop, but he used threats and intimidation to continue the abuse for about a year. He said that if she told anyone what he'd done, everyone would hate her for letting him. He said that her mother would no longer love her.
Nicole (who asked me to use her middle name to protect her privacy) knew her father had a tripod set up in his bedroom. She asked if he'd ever shown the pictures to anyone. He said no, and she believed him. ''It was all so hidden,'' she told me. ''And he knew how to lie. He taught me to do it. He said: 'You look them straight in the eye. You make your shoulders square. You breathe normally.' ''
When she was 16, Nicole told her mother, in a burst of tears, what had been going on at her father's house. Her father was arrested for child rape. The police asked Nicole whether he took pictures. She said yes, but that she didn't think he showed them to anyone. A few months later, while her father was out on bail, Nicole was using a computer he gave her to work on a presentation for Spanish class when she came across a file with a vulgar name that she couldn't open. She showed it to her mother and stepfather, and they brought the computer to the police.
A search detected five deleted video files of child pornography, two of them showing Nicole and her father. In the spring of 2006, he was charged with a new crime -- producing the videos -- and he fled the country. At this point, the police didn't realize that Nicole's father had also distributed the images.
Months later, the police said they had no leads on her father, so Nicole went on television to ask the public for any tips that might help them find him. A police officer in Toronto involved in tracking child pornography around the world saw the broadcast and recognized Nicole as an older version of the girl in the notorious videos. The Toronto officer set off an alert that reached the police in Nicole's hometown, informing them that she was the victim in a major pornography-distribution case.
The alert brought the local detective to Nicole's house on that December day, to confirm that she was in fact the girl in the pictures that circulated around the globe. ''It was the worst moment of my life,'' Nicole said of seeing the pictures of herself. ''In a way, I didn't remember it being that bad with my father -- and then I saw that it was. Knowing that other people, all over, had seen me like that, I just froze. I could hear my mother crying, but I couldn't cry.''
Nicole's appearance on TV produced a tip that eventually led the police to arrest her father in Hong Kong. But by going public, she had inadvertently exposed her identity to thousands of men who for years had collected her images. On one Web site with an American flag design, on a thread that continued for four years, commenters described in detail the acts of rape and bondage Nicole had experienced. One called the videos ''legendary.'' Another called her ''an eager participant'' because her father instructed her to smile and talk in the videos. ''The fact remains that she is the most searched for, sought after and downloaded ever,'' a third commenter wrote. ''There are hours of video out there. It's just too bad there are not more willing like her.''
For Nicole, knowing that so many men have witnessed and taken pleasure from her abuse has been excruciating. ''You have an image of yourself as a person, but here is this other image,'' she told me. ''You know it's not true, but all those other people will believe that it's you -- that this is who you really are.''
Until the 1970s, magazines with titles like Lolita were rife with sexual images of minors and routinely sold alongside adult pornography at red-light bookstores. In 1978, Congress made child pornography illegal, and four years later, the Supreme Court upheld a state law banning its sale. The court's decision changed the market along with the law. ''The commercial distributors started to go out of business,'' said Kenneth Lanning, a retired F.B.I. agent who consulted on child pornography cases for decades. For a time, distribution and production plummeted. But then came the Internet. By the mid- to late 1990s, Lanning said, ''there was a way for people seeking it to find each other and send images.''
A decade later, the Justice Department interviewed veteran experts like Lanning for a 2010 report, and concluded that ''the market -- in terms of numbers of offenders, images and victims'' -- was growing to a degree described as ''overwhelming'' and ''exponential.'' In the early-Web year of 1994, only 61 defendants were sentenced in federal court for child-pornography offenses; in 2011, 1,880 were, a 30-fold increase. The federal definition of child pornography extends to young people up to age 18, but the 2010 report noted that it had become more common for images to involve young children, as well as violence and sadism.
Precise numbers of child-pornography viewers are hard to come by. Unicef estimates that there are at least hundreds of thousands of Web sites with child pornography worldwide. Child-pornography consumers are even more likely to swap with one another via hidden networks. Using a tool developed at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2009, police have logged close to 22 million public I.P. addresses offering child-pornography pictures or videos via peer-to-peer file sharing, which allows users to download content from one computer to another; almost 10 million of the I.P. addresses were located in the United States. Many of the users shared only a single illegal image, perhaps downloaded inadvertently, but others offered collections of hundreds or thousands of pictures.
To gain access to a group of downloaders, a recent arrival may have to prove himself by delivering new material. Often this involves digitally altering an existing image, but in some cases, it can also mean seducing children to create new pictures to trade. The most desired series zoom around the Internet. ''A lot of these guys have a collector's mentality,'' Lanning said. The pictures Nicole's father took became must-haves and went viral.
For Nicole, knowing that her photos were circulating was an unrelenting burden. It was hard to concentrate at school and hard to forge new friendships. She stayed close to just a few friends from her church. Her family is deeply Christian -- ''I've found comfort in my faith,'' she says -- and she was home-schooled for a few years as a younger child. Her friends from church were the only ones she told about her father. ''Everyone else I held at arm's length,'' she told me when we met this summer at her lawyer's office. Nicole speaks deliberately and carefully, and on that day she was wearing an outfit that matched her coral nail polish and perfectly applied makeup. ''But other kids found out after my father was charged. I remember walking down the hallways and thinking I could hear people saying, 'There's the girl who was raped by her dad.' ''
In her junior year, Nicole transferred to a community college with a program for students who wanted to earn an associate's degree while finishing high school. ''At the time I'd have said I went for academic reasons, but looking back, it was also to isolate myself,'' she said.
Late that spring, Nicole got a series of messages on Myspace from a man who said he had been looking for her for five years. He asked, ''Want me to come visit u?'' When Nicole blocked him, he wrote to one of her friends on Myspace, telling her that Nicole was a ''porn star'' -- and sending two images. ''That's when I fully realized what it meant for these pictures to be out there,'' Nicole said. ''I couldn't get away from it, not really. I started getting paranoid and having nightmares.''
The man was arrested and went to prison, but Nicole couldn't avoid the knowledge that other men were still looking at the sexual photos of her young self. Later that year, she got a letter from the Victim Notification System at the Justice Department. Congress had passed a law in 2004 mandating that crime victims receive notice every time a suspect is arrested or has a court appearance. The letter was addressed to Nicole's mother and stepfather because she hadn't yet turned 18; it informed them that a man in California had been arrested for possessing a pornographic photo of her. ''It just sat there on the counter for days,'' Nicole remembered. ''We didn't really know where to put it.'' More arrests followed and more letters -- piles of them. ''We stacked them in a laundry basket in a walk-in closet so I wouldn't have to see them,'' Nicole said. ''Then there were more baskets, and we had to move them to the garage. It was really hard for me. I was still scared of my father, but I knew him. These other people, they were strangers, and there were so many of them.''
The piles of letters would eventually connect Nicole with another young woman who had also been abused and then lead them both to court. Back in April 1998, in one of the first investigations into Internet trafficking of child pornography, the F.B.I. started tracking an AOL user, with the handle HAZMAT029, who was posting on an AOL bulletin board service. HAZMAT029 sent 80 illegal pictures to another user, BMR169, along with e-mails that included the message: ''do me a favor. get a peice [sic] of paper and wright HI HAZ on it and take a pic of her in nothing but stockings pulled down below her [genitals].'' BMR169 e-mailed back pictures of a young girl, her shorts and underwear pulled to the side, sitting on a gray carpet in front of a wooden dresser. Next to her, a note read, ''HI HAZ.''
The F.B.I. traced BMR's AOL account to a suburban house in a small town, and in October of that year, a team of agents arrived with a search warrant. In a basement bedroom, they found the gray carpet and the dresser. They also seized a computer full of illegal images, including pictures that showed the same girl being forced to give oral sex and being raped. The man the F.B.I. suspected was BMR wasn't home, so the agents showed the face of the child in the photos to his wife and his adult son. Did they recognize the girl?
They did. As they spoke, one of the agents looked out the window of the house and saw the girl playing in the yard across the street. ''It's something I'll never forget,'' he told me.
Amy, as she's called in the court documents, was BMR's 9-year-old niece. Shown sanitized versions of the pictures, Amy denied that her uncle had abused her. She said he told her she was special and took her to buy treats like beef jerky, and she didn't want anything bad to happen to him. ''How is he?'' she asked her parents in the weeks after his arrest. ''Is he going to be mad at me?''
Over months of therapy, Amy began to talk about the abuse. ''My mind has everything in it,'' she told her therapist, according to court records I read with her permission. She remembered her uncle trying to have sex with her -- it hurt, and she pulled away. And she remembered, at his direction, chatting with men over the Internet about the photos he sent them.
Amy's uncle pleaded guilty to one count of rape and two counts of child sexual abuse in state court and was sentenced to the minimum for each one, adding up to 12½ years in prison. In federal court, he pleaded guilty to one count of production of child pornography and received a 12-year sentence. Amy's current lawyer, James Marsh, says her parents were told the state and federal penalties would run consecutively, but instead, her uncle was allowed to serve the two at the same time.
Amy was given a diagnosis of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder the year her uncle was sentenced, but she also asked to stop going to therapy -- she told her parents that she didn't want to talk about the abuse anymore. Her mother, who worked in health care, and her father, a tradesman, blamed themselves for trusting Amy's uncle with her. For years Amy's mother barely spoke to Amy's aunt, who remained married to her husband, even though the sisters continued to live across the street from each other.
As Amy grew up, she tried to push aside what had happened to her. Every few months, in middle school and high school, her parents would ask if she wanted to talk about it, and each time she would say no. ''I was always thinking about it, but I wasn't ready to deal with how I felt,'' she says now. Amy threw herself into her social life, going out and drinking in the hills behind her house. Even to the friends who knew, it almost seemed as if the abuse hadn't happened.
When she was 17, Amy received her first crime-victim notice from the Justice Department. ''My mom said it was a mistake, because I was still a minor -- the letter should have been addressed to her and my dad,'' she said. ''But it had my name on it, and I never got mail, so I wanted to open it. My parents took me into their room and said we needed to have a talk.'' Amy's parents had never told her that her uncle had distributed images of her to other men. ''It had been so long by then, eight years,'' she said. ''They didn't know how to tell me.''
Amy's parents took her to see Marsh, who had started the public-interest Children's Law Center in Washington. At their first meeting, he explained to Amy that the letters meant her pictures had been traded countless times online. ''I just felt so full of shame,'' Amy said. ''I started wondering, Has he looked at them? He said he hadn't, and that made me feel better. But then I thought, Who has?''
Marsh researched legal remedies for Amy. Combing through his casebooks, he found a provision in the Violence Against Women Act that he had never heard of before: it gave the victims of sex crimes, including child pornography, the right to restitution or compensation for the ''full amount'' of their losses. Enumerating what those losses could be, Congress listed psychiatric care, lost income and legal costs and concluded, ''The issuance of a restitution order under this section is mandatory.''
The provision for restitution, enacted in 1994, had yet to be invoked in a case of child-pornography possession. The basis for such a claim wasn't necessarily self-evident: how could Amy prove that her ongoing trauma was the fault of any one man who looked at her pictures, instead of her uncle, who abused her and made the pornography?
Marsh suggested that Amy see a forensic psychologist, Joyanna Silberg, who evaluated Amy and said she would need therapy throughout her life and could expect to work sporadically because of the likelihood of periodic setbacks. Silberg attributed these costs -- Amy's damages -- to her awareness of the ongoing downloading and viewing. ''Usually, we try to help survivors of child sexual abuse make a very strong distinction between the past and the present,'' Silberg, who has given testimony on Amy's behalf for restitution hearings, told me. ''The idea is to contain the harm: it happened then, and it's not happening anymore. But how do you do that when these images are still out there? The past is still the present, which turns the hallmarks of treatment on their head.''
Marsh put together a lifetime claim for Amy totaling almost $3.4 million. With the crime notices arriving in the mail, Marsh started tracking men charged with possession of her pictures. He looked, in particular, for wealthy defendants. He planned to use the concept of joint and several liability to argue that each defendant should be on the hook for the full amount of his client's damages -- that is, for millions of dollars. Joint and several liability is often used in pollution cases: when several companies dump toxic waste in a lake over time, a plaintiff can go after the company with the deepest pockets, and a judge can hold that single company responsible for the entire cost of the cleanup -- with the understanding that it's up to that polluter to sue the others to pay their share.
In July 2008, Marsh learned about the arrest of Alan Hesketh, a former vice-president of Pfizer, who was charged with trading nearly 2,000 child-pornography photos online -- among them four pictures of Amy. Marsh filed one of his first requests for restitution with the prosecution. Hesketh pleaded guilty, and his sentencing was scheduled for later that year.
At the time of the Hesketh case, Amy was struggling. She was 19 and living with her boyfriend. She had enrolled at a local community college, but she drank too much to concentrate on studying. The crime-victim notices had stirred up the past for her, and she wasn't in regular therapy. ''The last class I went to, there was this PowerPoint slide, something about child sexual abuse, and I thought, I can't do this,'' she told me as she sat in her kitchen smoking a cigarette. ''It just brought everything back.'' Amy dropped out after that, without telling her parents. ''I told myself I would just take a year off,'' she continued. ''But you know, statisticwise, once you leave school, the chances you'll finish go down about 80 percent.''
Amy has a quick intelligence -- she's a college dropout who can rattle off her own odds of going back -- and asks lots of questions. She has focused her curiosity on the legal strategy that Marsh has pursued for her. When Hesketh was sentenced, Amy decided she would be there. ''I kind of wanted to face my fear,'' she told me. She also wanted to prove a point: Hesketh was arguing, through his lawyer, that he had committed a victimless crime -- a common defense in cases of child-pornography possession. ''I thought, I want him to look at me and know that I'm not a picture; I'm a person,'' she said.
In a federal courthouse in Bridgeport, Conn., in October 2008, Amy sat on the opposite side of the courtroom from Hesketh's family. The judge opened the proceedings by acknowledging that there was a victim in the courtroom. Amy listened as Hesketh's grown children asked the judge for mercy for their father. ''His kids kept saying he was the best grandfather ever,'' she said. ''And I was like: 'But you know. You know what he did.' ''
Then Hesketh took the stand. As Amy remembers it, he said, '' 'I'm so sorry.' '' Earlier, he said that ''he hadn't hurt anyone,'' Amy told me. ''Now he totally flipped around. I felt like I'd made an impact. It was like, 'He knows now.' ''
Hesketh was sentenced to 6½ years. Four months later, in an unprecedented move, the judge advised Hesketh to settle the restitution claim and he agreed to pay $130,000.
Not long after, Amy found out she was pregnant. She wasn't sorry -- at the time she had faith in her boyfriend, whom she had told about the abuse and the photos. But he was a heroin user and dealer, and he went to jail two months after their son was born. Amy started seeing another man who she says had a jealous streak and broke her nose, twice. He also broke her infant son's leg, she told me. She took the blame when he threatened her, and she had to give up custody to her mother for six months.
As she recalled this time in her life, she took out her phone and scrolled through her photos until she found a close-up of her beaten face: lip split, one eye half-closed, nose swollen and cheek yellow with bruises. The young woman next to me had clear skin and bright eyes, and I had just watched her charm a police officer into calling us a cab. The girl in the photo was expressionless.
Amy stared at the picture on her phone. ''That was my normal,'' she said.
Six months after Hesketh's sentencing, Marsh went after another child-pornography defendant, Arthur Staples, a 65-year-old sheriff's deputy in Virginia, who had chatted online with an undercover detective and expressed an interest in young children. Staples sent one image of a young girl (not Amy), and he was caught with more than 600 pictures on his computer, including hers. Staples agreed not to appeal any sentence or restitution judgment. The judge sentenced him to 17½ years, and made the unusual move of ordering him to pay all of Amy's claim. To Marsh's surprise, Staples turned out to have $2 million in assets. He has since paid $1.2 million to Amy. (Marsh says the government let Staples's wife keep part of the estate.) While Amy has been turned down for restitution by some courts, which have stated that there was not enough proof that any one man who viewed her pictures was responsible for the harm she has suffered, she has won more than 150 cases, totaling $1.6 million. Most of the amounts aren't large: $1,000 or even $100, paid out in checks as small as $7.33.
Nicole has also been pursuing restitution. Her lawyer, Carol Hepburn, did her own research and got in touch with Marsh when she learned about the claims he was bringing for Amy. The two lawyers now collaborate on ideas and strategy, though they represent their clients separately. Since receiving her first check for $10,000, Nicole has collected more than $550,000, mostly in small amounts from 204 different men. So far only a few other child-pornography victims have gone to court for restitution. Many may not know there is a legal remedy; others don't know their images have circulated.
The restitution checks gave Nicole a lift when they started to trickle in, but, like Amy, she had trouble with the transition into adulthood. In the fall of 2008, Nicole was attending a one-year bible college and working at an ice-cream shop. At work she felt increasingly self-conscious around male customers. Had they seen her pictures? Were they like the man who stalked her on Myspace -- were any of them coming to the store because they knew? That spring, Nicole testified at her father's sentencing. She asked the judge to give him a long punishment, and her father was sent to prison for 50 years. Her roommates, one of whom was a friend from her childhood church, supported her. ''But I didn't have a counselor there, and that was tough,'' she said. ''I called my parents and said: 'I have to quit my job, and I need to come home. I feel like I'm going crazy.' ''
During her first few weeks at home, Nicole slept all day in her childhood bedroom and stayed up late watching sitcoms like ''Sabrina'' and ''The Nanny.'' Finally, she started counseling and was able to get a job doing administrative work at a nuclear-waste site. That June, she testified at the sentencing hearing of four child-pornography defendants caught with her images, hoping to gather strength from speaking out. Instead, the experience made her feel exposed.
More than a year later, in the fall of 2010, she left for a four-year college away from home. She was worried about being on her own, but she wanted to try. ''I push myself,'' she told me. ''I don't like to say something is too much for me.'' Like Amy, however, she took a psychology course, about child development, that brought up unbearable memories. During lectures, she began going blank. ''All of a sudden class would be over, and I would be like, 'What happened?' '' she said. She started skipping class for fear of continuing to disassociate.
Nicole, who wasn't in counseling at the time, failed all but two of her courses that spring. ''I just totally broke down,'' she said. ''I'd come home and sit in the same position and stare into space, and then I'd look at the clock, and it was six hours later.'' Nicole talked about this period of her life with Hepburn and me over dinner one night last summer. She showed us a tattoo on her right wrist: a heart sheltered by wings that she got after her father's sentencing. She also learned to make tattoos, and she took out her phone to show us a picture of the first one she created, an anchor with a rope curled around it. ''My cousin is a tattoo artist, and he taught me,'' she said. ''We grew up together, and he was a very easy person to hang out with during that bad time. I'd go over to his place, and he'd be drawing, and he said, 'You're into design, you could do this.' When I tried I felt this release of emotions. We started drawing for hours to music -- Tom Petty, Cake, everything. You have to learn how to go smoothly and keep the same pressure on the line the whole time. I drew anchors over and over again on grapefruit. I'd been numb for months, and now I could feel again. I actually felt joy.''
In the fall of 2011, Nicole transferred to a campus closer to her family. She made her way through her course work by avoiding subject matter that upset her and by allowing for her own limitations. ''I had to accept that, because I have this extra stressor, I get overwhelmed by things that other people can do,'' she said.
Nicole decided to spare herself going to court, so she wasn't in El Paso, in September 2011, for the sentencing of Luis Enriquez-Alonso, a student at the University of Texas. He agreed to plead guilty after being caught with thousands of illegal videos and images, including Nicole's, on his computer. At the hearing, Enriquez-Alonso and his parents listened while the prosecutor read into the record a statement Nicole wrote about what it is like to know men are looking at her pictures: ''After all these years and going to different counselors, I still haven't learned the trick to let my mind rest,'' Nicole wrote. ''When I do sleep, my dreams are vivid and I remember them for weeks. A common theme is finding myself naked in front of a crowd of people or in an enclosed space and I can't escape or run away fast enough.''
That day, without a court order, Enriquez-Alonso's family handed over a check for $150,000, along with an expression of remorse. ''That really touched me,'' Nicole said, ''that his family wanted to make sure that I was taken care of, that I could get all the counseling I need. Most of the time when I get restitution, there's no story behind it. I feel like they're forced to give the money. In this case, they wanted to do it, and there were words behind it, kind words.'' Enriquez-Alonso, who faced a maximum of 10 years in prison, is serving 5.
Study after study links child sexual abuse to psychological trauma, addiction and violent relationships in adulthood. There is almost no research, however, that deals with the specifics of Amy and Nicole's experiences: What additional harm comes from knowing that pictures of your childhood exploitation are circulating widely?
The Supreme Court actually addressed this question in its 1982 decision upholding child-pornography bans. '' 'Pornography poses an even greater threat to the child victim than does sexual abuse or prostitution,' '' Justice Byron White wrote, quoting from a book about abused children. '' 'Because the child's actions are reduced to a recording, the pornography may haunt him in future years, long after the original misdeed took place.' ''
David Finkelhor, a sociologist who directs the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, sees the moral weight of the Supreme Court's proclamation, but not the empirical proof. ''The evidence doesn't yet tell us to what extent the experience of being a pornography victim aggravates the experience of the sexual abuse itself,'' he told me. ''How do you separate it out?''
Courts have disagreed on this question. In at least a dozen cases, defendants have appealed restitution decisions and mostly won. In five of those cases, federal appeals courts have expressed skepticism that Amy and Nicole should receive more than nominal restitution. Two other appeals courts have allowed the young women to recover from individual defendants as members of the group of viewers but, so far, only for amounts of $10,000 or less. (Amy collected a far greater sum from Arthur Staples because he waived his right to appeal.)
Last spring, the legal battle was focused on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. One panel of three judges upheld full restitution to Amy of millions of dollars from a Texas man. Based on that decision, a second three-judge panel affirmed a separate $529,000 restitution order for Amy against a New Orleans defendant, but voiced its fundamental disagreement with the original ruling. To address the dispute, 15 Fifth Circuit judges gathered last May for a hearing in New Orleans. James Marsh and Carol Hepburn were there along with Amy; Nicole chose not to go. Amy knew this was the most significant hearing to date, and she wanted to show the judges that she was real, just as she had shown Alan Hesketh.
At the lectern to argue her side was Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge who teaches law at the University of Utah. Cassell is a staunch conservative (he challenged the right to a Miranda warning before the Supreme Court), and Marsh and Hepburn, both Democrats, were surprised at first to be allied with him. But as a leading advocate for victims' rights, Cassell sees in Amy's claims a chance to lay the groundwork for broader change.
For 30 years, the victims'-rights movement has fought for a larger role for victims in criminal prosecutions. Victims have gained the right to make statements in court about the impact a crime has had on them, which judges can take into account in determining punishment. Restitution remains an ambitious next step. The standard context is crime involving financial loss -- a bank robber ordered to return stolen money to the bank or an embezzler who must repay the employer he defrauded. Cassell sees Amy and Nicole's cases as a route to expand the idea. ''I'd like to pursue the concept of total restitution for all victims, for whatever crimes and losses a defendant has caused,'' Cassell told me. ''This is a good opportunity to show how it can work.''
In the courtroom, Cassell linked the defendants to the network for child-pornography distribution. ''What the defendants have done is collect images of an 8-year-old girl being bound, raped and sodomized,'' he said. ''If you participate in a market, you become responsible for that market.''The lawyer for the New Orleans defendant disagreed. She argued that there was no proof that her client, in particular, had harmed Amy -- no way to show that his viewing of her images caused damage. She also called the restitution order for $529,000 ''grossly disproportionate to his culpability relative to other people who have abused Amy.''
Michael Rotker, the lawyer for the department, told the court that the problem with the restitution awards was that there was no statutory authority for joint and several liability -- nothing in the law, as Congress wrote it, which allowed a victim to recover a large award from one defendant who could then seek to recoup those losses by suing other defendants. Instead, Rotker argued, each defendant could be held responsible only for a small and roughly equal fraction of the whole. He offered this hypothetical example: if 200 men were convicted of possessing Amy's images, and her claim for damages totaled $3 million, then a judge would have discretion to order a defendant to pay restitution of $15,000 to $30,000.
As the lawyers spoke, Amy's eyes filled with tears. ''Some of it was hard to listen to,'' she told me later. ''But my therapist said to think of it as a store, with different compartments you can take out and put back. She said, 'When you were a little girl, you had to compartmentalize to deal with everything you went through.' So I can still do that now, and sometimes it's good, I guess.''
At one point in the proceedings, Judge Emilio Garza stopped Cassell, not to challenge him, but to pick up on his theme. ''It seems to me that we're in this brave new world, where not only was there an actual rape, but I'm going to suggest to you there is a continuing digitized rape,'' the judge said. ''Possession of the digitized recording of the rape contributes to the system, contributes to the economic benefit of those who produced this thing.''
The judges would not announce their decision for several months, but at the end of the hearing, Amy focused on what Garza said that day. ''To hear that from a judge -- I couldn't believe it,'' she told me. ''It was so relieving. It was like he really got it. He understood.''
Just six weeks after Amy got home from New Orleans, her uncle was released from prison after completing his concurrent 12-year sentences. Amy says she was greatly relieved when her aunt told her that she wouldn't allow him in the house. Instead, he was paroled nearby. When Marsh texted to give her the address, Amy happened to be only a few blocks from it. ''I almost dropped the phone,'' she said. ''Oh, my God, it was just so weird. I thought, He's got binoculars, he's looking for me. I thought the worst.'' Marsh reminded her that if her uncle contacted her, he would go back to prison. And also that she was an adult now and safe from her uncle's pedophilia.
Last month, while standing in line at Wal-Mart with her brother and a friend, Amy saw a man who she thought was her uncle looking at her. ''I wasn't positive because I haven't seen him for so long,'' she said. ''But as soon as I made eye contact, I didn't breathe.'' Was she being paranoid? She couldn't tell. The man seemed to follow them out of the store. As they got into her car, the man stopped to light a cigarette, and she thought he was staring at them. ''It was very, very scary,'' she said.
Today, a sentence like the one Amy's uncle received -- with no additional prison time for a federal conviction for pornography production and distribution -- is extremely rare. The penalties for distributing or receiving pornography have become harsher. Receiving one illegal photo carries a mandatory minimum penalty of five years. The number of images a defendant downloads increases the punishment, as does his use of a computer. Now that large volumes of data stream with a click, the average recommended prison term for possession has jumped to 10 years, even if a defendant has no criminal record and there is no evidence that he produced or distributed porn. Because some child sexual abuse cases still end in relatively low penalties in state court, there's a paradox: defendants who look at sexual pictures of children can spend more years in prison than people who abuse children but don't have pornography of them.
The United States Sentencing Commission held hearings last February to discuss whether the punishment for child-pornography offenders has become both disproportionate and unfair -- with people who committed similar crimes receiving vastly different penalties, based on the subjective decisions of judges. Restitution was discussed even though the prevailing view is that technically it isn't considered part of punishment. Its purpose is to ''make the victim whole,'' as the legal phrase goes. ''Simply put, an innocent victim should not suffer financial losses from a crime -- the defendant should make good on those losses,'' Cassell said.
But Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who writes a frequently cited blog about sentencing, argues that the commission could rethink the role of restitution. In some cases, restitution could be considered commensurate to prison time -- and courts could recommend shorter sentences for child-pornography collectors who agree to compensate victims based on their ability to pay. Berman thinks the key to making this leap is adopting the point of view of the victim. ''Victims are shrewder than most prosecutors about the diminishing returns of long incarceration,'' he said. ''They want perpetrators to serve some time. They want these men's lives disrupted, and they want the deterrence that helps protect other people. But they're often wise enough to realize that there's not much gain in deterrence from a 5 or 10 year sentence to 15 years. If victims are saying that restitution is as, or more, important to them than five extra years, I very much think the sentencing commission and Congress should listen.''
When I asked Amy about such a trade-off, she supported it. Nicole had mixed feelings: she liked the idea of greater incentives for restitution, but she wasn't sure about giving up longer punishments, given how easy it would be for someone to leave prison and go back to downloading child pornography. Cassell says that using restitution in this way could have value. ''If it makes the perpetrators internalize how they've hurt the victims -- if it makes them see there are real victims -- then you deter them from doing this again when they get out,'' he said.
Berman also favors a proposal that has been discussed at the Justice Department: a general compensation fund that would systematically collect restitution from child-pornography offenders and pay it out to victims like Amy and Nicole based on the harm they suffered and the costs they've incurred because of it. A compensation fund could give more victims the financial means to put their lives back together. And it could force more defendants to reckon with the children in the pictures and with their own role in supporting a market that depends on abuse.
Restitution has allowed Amy and Nicole to get the counseling they need, but receiving large sums can be complicated. When Amy received her $130,000 check from Alan Hesketh, she went on shopping sprees at the mall, splurging at stores like Abercrombie & Fitch. She had never been able to earn a steady paycheck, and the money was a sudden windfall. By the time the $1.2 million check came last spring, she was more considered. She didn't want to stand out in her small town. Last summer, she bought a modest three-bedroom house a few miles from her childhood home, where her mother and brothers still live.
Amy has also discovered that she likes giving money away -- to her mother for a new deck, to a close friend who wanted kitchen cabinets she couldn't otherwise afford. It's her way of dealing with the discomfort of having resources that people around her don't and repaying those who helped her along the way. ''I used to be a mooch to my friends, asking, 'Could I bum a cigarette?' I was a smoker who couldn't afford a pack,'' she told me. ''So now, if you're my friends or family, and you need something, I've got your back.''
Nicole's relationship to her restitution money is different, partly because she has received smaller checks. She used a bit to travel, and to buy a car. She has primarily paid for her education. Though school can still be difficult for her -- during her last semester of college, Nicole continued to miss classes and assignments because she was disassociating -- she graduated in December with an A on her final paper and plans to apply to a master's program in counseling for the fall. At the moment, she's taking time off, renting a house with a friend and having a serious romantic relationship. Eventually, her plan is to earn a Ph.D. in clinical psychology.
Some researchers worry that restitution runs the risk of perpetually casting the people it seeks to help in the role of victim. ''There is some research showing that kids who have been abused benefit from being relieved of the victim identification when cases resolve faster,'' says David Finkelhor, the University of New Hampshire sociologist. But Amy and Nicole say that receiving money doesn't trouble them in that way. Nicole talked about feeling vindicated by the restitution payments. ''I didn't feel ambivalent about the money, not at all,'' she said. When I asked Amy if she thought that the checks were tainted by their tie to the pornography, she said, ''No -- I don't think about it that way.'' She added: ''O.K., I didn't work for this money. I mean, I didn't put in 12-hour days for years straight. But I earned it, kind of. Even if I didn't earn it.''
Amy and I talked about this last summer when I visited her at her new house. Her young son greeted me, pretending to be a monster. They had two new puppies that followed us as she showed me around, pointing out a couple of paintings that I watched her buy in New Orleans (she had asked Marsh how much she could spend). In the basement, Amy flicked on track lights that the previous owner installed over the bar. A door led to the garage, which housed a gleaming car she bought for $15,000.
For more than two years, Amy has been living with the man she started dating after she left the one who broke her nose. They knew each other from high school, and she feels sure about him: he has a full-time job and a long-term plan that includes getting married and then having a baby. When Amy found out her uncle was out of prison, her boyfriend helped calm her down; he said she had nothing to fear now, and she decided he was right.
While I was visiting, I gave Amy a ride to see her therapist -- ''I don't know what I'd do without her, I feel so much better being in therapy'' -- and on the way back, we stopped at her mother's house. Amy took me out on the half-rebuilt deck and pointed through the pine trees to the entrance to the basement of the house where her aunt still lives and where her uncle had taken her.
''I haven't passed through that door since I was 9,'' she said. ''One day I will. Me and my therapist talked about it. I'm not there yet, but I'll get there. I'll be able to go in and be like, 'Yeah, I can do this.' ''
In October, the Fifth Circuit ruled in Amy's favor, in a 10 to 5 decision. The court also accepted the theory of joint and several liability, finding that this means of allocating shared responsibility can ensure ''that Amy receives the full amount of her losses, to the extent possible, while also ensuring that no defendant bears more responsibility than is required for full restitution.'' Victims and the Justice Department can keep track of how much has been recovered, and courts can set a payment schedule based on an individual defendant's ability to pay. ''Ultimately, while the imposition of full restitution may appear harsh, it is not grossly disproportionate to the crime of receiving and possessing child pornography,'' Judge Garza wrote for the court. ''Defendants collectively create the demand that fuels the creation of the abusive images.'' Garza sent Amy's award of $529,000 back to the lower court because it did not provide for restitution ''in full'' -- in other words, it was too small.
The Fifth Circuit's decision creates a clear split among the appeals courts over how to interpret Congress' provision of restitution for sex-crime victims -- a split that only the Supreme Court can resolve. Cassell and Marsh have asked the justices to do that, and the court could hear a restitution case as early as next fall.
For Amy, Supreme Court review is a heady prospect. ''If I win, that will set everything up for other people like me, and that would be so amazing,'' she said. ''I don't even think there are words for it. To help people know that they're not powerless, that would be such a good feeling.''
Nicole worries about the public exposure that a Supreme Court case would bring. But she shared Amy's hope that it would help other victims. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has a database of more than 5,000 child-pornography victims. The center estimates that 12 percent of them have had their photos distributed across the Internet. That means hundreds of young people, in their teens and early 20s, could have potential claims for restitution. ''I need the help I'm getting, especially the counseling,'' Nicole said. ''I want other people to get it, too.'' Restitution can't undo the damage of the past. It can't actually make her or Amy whole. Still, Nicole says, ''it can help give us the tools to heal.''

HEADLINE: Paths to Expiring, in Alphabetical Order

BYLINE: By ERIK PIEPENBURG

 BODY:
He made it past the letter K. But at some point during L -- the one about the masturbation contest to the death -- the poor guy ran out of the movie screening, threw up and left. Who knows what X would have done to him.
A sickened moviegoer is just one reaction the director Jason Eisner (''Hobo With a Shotgun'') witnessed in response to ''L Is for Libido,'' a segment of ''The ABCs of Death,'' a new anthology of 26 horror shorts, each centered around a different letter of the alphabet and depicting death in grotesque, comic, erotic and head-scratching ways. Among other things, the unsettled patron never got to see Mr. Eisner's ''Y Is for Youngbuck,'' about a boy who assumes the spirit of a deer and goes on a revenge spree against a pedophile. 
''The guy looked at me,'' Mr. Eisner remembered, ''and said, 'Man I wanted to stay but this is too crazy for me.' ''
Available on demand on Thursday and opening in theaters on March 8, ''The ABCs of Death'' is a collaboration between the producers Ant Timpson, the creator of the Incredibly Strange Film Festival in Auckland, New Zealand, and Tim League, chief executive of the Alamo Drafthouse chain of movie theaters and founder of Fantastic Fest, the annual genre event held in Austin, Tex. Mr. Timpson and Mr. League recruited a large roster of international filmmakers. They gave each about $5,000 and asked for their top three choices for letters. There were only a few primary ground rules: The films had to be about four minutes long; each entry had to start and end on a red frame; and there had to be at least one death. ''What's cool with having so many voices and visions is that if you don't like a film, it's going to be over in four minutes,'' he said. ''You have a fresh start and a brand new sense of excitement of what's coming next.''
Directors with films in ''The ABCs of Death'' include Ti West (''The House of the Devil''), Srdjan Spasojevic (''A Serbian Film'') and Nacho Vigalondo (''Timecrimes''). One director, Lee Hardcastle, won an online competition to be included; his ''T Is for Toilet'' is a freakish stop-motion film about a killer commode.
Mr. Timpson said much of the film was inspired by children's books, especially alphabet primers, which ''all have a black humor subtext, especially the British ones.''
Rather than an anthology with a through line, Mr. Timpson called ''The ABCs of Death'' more of a ''portmanteau or omnibus'' film in the style of ''Dark Forces,'' a 1980 collection of macabre stories. ''I thought if we could capture one ounce of that, I'd be really stoked,'' he said.
Placement was crucial for Marcel Sarmiento, who originally chose the letters B, C and D to ensure his short appeared at the start of the film. ''I assumed that people were going to outgross one another, which influenced what I made,'' he said. ''I thought I could never compete with those guys, so I'll do something different.'' His entry was ''D Is for Dogfight,'' a revenge fantasy that features graphic scenes of dog-on-man brawling.
The anthology format has long thrived in horror, according to Ryan Turek, managing editor of the blog Shock Till You Drop, notably in the 1960s and '70s, when British companies like Amicus released gothic anthologies like ''The House That Dripped Blood'' and ''Asylum.'' In the 1980s there were Hollywood horror film anthologies like ''Creepshow.'' Eventually, Mr. Turek said, the format declined, because ''they were too difficult to produce, because of large casts and different directors and different negotiations.'' Recently the horror anthology has reappeared in the found-footage film ''V/H/S'' and its follow-up, ''S-VHS,'' which had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month.
''I'm a fan of slow-burn horror,'' said Brad Miska, a producer of ''V/H/S'' and ''S-VHS.'' ''But sometimes you want to have a good time immediately.''
Patrick Cooper, who compiled a list of ''Awesome Horror Anthology Movies'' for the blog Topless Robot, said the form's popularity comes down to the economy of a cheap thrill. ''It takes one simple little idea to make something horror,'' he said. ''You pass a car accident, and the victim looks at you, and then boom, it's a horror story. It unnerves you really fast.''
Mr. Eisner and Mr. Sarmiento cited as an influence ''The Bishop of Battle,'' a short in the 1983 anthology ''Nightmares'' that stars Emilio Estevez as a punk-rock teenager sucked into an arcade video game. Mr. Eisner said the anthology format is relevant now that ''we live in a generation that sits in front of YouTube and shows each other crazy clips.''
''In a short amount of time,'' he said, ''you can get away with a story that features high concept and horrific elements and get away with it easily. If you don't like one, just wait a few minutes.''

HEADLINE: Here Comes the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
As parties go, it was pure spectacle. The celebrity-heavy crowd at the Moore Building, a landmark in Miami's Design District, was celebrating the opening of Dior Homme nearby, swaying to electro-pop, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Pharrell Williams, Martha Stewart and Calvin Klein, and oozing like a lava spill into the street.
The scene, during Art Basel Miami Beach last month, seemed full of promise, heralding the rebirth of this once-blighted area, soon to be animated, if investors have their say, by an influx of diners, art and design lovers, and style-struck shoppers flocking to new luxury outposts like Hermès and Céline. 
So it was surprising to find on a visit last week, that the same swatch of turf stretching from Northeast 38th to Northeast 42nd Street, had the oddly haunted feel of a schoolyard in August. ''The place is so empty,'' lamented Lucie Hugary, a photographer and frequent visitor, a comment often echoed by tourists more accustomed to shopping, barhopping and crowd-gazing on teeming Lincoln Road.
But if traffic here is sparse most days, Craig Robins seems unfazed. Mr. Robins, the developer and force behind this area's renaissance-in-progress, says he is content to bide his time. ''Growth here is a process,'' he says of the neighborhood, which until recently was home mostly to a string of high-end furniture showrooms and a handful of popular dining spots. ''Here things build organically.''
The Design District's location -- within a pebble's throw of Interstate 95 and roughly 15 minutes by cab from South Beach -- would seem to argue in its favor. As does Mr. Robins's timing, in sync with a boom in luxury sales, led in this town by Brazilians and other foreign investors scooping up neighboring condos.
Such factors underpin a proposed $312 million renovation of the area undertaken by Dacra, Mr. Robins's development group, and L Real Estate, a private equity fund in which LVMH is a minor investor. That ambitious redo, in which L Real Estate has a 50 percent share, is expected within a year or two to transform the Design District into an ultra-high-end retail destination. Its centerpiece, a 4-block, 30-foot-wide tree-lined pedestrian promenade, will be anchored at each end by public plazas and department stores.
Mr. Robins's fervor for the scheme rests in part on past success (he played a significant role in the early '90s resurrection of the Art Deco district in South Beach), but mostly on the kind of conviction more commonly found at the megaplex. Build it, he seems to have reasoned, and they are bound to come.
Those who have recently set up shop on Northeast 40th Street, the neighborhood's chief commercial thoroughfare, include Prada, Hermès, Cartier, Céline, Agnona, and Louis Vuitton.
Vuitton hopes the move will help it reach a younger, more trend-driven clientele, said Valérie Chapoulaud-Floquet, the president of Louis Vuitton North America. The store will move in alongside existing tenants like Marni and Maison Martin Margiela, as well as the cosmetics emporium Brownes, which also still has a store in South Beach, and the fashion boutique En Avance, a defector from Lincoln Road.
They are to be joined in coming months by Tom Ford, Marc by Marc Jacobs and Zegna, to name but a handful, vying for traffic with art galleries stretching north from nearby Wynwood, popular restaurants like Michaels Genuine Food and Drink, or Crumb on Parchment, an upscale sandwich shop.
The project has its champions. Richard Florida, a scholar of urban revitalization, praised the Dacra plan in The Atlantic Cities Web site as ''an unmistakable sign that the economic and commercial center of gravity is shifting away from the suburbs and back to the urban core.'' Todd M. Glaser, a Miami developer with investments in the district, is a booster, predicting that the opening of an expanded Panama Canal in 2015 would inject the area with a new vitality.
As it stands the Design District is expected to compete with affluent enclaves like Bal Harbour 10 miles to the north and its Bal Harbour Shops, which recently lost premier tenants like Vuitton, Cartier, Céline and Dior to the Design District.
But for now, the neighborhood remains a chicly funky alternative. Eager to break free of the boxy format of most mall boutiques, and to jibe with the area's arty feel, Louis Vuitton has embellished its storefront with an eye-popping mural by the graffiti artist Retna. The Christian Louboutin facade is overgrown with orchids, the interior enlivened by a faintly Moorish décor.
The Moore Building, with a gravity-defying sculptural installation by Zaha Hadid stretched Flubber-like across the ceiling, is the proposed future site of a department store. Also scheduled to arrive are a boutique hotel, a cluster of condos, some 100 stores and 15 restaurants, and a dozen public art installations, including works from Mr. Robins's ever-expanding collection.
Rosy as it seems, the district's boutique-ification leaves some unmoved. Early defectors include Marimekko and Tomas Maier, but others, while keeping their distance, are deferring judgment. Roma Cohen, whose two Alchemist shops on Lincoln Road attract a similarly well-heeled fashion clientele, has fended off suggestions that he move to Northeast 40th Street, preferring to stick with South Beach.
Still, he acknowledged that the Design District is becoming a must-see. ''People who are in Miami for more than three days, they know to go there,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 3, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the rise of Miami's Design District as a retail destination referred incompletely to a recent move by the cosmetics emporium Brownes & Company. While it has indeed opened a store in the district, it still has a store in South Beach, having recently moved the Lincoln Road store to nearby Jefferson Avenue; Brownes is not one of the ''defectors'' from Lincoln Road to the district.

HEADLINE: For Mazda, It's Diesels at Daytona

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

 BODY:
When three Mazda 6 sedans roll onto the starting grid for the Rolex 24 endurance race on Saturday, they'll be packing a technology the company says has never before competed at the Daytona International Speedway: diesel engines.
Mazda is no stranger to the annual 24-hour event, the traditional kickoff for the sports-car racing season in the United States, having won its class there 23 times. But its debut with diesel-powered sedans will come as a surprise to many of the automaker's fans, who are used to seeing RX-7 and RX-8 sports cars, with their earsplitting rotary engines, take the checkered flag. 
The new racing program, supported by Mazda engineers in Japan and North America, aims to publicize a 2.2-liter turbodiesel engine that is one element of the company's Skyactiv strategy to improve efficiency. The plan lifts a page out of the playbook that Audi has used so successfully at the 24 Hours of Le Mans: using racing to demonstrate the engine's mettle and to increase awareness of diesel's benefits.
''We think diesel, with its great low-end torque, durability, performance and fuel economy, fits the Mazda brand's enthusiast reputation -- and we hope the racing program will demonstrate that,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief executive of Mazda North America.
Gasoline-powered versions of the 2013 Mazda 6 began arriving at United States dealerships this month, and the diesel engine will be available as a 2014 model late this year. Mazda's last diesel vehicle in the United States, the B2200 pickup truck, was offered in 1982-85.
Rather than install the Skyactiv-D diesel in a purpose-built chassis and enter it in a prototype class, Mazda instead decided to use the body of the production sedan. And to showcase the engine's reliability, power and efficiency, the engine would use as many standard parts as possible.
''When our engineers first looked at the new Sky-D they got excited about the level of power we could get from an engine this size,'' said Sylvain Tremblay, president of SpeedSource Engineering, a Florida company that has been closely affiliated with Mazda's factory racing since the 1990s.
The team found that it could use more than half of the stock engine's parts, by weight, to create the racing version. Uncommon for a high-profile factory racing program, more than 275 parts come directly from Mazda's assembly line, including the cylinder block and heads, valves and water pump -- the latter outperforming every specialized racing pump the team tested.
SpeedSource built the three Daytona racecars and their engines, which will use a clean-burning synthetic diesel fuel to produce more than 400 horsepower, compared with the 173 horsepower of the production Skyactiv-D engine. Prerace testing has shown the diesels will burn 25 to 30 percent less fuel than a comparable gasoline racecar over the same distance. That enables them to carry a fuel tank that is three to four gallons smaller, and thus lighter, than their competitors' fuel loads.
Better yet, the racing Mazda 6 diesel -- like its production cousin -- does not use a urea injection system for the exhaust, typically needed on diesel-powered vehicles to meet emission regulations. While such hardware helps eliminate tailpipe emissions, it can be expensive and reduce fuel efficiency. Engineers credit the production engine's low 14:1 compression ratio, combustion chamber shape and the sophisticated turbocharging setup for its clean combustion, which also benefits the race engine.
Many other parts are either modified stock items for greater performance, like the camshafts, or racing parts that share key elements with the standard part, like the pistons' bowl-shaped dome, which is critical for efficient combustion. A stock crankshaft proved itself durable throughout testing; it was replaced with a stronger aftermarket crankshaft only to increase the time between engine rebuilds to at least 30 hours during the season, Mr. Tremblay said.
''We tried to out-engineer the factory, but we weren't able to do that in many cases on this engine,'' he said.
The racing Skyactiv-D also features a compounded turbocharging system, which Mr. Tremblay said was a first in motor sports. In this arrangement, one large low-pressure turbocharger draws in and compresses ambient air, feeding it into a smaller high pressure turbo that compresses the air again and pushes it to the intake manifold. Compared with a single turbocharger, the compounded-turbo set-up offers a greater range of operating efficiency, said Mr. Tremblay, though it is more complex and difficult to package in the car.
The addition of Mazda's new diesel to the Daytona grid, and to the 11 Rolex series races that follow in 2013, was cultivated by Grand-Am, the road race sanctioning organization. Late last year Grand-Am announced its new GX class created for cars and powertrain technologies not currently involved in the Rolex series or ill-matched against the much faster GT class cars.
''Grand-Am welcomed us with open arms,'' Mr. Tremblay said, adding that the GX rules were aimed at encouraging diesels, hybrids and alternative clean fuels other than gasoline.
At Daytona, SpeedSource will campaign the No. 70 car with Mr. Tremblay sharing driving duties in the grueling daylong event. The No. 25 and 00 cars are sponsored by independent teams Freedom Autosport and VisitFlorida.com Racing.
After a test session at Florida in early January, Mr. Tremblay reflected on Mazda's challenge with its latest racecar.
''Before us, the only people who have played with road-racing diesels are Audi and Peugeot, and they were both bespoke prototype programs without a single stock part, so there's little data and technology transfer that applies to what we're doing,'' he said. ''We're basically alone and forging new ground with this program.''
''I believe there's a place in motor sports for diesel and hybrids,'' he said. ''And what better proving ground than the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona?''

HEADLINE: Former Prime Minister Is Elected President of Czech Republic

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PRAGUE -- Milos Zeman, a burly former leftist prime minister and economist known for his outspoken populism, was elected president of the Czech Republic on Saturday, becoming the country's first popularly elected president.
The election of Mr. Zeman, 68, an avowed supporter of European integration, signals the end of the era of Vaclav Klaus, the Czech president for the past 10 years, whose vociferous skepticism of the European Union and scorn for the battle against climate change made him a sometimes awkward partner in Europe and the United States.
With all of the vote counted, Mr. Zeman, a feisty man of the people who is often seen with a glass of Czech beer, won 55 percent compared with 45 percent for Karel Schwarzenberg, a pipe-smoking prince who is foreign minister in the current center-right coalition government. During the campaign, Mr. Zeman linked Mr. Schwarzenberg to unpopular austerity measures, including tough spending cuts. 
Speaking with characteristic bluntness after his victory was announced, Mr. Zeman said he wanted to be the president of all the Czechs, but ''not of Godfather structures here,'' an allusion to the country's problems with corruption.
While the Czech presidency is largely ceremonial, the president influences foreign policy, makes central bank appointments and approves judges. Parliament used to select the winner.
The election campaign between a left-leaning populist and an urbane conservative deeply polarized the country. Mr. Schwarzenberg, retooled as a punk rocker in his campaign posters, struck a chord with middle-class urbanites yearning for a change. But it was Mr. Zeman who ultimately won the hearts of a majority of Czechs, buffeted by economic hard times.
Once considered an economic and democratic stalwart among the former Soviet bloc countries, the Czech Republic has been suffering from weak economic growth and a spate of corruption scandals.
Vaclav Havel, the hero of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that brought down Communism, died in late 2011, depriving the Czechs of their most celebrated moral leader. There is also a feeling of disappointment here that his revolution came up short.
Mr. Zeman is widely regarded as a canny pragmatist who, as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, helped modernize the economy, setting the stage for the country to join the European Union in 2004.
Petr Pithart, a former prime minister and lawyer, who has known Mr. Zeman for decades, said he was strong-willed and could prove to be an even more volatile presence in the Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech president, than the provocative Mr. Klaus. Mr. Zeman has indicated he will attend cabinet meetings and try to influence important legislation. Mr. Pithart predicted he would push the presidential powers to their limits and make life difficult for the government.
''Zeman is viewed as a relic of the past,'' he said. ''He plays on basic fears like xenophobia. He could prove to be a terrible nuisance for the government.''
During the campaign, he came under criticism after his supporters depicted Mr. Schwarzenberg as a foreigner because he had fled communist Czechoslovakia for Austria in 1948.
Mr. Zeman was also attacked by women's rights advocates when he explained during a televised debate that raping female serfs had conferred an evolutionary advantage on ''squires'' that his rival Mr. Schwarzenberg, a prince, did not have. Mr. Zeman's last name means squire in Czech.
While Mr. Zeman is seen as an avid supporter of close ties with the European Union and the United States, he is also perceived as being close to Moscow. In 2010, he suggested that Russia could become a member of the European Union in the next several decades.
Some analysts argue that a 1998 grand coalition agreement between the leftist Mr. Zeman and rightist Mr. Klaus entrenched links between powerful business interests and the main political parties that opened the door to endemic corruption.
Mr. Zeman is regarded as personally incorruptible, a perception solidified in the police surveillance recording of a notorious gangster who was caught complaining in March 2000 that Mr. Zeman could not be bribed, and wanted only ''a sandwich, three pickles and for people to like him.''
Yet his sharp tongue has attracted controversy. When he was prime minister, he drew fire for comparing the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to Hitler. He has also heaped scorn on journalists, in the past labeling them ''manure'' and ''hyenas.''
He has shrugged off criticism for his tendency to speak his mind, noting on occasion that his role model, Winston Churchill, had a much harsher vocabulary than his.
Mr. Zeman, who led a minority government when he was prime minister, has long been a presence on the Czech political scene. He gained prominence in August 1989 when, during the dying days of Communist Czechoslovakia, he wrote a strident article blasting the failure of the Communist economic system.
He had joined the Communist Party during the 1968 Prague Spring, a short-lived blossoming of freedom that was smashed by the invasion of Czechoslovakia by roughly 750,000 Warsaw Pact troops. Two years later he was kicked out of the party and lost his job as an economics professor, forcing him to make a living working for a sporting federation.
After the fall of Communism in 1989, he joined the Social Democratic Party, becoming its leader in 1993, and, five years later, prime minister.
After he failed to win the presidency in 2003, a contest won by Mr. Klaus, he retreated from politics to his dacha in the Czech countryside. But he was soon back meting out advice, delivered on camera in worn sweaters.
Zdenek Janek, 66, a retired construction worker from Zabcice, in South Moravia, said he voted for Mr. Zeman because he was a straight talker. ''He is a reasonable man who understands economics, talks to the point and is a man of action.''
Mr. Zeman will take up his new role in March.

HEADLINE: Israeli Official Hints Pentagon Plans May Make Lone Strike on Iran Unnecessary

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Elisabeth Bumiller and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel's departing defense minister, Ehud Barak, said that the Pentagon had prepared sophisticated blueprints for a surgical operation to set back Iran's nuclear program should the United States decide to attack -- a statement that was a possible indication that Israel might have shelved any plans for a unilateral strike, at least for now.
In an interview conducted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and published by The Daily Beast on Friday, Mr. Barak was asked if there was any way Israel could go to war with Iran over what many in the West believe is a nuclear weapons program without dragging in the United States. 
Mr. Barak replied that there were more than just the two options -- of full-scale war or allowing Iran to obtain nuclear weapons capability -- in the event that sanctions and diplomacy failed.
''What we basically say is that if worse comes to worst, there should be a readiness and an ability to launch a surgical operation that will delay them by a significant time frame and probably convince them that it won't work because the world is determined to block them,'' he said.
Under orders from the White House, ''the Pentagon prepared quite sophisticated, fine, extremely fine, scalpels,'' Mr. Barak added, referring to the ability to carry out pinpoint strikes.
Herbert Krosney, an American-Israeli analyst and the author of a book about the arming of Iran and Iraq, said Mr. Barak's statement now ''indicates that there is close cooperation'' between Israel and the United States following months of tension between the country's leaders (though military and intelligence services continued to work together closely).
''I think there is a realization in Israel that it would be extremely difficult for Israel to operate alone,'' he said.
Last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was pushing hard for the Obama administration to set clear ''red lines'' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike, infuriating the administration. And Mr. Barak repeatedly warned that because of Israel's more limited military capabilities, its own window of opportunity to carry out an effective strike was closing.
It has appeared that Mr. Barak has drifted away from Mr. Netanyahu in recent months, sounding more conciliatory toward the Obama administration, but even the prime minister has become less antagonistic.
The Pentagon declined to comment on The Daily Beast report, but a senior defense official said, ''The U.S. military constantly plans for a range of contingencies we might face around the world, and our planning is often quite detailed.'' The official added, ''That shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.''
In recent years, Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu had become increasingly alarmed as Iran moved forward with a nuclear program that it says is solely for peaceful purposes, but that Israel, the United States and others believe is geared toward producing a bomb. The two men consistently emphasized Israel's doctrine of self-reliance for such existential issues.
But faced with tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs, the prospect of an imminent unilateral Israeli strike receded in recent months.
In the past few weeks Mr. Netanyahu campaigned for re-election in Israel as a strong leader who, among other things, had managed to persuade the world to deal with the Iranian threat.
Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud Party emerged weakened from the elections, with much of the Israeli electorate more focused on domestic issues. In a speech after the voting, he said, ''The first challenge was and still is to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.'' But he did not again threaten to go it alone.
In the interview last week, Mr. Barak did not specify what the Pentagon's ''scalpels'' were. But there has been a broad effort at the White House, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies to develop a series of options that could set back, though probably not halt, Iran's nuclear progress.
The first was a covert plan called Olympic Games to undermine Iran's nuclear enrichment plans with cyberattacks, according to participants in that program. The second layer of plans, American and other officials have said, involves covert means of interrupting the supply of uranium to Iran's enrichment plants, or crippling the plants themselves. The biggest target is a deep underground plant called Fordo, near Qum. There, under a mountain, Iran is producing most of its medium-enriched uranium, which could be converted to bomb grade in a matter of months.
The site is hardened, and probably beyond Israel's ability to destroy from the air. The United States recently added a weapon that officials believe could do significant damage: the ''Massive Ordnance Penetrator,'' a bomb that is designed to attack deep, hardened sites.
But the existence of any plans, officials note, does not indicate an intent to them carry them out.

HEADLINE: Myanmar's Army Makes Gains in Battle Against Rebels, Observers Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER; Wai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- Government troops in Myanmar captured a strategic hilltop position outside the headquarters of ethnic Kachin rebels on Saturday, a photographer and another observer in the area reported. The takeover of the hilltop would be a significant advance in a long and bloody campaign near the border with China.
The intense fighting near the town of Laiza, the rebel base, comes amid increased foreign criticism of the military campaign and heightened tensions between the Burmese ethnic majority and minority groups, who make up one-third of the country's population. 
A spokesman for the government, Ye Htut, said that he was not aware if the hilltop position, Hkayabum, had been taken but that government troops were ''very close to the post and heavy fighting is ongoing.''
In comments that are likely to anger Myanmar's minorities, the country's opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, expressed admiration for the military during a visit to Hawaii over the weekend.
The comments by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, were made in the context of the military's role in helping secure independence from Britain. But given the timing, they are likely to further alienate ethnic minorities, who have criticized her for not speaking out forcefully against the Kachin campaign.
''I've often been criticized for saying that I'm fond of the Burmese Army, but I can't help it -- it's the truth,'' Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father was the founder of the modern Burmese Army, said Friday at the East-West Center in Honolulu.
The military ruled Myanmar for five decades, suppressing dissent and jailing its opponents, including Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. But a civilian government, led by a former general, Thein Sein, took power in 2011 and allowed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party to run for the seats in Parliament that they now hold.
National reconciliation between the Burmese majority and many ethnic groups is seen as a crucial component of Myanmar's moves toward democracy under Mr. Thein Sein.
The fighting in Kachin has displaced tens of thousands of civilians in wintry conditions.
The military's reported capture of Hkayabum comes a week after the government announced a unilateral cease-fire in what some analysts have said was an effort to allay criticism by foreign governments over its air and ground campaign. That announcement coincided with a gathering of representatives from at least two dozen countries and international organizations, including the World Bank, in Myanmar's capital, where they discussed offering assistance to the country as it moves toward democracy.
The cease-fire never went into effect, some observers say, with the Myanmar Army continuing an intensive artillery assault on rebel positions. ''It's been a nonstop barrage,'' said Ryan Roco, an American photographer documenting the fighting from the front lines. ''It's raining mortars.''
Khon Ja, a Kachin humanitarian worker in the area, said that it was possible rebel forces would retake the hilltop position and described the fighting as ''cat and mouse.''
The Myanmar government has repeatedly said that it has been acting in self-defense against the Kachin Independence Army, or K.I.A.
A statement by Myanmar's Foreign Ministry published in state newspapers on Saturday said that the rebels had ''attacked military column with strong forces'' immediately after the cease-fire was announced on Jan. 18 and that the military, or Tatmadaw, as it is known in Burmese, had no choice but to fight back.
''As K.I.A. troops have constantly launched such terrorist attacks, the Tatmadaw had to take military actions just to protect and safeguard the peace and tranquillity of the community and for the prevalence of law and order,'' the statement said.
Some observers have challenged that view, saying the military has advanced its positions even as it claims to be acting in self-defense.
The United States Embassy in Yangon said on Thursday that it was ''deeply concerned'' by what it called a continued government offensive.
''The United States strongly opposes the ongoing fighting, which has resulted in civilian casualties and undermined efforts to advance national reconciliation,'' a statement said.
Myanmar's Foreign Ministry criticized the American statement, saying the government was ''endeavoring in good faith'' to achieve a cease-fire.
The Foreign Ministry also said it ''strongly objects'' to the use of the word ''Burma'' in the release by the United States government. Using the country's former name, it said, ''may affect mutual respect, mutual understanding and cooperation which have recently been restored between the two countries.''
A junta changed the country's English name to Myanmar from Burma in the late 1980s, soon after the bloody suppression of a popular uprising against military rule. The violent context of the name change made many foreign governments, including the United States, reluctant to go along with it. But today most governments call the country Myanmar.
President Obama used the name Myanmar during his trip to the country late last year, though he also used the name Burma.

HEADLINE: Selling a Dream at Sundance

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
PARK CITY, UTAH -- For years this ski enclave has held the dual distinction of being the home of Robert Redford's Sundance movie festival and of some of the highest-end properties in the state.
Where else can ski enthusiasts own a home with backdoor access to the slopes at a top-notch ski resort like Deer Valley? Not in Aspen, which is surrounded mostly by public land. The sense of exclusivity has drawn a bevy of movie moguls and celebs here to Park City, from Jeffrey Katzenberg to Will Smith, who have bought multimillion-dollar ski homes in the area.
While Sundance attracts A-listers and up-and-comers each year, the event hasn't been much help in the past for brokers trying to sell high-end properties. That was especially true after the recession scared off investors hoping for quick returns. Brokers now say they're seeing more buyers who are not so interested in flipping, but instead are looking for good long-term investments.
So taking a popular page out of the playbook used in places like Manhattan, the Hamptons and Miami, some in the real estate community took a different tack at Sundance this year. Rather than the hordes of actors, directors and producers, they sought to connect with another growing cohort of the Sundance experience: the executive crowd. 
On a hill in the exclusive Deer Crest neighborhood, a crowd of the wealthy and connected mixed and mingled at the ''Ski Dream House,'' a 13,500-square-foot home owned by the vacation rental company Resorts West that has 6 bedrooms, 15 fireplaces, a ski bar and backdoor access to the slopes. Its price tag: $21.9 million.
This was no ordinary open house. Over two days, the guests sipped $500 Vérité wines and nibbled on contemporary Korean fare prepared by David Shim the chef of Kristalbelli in Manhattan, while being able to test-drive Rolls Royces, hear pitches about private jets and try on ski goggles with built-in cameras. Armani publicized a new fragrance, Essenza, while Hasselblad orchestrated the North American debut of a $6,000 camera, the Lunar, which comes in 14-carat, 18-carat and rose-gold versions.
Downstairs in the ''Chill Room'' a D.J. entertained the crowd between screenings and receptions for movies like ''Running From Crazy,'' the exploration of Mariel Hemingway's family history of suicide and mental illness. Nearby, next to a 550-gallon fish tank, a Sony representative demonstrated an 84-inch TV that lists for $25,000. Sony also provided the HD projector for the 14-seat home theater, which was screening ''Lawrence of Arabia'' when I dropped by.
Resorts West hired the Manhattan-based Rand Luxury to organize the event. Bradford Rand, the company's president, said he had run similar events, like the ''Red Cross Ball'' at an $18 million East Hampton estate. Mr. Rand organized events in 2007 and 2008, before the home finally sold in 2009, he said. (This kind of cross-branding was also used in December at Art Basel, where cocktail parties hosted by investment banks doubled as chances to show off high-end developments on Miami Beach.)
Brokers say recent sales suggest that Park City is drawing big buyers.
An eight-bedroom Park City ranch sold last week for $16 million to a dot-com billionaire from California. A 63-acre estate owned by Jon Huntsman Sr., the richest man in Utah, has an interested buyer after being listed for $44 million, the highest asking price ever in Utah, said Paul Benson, a broker with Sotheby's in Park City. A giant ski cabin that Mr. Katzenberg, the DreamWorks co-founder, commissioned some 20 years ago and used to entertain friends like Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, is on the market for $20.5 million.
''The last few years we had to beg to get people to come'' during Sundance, Mr. Benson said. ''Real estate wasn't really a hot topic. But this year that has changed. The people are actually spending money to be here. They aren't here because they had free tickets. They are looking at high-end homes. It is 2006 all over again.''
Before the housing bust, Mr. Benson tried to use Sundance to draw buyers to luxury properties in Park City. Since 2006 he has hosted ''Chef Dance,'' an event featuring celebrity chefs. He helped Prudential, which he worked for at the time, to sell more than 20 condos in the Waldorf, he said. It was after Sundance in 2006 that attendees soured on high-end real estate in the area, brokers said.
This year Mr. Benson is once again hosting ''Chef Dance.'' But he has also helped sponsor an event for the private banking group of JPMorgan, as well as for a group from Google. ''They all want real estate information,'' Mr. Benson said, ''so we have had to tailor brochures for these events.''
High-end developers are moving in, meaning that Park City is likely to get more expensive. Kenneth Abdalla, a former investment banker from Southern California who now resides mostly in Park City, has bought seven properties along Main Street in the past 16 months for a total of over $100 million, Mr. Benson said.
He is renovating them into residences -- like the former Imperial Hotel, which had an open house during Sundance and an asking price of $4 million for a four-bedroom home -- or more upscale hotels. The average rate of a room at Sky Lodge hotel, which reopened a few days before Sundance after Mr. Abdalla bought it, is $500 a night, up from $270 in 2011, said Hilary Reiter, a spokeswoman for the hotel.
There is even talk from the president of Deer Valley Resort of putting in a gondola chair lift on Main Street that would give direct access to Deer Valley from downtown.
Still, the most exclusive areas of Park City are up the mountain in gated neighborhoods like Bald Eagle Club, where Mr. Katzenberg owns a six-bedroom home designed by the architects Charles Gwathmey and Rick Otto and decorated by the late Naomi Leff, who also did the interiors of homes for Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. The Katzenberg residence features a ''great room'' with 30-foot high ceilings and 22-foot-high windows, where a wood-burning fireplace beckons you to pray for a snowstorm so you can stay in.
The seclusion of the home, which is tucked amid tall pine trees but has direct access to the Deer Valley slopes, has been a draw for Mr. Katzenberg's many prominent guests over the years, including the late Michael Jackson, Al and Tipper Gore, and the actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.
The Dream House was the result of a committee organized by Resorts West to design the ''ultimate ski home,'' said Joe Ballstaedt, the company's chief executive. When the home first came on the market in 2007, Resorts West used it strictly as a rental property ($16,500 a day is the current rate). But recently the company decided to sell it to raise funds to build another home in a ski town, possibly in Colorado.
The committee included readers of Ski magazine, local skiers, even the mayor of Park City. Their suggestions reflected the dreams of fun-loving skiers in their mid-30s, said Tracie Heffernan, a spokeswoman for Resorts West.
The committee spent whole meetings debating details like how the door to a ''secret room'' would open. ''Is it going to be a book? Is it going to be a latch?'' Ms. Heffernan said. (A safer option was ultimately chosen: a button on a wall.)
Many of their suggestions made it into the home's design, including a D.J. booth above the ''Chill Room'' bar, a small grotto in the outdoor swimming pool (think Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion), and a bar that can be accessed directly from the slopes, lest a tired skier have to climb out of his boots to get a beer.
Still, the home seems less suited for a Hollywood director's family than for a group of investment bankers, Ms. Heffernan said. ''That would probably be the ideal buyer for a home like this,'' she said. ''Sixteen adults who want a D.J. booth and a pool table. It is a home for entertaining.''

HIGHLIGHT: The right loses its resonance. 

 BODY:
If you want to understand the trouble Republicans are in, one good place to start is with the obsession the right has lately developed with the rising disability rolls. The growing number of Americans receiving disability payments has, for many on the right, become a symbol of our economic and moral decay; we're becoming a nation of malingerers.
As Jared Bernstein points out, there's a factual problem here: a large part of the rise in the disability rolls reflects simple demographics, because aging baby boomers are a lot more likely to have real ailments than those same workers did when they were in their 20s and 30s. The Social Security Administration does a formal adjustment for this reality, and as Jared says, it looks like this: 
It looks a lot less dramatic, doesn't it?
And as for the rest of what's going on, CBO -- which also concludes (pdf) that a lot of it is demographics -- adds this description of policy changes:
In 1984, lawmakers enacted the Disability Benefits Reform Act, which expanded the ways in which people could qualify for the DI program. That legislation, in addition to reversing several of the cost-containment measures enacted as part of the 1980 Social Security Disability Amendments, shifted the criteria for DI eligibility from a list of specific impairments to a more general consideration of a person's medical condition and ability to work. The legislation allowed applicants to qualify for benefits on the basis of the combined effect of multiple medical conditions, each of which taken alone might not have met the criteria. It also allowed symptoms of mental illness and pain to be considered in assessing whether a person qualified for admission to the DI program, even in the absence of a clear-cut medical diagnosis. 
So yes, there has been some liberalization of the criteria -- if you have multiple interacting conditions or mental illness, you may qualify in ways you didn't before -- but that liberalization is pretty reasonable. It's still quite hard to qualify for DI.
What strikes me, however, isn't just the way the right is trying to turn a reasonable development into some kind of outrage; it's the political tone-deafness.
I mean, when Reagan ranted about welfare queens driving Cadillacs, he was inventing a fake problem -- but his rant resonated with angry white voters, who understood perfectly well who Reagan was targeting. But Americans on disability as moochers? That isn't, as far as I can tell, an especially nonwhite group -- and it's a group that is surely as likely to elicit sympathy as disdain. There's just no way it can serve the kind of political purpose the old welfare-kicking rhetoric used to perform.
The same goes, more broadly, for the whole nation of takers thing. First of all, a lot of the "taking" involves Social Security and Medicare. And even the growth in means-tested programs is largely accounted for by the Earned Income Tax Credit -- which requires and rewards work -- and the expansion of Medicaid/CHIP to cover more children. Again, not the greatest of political targets.
The point, I think, is that right-wing intellectuals and politicians live in a bubble in which denunciations of those bums on disability and those greedy children getting free health care are greeted with shouts of approval -- but now have to deal with a country where the same remarks come across as greedy and heartless (because they are).
And I don't think this is a problem that can be solved with a slight change in the rhetoric.

HEADLINE: Beneath the Calm, SAC Works to Contain Fallout From Inquiry

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: As federal authorities continue to press an insider trading investigation, SAC Capital Advisors, run by Steven A. Cohen, is working to retain clients and staff members. 

 BODY:
At last month's Hurricane Sandy benefit concert, Steven A. Cohen sat near the Madison Square Garden stage, grooving to performances by Bon Jovi and Billy Joel.
Last week, he flew a private jet to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, rubbing shoulders with world leaders and Fortune 500 chieftains. And on Monday, he will show up at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., for one of the year's biggest hedge fund conferences and, if he can squeeze it in, a round of golf.
For a man who has emerged as the Justice Department's great white whale in its insider trading investigation - a Wall Street version of Moby-Dick being pursued by Captain Ahab - Mr. Cohen, the billionaire owner of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, does not appear concerned.
But inside the offices of SAC's Stamford, Conn., headquarters, and at Midtown Manhattan law firms, Mr. Cohen's employees and lawyers are working hard to contain the fallout from the investigation. 
His executives have offered financial incentives to Mr. Cohen's staff members to stay with SAC. Marketing officers are trying to persuade investors to keep their money at the fund. And defense lawyers are working furiously to persuade federal securities regulators not to file a civil fraud lawsuit against the firm.
"This has always been a stressful place to work," said an SAC employee who requested anonymity because he was unauthorized to speak publicly about the fund. "Now it's just more stressful."
Neither SAC nor Mr. Cohen has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The main question now looming over the firm is whether its clients will stand by the fund, or its legal and regulatory problems will cause investors to head for the exits. Under the firm's rules, SAC clients have until Feb. 14 to ask for their money back, and then cannot make another so-called redemption request for another three months.
Mr. Cohen's fund was dealt a blow last week when a Citigroup unit that manages money for wealthy families disclosed that it was withdrawing its $187 million investment. The move by the bank was the most prominent client departure since November, when the multiyear investigation into SAC's trading practices entered a more serious phase.
Citigroup's withdrawal represents a tiny percentage of SAC's $14 billion in assets under management. The fund has said it expects total investor redemptions for the first quarter of up to $1 billion, a number that an SAC spokesman has said will not adversely affect its business.
SAC is largely insulated from the potentially devastating effects that client defections can have on a hedge fund in part because of Mr. Cohen's extraordinary wealth. Unlike other hedge fund managers who rely almost entirely on outside investors, Mr. Cohen has the comfort of knowing that about $8 billion of SAC's fund belongs to him and his employees.
Still, the Citigroup decision stung, say people close to SAC's business, because of the longstanding and lucrative relationship between the bank and the fund. Another concern, said these people, is that the move could influence other large SAC investors currently weighing whether to keep their money at the fund.
For Citigroup, its withdrawal of money from SAC carries substantial business risk. The bank has a vast relationship with SAC, earning revenue by providing the fund with financing and trading services.
SAC could exact retribution on Citigroup by terminating, or at least scaling back, its broader relationship with the bank. An SAC spokesman declined to comment.
Citigroup's move came two months after federal authorities arrested Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager, in what they described as the most lucrative insider trading case ever uncovered. The Martoma indictment represented the first time that the government had brought charges stemming from a trade in which Mr. Cohen had been involved. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned Mr. Cohen that it might file a civil fraud action against SAC related to the case.
In addition to Mr. Martoma, at least seven former SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the fund. Three have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.
Citigroup issued a statement that its decision "should not be construed as a statement on the merits of any outstanding legal proceedings or potential regulatory action." But the bank specifically cited the Martoma case, explaining that "in the event these legal and regulatory matters are resolved favorably for Mr. Martoma and SAC, Citi Private Bank expects to reconsider admission of SAC's funds to its hedge fund platform."
Mr. Martoma has pleaded not guilty and rejected requests by federal agents to cooperate against his former boss. Mr. Cohen has told his employees and clients that he is confident that he has acted appropriately at all times.
Yet the heightened government scrutiny has caused skittishness among SAC's top ranks, forcing the fund to lavish even richer financial incentives on a group of employees that is already among the most highly compensated in the hedge fund industry.
This month, SAC told its stable of portfolio managers that it would increase year-end bonuses by three percentage points. SAC portfolio managers - the fund's most senior traders, given the authority to make their own investment decisions and also feed Mr. Cohen their best ideas - are paid, on average, 20 percent of the profits they generate for the fund.
"The program is intended to retain our most valuable resource, our investment professionals," said Jonathan Gasthalter, the SAC spokesman.
Another valuable resource is SAC's outside investors, which account for about $6 billion, or 40 percent, of the fund's assets. That money accounts for hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, which SAC uses to finance one of the world's largest and most sophisticated hedge fund operations, with more than 1,000 employees and 125 teams of traders and analysts. Its operation is also one of the most successful, posting average annualized returns of about 30 percent since 1992.
Those results have in the past kept SAC's customers satisfied, but the government scrutiny has made many of them uneasy. The firm's marketing team has reached out to the fund's investors to address their concerns and reassure them that the insider trading inquiry will not affect its performance.
Despite those efforts, several investors in addition to Citigroup, including Titan Advisors and a unit of Société Générale, have notified SAC that they are withdrawing money. Other clients, like Chapwood Investments and SkyBridge Capital, have said they will continue to invest with the fund.
SAC executives continued the charm offensive with major clients on Sunday, holding an annual golf outing in Palm Beach on the eve of a hedge fund conference at the Breakers sponsored by Morgan Stanley. The conference - a matchmaking event that connects top managers with the world's richest investors - is considered an important stop on the hedge fund money-raising circuit.
Since Morgan Stanley does not invite the news media to its conference, there is not expected to be the same paparazzi-like reports on Mr. Cohen that emerged last week from Davos. Bloomberg News filed a dispatch that Mr. Cohen sat in on a panel discussion on data security called "The Digital Infrastructure Context." And Henry Blodget, the editor of the financial Web site Business Insider, wrote a Twitter post on a sighting of Mr. Cohen.
"Steve Cohen was hanging in Davos lounge yesterday," he wrote. "Didn't look worried."

HEADLINE: The Clinton Doctrine of American Foreign Policy

BYLINE: DAVID ROHDE


HIGHLIGHT: Hillary Rodham Clinton's time as secretary of state saw no major breakthroughs and few mistakes, but as she left she made the case for a new American foreign policy. 

 BODY:
The partisan political theater, of course, was top-notch. Sen. Rand Paul's declaration that he would have fired Hillary Rodham Clinton; her angry rebuttal of Sen. Ron Johnson's insistence that the Obama administration misled the American people about the Benghazi attack; Sen. John McCain's continued outrage at the slapdash security the State Department provided its employees.
Beneath the posturing, though, ran larger questions: what strategy does the United States have to counter the militant groups running rampant across North and West Africa? And what kind of secretary of state has Mrs. Clinton been? In her last Congressional hearing in that position, Mrs. Clinton expressed exasperation with Washington's political trench warfare.
"We've got to get our act together," she said. 
Mrs. Clinton has been a very good but very cautious secretary of state, many analysts say - one who, for the most part, kept her distance from Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine and other seemingly intractable conflicts. 
One State Department official, while praising Mrs. Clinton's tenure, nonetheless looked forward to the arrival of Sen. John Kerry, her designated successor: "I came to admire Clinton as secretary of state, her focus on women and innovation in particular," the official told me. "But am really happy to have someone in the job who does not retain political ambitions."
In a recent assessment of Mrs. Clinton's tenure, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution argued that she had enjoyed some success, including restoring the United States' image abroad, but she made no historic breakthroughs, he said. 
Mr. O'Hanlon argued that Mrs. Clinton's famed work ethic paid off. She made few mistakes, no major gaffes and did not "needlessly antagonize" friends or enemies. Mr. O'Hanlon called Mrs. Clinton's role in the administration's "pivot to Asia" and tough stance toward China arguably "her greatest and most memorable contribution."
The problem, as last week's hearing showed, is that the Middle East and the threat of terrorism continue to dominate American foreign policy. Even as the United States becomes more energy independent, terrorist attacks like the kidnappings in a remote oil facility in Algeria will make headlines and influence markets. Barring a massive shift in American domestic politics, Israel's security will continue to be viewed as a vital interest of the United States. 
Mrs. Clinton, to her credit, made forty trips to Europe that helped produce crippling new sanctions on Iran. Last fall, she helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But she failed to personally engage in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
To be fair, the Obama White House may have limited her options. After promising more open debate than occurred under President George W. Bush, the Obama White House tightly controlled the formulation of American foreign policy. Critics have also accused Mr. Obama of being overly cautious in foreign affairs. 
With the exception of the Libya intervention and the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Mr. Obama was "coolly calculating and reluctant to engage" in his first-term foreign policy, The Economist magazine recently argued. 
Mr. Obama, of course, is trying to avoid the over-reach his predecessor displayed in Iraq. He also faces enormous fiscal pressures at home. But there is a risk that the pendulum is swinging too far toward a smug isolationism in Washington. 
As Mrs. Clinton departs, worrying trends are emerging in the way America engages with the world. The new U.S. weapon of choice is the drone strike - a tactic that carries zero political risk at home but spreads anti-Americanism abroad. 
Complex foreign policy problems that threaten American security are increasingly seen as "entanglements" best avoided. There is a convenient view that there are no "good guys" in the power struggles now unfolding in the post-Arab-Spring Middle East.
The potential lesson of the bruising political battle over Benghazi is simple: Take few risks, turn embassies into bunkers and avoid political firestorms at home. In her testimony, Mrs. Clinton passionately argued against that approach. 
Declaring Somalia and Colombia success stories, she said the United States could counter militancy in Africa and the Middle East by working with regional organizations and training local security forces. U.S. funding and training of an African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, Mrs. Clinton said, had slowly succeeded in driving back al-Shabaab and other Islamist forces. In Colombia, the government has driven back FARC rebels and narco-traffickers.
There have been setbacks and the efforts in both countries are imperfect. But local security forces trained and funded by the international community slowly gained ground in painstaking efforts over many years.
"What we have to do is recognize that we're in for a long-term struggle here," Mrs. Clinton said at the hearing. "And that means we've got to pay attention to places that historically we have not chosen to or had to."
During their heated exchange, Mr. McCain criticized Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration for not doing enough to train Libya's security forces. Secretary Clinton replied that House Republicans had put a hold on the funding the administration requested to train Libyans.
"If this is a priority and we are serious about trying to help this government stand up security forces," she said, "then we have to work together."
Mrs. Clinton is right. And so is Mr. McCain. Congressional politicking hinders the State Department. The State Department executed terribly in Benghazi. But Mrs. Clinton, who I have criticized in the past, won the day.
"We are in a new reality," she said, referring to the change sweeping across the Middle East. "We are trying to makes sense of events that nobody had predicted but that we're going to have to live with."
Mrs. Clinton called for the United States to show "humility" abroad and stop making national security issues "political footballs" at home. She said a Cold War style bipartisan agreement should be reached to launch a long-term American effort to strengthen local security forces and promote democracy across Africa and the post-Arab-Spring Middle East.
"Let's be smart and learn from what we've done in the past," she said. "Put forth a policy that wouldn't go lurching from administration to administration but would be a steady one."
"We have more assets than anyone in the world," Mrs. Clinton added, "but I think we've gotten a little bit off track in trying to figure out how best to utilize them."
A "little bit off track" is a euphemism for partisanship endangering national security. If the U.S. doesn't get its act together, expect more Benghazis.

HEADLINE: Trade Official Says U.S. Wants Deal With Europe

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, says President Obama is committed to an agreement to smooth trade with the European Union, but only if it can overcome objections from farm groups and win Congressional approval. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - America's top trade negotiator said late on Saturday that President Obama was committed to reaching an agreement to smooth trade with the European Union, but only if it was written in a way that would overcome objections from farm groups and that could win Congressional approval.
In an interview in Davos, Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, responded to European leaders who in the last week renewed their calls for a United States-Europe deal to dismantle tariffs and other barriers, which they badly want as a way of stimulating their ailing economies. 
At the World Economic Forum, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany were among a number of leaders and business people pleading for a pact that would eliminate tariffs as well as regulations that impede trade. Even without changes, the United States and Europe already have the world's largest trading market.
On both sides of the Atlantic, proponents have expressed frustration about the delaying of an official report by an American-European working group that would set the stage for formal talks. The delay has fed the widespread perception that Mr. Obama does not care much about a trade pact or, for that matter, about Europe in general.
''We greatly value the trans-Atlantic relationship,'' Mr. Kirk said in Davos. ''We have devoted an extraordinary amount of time'' to a possible trade agreement. But the administration wants to make sure objections from farmers and other constituencies are addressed, he said. Otherwise, officials might spend years negotiating an agreement only to have it rejected by Congress.
''If we do this, we want there to be a bridge to somewhere and we want to get there on one tank of gas,'' Mr. Kirk said. He declined to predict when talks might begin.
Trade had been a main topic of discussion at the World Economic Forum, which concluded Saturday. There were signs of progress toward a trade accord, which, if it proved durable, could provide a riposte to the eternal criticism of the elite event: that the annual Davos forum is nothing more an expensive cocktail party where little of substance is ever accomplished.
While it is true that Davos is rarely the place for concrete agreements, the event attracts a diverse international crowd in an informal setting. It can be a place where political and business leaders work toward consensus on difficult issues like trade. That may have been the case in the last week, some of the people involved said.
''I'm carefully optimistic we will kick off negotiations this year,'' Alexander Stubb, the Finnish minister for foreign affairs and trade, said after a panel on trade issues on Saturday. ''It's going in the right direction.''
Friction-free commerce between the United States and Europe could create jobs and add an estimated $50 billion a year to the United States economy, Mr. Kirk said. European political leaders fervently want a deal to help their anemic economies grow. There is also strong support from business groups on both sides of the Atlantic.
''Half a dozen senior leaders in Europe are ready to move forward,'' Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said last week in Davos, adding that a deal could be concluded within 18 months if both sides set their minds to it. 
But others are skeptical, noting that Europe and the United States have been talking about a trade deal for years. While American companies like General Electric have expressed strong support for an agreement, progress has always been stymied by objections from interest groups, particularly over agricultural issues. Some Europeans, for example, object to imports of American food containing genetically modified plants.
''I was surprised to hear all the speakers saying it will happen in the next two years,'' said Maximilian Zimmerer, chief financial officer of Allianz, a German insurance company. ''What about the last 10 years?''
Mr. Kirk declined to go into detail about what specific issues might be delaying a report by what is known as a high level working group, which he leads along with Karel De Gucht, the trade commissioner of the European Union. A favorable recommendation by the group would set in motion the process of negotiating a comprehensive agreement.
But Mr. Kirk noted that members of Congress with farmers as constituents far outnumbered those whose districts included big companies like Boeing or Apple that would benefit from a trade deal. ''Agriculture tends to be a challenging issue,'' he said. 
That is partly because American farmers are already on the lighter side of the trade scale. The European Union exports far more farm products to the United States than vice versa: 14.6 billion euros ($19.7 billion) compared with 8.2 billion euros, according to European Union figures for 2011, the most recent available.
Mr. Kirk has announced plans to leave his post as trade representative next month, and Mr. Obama has not named his successor. But Mr. Kirk said his departure would not impede progress toward a deal. 
Mr. Kirk and others say the biggest benefits of a trade pact would come from eliminating regulatory barriers. For example, while both the United States and Europe have strict requirements on auto safety and emissions, the rules are different. Harmonizing the regulations would free carmakers like Audi from having to make costly changes in headlights, exhaust systems and other components in order to export them to the United States.
Synchronizing regulations is much more complicated than eliminating tariffs. But, Mr. Kirk said, ''These are all problems that are solvable.'' 
Some trade experts argue that even bigger benefits could come simply from streamlining official procedures involved when goods move across borders. The longer a product sits on a dock waiting for customs clearance, the greater the cost to companies and consumers.
A study by the World Bank and the consulting firm Bain & Company, published at the World Economic Forum, estimated that trade could increase 15 percent if goods moved across borders more efficiently. 
''We're talking about removing waste,'' said Mark Gottfredson, a partner at Bain. ''Everybody can agree on that.''

HEADLINE: Myanmar and World Bank Sign Deal to Clear Old Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- The World Bank on Sunday announced a long-awaited deal to allow Myanmar to clear part of its huge decades-old foreign debt, opening the door for lending to jump-start its lagging economy. 
The bank's Washington headquarters said in a statement that the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the country's overseas development bank, will provide a bridge loan to Myanmar to allow it to cover outstanding debt to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which totals about $900 million.
Myanmar stopped payments on its old loans in about 1987, making it ineligible for new development lending.
The deal is a major breakthrough for Myanmar, with loans likely to go to upgrading its dilapidated infrastructure, including electricity and ports. A result could be to bring in more foreign direct investment, already attracted by the country's relatively low-cost economy.
The deal is also likely to draw criticism, because it comes as Myanmar's army is pushing hard against ethnic Kachin rebels in the country's north, echoing the counterinsurgency campaigns of previous military governments.
A former general, Thein Sein, became the country's elected president in 2011 and began reversing almost five decades of military repression by instituting political and economic reforms.
He won the substantial easing of economic and political sanctions imposed against the junta by the United States and other nations. But some democracy activists say the rewards have been too much, too fast, allowing some abuses to continue, like repression of ethnic minorities.
Myanmar ran up $8.4 billion of debt during the socialist government of Gen. Ne Win from 1962 to 1988, and $2.61 billion of debt after a new military junta took over in 1988, making for a total of a little more than $11 billion.
The largest creditor before 1988 was Japan, with loans of $6.39 billion, and the biggest post-1988 creditor was China, with $2.13 billion.

HEADLINE: The Embers Of a Fading Coal Town

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
NEWS FROM HEAVEN The Bakerton Stories
By Jennifer Haigh 244 pages. Harper. $25.99.
The essential reference for Jennifer Haigh's new book of short stories, ''News From Heaven,'' is her 2005 novel, ''Baker Towers.'' Both books are about the life and times of Bakerton, Pa., a coal-mining company town that went from booming prosperity to sharp decline.
While the prosperity belonged solely to the mine-owning Baker family, Ms. Haigh wrote ''Baker Towers'' about the Novaks, who lived on what was called Polish Hill in a place where ethnicity counted for everything. The ''towers'' of the title are two huge heaps of sulfurous waste from the mines, a grim portent of things to come. 
Ms. Haigh is a coal miner's granddaughter who grew up in a part of central Pennsylvania not far from Bakerton in Barnesboro, now defunct, another town named for an owner of its coal mine. And although she has established herself as anything but a provincial writer, she is drawn back to coal country over and over again. All the stories in ''News from Heaven'' revisit Bakerton, spanning about half a century as they show how the place has changed. Mostly it has declined in the expected economic ways. But Ms. Haigh's fine, enveloping stories are not ordinary or predictable at all.
Early in her career Ms. Haigh said she liked to write ''about the ways people behave when they think no one is looking.'' That hasn't changed, nor have the extraordinarily close family ties that bind her characters to one another. As she has shown in her novels ''The Condition'' and ''Faith,'' Ms. Haigh is one of the most subtle, incisive fiction writers currently exploring the dynamics of big, secretive families, the kinds whose members are much more apt to betray private thoughts than speak them out loud. Throughout ''News From Heaven,'' her combined gifts for piercing acuity and discreet understatement make a powerful mix.
''News From Heaven'' begins nominally outside Bakerton: in New York City, in the 1930s, on the Upper West Side, where the shy 16-year-old Annie Lubicki has come to work as a maid in a household that baffles her. In ''Beast and Bird,'' the Nudelman family has two sinks, two stoves, two sets of pots and two separate dish towels. It is an arrangement that makes Annie think of crazy Bakerton neighbors. ''If Mrs. Nudelman were poor, her madness would be simpler,'' Annie thinks. ''Wealth permitted this elaborate variant.'' She has no idea that the Nudelmans are Jews keeping a kosher household, and not even much idea that World War II is looming.
Annie is quietly fascinated by the Nudelmans' son, a dark-haired boy in a skullcap who says he plans to devote his life to scholarship. But his health is fragile, and Annie's concern about him creates a terrible misunderstanding. Annie is sent back to Bakerton, and she does not reappear in ''News From Heaven.'' But elsewhere Ms. Haigh writes about events that will shape the fortunes of future generations.
Much later in the book a Bakerton native named Ray comes home to celebrate his parents' 50th anniversary. Ray's beloved Pop is not the kind of man who believes in such hoopla. But Bakerton, even at its most impoverished, is a town that likes big occasions. Ray is now a Houston oilman, nastily called ''J. R.'' and all too representative of how coal mining in Bakerton has, literally and figuratively, collapsed. (The violent destruction of a Baker mine was a major event in ''Baker Towers.'' Since then the other mines have been shrinking and withering less dramatically.)
Anyway, Ray's visit home becomes a life-altering experience when he discovers that he is not Pop's son. Not for nothing is Ray so different from other Bakerton neighbors; Pop raised Annie's baby after she came back from New York in disgrace.
Each story in ''News From Heaven'' carries comparable shock value. We first see Sandy, the golden boy of the Novak family in ''A Place in the Sun,'' as a gambling addict headed for Las Vegas on his 33rd birthday, spotting the casinos and the wedding chapels as he heads into town with a naïve young starlet for company. By the end of the story he will sanction the ending of one life and bless the start of another, all as he experiences an all-but-impossible (for him) moment of grace.
In the next story, ''To the Stars,'' it is seven years later. And Sandy is returning to Bakerton as ''cargo.'' All he has left in the world, as his sister Joyce discovers, are his high school transcript, a bail bondsman's phone number and a lottery ticket. And a rich older girlfriend who loves Sandy so much that she finds Bakerton, with its rows of identical six-room company-built houses, a beautiful place.
Although ''News from Heaven'' may sound full of sad situations, it's an uplifting and radiant book. That's because Ms. Haigh sees how even the town's most withdrawn, seemingly hopeless residents have found routes to happiness, no matter how brief they turn out to be. One of the book's high points is ''Thrift,'' about a nurse named Agnes who has allowed herself to reach the age of 50 in the throes of a suffocating family. Now, finally free, she sells the farm that had made her part of the town's economic elite and moves into a trailer. When a handsome young roofer asks her for a glass of water, Agnes all but swoons at the prospect of a life with him. But the odds seem impossible. Agnes's way of binding the roofer to her is what makes the story so powerful.
Most poignant, there is Mitch Stanek, the title figure in ''Favorite Son.'' He's the star, the handsome lifeguard who excites all of Bakerton's female population. And he's such a success that he leaves town in a blaze of glory, with a football scholarship to a college in Florida. But something goes wrong. The favorite son comes back, his getaway over. Ms. Haigh will not explain this until the end of the story, when she lays out some shocking calculations about what Mitch's prospects really were. It is Ms. Haigh's great gift to make all of these people come alive and to make readers really care how their destinies unfold.

HEADLINE: An Oil Boom Takes a Toll on Health Care

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
WATFORD CITY, N.D. -- The patients come with burns from hot water, with hands and fingers crushed by steel tongs, with injuries from chains that have whipsawed them off their feet. Ambulances carry mangled, bloodied bodies from accidents on roads packed with trucks and heavy-footed drivers.
The furious pace of oil exploration that has made North Dakota one of the healthiest economies in the country has had the opposite effect on the region's health care providers. Swamped by uninsured laborers flocking to dangerous jobs, medical facilities in the area are sinking under skyrocketing debt, a flood of gruesome injuries and bloated business costs from the inflated economy.
The problems have been acute at McKenzie County Hospital here. Largely because of unpaid bills, the hospital's debt has climbed more than 2,000 percent over the past four years to $1.2 million, according to Daniel Kelly, the hospital's chief executive. Just three years ago, Mr. Kelly added, the hospital averaged 100 emergency room visits per month; last year, that average shot up to 400. 
Over all, ambulance calls in the region increased by about 59 percent from 2006 to 2011, according to Thomas R. Nehring, the director of emergency medical services for the North Dakota Health Department. The number of traumatic injuries reported in the oil patch increased 200 percent from 2007 through the first half of last year, he said.
The 12 medical facilities in western North Dakota saw their combined debt rise by 46 percent over the course of the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years, according to Darrold Bertsch, the president of the state's Rural Health Association.
Hospitals cannot simply refuse to treat people or raise their rates. Expenses at those 12 facilities increased by 15 percent, Mr. Bertsch added, and nine of them experienced operating losses. Costs are rising to hire and retain service staff members, as hospitals compete with fast food restaurants that pay wages of about $20 an hour.
''Plain and simple, those kinds of things are not sustainable,'' he said.
Many of the new patients are transient men without health insurance or a permanent address in the area. In one of the biggest drivers of the hospital debt, patients give inaccurate contact information; when the time comes to collect payment, the patients cannot be found. McKenzie County Hospital has invested in new software that will help verify the information patients give on the spot.
Mr. Kelly has pushed for the state, which has a surplus of more than $1 billion, to allocate money intended for the oil region specifically to health care facilities in the area. He has also asked for the state to grant low-interest loans so hospitals can borrow money for facility improvements and for the governor to convene a task force to study health care issues in the oil patch.
Aides to Gov. Jack Dalrymple say he is taking steps to bolster medical training in the state, proposing to spend $68 million on a new medical school building at the University of North Dakota and $6 million to expand the nursing program at Lake Region State College. Mr. Dalrymple, a Republican, has also increased Medicaid financing for the state's rural hospitals.
''Health care is certainly one of those areas that was targeted early on as we've seen growth out west,'' said Jeffrey L. Zent, a spokesman for the governor.
Public utility numbers suggest that the population of Watford City has more than quadrupled to 6,500 over the past two years, Mr. Kelly said. In nearby Williston, considered the heart of the oil boom, the population, including temporary workers, has swelled to 25,000 to 33,000 from fewer than 15,000 in 2010, according to a study by North Dakota State University.
The huge population growth has produced new communities virtually overnight, creating logistical problems that affect the quality of medical care.
After a recent emergency call, Kelly Weathers, who has worked as a paramedic in the region for nearly 25 years, drove in circles with his team for about 15 minutes, searching for the address where they had been sent to treat a man who had hurt his back falling off a piece of equipment. But they could not find the street because a sign had not yet been erected. Eventually, a colleague of the injured man met the ambulance at the highway and escorted them to the site.
Mr. Weathers, who works for the Mountrail County Health Center in Stanley, said that in the past, ''all the volunteers, they didn't go by street signs.''
''It was like, 'The corner store, third house to the north of that,' '' he said. ''So now, if you give them '62nd Avenue,' they go, 'Where's that at?' ''
Charles Quinn, 43, of Mississippi, has been working in the region for eight months repairing 18-wheelers. He said his job has its dangers because he often works under the trucks while they are running.
''It's all kind of dangerous,'' he said of the jobs in the oil patch. ''There's a lot more accidents around you because you got more people around you working.''
The cramped housing camps where many oil workers live can add to health issues. On a recent afternoon at McKenzie County Hospital, a man limped into the emergency room complaining about a dry, red patch of skin on his leg. Dr. Gary Ramage, the hospital's sole full-time physician, said it was a bite from a brown recluse spider, which had most likely nested under the trailer where the man lives.
Since the oil industry started growing rapidly in the region, Dr. Ramage said, he has had to treat many more sexually transmitted diseases. Chlamydia rates in McKenzie County roughly doubled from 2010 to 2011.
With little money to spend, hospitals are struggling to finance sorely needed improvements and hire additional medical providers. McKenzie, which is six decades old, is a one-story brick building and has one room for emergencies. (A makeshift second emergency room was created from one of the inpatient rooms.) In a building across the street that houses a clinic, a narrow hallway with dark carpet is crowded with file drawers lining the walls.
Hospital executives are hoping to get the local government to approve a 1-cent sales tax increase so they can build a $55 million medical facility that would triple the size of the clinic, expand the emergency room, maintain the 24-bed hospital and increase space for other outpatient services like physical therapy. They have also spent the past year trying to hire two new doctors. Recruiting medical professionals to the area has long been a problem.
''Let's be honest,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''People think they have to move to Siberia if they move to North Dakota.''
But for now, Dr. Ramage, a gregarious Canadian who has worked here for 18 years, is left shouldering much of the load. Before the oil boom started a few years back, Dr. Ramage covered both the clinic and the emergency room. Now he mostly works at the clinic, while the hospital hires roving physicians to cover the emergency room. He is well known in the community, and people call him at home when they are sick. But now, he does not know many of the patients he sees.
''My work is no longer small-town work,'' he said. ''My work has now been transformed from that of a small family practitioner to basically an E.R. doc.''

HEADLINE: Davos Forum Considers Learning's Next Wave

BYLINE: By ALISON SMALE

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- She may not have been the youngest speaker ever at the World Economic Forum in Davos, but Khadija Niazi, 12, was certainly captivating.
Hundreds of the conference's well-heeled attendees listened intently as Ms. Niazi, of Lahore, Pakistan, described her experience with massive open online courses, known as MOOCs, that are spreading rapidly around the globe.
MOOCs are vastly extending the reach of professors at some of the world's best universities, particularly at Stanford, Harvard, M.I.T., Yale, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania and Duke. 
Ms. Niazi has been taking courses, free so far, from Udacity and Coursera, two of the earliest providers of this new form of instruction. Her latest enthusiasm is for astrobiology, because she is fascinated by U.F.O.'s and wants to become a physicist.
Education has long played a part in the annual deliberations here. But this time, many participants may have detected what Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's president, described as ''a lot of attention.''
The fast rise of MOOCs is one reason. Coursera, at Stanford, for example, has existed just a few months and now has 214 courses attracting 2.4 million students from 196 countries.
Stanford, in Silicon Valley, has been the starting place for many well-regarded technology efforts, perhaps most notably Google. Still, questions swirl over the economic model that might eventually emerge to finance these online courses, which so far tend to be offered free in what amounts to a global test-marketing phase.
There are many other unanswered pedagogical issues, too -- can such courses teach the humanities, or ever grade a creative writing piece? -- in envisioning the potential for further educating millions who previously had no access to this caliber of teaching.
''We don't know where the next Albert Einstein is,'' said Daphne Koller, a computer science professor at Stanford who, with a colleague, Andrew Ng, introduced Coursera last spring. ''Maybe she lives in a small village in Africa.''
Sebastian Thrun, another Stanford computer science professor who introduced Udacity after seeing more than 160,000 students sign up for an online class on artificial intelligence in the fall of 2011, predicted that this kind of learning would eventually upend American and perhaps other Western academic institutions.
In a discussion after Ms. Niazi's presentation, Lawrence H. Summers, the economist and former Harvard president, was more cautious. He acknowledged the potential for the courses ''to be hugely transformative.''
But ''what it means for American students is the smallest part of it,'' he said. ''This is going to take a lot of working out.''
Peter Thiel, an early investor in digital technology, said online learning meant that the best professors would eventually need to focus even more on their role as mentors to students they worked with in person.
That is one reason Mr. Thiel and others emphasized that elite universities, the incubators of the long-term research essential to most major discoveries, would still exist.
Ms. Faust, in an interview, also emphasized the role of research and new ideas. Corporations are valuable sources of innovation, she said, but ''they are living under the tyranny of quarterly reports and stock prices.''
A university expands thinking and research in ways ''that may be unpredictable and may be long,'' she said. But the cumulative effect of each new postdoctoral, graduate or undergraduate student attending a university like Harvard, whether physically or virtually, is accumulated wisdom and experimentation, she said.
Enterprising academic institutions have taken the lead in online learning. Harvard and M.I.T., for instance, worked together to introduce EdX, which offers free online courses from each university, last year. About 753,000 students have enrolled, with India, Brazil, Pakistan and Russia among the top 10 countries from which people are participating.
Also at Davos were officials from the new Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia. The institute, also known as Skoltech, recruited a longtime M.I.T. professor, Edward F. Crawley, to aid its efforts to rival research institutions around the world and has welcomed its first 75 graduate students.
China's best universities were also advertising their courses, although Chinese academics said that outside elite institutions in Beijing and Shanghai, the Chinese emphasis on rote learning could not compete yet with more interactive education in the West.
Dr. Koller said the value of a postgraduate education, no matter where it was gained, was shifting fast. ''We have passed the stage in history,'' she said, ''where what you learn in college can last you for a lifetime.'' After 15 years, she added, that learning is ''obsolete.''
Top British universities like Oxford and Cambridge are also experimenting with online courses, which they promoted here.
Because government financing plays a large part in European institutions, both Andrew Hamilton, the vice chancellor of Oxford, and Leszek Borysiewicz, his counterpart at Cambridge, emphasized the paramount need to sustain long-term research.
In medicine, Mr. Borysiewicz argued, the span from the germ of a new idea to the bedside is typically about 17 years.
That requires long-term thought, akin to the studiously elite admissions policies and research skills that have kept Britain's top two universities among the world's best for hundreds of years.
But at Stanford, Dr. Koller is thinking in days, not centuries. Asked about the economic viability of Coursera, she outlined three potential sources of income: students paying an optional low fee ($59, for example) for a completed course; smaller colleges licensing the courses devised by the bigger universities; and employers subsidizing courses for their workers to bridge skill gaps.
When pressed on the likelihood of each model, she said: ''Get back to me in two weeks. That's when the sign-up for the student model ends.''

HEADLINE: Still on Strike, A Bus Union Sees a Threat To Its Culture

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Each August, just before the start of school, more than 1,000 drivers for the Atlantic Express school bus company gather in a lot in the shadow of Citi Field in Flushing, Queens. For the drivers, it is the event of the year, one repeated at lots all over the city, and is known simply as ''the pick.''
The drivers inspect slips of paper stapled to hulking plywood boards, each slip detailing another route: Names of children, where to pick them up and when, and whom to contact for emergencies. In order of tenure, the drivers are called in groups of 5 to 10 inside a mammoth depot, where they try to sign up for a choice route -- one that touches a neighborhood or school they prefer or ends at a bus yard near their home.
''It's basically picking your job,'' said Albert Serrano, 45, an Atlantic driver for the past 13 years who ranked No. 560 among 1,700 drivers at last summer's pick. ''The longer you're there, the better chance you have to pick something you want.'' 
Each profession has its own customs and quirks, but the culture of the New York City school bus driver is certainly one of the more unusual, one built on odd daily and annual schedules, decades of accumulated work rules and above all a deference to seniority. And it is now facing upheaval, with the city moving to end some seniority-based job guarantees, which led most of the city's drivers to walk out on Jan. 16.
The strike, which has shut down roughly 5,000 of the city's 7,700 school bus routes, is expected to continue this week, though the drivers' union and the school bus companies had agreed to sit down at Gracie Mansion with a mediator on Monday.
The city is not a direct party to the negotiations, but its decision to seek new bids for 1,100 special education routes is what led to the strike.
For union members, seniority plays a role in two important ways. One is during the August pick. The other is when drivers are laid off because their companies have lost city contracts to run bus routes. Laid-off drivers are entitled to choose from openings at other companies, with the longest-serving drivers having first choice, in a process known as the ''master pick.'' The new bid requests do not require companies to hire laid-off drivers, ending decades of job protections for older drivers and essentially ending the master pick.
The city and the union, Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, disagree over whether such job guarantees are legal, with the city pointing to a Court of Appeals ruling barring them for prekindergarten routes.
The concept of seniority is laced through a bus driver's world: For the most experienced, ''the pick'' represents a reward for years spent on more onerous routes.
''The pick means I can go to the same area, all the time, and see the same kids year after year,'' said Dawn L. Wensmann, 46, who has been driving a bus for Atlantic for 14 years. ''I see the kids and they say, 'Hey, bus driver, do you remember me?' and I say, 'Yes,' and I do. I watch them grow up. I've seen children who've been on my bus, and now I see them with children of their own.''
Union drivers earn $14 to $29 an hour, and work on a 40-hour-weekly schedule with overtime kicking in if a day exceeds 10 hours. Ms. Wensmann, a single mother of an 11-year-old daughter who lives in North Babylon, on Long Island, earns $42,000 a year driving her bus; the most senior drivers earn around $51,000. Many have second jobs.
But many also qualify for unemployment during summertime, because they are technically laid off then; for Ms. Wensmann, that brings in an additional $362 a week for eight weeks.
In most cases, buses pull out of their depots between 6 and 6:30 a.m., but drivers must get to the yard in time to prepare their buses: Check their brakes and lights, and make sure they are clean and have enough diesel fuel.
Routes can be lengthy, with several going from Staten Island to Westchester County, the location of some special education programs. Two hours can pass between the first pickup and when a driver reaches the school. In the middle of the day are field trips, though they are less frequent in the coldest months. Field trips are assigned, more or less, in a reverse of seniority: Shop stewards hand them out to the newest drivers first, meaning older drivers might enjoy a few hours of downtime in the middle of the day, and if they were lucky enough to pick a route that ends close to home, they could eat lunch in their own kitchen.
The drivers must return to schools for dismissal, usually between 2 and 3:30 p.m., and by the time they finish and return to the depot it can be 6 p.m. or later.
The work force can resemble a United Nations meeting. At a picket line in Ridgewood, Queens, last week, there was Yousef Abdalla, of Egypt, and Ilya Bdil, of Ukraine. In the past decade, there has been an influx of Haitians, who now make up 40 percent of drivers and monitors in New York, said James P. Hedge, an executive board member in the union. An additional 30 percent are Hispanic, he said, and the rest are ''everything else.''
Sixty percent of drivers are male. The average age is 52 to 54. Among monitors, who are known as matrons and ride on special education buses with drivers, all but five percent are women.
Qualifying for the driver's job is its own minijob: Drivers must earn a Class B commercial license from New York State with special endorsements for passengers, schools and air brakes. To get a license they need practice, and often must rent time on a bus. The whole process usually takes around six months, one reason bus companies have had trouble finding replacements during the strike. There is also the fear of being labeled a scab.
''Because we have a strike line, no one is going to cross it,'' said Steve Weistreich, 66, a former driver who is now a manager at Hoyt Transportation in Brooklyn.
Once behind the wheel, drivers must follow a litany of rules.
Each must have a first-aid kit with 16 bandages, 4 safety pins, a sling and gauze pads. Most drivers keep two kits aboard -- one fully stocked, which they never use, but that is there in case of a surprise inspection, and one for practical use. A substandard kit brings the company a $25 fine.
A driver who moves a bus containing special-needs children without a matron on board can be suspended for up to six months, Mr. Hedge said. Larger general-education buses require no matron, but companies face a $200 fine if a bus arrives at a school in the afternoon less than five minutes before the official dismissal time, he said.
Though companies are responsible for the fines, Mr. Hedge said drivers paid them about half the time to avoid discipline from their company.
One driver, John R. Bisbano, 67, a former city sanitation worker, said he had successfully fought for back pay last year after he was taken off the job for moving without a matron. Now he is on the picket lines, where drivers earn $30 a day from the local union. The international parent union may soon chip in another $30.
''I don't want to turn my back on the next generation of kids,'' Mr. Bisbano said. ''Unions are not perfect, but they did make the middle class in this nation.''

HEADLINE: In Hiring, a Friend in Need Is a Prospect, Indeed

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Riju Parakh wasn't even looking for a new job.
But when a friend at Ernst & Young recommended her, Ms. Parakh's résumé was quickly separated from the thousands the firm receives every week because she was referred by a current employee, and within three weeks she was hired. ''You know how long this usually takes,'' she said. ''It was miraculous.''
While whom you know has always counted in hiring, Ms. Parakh's experience underscores a fundamental shift in the job market. Big companies like Ernst & Young are increasingly using their own workers to find new hires, saving time and money but lengthening the odds for job seekers without connections, especially among the long-term unemployed.
The trend, experts say, has been amplified since the end of the recession by a tight job market and by employee networks on LinkedIn and Facebook, which can help employers find candidates more quickly and bypass reams of applications from job search sites like Monster.com. 
Some, like Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, have set ambitious internal goals to increase the proportion of hirings that come from internal referrals. As a result, employee recommendations now account for 45 percent of nonentry-level placements at the firm, up from 28 percent in 2010.
The company's goal is 50 percent. Others, such as Deloitte and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, have begun offering prizes like iPads and large-screen TVs in addition to traditional cash incentives for employees who refer new hires.
Economists and other experts say the recession has severed networks for many workers, especially the long-term unemployed, whose ranks have remained high even as the economy recovers.
Nearly 4.8 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or more, according to the Labor Department, three times as many as in late 2007. The typical unemployed worker has been jobless for 38 weeks, compared with 17 weeks before the recession.
While the overall unemployment rate has edged downward recently, little improvement is expected for the long-term jobless when data for December is released by the Labor Department on Friday.
''The long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people don't have access to the network,'' said Mara Swan, executive vice president for global strategy and talent at Manpower Group, which provides temporary help and job placement services. ''The more you've been out of the work force, the weaker your connections are.''
Although Ernst & Young looks at every résumé submitted, ''a referral puts them in the express lane,'' said Larry Nash, director of experienced and executive recruiting there. Indeed, as referred candidates get fast-tracked, applicants from other sources like corporate Web sites, Internet job boards and job fairs sink to the bottom of the pile.
''You're submitting your résumé to a black hole,'' said John Sullivan, a human resources consultant for large companies who teaches management at San Francisco State University. ''You're not going to find top performers at a job fair. Whether it's fair or not, you need to have employees make referrals for you if you want to find a job.''
Among corporate recruiters, Mr. Sullivan said, random applicants from Internet job sites are sometimes referred to as ''Homers,'' after the lackadaisical, doughnut-eating Homer Simpson. The most desirable candidates, nicknamed ''purple squirrels'' because they are so elusive, usually come recommended.
''We call it Monster.ugly,'' said Mr. Sullivan, referring to Monster.com. ''In the H.R. world, applicants from Monster or other job boards carry a stigma.''
Monster.com did not respond to a request for comment.
Even getting in the door for an interview is becoming more difficult for those without connections. Referred candidates are twice as likely to land an interview as other applicants, according to a new study of one large company by three economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For those who make it to the interview stage, the referred candidates had a 40 percent better chance of being hired than other applicants.
For many companies, the odds are even more lopsided. At Sodexo, a food service and facilities management company that hires 4,600 managers and executives a year, referred employees are 10 times more likely to be hired than other applicants.
''We're focusing on what will be most efficient,'' said Arie Ball, Sodexo's vice president for talent acquisition. ''And it's just easier to connect on social networks than it used to be.'' The company recently released a mobile app so employees can make recommendations from their mobile phones.
In particular, LinkedIn has altered the hiring landscape, making it easy for recruiting departments to trace connections between job candidates and their own employees by using LinkedIn's database and software.
LinkedIn has also eaten into the bottom line of Monster.com and other online job sites as well as that of traditional recruiters, said Craig A. Huber, an experienced stock analyst at Huber Research Partners who covers LinkedIn and Monster.com.
Even as the rise of social media changes the landscape for job seekers, the depth of the last recession has eroded labor networks in both the white- and blue-collar worlds, said Judith K. Hellerstein, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland. Skills decline, she said, and friends become reluctant to recommend people who have been out of work for months or years.
''We're in a period of historic displacement in the labor market,'' Ms. Hellerstein said. ''The long-term unemployed are a huge problem that we haven't figured out. All this human capital is being wasted and their skills are atrophying.''
Referral programs carry important benefits for big companies. Besides avoiding hefty payouts to recruiters, referred employees are 15 percent less likely to quit, according to Giorgio Topa, one of the authors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York study.
Human resource departments have recognized the same pattern. ''Our analysis shows referred hires perform better, stay longer and are quicker to integrate into our teams,'' said Mr. Nash of Ernst & Young.
As a result, within the last two years, firms like Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and Booz Allen have created dedicated teams within their human resource departments to shepherd prospects through the system. Over all, Deloitte receives more than 400,000 résumés a year, but recommended employees are guided along by a 12-person team.
''We had people that felt referrals weren't being attended to or referrals weren't being contacted,'' said Maribeth Bailey, national director of talent acquisition at Deloitte. ''We simplified the process by removing a lot of red tape.'' Deloitte now gets 49 percent of its experienced hires from referrals, up from 43 percent two years ago.
Ms. Swan of Manpower cautions that although employee referrals are a valuable tool, ''you have to watch the ultimate long-term result in terms of diversity and skills.'' Otherwise, she warned, ''you're going to get people like you have.''
People tend to recommend people much like themselves, economists say, a phenomenon known as assortative matching. Mr. Topa's study for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that 63.5 percent of employees recommended candidates of the same sex, while 71.5 percent favored the same race or ethnicity.
As a result, some companies are trying to make sure the proportion of employees who are recommended doesn't get too high even as they expand their referral programs.
At Enterprise Rent-A-Car, the proportion of workers hired through employee referrals has risen from 33 percent to just under 40 percent in the last two years, but the company wants to make sure it doesn't pass the 50 percent mark, said Marie Artim, vice president for talent acquisition at Enterprise Holdings.
''I think if you begin to creep up to 50 percent or higher, you start to worry about people not getting the opportunity to talk to us,'' she said. ''That's why we look for a balance.''

1913 Turkey Given Time to Reply
LONDON -- The Note of the allies, now prepared, definitely breaking off the peace negotiations, has not yet been presented. The Servian delegates had not received full instructions from Belgrade yesterday [Jan. 27], and there prevails a desire that Turkey should have as much time as possible to decide upon her line of action. These being the circumstances, there was no full meeting of the delegates of the allied States yesterday, and the time of the presentation of the Note to Turkey remains indefinite. No one anticipates, says the ''Daily Chronicle,'' that the Turkish reply will be other than a negative one. The allies are determined, however, not to allow the present state of affairs to continue more than a few days at most. The Turkish reply has not yet been received by the Powers, and it is likely that several days will elapse before it is forthcoming. Reuter's Agency learns that the ''conversations'' between M. Mishu, the Roumanian Minister, and Dr. Daneff were resumed yesterday morning and, according to a statement made in Roumanian circles, are proceeding amicably. Dr. Daneff, on being questioned, declared that there was nothing to communicate for the present. 
1938 Charter Restricts Strikes
Far-reaching regulation of both capital and labor by the French state will be effected if the six bills embodying the so-called ''modern French charter of labor'' tabled by Premier Camille Chautemps in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday [Jan. 27] are enacted into law. The French Premier himself championed his measures in a wireless appeal to the nation last night, declaring that France must have social peace if the franc was to be saved and if French production was to be increased to the point where it could balance French imports. So far, neither the French Federation of Labor, nor the Association of French Employers, has taken a stand for or against the labor bills which constitute the first legislation to be taken up by the reformed Chautemps Cabinet. If the government's labor charter is passed, France, while remaining a democracy, will have advanced far in the economic field in the direction of Germany and Italy, which have banned strikes and lockouts and made arbitration of industrial disputes compulsory. The difference will be that what the totalitarian states have achieved by fiat from the government, France is trying to accomplish by Parliamentary legislation.
1963 Kennedy Postpones Atom Tests
WASHINGTON -- President Kennedy indefinitely postponed underground atomic tests yesterday [Jan. 26] as a good-will gesture aimed at achieving a nuclear test-ban treaty. But he warned, in a White House statement, that the United States would never again accept a long-term unpoliced moratorium on tests. If current test-ban talks later seem to be getting nowhere, he said, the United States ''would act accordingly.'' The United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union have been wrestling with the nuclear test-ban problem since 1958. Each time they get close to agreement, something happens to thwart agreement. Now, with secret negotiations under way amid expressions of hope on all sides, they appear closer to success than ever.

HEADLINE: Rebound in Chinese Industries Gains Steam

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies rose 17.3 percent in December from the same month a year earlier, to 895.2 billion renminbi, official data released Sunday showed, as a fourth-quarter recovery helped offset poorer corporate results in the third. 
The data from the National Bureau of Statistics gave the latest sign of a gathering rebound in activity in China, the world's second-largest economy after that of the United States. The December increase in profits to $143.91 billion was smaller than the 22.8 percent increase in November but still marked the third-fastest growth last year.
Industrial profits totaled 5.56 trillion renminbi in 2012, up 5.3 percent from a year earlier, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics said on its Web site. That was up from a 3 percent increase in the first 11 months of 2012, compared with 2011.
The Chinese economy grew at a rate of 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, snapping a streak of seven consecutive quarters of slowdown.
Among 41 sectors surveyed by the bureau, 29 reported rising profits last year, led by a 69 percent jump for power generation companies, a nearly 21 percent increase for food processing companies and an 8 percent rise for makers of electrical equipment.
But some sectors are still struggling. Profits at steel companies tumbled 37 percent, while earnings for chemical companies fell 6 percent.
According to a Reuters poll, analysts predict that China's annual economic growth will rebound slightly to 8.1 percent this year.
The HSBC flash purchasing managers' index this month, the earliest indicator of China's industrial activity, showed growth in the factory sector accelerating to a two-year high in January.
Volvo's China joint venture
Volvo of Sweden said it would surpass Daimler as the world's biggest maker of heavy trucks after agreeing to set up a venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group, Reuters reported from Beijing.
Volvo will pay 5.6 billion renminbi for a 45 percent stake in the joint venture, giving it access to China, where it currently has only a minor presence. The truck maker is a separate company from Volvo Cars, which Ford Motor sold to Geely Automobile of China in 2010.
China was ''a little bit of a missing link in our global strategy'' for trucks, Volvo's chief executive, Olof Persson, said in a conference call with analysts and journalists. He said the agreement meant Volvo would ''get a major foothold and share in the world's largest truck market.''
The two companies will form a new venture, Dongfeng Commercial Vehicles, after the Chinese company buys out Nissan Motor of Japan in their joint venture in medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Dongfeng is the world's second-largest producer of heavy-duty trucks and China's biggest with total sales of 186,000 in 2011.

HEADLINE: Carrots For Doctors

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
WITH its ambitious proposal to pay doctors in public hospitals based on the quality of their work -- not the number of tests they order, pills they prescribe or procedures they perform -- New York City has hopped aboard the biggest bandwagon in health care. Pay for performance, or P4P in the jargon, is embraced by right and left. It has long been the favorite egghead prescription for our absurdly overpriced, underperforming health care system. The logic seems unassailable: Reward quality, and you will get quality. Stop rewarding waste, and you will get less waste. QED! P4P!
If only it worked.
For if you spend a little time with the P4P skeptics -- a data-bearing minority among physicians and health economists -- you will come away full of doubts. In practice, pay for performance does little to improve outcomes or to control costs. But if you look hard enough at why this common-sense approach doesn't deliver, you find some clues to what might. 
The New York plan would give hospitals bonuses to distribute to their doctors based on such indicators as patient satisfaction, speeding the flow of cases through the system and administering specific therapies. It is an attempt to get ahead of the federal law we all know as Obamacare, which includes rewards for hospitals that peg pay to a list of quality metrics. I've said before that I consider Obamacare an important leap forward, mainly for extending the basic safety net to millions of Americans. And there are aspects of the law, notably the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board, that may help bring down costs, if Congress can resist the temptation to interfere. But the pay-for-performance provisions are a triumph of theory over experience.
The first problem with P4P is that it does not address the biggest problem. Americans spend more than twice as much per capita as other developed countries on health care -- a crippling 18 percent of the country's economic output, and growing. Before studying the statistics, I assumed the root of the problem was doctors who, paid piecemeal for the services they provide, load up patients with marginal tests and treatments. In fact, America's health care system is not much different from other developed countries in the volume of service. Our doctors prescribe more or less the same number of pills and X-rays, perform similar numbers of blood tests and surgeries, as doctors in the best European countries. While there are undoubtedly savings to be had by cutting unnecessary services (shortening hospital stays, for example), the main problem is that our system charges far more for each service -- each office visit, each hip replacement, each day in a hospital bed, each dose of antibiotic. ''The facile explanation is that doctors do too much,'' said Peter Bach, a doctor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who studies quality of cancer care. ''But if you compare us to other countries on volume, we're not leading in any category. The flip side is, we pay double for a lot of stuff.'' (Actually, we lead in tonsillectomies and knee replacements, but his point is generally right.)
Doctors cite a number of reasons our medical treatments cost more -- the high price of malpractice insurance being a favorite, and genuine, culprit. But the main reason everything costs less in other countries is that other countries tend to have one big payer -- usually the government -- with the clout to bargain down prices. A single-payer system has, so far, proven politically unpalatable in this country. And even Medicare, which has the power of scale and uses it to drive down prices, wields its power sparingly, because doctors threaten to stop serving Medicare patients if the reimbursements fall too low. As hospitals merge into mightier megachains, they may be able to bargain down the payments to doctors and drug companies and device-makers, and create economies of scale by standardizing treatments. (The physician and New Yorker writer Atul Gawande proposed in a provocative August article that hospitals could drastically improve productivity by studying the example of restaurant chains like the Cheesecake Factory.) But that's not what P4P is about.
Instead of leverage, P4P employs incentives. Reduce the length of stay for acute-care patients, cut the rate of readmission for pneumonia cases, make sure heart-attack victims get a talk about diet before they are discharged, and you stand to find a little windfall in your paycheck.
Critics, who have evidence from a host of pilot programs, say that the bonuses are typically too small to change behavior; New York's would be a maximum of 2.5 percent of a doctor's salary, and most P4P programs pay less than that. Often the performance indicators measure things that are not within the doctor's control. Luis Marcos, a former president of the agency that runs New York's public hospitals, plucked several examples from the list of 13 metrics proposed for New York. Reducing waits in the emergency room (No. 4) is a worthy goal, he said, but it depends on a whole cast of people, from the clerk who greets the patient to the orderly who makes the bed ready. Shortening hospital stays (No. 13) requires having someone in the community -- family, a social worker -- to receive the patient; that's an especially hard requirement for hospitals that treat a lot of low-income or homeless people.
Another problem with P4P is that providers learn how to manipulate the results. ''Once you define performance, people manage toward those metrics and neglect other things that don't get counted,'' said the Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt, who writes for The Times's Economix blog. New York doctors have a favorite, possibly apocryphal, story of medical providers gaming the system: Miami hospitals that use patient feedback as a performance measure wait until spring to do their surveys, because that's when the cranky, hard-to-please New Yorkers go home from their winter refuge.
Ashish Jha, a doctor at the Harvard School of Public Health, argues that P4P might get results if the incentive payments to hospitals were substantially bigger, the formulas were simplified and the performance indicators were kept to a few, clear measures that doctors and patients agree matter: mortality rates, infection rates, recurrence of heart attacks. ''If hospitals achieve great outcomes, it matters little how they did so,'' Jha wrote in the latest Journal of the American Medical Association. And death rates are harder to game than administrative procedures.
Jha also proposes a little experiment in behavioral psychology: give hospitals 100 percent of the bonus at the beginning of the year, but require them to send a refund at the end of the year to pay for any shortcomings. Givebacks really focus the mind.
PETER PRONOVOST, a physician and professor at Johns Hopkins, says that rather than bribe doctors to adopt better practices, we should play to doctors' professionalism. Pronovost is famous for a scheme that drastically reduced infections associated with catheters by disseminating to doctors and nurses a simple, five-point operating-room checklist of reminders: Wash your hands, wear a sterile mask, etc. No pay incentives were involved, just an appeal to professional pride -- and, later, public reporting of the results. ''I wouldn't rule out economic incentives,'' Pronovost told me. ''But you can do a lot just working with professional norms.''
Pronovost has a more radical piece of common sense to offer. He proposes that the United States create an agency that would do for medicine what the Securities and Exchange Commission does for securities markets: compile and audit information about the performance of hospitals, and make it public. Rankings of hospitals now come either from news organizations or consumer groups working with untested and inconsistent data, or they are propaganda produced by medical providers themselves. ''There are stronger regulations about what a company can say about toothpaste than what a hospital can claim about quality,'' Pronovost said.
For image-conscious doctors and hospitals, pride and shame might be the most effective kind of carrots and sticks.

HEADLINE: Makers, Takers, Fakers

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Republicans have a problem. For years they could shout down any attempt to point out the extent to which their policies favored the elite over the poor and the middle class; all they had to do was yell ''Class warfare!'' and Democrats scurried away. In the 2012 election, however, that didn't work: the picture of the G.O.P. as the party of sneering plutocrats stuck, even as Democrats became more openly populist than they have been in decades.
As a result, prominent Republicans have begun acknowledging that their party needs to improve its image. But here's the thing: Their proposals for a makeover all involve changing the sales pitch rather than the product. When it comes to substance, the G.O.P. is more committed than ever to policies that take from most Americans and give to a wealthy handful. 
Consider, as a case in point, how a widely reported recent speech by Bobby Jindal the governor of Louisiana, compares with his actual policies.
Mr. Jindal posed the problem in a way that would, I believe, have been unthinkable for a leading Republican even a year ago. ''We must not,'' he declared, ''be the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys. We have to be the party that shows all Americans how they can thrive.'' After a campaign in which Mitt Romney denounced any attempt to talk about class divisions as an ''attack on success,'' this represents a major rhetorical shift.
But Mr. Jindal didn't offer any suggestions about how Republicans might demonstrate that they aren't just about letting the rich keep their toys, other than claiming even more loudly that their policies are good for everyone.
Meanwhile, back in Louisiana Mr. Jindal is pushing a plan to eliminate the state's income tax, which falls most heavily on the affluent, and make up for the lost revenue by raising sales taxes, which fall much more heavily on the poor and the middle class. The result would be big gains for the top 1 percent, substantial losses for the bottom 60 percent. Similar plans are being pushed by a number of other Republican governors as well.
Like the new acknowledgment that the perception of being the party of the rich is a problem, this represents a departure for the G.O.P. -- but in the opposite direction. In the past, Republicans would justify tax cuts for the rich either by claiming that they would pay for themselves or by claiming that they could make up for lost revenue by cutting wasteful spending. But what we're seeing now is open, explicit reverse Robin Hoodism: taking from ordinary families and giving to the rich. That is, even as Republicans look for a way to sound more sympathetic and less extreme, their actual policies are taking another sharp right turn.
Why is this happening? In particular, why is it happening now, just after an election in which the G.O.P. paid a price for its anti-populist stand?
Well, I don't have a full answer, but I think it's important to understand the extent to which leading Republicans live in an intellectual bubble. They get their news from Fox and other captive media, they get their policy analysis from billionaire-financed right-wing think tanks, and they're often blissfully unaware both of contrary evidence and of how their positions sound to outsiders.
So when Mr. Romney made his infamous ''47 percent'' remarks, he wasn't, in his own mind, saying anything outrageous or even controversial. He was just repeating a view that has become increasingly dominant inside the right-wing bubble, namely that a large and ever-growing proportion of Americans won't take responsibility for their own lives and are mooching off the hard-working wealthy. Rising unemployment claims demonstrate laziness, not lack of jobs; rising disability claims represent malingering, not the real health problems of an aging work force.
And given that worldview, Republicans see it as entirely appropriate to cut taxes on the rich while making everyone else pay more.
Now, national politicians learned last year that this kind of talk plays badly with the public, so they're trying to obscure their positions. Paul Ryan, for example, has lately made a transparently dishonest attempt to claim that when he spoke about ''takers'' living off the efforts of the ''makers'' -- at one point he assigned 60 percent of Americans to the taker category -- he wasn't talking about people receiving Social Security and Medicare. (He was.)
But in deep red states like Louisiana or Kansas, Republicans are much freer to act on their beliefs -- which means moving strongly to comfort the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted.
Which brings me back to Mr. Jindal, who declared in his speech that ''we are a populist party.'' No, you aren't. You're a party that holds a large proportion of Americans in contempt. And the public may have figured that out.

HEADLINE: Norway Debates Overseas Ventures After Siege in Algeria

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and HENRIK PRYSER LIBELL; Chris Cottrell contributed reporting from Berlin.

 BODY:
AUSTRHEIM, Norway -- Oil and gas made Norway one of the world's most advanced and prosperous countries in just a few decades. Now the deadly siege in Algeria has fired up a debate here over how far its petroleum companies, and their skilled workers, should go in the hunt for resources and profits.
In recent days, the energy giant Statoil has confirmed the deaths of four of the five company employees missing since Islamist militants attacked a gas installation this month at In Amenas, near the Libyan border. Few in Norway held out more than the slimmest hope for the last missing employee.
This sparsely populated region on the North Sea coast, where on winter afternoons children skate on frozen ponds nestled among snow-covered evergreens, might seem to have little in common with the barren Sahara. But the flare of burning gas in the distance at the Mongstad refinery, Norway's largest, serves as a reminder of why four people from the area found themselves among the 17 Statoil employees at the Algerian facility when it was ambushed. 
Since Phillips Petroleum struck oil in 1969 in the Ekofisk field in the North Sea, more and more Norwegians from this coastal region have passed up traditional jobs like fisherman and sailor to become the mechanics and engineers powering the petroleum industry -- not just in Norway but also from the Gulf of Mexico to Nigeria.
Austrheim's mayor, Per Leroy, 55, understands just how much the petroleum industry has meant to the region and the country. ''Go back 100 years and the area north of Bergen was one of the poorest in Europe,'' Mr. Leroy said. ''Now it's one of the richest.''
Statoil was founded in 1972 through an act of Parliament. It is run as a profit-making company, though the government maintains a roughly two-thirds stake in the business. While many European countries are struggling under growing debt burdens, Norway, thanks to its petroleum reserves, has a sovereign wealth fund with an estimated $700 billion to protect its future.
Norwegians enjoy universal health care, subsidized public universities that are almost free to attend and a generous social security system. Norwegians have a higher-than-average life expectancy, breathe cleaner air and are more satisfied with their lives than the residents of most industrialized countries, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. World Bank figures show that Norway's economic output of $98,102 per capita in 2011 was more than twice the $48,112 in the United States.
But workers who take their skills from oil platforms on the North Sea to projects in unstable countries are exposing themselves to new risks, a reality thrust into sharp relief by the militants' assault on In Amenas, an ordeal that drew a powerful counterattack by the Algerian military. In the end, at least 37 foreign hostages were killed.
''You are not just a traveler in the oil business, sometimes you are traveling in an invisible war zone,'' said Tom Hella, 35, an oil-drilling operator from the nearby town of Radoy whose career has taken him from Angola to Azerbaijan. But after what happened in Algeria, he said: ''The missis just said that that's it. After this she won't let me travel anymore.''
That conversation, writ large, is taking place across Norwegian society. Helge Ryggvik, a historian and oil researcher, told the daily Dagsavisen that Norwegian oil companies should withdraw from risky countries.
Even if they are willing to take the chance, the increased security costs of doing business may keep safety-conscious companies away. Henrik Thune, a senior researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in Oslo, specializing in energy and the Middle East, said, ''Western companies will pull out and other countries' companies, like Chinese, Indian and Russian companies, will replace them.''
In April 2010, Russian and Norwegian leaders finally resolved a 40-year dispute over how to divide the Barents Sea and part of the Arctic Ocean, opening another frontier in oil and natural gas exploration. Newer technologies have meant that existing reserves will remain productive for years to come, while recent discoveries have increased optimism that local production will remain strong for decades.
''They find the Norwegian continental shelf attractive because the political risk is very small,'' said Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, an oil analyst at Nordea Markets in Oslo. ''Maybe they won't pull out, but they don't have to go abroad as they did before,'' Ms. Saltvedt said. ''We're still little people in the big world.''
Statoil had already announced last year that it would sell its stake in a giant oil field in Iraq to the Russian company Lukoil.
The Algerian episode has not been as shocking for Norwegian society as the massacre of 69 people in 2011 at a political youth camp at Utoya Island along with a bombing in Oslo that killed eight. That was a trauma from which the nation is still recovering. But those killings, horrifying as they were, did not raise the kinds of policy questions that the events in Algeria do for a country with an outsize stake in the world of energy.
''If we have enough oil, there shouldn't be reason to send people over there,'' said Kim Vagenes, 22, who works at a hardware store here in Austrheim. The municipality, with a population of 2,850, is the hometown of two of the oil workers confirmed dead. ''Of course, the oil companies want as much oil as they can get.''
As a young man Mr. Leroy, the mayor of Austrheim, assumed he would go into the shipping business, but construction on the Mongstad refinery began just after he finished high school. ''The optimism came back to the people,'' he said. ''They moved back, built new houses.''
Thanks to the petroleum industry, the unemployment rate in Austrheim averages less than 2 percent. The development has quite literally connected this part of the region of Hordaland to the world. It used to take three hours by boat to get to the regional hub of Bergen. Now it takes an hour by car, using bridges built with oil money. At the airport in Bergen, advertisements promote jobs that ''take the next step in Bergen's oil and gas success'' and promise to help customers ''maximize their reservoirs' performance.''
Politicians and business leaders have thus far taken a strong stance, saying they will not be intimidated by acts of violence. Helge Kristoffersen, a managing director at the recruiting firm Mosaique, said that challenging, well-paying job openings would continue to attract candidates.
''Some may shy away from assignments in countries with high risk for a while to come,'' Mr. Kristoffersen said, ''but we quickly forget.''

HEADLINE: Before a Departure, a Rare Joint Interview

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- They sat side by side, trading laughs and finishing each other's thoughts. Five years ago, the very prospect of such a moment would have been ''improbable,'' as one of them put it.
But now as the improbable partnership between President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton winds down with her pending departure from the cabinet, the two rivals-turned-allies sent a public signal of solidarity on Sunday -- at a time when one has run his last election and the other is contemplating one more. 
The unusual joint interview with Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' was noteworthy mainly because it happened. Neither broke much ground in describing the journey that took them from bitter opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 to collaborators in dealing with terrorism, war, diplomacy and global economics.
But the picture of comity was presumably what the White House wanted when it proposed the interview to CBS in the first place.
''I consider Hillary a strong friend,'' Mr. Obama said.
''Very warm, close,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
The two laughed off the meaning of the interview for the 2016 election, when many Democrats expect Mrs. Clinton to run again. Mr. Obama could hardly endorse her when his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., appears to be angling for the party's nomination as well.
''You guys in the press are incorrigible,'' Mr. Obama told Steve Kroft when he asked about the 2016 race during the interview, which was taped last week. ''I was literally inaugurated four days ago, and you're talking about elections four years from now.''
Mrs. Clinton suggested that it might even be illegal for her to answer. ''I am still secretary of state,'' she said, ''so I'm out of politics. And I'm forbidden from even hearing these questions.''
Mrs. Clinton said she was still recovering from the concussion she suffered last month after falling and hitting her head. Among other things, she has to wear glasses for the time being instead of contact lenses. ''I have some lingering effects from the concussion that are decreasing and will disappear,'' she said. ''But I have a lot of sympathy now when I pick up the paper and read about an athlete or one of our soldiers who's had traumatic brain injury.''
Mr. Obama defended himself against criticism that he has been too passive on the world stage, pointing to his intervention in Libya, where a revolution aided by NATO warplanes led to the death of the country's longtime dictator. ''Muammar Qaddafi probably does not agree with that assessment,'' Mr. Obama said of the criticism, ''or at least if he was around, he wouldn't agree with that assessment.''
The president lavished praise on Mrs. Clinton for her discipline, stamina and talent. And they put a glossy shine on history by brushing off the tough primary attacks five years ago as the product of trying to find differences where, they now say, there actually were not that many.
''Despite our hard-fought primary, we had such agreement on what needed to be done for our country,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
''Made for tough debates, by the way,'' Mr. Obama added, ''because we could never figure out what we were different on.''
''Yeah, we worked at that pretty hard,'' she said.
As for any residual bad feelings, they said it had taken their aides longer to get over it than it had taken them. ''What did evolve was a friendship, as opposed to just a professional relationship,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Friendships involve a sense of trust and being in the foxhole together. And that emerged during the course of months when we were making some very tough decisions.''

HEADLINE: 2 Science Projects to Receive Award of a Billion Euros

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Projects to imitate the brain and to develop new materials for information technology have won awards of about 1 billion euros each that will be announced Monday by the European Commission.
The awards, the largest of their kind ever made by the European authorities and equivalent to about $1.35 billion each, are aimed at helping innovative industries in the European Union and nonmember countries like Switzerland.
''Europe's position as a knowledge superpower depends on thinking the unthinkable and exploiting the best ideas,'' Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for information technology, said in a statement prepared in advance of the formal announcement. 
The goal is to ''keep Europe competitive, to keep Europe as the home of scientific excellence,'' Ms. Kroes said.
About half the money, which is to be disbursed over a decade, is expected to come from governments, and the rest from companies, institutes and universities, according to European Union officials. Details of how an initial payment of 54 million euros, almost $73 million, for each project will be allocated should be decided in the coming months, officials said.
A selection committee of scientists and industrialists took two years to whittle a list of more than 20 projects down to two winners. The members of the selection committee have not been identified, but European Union officials said they were carefully vetted to avoid any conflicts of interest.
The Human Brain Project aims to create the most accurate simulation to date of the brain and its functions. The project could help aid diagnoses of diseases, help with the testing of new drugs, and develop supercomputing techniques modeled on the brain.
The project involves scientists from 87 institutions and will be led by Henry Markram, a professor at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. Partners in that project include the Institut Pasteur in France, I.B.M. in the United States and SAP in Germany.
The project on new materials will focus on ultrathin graphene, which conducts electricity better than copper, is up to 300 times stronger than steel and could be used to build better display screens. European officials say graphene could also replace and redefine components in devices like computers and phones by, for example, making them foldable.
That project involves more than 100 research groups and will be led by Jari Kinaret, a professor at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. Members of the consortium include the University of Cambridge in England and Nokia in Finland.
The European Union trails the United States in innovation, and that gap has been widening in some categories like research and development spending by business, according to a study issued by the European Commission in February 2012.
The bloc also lags behind Japan and South Korea in innovation, according to the study. And while the European Union is doing better than the biggest emerging nations, China is catching up, partly because of its strength in exports of medium and high-tech products, the study said.
European Union governments stepped up their calls for initiatives to address specific science and technology challenges at the end of 2009. The European Commission then came forward with plans for financing worth up to 2 billion euros, almost $2.7 billion, over a decade.
The plan breaks with previous scientific initiatives that have normally run in cycles of two to four years. Ms. Kroes said the new financing model should deliver innovative technologies more quickly.
The decision meant disappointment for some projects, including FuturICT, which had aimed at creating ''a planetary scale computer'' for helping predict events like natural disasters. Some of the reasoning used to reject FuturICT was ''quite crazy,'' and the project's leaders should be ''pretty shocked,'' Alex Vespignani, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who is a supporter, wrote on the project's Web site.
Exactly how much money from the central European Union budget will go to the two winners and to a huge array of other projects, including additional possible projects on the scale of those focused on graphene and the human brain, will partly depend on the outcome of a battle between leaders in the bloc on the size of the next long-term budget.

HEADLINE: As Art Values Rise, So Do Concerns About Market's Oversight

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN and KEVIN FLYNN

 BODY:
When some of the world's richest people gather for the glittering New York auction season this spring, they will spend hundreds of millions of dollars in an art market that allows opaque transactions and has few outside monitors.
At major auctions the first bids announced for a piece are typically fictional -- numbers pulled from the air by the auctioneer to jump-start bidding.
Collectors can find themselves being bid up by someone who, in exchange for agreeing in advance to pay a set amount for a work, is promised a cut of anything that exceeds that price.
And year round, galleries ignore with impunity a 42-year-old law that says they must post their prices. 
Art sales in New York, at galleries or at auction, are estimated at $8 billion a year. Yet the last significant change in the city's auction regulations took effect more than two decades ago, when the value of transactions was less than half of what it is today.
Many in the art world insist there is no need for further scrutiny of a market that prompts few consumer complaints and is vital to the New York economy. But other veterans of the business say there is mounting concern that monitoring has not kept pace with the increasing treatment of art as a commodity.
''The art world feels like the private equity market of the '80s and the hedge funds of the '90s,'' James R. Hedges IV, a New York collector and financier, said. ''It's got practically no oversight or regulation.''
For two decades some New York State lawmakers have been trying to curb the practice known as ''chandelier bidding,'' a bit of art-market theater in which auctioneers begin a sale by pretending to spot bids in the room. In reality the auctioneers are often pointing at nothing more than the light fixtures.
''The time has come to give up this fiction that there are actual real bidders,'' said David Nash, a gallery owner who spent 35 years as a top executive with Sotheby's.
But nine bills submitted in Albany over the years to ban the practice failed. So today, in a city that seeks to regulate soda consumption, chandelier bidding remains 100 percent legal. The law says auctioneers can announce such bids as long as they stop before reaching a sale item's reserve price, the confidential minimum amount that sellers have agreed to accept.
Auction houses say that the bidding practice is harmless, fully disclosed and widely understood by collectors, and that it protects the seller by, among other things, preserving the drama that draws buyers to a sale.
''People like to say that the art market is unregulated,'' said Jane A. Levine, senior vice president and compliance director for Sotheby's. ''Nothing could be further from the truth. There are bespoke auction rules that cover this very tiny market that actually do govern the auction process.''
The New York City Consumer Affairs Department, which oversees the art market, reports few complaints from buyers or sellers, and auctioneers point to additional consumer protections provided by the state Uniform Commercial Code.
Auction officials say most criticism of their practices comes from gallery owners -- their rivals for sales -- who they say operate without oversight. ''The dealers are not regulated at all,'' said Patricia G. Hambrecht, chief business development officer for the Phillips auction house.
Some perceptions of the market as an insiders' game stem from recent lawsuits against galleries, including three by collectors who accused Knoedler & Company, now defunct, of fraud.
''Is there any reason to believe that regulating the art market will be any more effective than regulating the financial markets has been?'' asked Jonathan Brown, a professor at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. ''Many of the players are identical.''
But others say that, given the money involved and the number of newly wealthy buyers, stricter rules are a must.
''Ideally any tightening of the rules would be self-imposed,'' said Michael Plummer, a former Christie's executive who is now a principal in Artvest Partners, an art advisory company. ''Unfortunately I don't think the markets are going to have the discipline to do that.''
Price Tags Are 'Tacky'
Perhaps nothing illustrates the art market's laissez-faire spirit better than the way galleries flout New York City's ''truth in pricing'' law. It says items for sale, including art, must have a price tag conspicuously displayed. None of 10 galleries visited at random this month had posted prices, though a few smaller ones produced price lists when asked. At the David Zwirner gallery in Chelsea a woman at the front desk seemed indignant when asked if she had a price list.
''I do not,'' she said.
In 1988 Consumer Affairs officials cracked down on galleries that did not post prices; 19 violators were cited.
''We brought it out from behind the curtain,'' said Angelo J. Aponte, the former consumer affairs commissioner. ''There was a lot of blowback. That industry has a lot of clout in New York.''
There does not appear to have been a similar enforcement effort in recent years. Consumer affairs officials declined to be interviewed or to detail whether any galleries were cited last year for violating the pricing law. In the past the agency's inspectors have focused on industries that draw the largest share of complaints, like home-improvement contracting.
But the pricing law is enforced against other retailers. The Adry Furniture Corporation of Brooklyn, for example, was fined $500 in 2011 for failing to display prices for a red stool and an end table.
Dealers said posting prices on valuable works in an open gallery creates security concerns and disrupts an exhibition's aesthetics by transforming artworks into commodities.
''We consider it tacky to do that,'' Richard L. Feigen, a longtime dealer, said.
Others say posting prices would reduce the market's elitism. Galleries, experts say, often choose to whom they will sell and favor good customers, especially those whose ownership will add luster to an artist's market standing.
''You can't deny someone the opportunity to buy something if the price is posted and the work is unsold,'' said Robert Storr, dean of the Yale University School of Art. ''Unless there is the will to enforce these things,'' he said of pricing laws, ''there is no point in having them.''
Profits From Risk
When you talk to dealers about what most needs policing in the art market, many mention third-party guarantees.
A guarantee typically operates as it sounds. When someone offers a piece for auction, the house will sometimes guarantee that the seller will make at least a minimum amount by arranging with a third party to purchase the work for a specific price, undisclosed to the public, should it fail to sell for more. In exchange for putting up the funds, the guarantor, whose name is also not revealed, gets a cut of any proceeds above the guarantee.
So if a third party commits to a $10 million guarantee, and the bidding reaches $12 million, the third party receives a piece (often 30 percent to 50 percent) of the additional $2 million.
Auction houses use guarantees to compete for coveted consignments. Because they primarily profit from fees tied to sale prices, it's in their interest to attract the most valuable works.
Although only a small percentage of works are sold with guarantees, they are often the most expensive. And since 2008, when the auction houses lost heavily during a market slump on works they had guaranteed themselves, they have often turned to third parties to take on that risk.
Christie's, for example, was able to sell Picasso's ''Nude, Green Leaves and Bust'' in 2010 after it found a third party willing to put up an undisclosed guarantee. When the painting, with a low estimate of $70 million, sold for $106.5 million -- at the time, the highest price ever for a work sold at auction -- the unnamed guarantor presumably walked off with a good bit of money.
The problem, some dealers, collectors and art advisers say, is that the neutrality of an auction is lost when these underwriters can bid on a work they've guaranteed. Critics argue that the guarantors have an undisclosed interest in the outcome and an unseen advantage over other bidders because a buyer who wants the work might wind up competing against someone who only wants to bid up the price.
''In a market that purports to be transparent and offering disclosure of conflicts of interest, this is not a level playing field,'' Mr. Hedges, the collector, said.
At Christie's and Phillips, both large auction houses, even if a guarantor ends up owning the work, he would still pay less for it than anyone else. For example, if a guarantor's bid of $12 million turned out to be the winning bid, the guarantor would not pay the full $12 million because he or she still gets the cut -- called a financing fee -- of any amount above the $10 million guarantee.
That means the prices in auction records -- the industry's prime metric for measuring value -- are not always accurate.
''If the price is not the price because the guarantor has bought it and gotten a discount, there is no longer any transparency in the market,'' said Michael Moses, a retired New York University professor whose company, Beautiful Asset Advisors, tracks the art market.
Sotheby's, which refers to its arrangement as ''an irrevocable bid,'' said it does not allow a guarantor who ends up owning a work to share in the financing fees. ''Our view is, people aren't bidding on the same terms,'' said Jonathan A. Olsoff, senior vice president and worldwide director of litigation. ''The guarantor is getting a discount.''
Christie's and Phillips said that they allowed guarantors to earn a financing fee, even if they bid successfully for a work, because to do otherwise might dissuade them from bidding and, thus, deprive a seller of the best price.
Auction houses say guarantees create liquidity and give sellers the confidence to bring important works to market. If there are abuses, they say, it is the guarantors' conduct that is the issue, not their own.
The houses typically secure the guarantees from wealthy collectors and private dealers, some of whom agree to be guarantors because it can help maintain the value of an artist in whose work they have invested.
Though bidders never know who in a salesroom might be a guarantor or what price has been guaranteed, the auctioneers, as required by law, do disclose at the start of a sale that some works will be sold with guarantees and denote them with small symbols in the catalog. The auction houses also disclose that guarantors may be bidding, even though, they say, consumer affairs regulations do not expressly require that.
''We're pro transparency,'' said Karen Gray, Christie's general counsel, ''so actually our announcements are going farther than we are strictly required to.'' Consumer affairs officials did not respond to that contention but said in a statement, ''Fairness, accountability and transparency are the hallmarks of auctioneer regulation, and we're interested in hearing from industry leaders about the changing face of the auction industry.''
Bills Perennially Stalled
Richard L. Brodsky said he knew his efforts as a New York State assemblyman in the 1990s to regulate the sale of art in the state further would draw yawns from fellow legislators. Many viewed the art world, he said, as a foreign place inhabited by wealthy people with little need for protection.
But Mr. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said the public's interest in fair and orderly markets was at stake. And if prices were artificially inflated, he said, taxpayer-supported institutions like museums could find themselves unable to afford important works.
So in 1991 he introduced a bill to ban chandelier bidding. Gallery owners had complained about the practice for years. But while the city had made other changes in the law, it had stopped short of banning such bids.
''I don't think it's unreasonable, given the clientele and players, to have that little bit of theater,'' Mr. Aponte, the consumer affairs commissioner, had said in 1986 during an earlier debate.
Mr. Feigen, the art dealer, said in later hearings that he did not find that argument compelling.
''If I want drama, I'll go to Broadway,'' he said, ''not to a financial market.''
Under the law in New York City and other places, auctioneers may make up bids at the beginning of a sale as long as they stop announcing such bids before the auctioneer reaches the undisclosed reserve, the minimum amount the consignor will accept.
Auctioneers say chandelier bidding (they prefer the term ''consecutive bidding'') is necessary to keep the reserve secret and protect the seller. Without it, they say, bidding might end up starting at the reserve, since that is the minimum a seller will accept, and thus telegraph what it is. They liken it to real estate transactions in which sellers do not reveal the minimum amount they will accept so as to retain negotiating leverage.
City law requires auction houses to disclose in their catalogs and on a salesroom sign that such bidding may take place. The practice is also mentioned during the rapid recitation of auction rules before a sale.
But Mr. Plummer, the art adviser, said he had accompanied prospective buyers to auctions who were unaware of the practice. ''It is absolutely not correct,'' he said, ''to assume that all participants in an auction are seasoned insiders who understand the nuances of chandelier bidding.''
Under the bill Mr. Brodsky introduced an auctioneer would have to make plain a fake bid by saying it was ''for the consignor'' as in, ''I have $1 million for the consignor.''
The consumer affairs agency backed the bill. At hearings Richard Schrader, its deputy commissioner, testified that chandelier bidding may inflate prices by snaring ''unwitting bidders into thinking that they are competing with other potential purchasers.''
Auction houses argued, though, that the existing regulations in New York City were sufficient. Christie's and Sotheby's hired Stanley Fink, a powerful former Assembly speaker, to lobby on their behalf. ''He was ferocious in support of his clients and his presence was meaningful,'' Mr. Schrader recalled.
When Mr. Brodsky's bill failed, he reintroduced it, session after session. The first eight bills never made it out of the Assembly. On his ninth try, in 2007, the bill got through the Assembly, but died in the Senate.
Mr. Brodsky said city officials seldom supported the legislation, a charge consumer affairs officials denied. In a statement the agency said it had ''no record of former Assembly member Brodsky requesting changes in enforcement practices or oversight to address the changing face of the auction industry.''
Mr. Brodsky said: ''I have had continuing and unsatisfactory communication with New York City on this matter for 15 years. I cannot speak to the adequacy of their record keeping.''
In 2008 Mr. Brodsky toned down the bill in ways that extended the city's auction regulations to the entire state but effectively left the practice of chandelier bidding unchanged.
He said he decided a softened bill was better than no bill at all. ''I can't get everything I want but I can make this part of the public policy dialogue,'' he said. ''And I did.''
The auction houses, pleased with the changes, sent a memo of support, and in 2010 the Legislature passed the amended bill.
But it would not become law. Gov. David A. Paterson vetoed the bill, citing concerns that counties had no way to enforce it.
The legislation lives on today, albeit in its weaker form. Its Senate sponsor, Daniel L. Squadron of Manhattan, says it still has value. Beyond extending the reach of the city law, the proposal would empower the state attorney general to enforce auction violations and provide additional grounds on which bidders might sue.
Senator Squadron said he had not lost hope that the legislation might pass. (Last fall the state did strengthen the law that protects artists and owners who consign their work to galleries.)
''The need to trust the credibility of an auction is as real a need as it was 20 years ago,'' Senator Squadron said.
Last year, though, his bill never made it out of committee.

HEADLINE: North Korean Leader Vows 'High-Profile' Retaliation Over New U.N. Sanctions

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has ordered his top military and party officials to take ''substantial and high-profile important state measures'' to retaliate against American-led United Nations sanctions on the country, the North's official media reported Sunday.
North Korea did not clarify what those measures might be, but it referred to a series of earlier statements in which Mr. Kim's government has threatened to launch more long-range rockets and conduct a third nuclear test to build an ability to ''target'' the United States. 
Mr. Kim threw his weight behind his government's escalating standoff with Washington when he called a meeting of top security and foreign affairs officials and gave an instruction in his name. He inherited the posts of supreme party and military leaders from his father, Kim Jong-il, who died in December 2011.
By calling such a meeting and having it reported in state news media, Mr. Kim appeared to be asserting his leadership in what his country called an ''all-out action'' against the United States, unlike his father, who tended to remain reclusive during similar confrontations.
''At the consultative meeting, Kim Jong-un expressed the firm resolution to take substantial and high-profile important state measures in view of the prevailing situation,'' said the North's Korean Central News Agency, or K.C.N.A. ''He advanced specific tasks to the officials concerned.''
The K.C.N.A. dispatch, which was distributed Sunday, was dated Saturday, indicating that the meeting in Pyongyang, the capital, took place then. That was the same day on which the North's main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said that the United Nations Security Council's resolution last Tuesday calling for tightening sanctions against the North left it with ''no other option'' but a nuclear test.
''A nuclear test is what the people demand,'' it said in a commentary.
The resolution was adopted unanimously -- with the support of the North's traditional protector, China -- as punishment for its Dec. 12 rocket launching. The Security Council determined that the launching was a cover for testing intercontinental ballistic missile technology and a violation of its earlier resolutions banning North Korea from conducting such tests.
The North rejected the old resolutions, as well as the latest one, insisting that launching rockets to put satellites into orbit was its sovereign right. Its successful rocket launching in December, coming after a failure last April, was the most visible achievement that Mr. Kim's government could present to its people, who have suffered decades of poverty and isolation. In North Korean propaganda, defending the rocket program is likened to protecting national pride and independence -- even if the country has to pay a high economic price.
Last Thursday, North Korea said that its drive to rebuild its moribund economy and its rocket program, until now billed as a peaceful space project, would be adjusted and redirected toward efforts to foil hostilities by the United States. On Sunday, it said the Security Council's action ''has thrown a grave obstacle'' in the way of its efforts to focus on ''economic construction so that the people may not tighten their belts any longer.''
Still, it said it had to ''defend its sovereignty by itself'' because ''different countries concerned'' failed to ''fairly solve the problem.'' In the past few days, North Korea, without citing China by name, expressed bitterness and defiance against its longtime Communist ally for endorsing the American-led Security Council resolution. On Saturday, Rodong Sinmun reaffirmed its dislike of ''sadae,'' or toadying to big countries, including China.
China provides all of North Korea's fuel and remains its biggest trading partner, but analysts believe that its influence on the recalcitrant government in Pyongyang is limited. China has been thus far reluctant to use its economic leverage, fearing that it would only drive its neighbor into more provocations, which would be a blow to China's interest in maintaining stability in the region.
International attention has focused on the Punggye nuclear test site in northeastern North Korea, where the country conducted its two previous underground nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. Enough preparations have been made there recently that a third test could happen on short notice from the North Korean leadership, South Korean officials said.
In a report issued Sunday, the Institute for National Security Strategy, a research organization affiliated with South Korea's main intelligence service, said that North Korea might use provocations this year to tame the government of President-elect Park Geun-hye, who will be sworn in next month.
''It will wait and see until the new government's North Korea policy shapes up,'' it said. ''If the policy is not favorable, the North may lash out with provocations.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s Cantor, Looking Past Politics of Debt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Alison Smale contributed reporting from Davos, Switzerland.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With House Republicans gathered behind closed doors this month at a resort in Williamsburg, Va., Representative Eric Cantor hushed the crowd with a long slide presentation on the prospects of a government default.
The federal debt was climbing quickly. The Treasury Department was using ''extraordinary measures'' to keep paying the nation's debts, even if, technically, the government had blown past its borrowing limit. President Obama, he said, would set the day the government would go into default, and Republicans balking at raising the debt limit had no real idea when that day would be. The Republican Party was not in control of the situation.
For Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, the goals during the ensuing week -- from Williamsburg to the House vote last Wednesday to suspend the debt limit until May -- were to make sure the government did not default on its debt in the coming weeks and to get House Republicans beyond an endless, and politically fruitless, discussion about debt, deficits and green-eyeshaded austerity. 
''We are in a town run by Democrats, and we cannot win the hearts and minds of Americans if we are just talking about numbers, day in and day out,'' said a Cantor aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss his boss's plans. ''There are a lot of things Republicans care about.''
After lying low for several months, Mr. Cantor is reasserting his presence in the Capitol, even as Speaker John A. Boehner continues his struggles to maintain Republican unity. In the coming weeks, the majority leader plans to lay out a second, softer track for his party beyond the constant cycle of budget showdowns and deficit talks.
Notably, that track will include a new push for private-school vouchers for underprivileged children, health care options beyond the old fight over the president's health care law, new work force training initiatives and a renewed push for science, technology and engineering visas for would-be immigrants.
After successfully engineering the latest debt ceiling vote last week, Mr. Cantor flew to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he road-tested those themes as the lone House Republican leader rubbing elbows with the international elite.
Citing a struggling single mother with a gifted child in a poor city neighborhood, he told Davos attendees, ''We need to create some type of competitive mechanisms'' to help her escape the bad schools she is stuck with. Between meetings with King Abdullah II of Jordan; President Shimon Peres of Israel; the International Monetary Fund director, Christine Lagarde; and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, he spoke of ''sane immigration policies,'' unemployed youths and a German model for economic output.
Mr. Cantor is expected to lay out his domestic vision on Feb. 5 at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right research group.
His latest moves follow two episodes this month that attracted wide notice and new questions about Republican unity. He publicly broke with the speaker early this month over the deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, voting against the agreement even as Mr. Boehner voted for it. He then deftly maneuvered to secure passage of a Hurricane Sandy disaster relief package that Mr. Boehner had initially been cool to, bowing to pressure from financial donors in New York and engineering a complex process that satisfied both Northeastern Republicans and fiscal conservatives.
On the train ride to the House Republican retreat in Williamsburg, Mr. Cantor, who represents a district in Virginia, walked the aisles and worked the back bench, asking members about their legislative interests and promising attention.
Mr. Cantor's actions lack what many saw in 2011, the first year of Republican House control, as overt disloyalty to Mr. Boehner. Instead, lawmakers and aides say, his eye may be on an emerging potential rival for the speakership, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party's 2012 vice-presidential nominee.
Mr. Ryan has given no sign that he wants the job, but House Republicans say that if anyone can challenge Mr. Cantor for the job, it is Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman. Mr. Cantor appears to be shoring up his power before Mr. Boehner's retirement, which many believe will come in four years, if not two.
''I have never felt that there was any real reason to believe Eric is plotting and scheming against the speaker,'' said Vin Weber, a former Republican House member who remains close to the leadership. ''But when you're in the leadership, you're always looking over your shoulder, using your peripheral vision to see who might be coming up on you. That's the nature of leadership.''
Mr. Cantor's supporters say his moves have nothing to do with leadership intrigue and everything to do with leadership -- and with shaping the direction of the party after last year's electoral defeats.
After more than two years of budget fights, the majority leader, more than anyone else in the leadership, is said to want to broaden the discussion. His mantra behind closed doors is ''How do we make life work better?'' aides say, and he would like the next two years to be at least as much about job creation and economic opportunity as about spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs.
Mr. Cantor's votes -- against the fiscal cliff deal but for $60 billion in disaster aid -- may have lacked ideological consistency, but they do contain a common thread. All have been good for Mr. Cantor.
The work he did for the aid package put him in a small minority of his party. The bill passed 241 to 180, but only 49 Republicans voted yes; 179, including Mr. Ryan, voted no. But its passage pleased rich New York donors like the venture capitalist Kenneth G. Langone and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who pushed him hard for a vote after the speaker backed off the bill on the last day of the 112th Congress.
Those donors, in turn, help keep Mr. Cantor's two political action committees, the YG Action Fund and the Every Republican Is Crucial PAC, flush so he can spread largess to the young House Republicans who make up the core of his support. Goldman Sachs was the second-largest donor to ERIC PAC in the 2012 political cycle.
''I certainly asked a good number of people in New York who he has relationships with to call him and ask for his support,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
Mr. Cantor stayed on the right side of House conservatives -- and against Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan -- when he shocked Republicans and opposed the last-minute deal that allowed taxes to rise on incomes over $400,000 while averting much broader tax increases that could have put the economy back into recession.
The deal passed 257 to 167, but this time Mr. Cantor was with the majority of his conference. Just 85 Republicans voted for it, including Mr. Boehner, who rarely votes; 151 voted against.
''This is all about the longer term,'' one House Republican said. ''Get rid of the image of being too grasping and ambitious. Cooperate with Boehner where it's not going to hurt him, but don't run risks in the short term.''
Mr. Cantor is in a tricky position. If he becomes too closely associated with Mr. Boehner, he could be swept aside in the event of a broad leadership upheaval. But he cannot look like the architect of upheaval and risk losing the gavel in the melee.
Mr. Cantor declined to be interviewed for this article. But Doug Heye, a Cantor spokesman, dismissed any talk of disunity. The top leaders are working well together, he said, but sometimes their beliefs will diverge.
''When it comes to the cliff, when it comes to Sandy, he voted his conscience and what he thought was right,'' Mr. Heye said of his boss.
But even the hint of division is coming at a bad time, with Mr. Obama fresh off a convincing electoral victory and staking out uncompromising positions as the government careers toward the next fiscal deadlines: March 1, when nearly $1 trillion in across-the-board defense and domestic spending cuts begin; March 27, when the stopgap law financing the government expires; and May 16, when the new debt ceiling reprieve expires.
''This is an unprecedented time for House Republican leadership,'' said Ron Bonjean, who was an aide to J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, a former Republican speaker. ''Never before have we lacked a consistent message due to the results of an election, with such high stakes ahead.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Reassures an Impatient Europe on Trade

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Barack Obama is committed to reaching an agreement to smooth trade with the European Union, the United States' top negotiator has said, but only if it is constructed in a way that would overcome objections from farm groups and that could win congressional approval.
In an interview Saturday in Davos, Ron Kirk, the U.S. trade representative, responded to European leaders who in the past week renewed their calls for a U.S.-Europe deal to dismantle tariffs and other barriers, which they badly want as a way of stimulating their ailing economies. 
At the World Economic Forum, David Cameron, the British prime minister, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, were among a host of leaders and business people pleading for a pact that would eliminate tariffs as well as regulations that impede trade. Even without changes, the United States and Europe between them already have the world's largest trading market.
On both sides of the Atlantic, proponents of a deal have expressed frustration about the delaying of an official report by a U.S.-European working group that would set the stage for formal talks. The delay has fed the widespread perception that Mr. Obama does not care that much about a trade pact or, for that matter, about Europe in general.
''We greatly value the trans-Atlantic relationship,'' Mr. Kirk said at a hotel in Davos. ''We have devoted an extraordinary amount of time'' to a possible trade agreement, he said. But the administration wants to make sure objections from farmers and other constituencies are addressed first, he said. Otherwise, officials might spend years negotiating an agreement only for Congress to reject it.
''If we do this, we want there to be a bridge to somewhere and we want to get there on one tank of gas,'' Mr. Kirk said. He declined to predict when formal talks might begin.
Trade had been one of the main topics of discussion at the World Economic Forum, which concluded Saturday. There were signs of progress toward a trade accord, which, if it proved durable, could provide a riposte to the eternal criticism of the elite event: that the annual Davos forum is just an expensive cocktail party where little of substance is ever accomplished.
While it is true that Davos is rarely the venue for concrete agreements, the event attracts a diverse international crowd in an informal setting. It can be a place where political and business leaders work toward consensus on difficult issues like trade. That may have been the case in the past week, some of the people involved said.
''I'm carefully optimistic we will kick off negotiations this year,'' Alexander Stubb, the Finnish minister for foreign affairs and trade, said after a panel on trade issues at the forum Saturday. ''It's going in the right direction.''
Noting that trade ministers from more than 20 nations were in town, Mr. Kirk said: ''It's a great opportunity to touch base with a number of them bilaterally. This saves me a trip to nine other countries.''
''Everybody criticizes Davos until they come,'' Mr. Kirk said.
Friction-free commerce between the United States and Europe could create jobs and add an estimated $50 billion a year to the U.S. economy, Mr. Kirk said. European political leaders fervently want a deal to help their anemic economies grow. There is also strong support from business groups on both sides of the Atlantic.
''Half a dozen senior leaders in Europe are ready to move forward,'' Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview in Davos on Thursday. He said that a deal could be concluded within 18 months if both sides set their minds to it.
But others are skeptical, noting that Europe and the United States have been talking on and off about a trade deal for years. While U.S. companies like General Electric have expressed strong support for an agreement, progress has always been stymied by objections from interest groups, particularly over agricultural issues. Some Europeans, for example, object to imports of U.S. food containing genetically modified plants.
''I was surprised to hear all the speakers saying it will happen in the next two years,'' said Maximilian Zimmerer, chief financial officer of Allianz, a German insurance company. ''What about the last 10 years?''
Mr. Kirk declined to go into detail about what specific issues might be delaying a report by what is known as a High Level Working Group, which he leads along with Karel De Gucht, the E.U. trade commissioner. A favorable recommendation by the group would set in motion the process of negotiating a comprehensive agreement.
But Mr. Kirk noted that members of Congress with farmers as constituents far outnumbered those whose districts included big companies like Boeing or Apple that would benefit from a trade deal. ''Agriculture tends to be a challenging issue,'' he said.
That is partly because American farmers are already on the lighter side of the trade scale. The European Union exports far more farm products to the United States than vice versa: 14.6 billion euros, or $19.7 billion, versus 8.2 billion euros, according to E.U. figures for 2011, the most recent available.
Mr. Kirk has announced plans to leave his post as trade representative next month, and Mr. Obama has not named his successor. But Mr. Kirk said that his departure would not impede progress toward a deal.
Mr. Kirk and others say the biggest benefits of a trade pact would come from eliminating regulatory barriers. For example, while both the United States and Europe have strict requirements on auto safety and emissions, the rules are different.
Harmonizing the regulations would free carmakers like Audi from having to make costly changes in headlights, exhaust systems and other components in order to export them to the United States.
Synchronizing regulations is much more complicated than eliminating tariffs. But, Mr. Kirk said, ''These are all problems that are solvable.''
Some trade experts argue that even bigger benefits could come simply from streamlining official procedures involved when goods move across borders. The longer a product sits on a dock waiting for customs clearance, the greater the cost to companies and consumers.
A study by the World Bank and the consulting firm Bain & Co., published at the World Economic Forum last week, estimated that trade could increase by 15 percent if goods moved across borders more efficiently. Such changes also raise fewer political issues.
''We're talking about removing waste,'' Mark Gottfredson, a partner at Bain, said in Davos. ''Everybody can agree on that.''

HEADLINE: Debate at the Fed on When To Slow Its Asset Buying

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has left little doubt about its plans for the next few months, and thus little mystery about the statement it will release Wednesday after the latest meeting of its policy-making committee. The economy remains weak. The Fed will keep buying bonds to hold down borrowing costs.
Inside the central bank, however, debate is once again shifting from whether the Fed should do more to stimulate the economy to when it should start doing less. 
Proponents of strong action to reduce unemployment won a series of victories last year, culminating in December when the Fed announced that it would hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent. The rate was 7.8 percent in December.
To accelerate that process, the Fed also said it would increase its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion each month until it sees clear signs of strength in the job market.
The Fed is expected to affirm both policies on Wednesday. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said this month that the persistence of high unemployment ''motivates and justifies'' the efforts.
The looming question is how much longer the asset purchases will continue.
The officials who led the push for stronger action have turned to defending the need to continue asset purchases for as long as possible, while those who opposed the policy are pressing for an early end date.
Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, was among the most outspoken advocates for asset purchases last year. In a speech earlier this month, he said that the Fed's efforts to suppress interest rates were producing clear benefits, increasing sales of homes and cars.
''I consider it imperative that monetary policy continue to actively support the economy at present, since we continue to have an unacceptably high unemployment rate while, at the same time, inflation is undershooting the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target,'' said Mr. Rosengren, who holds a rotating seat this year on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee.
Critics of the Fed's efforts initially warned that the purchases would reduce the central bank's ability to control inflation. Increasingly, they also have emphasized that the purchases could undermine the stability of financial markets.
Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in a speech this month that the Fed's efforts to push down interest rates were driving up the price of farmland, junk bonds and other risky investments.
Ms. George, who holds a vote on the policy-making committee this year, said that the eventual sale of the Fed's holdings also could disrupt markets.
''Like others, I am concerned about the high rate of unemployment, but I recognize that monetary policy, by contributing to financial imbalances and instability, can just as easily aggravate unemployment as heal it,'' she said.
Many prominent economists outside the Fed continue to argue that the central bank should be acting even more forcefully to stimulate the economy, but that view has gained little traction inside the central bank.
Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is the only official who has publicly endorsed stronger action.
''Monetary policy is currently not accommodative enough,'' Mr. Kocherlakota said, noting that unemployment is too high while the pace of inflation is too low -- below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers healthy.
Mr. Kocherlakota said the Fed should announce its intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent, rather than the 6.5 percent threshold the central bank adopted in December.
The Fed deliberately left the duration of the asset purchase program as an open question, in contrast to the specific interest-rate threshold.
It said only that it wanted to see ''substantial improvement'' in the labor market, though officials have made it clear they also expect to suspend asset purchases well before the unemployment rate reaches the 6.5 percent line.
Mr. Bernanke explained at a December news conference that the Fed wanted to retain greater flexibility because asset purchases are a relatively untested strategy.
''We'll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences,'' he said.
But the discussion already has begun to swing toward informal thresholds.
Mr. Rosengren said last year that the Fed should certainly continue the purchases until the unemployment rate declines at least below 7.25 percent.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and another voting member of the committee this year, wrote this month that ''there is no simple answer to this question'' of when the Fed should stop buying bonds.
Then he provided one, telling CNBC that he expected the unemployment rate to drop to near 7 percent by the end of the year and that it would then be appropriate for the Fed to consider suspending its program of asset purchases.

HEADLINE: Obama Focuses on Status Quo, Not Left, in Battle With G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For all the talk that President Obama has shifted leftward, much of his early second-term energy seeks simply to preserve the status quo.
Mr. Obama's Inaugural Address last week celebrated the role of ''collective action'' in creating conditions for a modern economy, expanding individual opportunity and assisting the poor. He rejected Republican arguments that government benefits create ''a nation of takers.''
That partisan gibe was telling. He defended two programs, Medicare and Medicaid, begun nearly a half-century ago, and a third, Social Security, that dates from the Great Depression. The federal welfare commitments that Mr. Obama praised in observing that ''a great nation must care for the vulnerable'' also date back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's time. 
Yet all those benefits are in the cross-fire of the president's continuing fiscal battle with Republicans in Congress. That is not because of a shift in philosophy by Mr. Obama or his party, but rather because of the looming cost of the retirements of baby boomers and of the persistent ideological boldness of partisan foes.
Mr. Obama expanded the scope of federal obligations during his first term through short-term stimulus programs and the new health care law. Encouraged by his second popular-vote majority in November and hardened by his confrontations with Republicans over the past two years, he has taken a feistier stance toward his adversaries.
None of the president's economic initiatives, however, represent a departure for Mr. Obama himself, or for his party. If President Bill Clinton set out to build a ''bridge to the 21st century,'' said Simon Rosenberg, the president and founder of the New Democrat Network, Mr. Obama is walking across it.
John D. Podesta, an Obama adviser who served as chief of staff in the Clinton White House, called the president's second-term economic agenda ''consistent with where he's been, consistent with where Clinton was.''
Indeed, since World War II both parties have accepted a substantial measure of federal activism ''as American as apple pie,'' said Kenneth Baer, a former Obama budget aide.
Mr. Obama's problem is that postwar America could afford more pie than a post-baby-boomer America will be able to. And in the era of the Tea Party, Republicans have proved increasingly willing to challenge once-settled assumptions about Washington's role.
In another political moment, Mr. Obama's attempt to preserve old governing assumptions might be labeled conservative. But Republicans, even after shifting tactics in the wake of a bracing November defeat, say he will have to fight nonstop to advance his agenda.
''His entire second term on fiscal issues is going to be essentially defensive,'' said Representative Tom Cole, a veteran Republican from Oklahoma. ''He's trying to defend not just the New Deal legacy, but also Obamacare.''
Mr. Cole added, ''The problem he has is, those programs can't be defended in their current forms.''
But Republicans also have not made their case for the ''structural reforms'' that they say have been made urgent by trillion-dollar deficits. In fact, they have failed to do so repeatedly.
In the 1990s, Speaker Newt Gingrich's attempt to rein in Medicare and Medicaid spending helped Mr. Clinton win a second term. President George W. Bush, after adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, could not persuade a Republican Congress to pass his plan for a partial privatization of Social Security.
In last year's campaign, the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, backed a plan to overhaul Medicare through spending limits on each beneficiary. But their plan pushed such savings 10 years into the future, while they attacked Mr. Obama for having cut Medicare spending to help finance the health care law.
When it comes to Republicans pushing for structural changes in benefit programs, ''the record there is not good,'' said Peter Wehner, a former Bush White House aide. And the Republican argument will not soon get easier to make.
Mr. Obama acknowledges the need for some cuts in entitlement spending, but he campaigned successfully on higher taxes for affluent Americans as an alternative to the deep cuts that Republicans want. By refusing to negotiate this month over raising the nation's borrowing limit, Mr. Obama forced Republican leaders to set that cudgel aside without accepting the spending cuts they previously insisted on.
To swing rank-and-file Republicans behind that capitulation, House leaders promised that Mr. Ryan's new budget plan this spring would eliminate the budget deficit within 10 years. Doing so, however, will almost certainly require limiting Medicare spending much sooner than 10 years from now -- a step that Mr. Wehner said ''I'm not sure I'd recommend,'' because it could bring more political pain.
Yet fiscal pressure on the White House will not let up even if Mr. Obama marshals public opinion against that budget. Absent a negotiated deal to reduce spending, Mr. Cole said, Republicans say they will let $1 trillion in 10-year across-the-board budget cuts take effect under the ''sequestration'' provision both parties agreed to in 2011. That would squeeze defense and domestic government functions alike.
A deal remains possible. In earlier, unsuccessful talks with Republicans, Mr. Obama embraced what Mr. Podesta calls ''sensible reforms'' to major entitlement programs, including reduced spending for affluent beneficiaries and more modest inflation adjustments.
Not even liberal advocates hold out much hope for new expansions in the government's economic role, or crackdowns on the United States' trading partners, or stimulus spending to reduce unemployment -- notwithstanding Mr. Obama's second-inaugural swagger.
Upon hearing Mr. Obama's address, ''I was troubled by the assumption that the economy's in recovery, when for most Americans the recovery hasn't started,'' said Robert L. Borosage, a co-director of the liberal Campaign for America's Future.
''He spoke to the progressive coalition,'' Mr. Borosage added. But in some ways, he said, the speech ''sounded like it came from the Clinton years.''

HEADLINE: Beneath the Calm, SAC Works to Contain Fallout From an Inquiry

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
At last month's Hurricane Sandy benefit concert, Steven A. Cohen sat near the Madison Square Garden stage, grooving to performances by Bon Jovi and Billy Joel.
Last week, he flew a private jet to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, rubbing shoulders with world leaders and Fortune 500 chieftains. And on Monday, he will show up at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., for one of the year's biggest hedge fund conferences and, if he can squeeze it in, a round of golf.
For a man who has emerged as the Justice Department's great white whale in its insider trading investigation - a Wall Street version of Captain Ahab pursuing Moby-Dick - Mr. Cohen, the billionaire owner of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, does not appear concerned.
But inside the offices of SAC's Stamford, Conn., headquarters, and at Midtown Manhattan law firms, Mr. Cohen's employees and lawyers are working hard to contain the fallout from the investigation. 
His executives have offered financial incentives to Mr. Cohen's staff members to stay with SAC. Marketing officers are trying to persuade investors to keep their money at the fund. And defense lawyers are working furiously to persuade federal securities regulators not to file a civil fraud lawsuit against the firm.
"This has always been a stressful place to work," said an SAC employee who requested anonymity because he was unauthorized to speak publicly about the fund. "Now it's just more stressful."
Neither SAC nor Mr. Cohen has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The main question now looming over the firm is whether its clients will stand by the fund, or its legal and regulatory problems will cause investors to head for the exits. Under the firm's rules, SAC clients have until Feb. 15 to ask for their money back, and then cannot make another so-called redemption request for another three months.
Mr. Cohen's fund was dealt a blow last week when a Citigroup unit that manages money for wealthy families disclosed that it was withdrawing its $187 million investment. The move by the bank was the most prominent client departure since November, when the multiyear investigation into SAC's trading practices entered a more serious phase.
Citigroup's withdrawal represents a tiny percentage of SAC's $14 billion in assets under management. The fund has said it expects total investor redemptions for the first quarter of up to $1 billion, a number that an SAC spokesman has said will not adversely affect its business.
SAC is largely insulated from the potentially devastating effects that client defections can have on a hedge fund in part because of Mr. Cohen's extraordinary wealth. Unlike other hedge fund managers who rely almost entirely on outside investors, Mr. Cohen has the comfort of knowing that about $8 billion of SAC's fund belongs to him and his employees.
Still, the Citigroup decision stung, say people close to SAC's business, because of the longstanding and lucrative relationship between the bank and the fund. Another concern, said these people, is that the move could influence other large SAC investors currently weighing whether to keep their money at the fund.
For Citigroup, its withdrawal of money from SAC carries substantial business risk. The bank has a vast relationship with SAC, earning revenue by providing the fund with financing and trading services.
SAC could exact retribution on Citigroup by terminating, or at least scaling back, its broader relationship with the bank. An SAC spokesman declined to comment.
Citigroup's move came two months after federal authorities arrested Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager, in what they described as the most lucrative insider trading case ever uncovered. The Martoma indictment represented the first time that the government had brought charges stemming from a trade in which Mr. Cohen had been involved. The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned Mr. Cohen that it might file a civil fraud action against SAC related to the case.
In addition to Mr. Martoma, at least seven former SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the fund. Three have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.
Citigroup issued a statement that its decision "should not be construed as a statement on the merits of any outstanding legal proceedings or potential regulatory action." But the bank specifically cited the Martoma case, explaining that "in the event these legal and regulatory matters are resolved favorably for Mr. Martoma and SAC, Citi Private Bank expects to reconsider admission of SAC's funds to its hedge fund platform."
Mr. Martoma has pleaded not guilty and rejected requests by federal agents to cooperate against his former boss. Mr. Cohen has told his employees and clients that he is confident that he has acted appropriately at all times.
Yet the heightened government scrutiny has caused skittishness among SAC's top ranks, forcing the fund to lavish even richer financial incentives on a group of employees that is already among the most highly compensated in the hedge fund industry.
This month, SAC told its stable of portfolio managers that it would increase year-end bonuses by three percentage points. SAC portfolio managers - the fund's most senior traders, given the authority to make their own investment decisions and also feed Mr. Cohen their best ideas - are paid, on average, 20 percent of the profits they generate for the fund.
"The program is intended to retain our most valuable resource, our investment professionals," said Jonathan Gasthalter, the SAC spokesman.
Another valuable resource is SAC's outside investors, which account for about $6 billion, or 40 percent, of the fund's assets. That money accounts for hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, which SAC uses to finance one of the world's largest and most sophisticated hedge fund operations, with more than 1,000 employees and 125 teams of traders and analysts. Its operation is also one of the most successful, posting average annualized returns of about 30 percent since 1992.
Those results have in the past kept SAC's customers satisfied, but the government scrutiny has made many of them uneasy. The firm's marketing team has reached out to the fund's investors to address their concerns and reassure them that the insider trading inquiry will not affect its performance.
Despite those efforts, several investors in addition to Citigroup, including Titan Advisors and a unit of Société Générale, have notified SAC that they are withdrawing money. Other clients, like Chapwood Investments and SkyBridge Capital, have said they will continue to invest with the fund.
SAC executives continued the charm offensive with major clients on Sunday, holding an annual golf outing in Palm Beach on the eve of a hedge fund conference at the Breakers sponsored by Morgan Stanley. The conference - a matchmaking event that connects top managers with the world's richest investors - is considered an important stop on the hedge fund money-raising circuit.
Since Morgan Stanley does not invite the news media to its conference, there is not expected to be the same paparazzi-like reports on Mr. Cohen that emerged last week from Davos. Bloomberg News filed a dispatch that Mr. Cohen sat in on a panel discussion on data security called "The Digital Infrastructure Context." And Henry Blodget, the editor of the financial Web site Business Insider, wrote a Twitter post on a sighting of Mr. Cohen.
"Steve Cohen was hanging in Davos lounge yesterday," he wrote. "Didn't look worried."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe's Big Bet on EVs and Hybrids

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: While electric vehicle charging stations are clearly the most ambitious part of the plan, the eight-billion-euro Clean Power for Transport Package includes standards for developing hydrogen, biofuel and other natural gas networks. 

 BODY:
If you build it, they will come.
That's the bet behind an ambitious plan to boost the number of electric vehicles and hybrids plying European roads by making electric charging stations nearly as common as gas stations.
The European Union wants to build a half million charging stations by 2020.
''We can finally stop the chicken and the egg discussion on whether infrastructure needs to be there before the large scale roll out of electric vehicles. With our proposed binding targets for charging points using a common plug, electric vehicles are set to hit the road in Europe," the European commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard told the press on Thursday. 
While electric vehicle charging stations are clearly the most ambitious part of the plan, the eight-billion-euro "Clean Power for Transport Package" also includes standards for developing hydrogen, biofuel and other natural gas networks.
"Developing innovative and alternative fuels is an obvious way to make Europe's economy more resource efficient, to reduce our overdependence on oil and develop a transport industry which is ready to respond to the demands of the 21st century," said European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas.
Four of the European countries with the most ambitious plug-in technology programs - Germany, France, Spain and Britain - have individual national plans that aim to have more than seven million electric cars on their roads by 2020. (Earlier this month Rendezvous reported on a market study that predicted that "natural growth" would mean there will be 7.8 million plug-in cars on the road globally by 2020).
Currently, plug-in vehicles make up a fraction of Europe's estimated 250 million cars. In 2011, for example, only 1,858 pure electric vehicles were bought in Germany, 1,796 in France, 1,547 in Norway and 1,170 in Britain, according to E.U. figures. However, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids could make up as much as 2 - 8 percent of the total by 2025.
But a lot needs to happen in the next seven years.
For example, Germany had less than 2,000 publicly accessible electric charging stations in 2011, according to E.U. figures. By the end of the decade, the country would have to install another 148,000 public points to reach its target. By way of comparison, the whole country only has roughly 14,300 gas stations (most of which, of course, have multiple pumps).
In the United States, the global leader in the adoption of plug-in technology, there are currently about 5,300 publicly available charging stations, according to a government database.
Even E.U. member states that have virtually no public charging points available will open up to the network. For example, by 2020, the island state of Malta will have 1,000 charging points, according to the plan.
The plan would not only ensure Continental coverage for plug-in vehicles, it would introduce the "Type 2" plug as the standard system in Europe.
Currently, competing systems dominate in neighboring member states. Such infrastructure incompatibility makes it difficult to drive an electric car from Paris to Berlin, relying on public charging points.
But not everyone agrees with Ms. Hedegaard that providing recharging stations is the best way to bring electric vehicles to European roads.
"My basic concern is that the main barrier to electric vehicles isn't recharging points, it's the vehicle price. While having more public charging points will certainly help, it's not in itself going to reduce the vehicle cost," said Ben Lane, of sustainable transport solutions, a U.K.-based electric vehicle consultancy that also runs the Next Green Car Web site.
Noting that a vast majority of electric car or plug-in hybrid drivers avail themselves of private charging points, either at home or at work, Mr. Lane suggested that the funds would be more effectively spent by subsidizing the high cost of purchasing electric cars.
"Registration incentives for electric vehicles, such as currently operate in France, is one of the most effective ways to shift the market from conventional to electric drive trains," he said in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: The Rockaway Spirit Lives After Hurricane Sandy

BYLINE: JANE GARFIELD FRANK


HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: Viewing the devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy, a resident of the Rockaways took comfort in a group of surfers. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
A mild November day, five weeks after Hurricane Sandy. I walk the shoreline in Rockaway Beach as I do several times a week, every season of the year. 
My walk does not feel as therapeutic or serene as it usually does. How could it? The storm's devastation is inescapable. If I glance toward where the beach walls once stood, I see rubble. The once stately homes along the beach now hang like cardboard boxes. 
I feel a terrible sadness, and so I will myself to look only at the ocean, to concentrate on the rhythmic beauty of the waves - and how in spite of everything it still feels like my old, dear friend.
And then I see them. Three heads bobbing, three wetsuits, on three surfboards - surfers catching waves in the near distance. In that moment I know that NOTHING can destroy the "Rockaway spirit," and that this community of gritty, unpretentious ocean-lovers will rebuild, renew and be more beautiful than ever.

HEADLINE: When Corruption Helps the Bottom Line

BYLINE: MICHAEL S. PAGANO


HIGHLIGHT: A recent study found that the most corrupt countries like Venezuela are actually better for investors than moderately corrupt countries like Morocco or Mexico. 

 BODY:
 Michael S. Pagano is the Robert J. and Mary Ellen Darretta Endowed Chair in Finance at the Villanova School of Business. 
Most investors would agree that less corruption and more transparency in financial markets are good things. But in a contrarian way, a high degree of corruption in foreign markets can actually be beneficial. And that may provide an interesting counterargument to recent enforcement actions.
The fact that large-scale corruption exists is not in dispute; in many foreign markets it is clearly "caveat emptor." Actions by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States are making front-page headlines almost on a weekly basis in recent years. 
The Justice Department and the S.E.C. recently released guidance on the corrupt practices act, a law that has become problematic for many global companies. And many other countries around the world are also following suit with newly empowered regulatory agencies. In April 2011, Britain passed the Bribery Act, a major compliance regulation, to go after corruption. 
Under this backdrop, Professors Pankaj K. Jain of the University of Memphis, Emre Kuvvet of Texas A&M and I set out to analyze just what effects corruption had on investment, cost of capital and market liquidity for institutional investors. We examined corruption and its effect on financial markets at the national level using data from 49 countries. 
Our finding that investing conditions are extremely favorable in Denmark, one of the most transparent countries, makes logical sense. 
What is surprising is that the most corrupt countries like Venezuela (which is at the very bottom of our list at No. 49) are actually better for investors than moderately corrupt countries like Morocco or Mexico. 
This finding points to a "perverse level playing field" where potential investors in these extremely corrupt countries know who is in charge and can thereby succeed and prosper. But in moderately corrupt countries, it is unclear who is in charge and how to play the game. 
Corruption is a result of several factors, including the increased pressure on investors and companies to compete for lucrative international business opportunities. As noted in a 2011 working paper, the benefits obtained by bribing officials or engaging in corrupt behavior can be quite tempting; it is estimated that the average return is 10 to 11 times the original bribe amount for 166 prominent cases in 20 countries.
We used several tools to help us quantify some of the effects of corruption on stock prices. Some of those included the corruption perceptions index data from Transparency International; data from Ancerno that gives company transaction costs for foreign stocks traded by more than 700 institutions in the home markets of 49 countries; and I.M.F. data on foreign portfolio investment flows in all 49 countries.
Based on these data, it was clear that corruption in the 49 countries that were studied directly affected their financial markets. Corruption directly affected stock liquidity (making it hard to quickly buy or sell a particular stock or bond), the cost of buying and selling stocks and the trading costs of stocks. 
Corruption also affects the amount of foreign investment in a country as a percentage of gross domestic product, and the cost of financing corporate operations within a certain country. We discovered that, on average, corruption can reduce foreign equity investments by 70 percent, raise trading costs by 0.8 percentage points (that is, 80 basis points) and increase the cost of capital by up to 8.63 percentage points. 
The presence of corruption also makes it hard for outsiders to value a security properly. Higher levels of corruption typically lead to greater investor uncertainty -- and a wider gulf between what insiders and outsiders know about the value of a market's stocks and bonds.
An answer to the problem, however, may lie in investing in education rather than in regulation. Our study also found that corruption was inversely related to the level of education in a country. So, more education typically relates to less corruption, and a country that wants to reduce corruption over the long run should promote and invest in education.
In the meantime, what is an investor to do? Because of the "perverse level playing field" that makes moderately corrupt countries unattractive, large investors looking at foreign markets might prefer to invest in the most corrupt nations (as well as the most transparent). 
There are corporate costs to engaging in corruption, however. Our study also examined 27 publicly traded companies that ran afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including I.B.M., Chevron and Siemens. 
We discovered that after each company was fined, its average trading costs and cost of capital were higher. These higher costs translate into a lower stock price for those firms that have been penalized under anticorruption laws. 
So should investors ask for more regulatory enforcement of corrupt foreign exchanges? Of course, but the incentives for doing what is morally right and for what actually might make a profit may not be so clearly aligned. 
Maybe government's role in promoting education might be another, more effective way to realign these incentives so that the world can be more transparent and less corrupt in the long run.

 The Big Story: Four More Years 
At his inauguration, President Obama delivers a rallying cry for active government. Rick Newman says the president has given a gift to the stock market. This blogger believes that the speech made things a lot more certain for small businesses. Here's the whole speech in just three minutes. These are 22 of the most fabulous Beyoncé moments from the inauguration (and one that's not-so-fabulous). The president's daughters seemed to enjoy the day, too.
 Finance: Bank of America Hires 1,000 Bankers 
Investment professionals are anticipating an influx of income and growth-hungry mom-and-pop "retail" investors.

Existing home sales shrank, but Bill McBride says it's a solid report. Manufacturing activity contracts again in Richmond and in Kansas City (pdf). Blockbuster plans to close 300 stores. A quarterly survey finds that small-business confidence continues to hold steady but a Chamber of Commerce survey finds 53 percent of small businesses have not hired in the past year and 64 percent plan to keep the same number of employees in 2013. The International Monetary Fund thinks the United States economy is slowing down.

 The Week's Bests 
Freshdesk's marketing and communications manager, Sairam Krishnan, explains how his company finds and keeps customer service representatives: "Test their culture fit. Every company has a slightly different way of doing business. At Freshdesk, we frown upon bureaucracy and hierarchy. We put our customer service candidates in situations where they have to interact with a few senior employees of the company. These interactions, usually spontaneous and casual, help the team evaluate the candidate's personality and fit with our customer service-centered culture."
Megan Totka shares tips for building a socially conscious business: "Set an example. While it is great to encourage employees to volunteer, and even provide incentives, the best way to get everyone in your company fired up for service is by getting out there and participating yourself. Do more than simply embrace the idea of service; make the service happen."

HEADLINE: Immigration and Republican Self-Interest

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why immigration reform will almost certainly hurt the G.O.P. politically. 

 BODY:
Here is Ezra Klein, explaining why Republican are suddenly looking more, shall we say, transigent on immigration than they've been on taxes:
By and large, Washington isn't gripped by fever. It's gripped by actual disagreements and mismatched incentives. Republicans really do disagree with Obama on taxes. And most Republican senators and representatives really do come from increasingly conservative districts that didn't vote for Obama. When you stack substantive disagreement atop a strategic incentive to disagree, you get Washington in 2012.
But - and this is key - Republicans weren't behaving irrationally. They were behaving rationally. And that's exactly why they might cut a deal on immigration even as they fight Obama on taxes. 
Two numbers explain why a rational Republican Party needs to do something dramatic on immigration: 27 percent and 2 percent.
Twenty-seven percent is the percentage of the Latino vote Mitt Romney received in 2012, according to the Fox News exit poll. Two percent is the projected increase in the non-white electorate come 2016. So Republicans are losing badly among Hispanic voters and Hispanic voters are becoming an increasingly important part of the electorate.
I actually think Klein has this backward. Yes, the individual incentives of some Republican legislators - especially those who represent safe-as-houses districts and fear primary challengers more than Democrats - cut against making any kind of deal with President Obama on taxes. But the national party's interests pretty plainly cut the other way: Given how badly Republicans have been hurt by the perception that they stands for economic royalism and the interests of the 1 percent, there was no sound political reason to make tax cuts for high earners a hill the party was willing to die on, and every reason to cut a deal on the Bush tax rates like the one that was ultimately cut and then move on to other issues.
On immigration, though, the national party's political self-interest isn't necessarily served by compromise at all. It's true that passing some kind of comprehensive immigration reform might improve Klein's first number on the margins. Not by as much as some G.O.P. optimists would like to imagine, I suspect, since relatively few Hispanics are single-issue immigration voters, and absent a broader shift in economic policy the ceiling on Hispanic support for the current Republican Party is probably harder than many conservatives believe. (Plus, it isn't clear how much credit Republicans would get it in any case for a reform that would be signed and trumpeted by President Obama.) But let's concede, for the sake of argument, that just taking the immigration issue off the table for a cycle or so could be helpful to Republican minority outreach, and boost the next G.O.P. nominee's share of the Hispanic vote back into the 30s.
The problem comes in with Klein's second number. That 2 percent per cycle increase in the non-white share of the electorate isn't a static figure: By definition, creating a path to citizenship turns illegal aliens into potential voters, and any serious analysis of Hispanic opinion tells you that those new voters' interests and beliefs will tend to align with the Democratic Party. No, not necessarily forever, but across the next few decades of American politics there is simply no plausible case that gratitude to Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake will convert a liberal-leaning voting bloc into a true swing constituency, let alone a Republican-tilting demographic. Which makes it very, very easy to imagine a future where immigration reform helps Republicans win a slightly higher percentage of the Hispanic vote, but costs them many more votes in absolute terms by accelerating the ongoing demographic shifts in the electorate. (And that's without getting into the incentives that such a deal would create for future migration, or its disillusioning impact on the working class white voters the G.O.P. still can't win without ...)
Presumably these costs would be reduced if the reform's path to citizenship were long and arduous enough, with more waiting and more hurdles than a straightforward amnesty. But then the immediate political benefits to Republicans become much more uncertain as well, since they would still be playing the "bad cop" role in a policy debate that would no doubt extend for many years after the initial bill were passed. (The ads write themselves: "Republican candidate X says that he supports immigration reform, but he's voted again and again to keep hardworking immigrants in legal limbo, deny their children benefits, etc. ...")
None of the foregoing is meant to answer the question of whether the proposed reform package would be good for the country. And clearly, while the current rush to reform has been driven by electoral anxieties, many of the Republican-leaning groups who back legalization do so out of genuine principle rather than expedience - whether they're religious conservatives who believe that it's a moral and humanitarian imperative, or the free-marketeers who are convinced that the economic benefits of mass low-skilled immigration outweigh the costs.
One can respect those beliefs while disagreeing with them. But there's much less to respect in the self-interested, self-consciously strategic case for why Republicans need to support a comprehensive immigration reform, because that case doesn't really exist.

HEADLINE: Labor Sees Bright Spots in Membership Trends

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Union ranks are down over all, but they have risen in California, and among Latinos and Asian-Americans. 

 BODY:
The American labor movement received some bitter news last week when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its annual report on union membership - it showed a 398,000 overall decline in union membership, with the percentage of workers in unions dropping to 11.3 percent, the lowest rate in nearly a century. 
 But some union leaders saw some important silver linings in the gloomy report - especially the surprisingly strong growth in labor's ranks in California. The bureau reported a jump of 110,000 in the number of union members in California, to 2.49 million (meaning that in the 49 other states, the overall loss was 508,000 members). 
"There is a significant organizing consciousness among unions in California that I haven't seen in other parts of the country," said Kent Wong, director of the Labor Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. "And a major factor in California's success is there has been a very aggressive attempt on the part of many unions to organizing immigrant workers."
 The jump in union membership in California is tied to the one other bright spot for unions in the bureau's report. While union membership among whites fell by 547,000 last year (to 11.3 million), union membership among Latinos jumped by 156,000 last year (to 1.98 million) while increasing for Asian-Americans by 45,000 (to 668,000) -- although the percentage of Asian-American workers in unions actually dropped, to 9.6 percent, as the overall number of Asian-Americans employed jumped sharply.
 In California, there are vigorous campaigns to unionize car-wash workers, recycling workers and the truck drivers who transport freight to and from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. And in recent years, labor unions have organized about 200,000 home care aides in California. 
Immigrants account for a high percentage of workers in those groups. 
"The Latino population is growing in California," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, the federation of the state's unions. "Latinos and other immigrants are more prone to join unions. A lot of Latinos developed a historic sense of economic and social justice in their home countries."
Mr. Pulaski said a big reason that unions in California are doing better than those in other states is that California's unions have built impressive political power, helping the Democrats clinch a two-thirds supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. Thanks to their political power, California unions have, for instance, persuaded lawmakers in much of the state to make it easy for unions to organize the 200,000 home care aides.
And Mr. Pulaski said the organizing victories and progressive politics in California create a hospitable hothouse atmosphere for organizing, encouraging other workers to unionize.
Professor Wong said, "The unionization victories at four car washes in Los Angeles have gotten a lot of attention among Latinos. They have really resonated."
(Union membership did rise in a handful of other states, but more modestly than in California. Those states included Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas.) 
All this is far different from what has happened in the Midwest over the last two years. Republicans in Wisconsin enacted a far-reaching law that curbed the collective bargaining rights of most of the government employees in that state - making many government workers conclude that there was little reason to remain in their union. Ohio Republicans enacted a similar law in 2011, but Ohioans repealed that anti-union law in a referendum in November of that year.
Indiana's Republican-dominated legislature enacted a "right to work" law last February that is likely to reduce union membership, and in Michigan, the Republican-dominated legislature and the Republican governor also enacted a "right to work" law last month. "Right to work" laws bar any requirement that workers at a unionized workplace pay any dues or fees to the union. Such laws often encourage workers to quit their unions, because by quitting they no longer have to pay union dues or fees.
Barry T. Hirsch, a labor economist at Georgia State University, said the anti-labor offensive in the Midwest had taken a heavy toll on union membership there. In just five Midwestern states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin - union membership fell by 252,000 last year, according to the bureau's report. 
Professor Hirsch suggested that the reported drop-off in union members in the Midwest might be exaggerated because when questioners doing the household survey that was crucial to last week's report went to workers' homes to interview them, some union members might have grown reluctant to acknowledge to the questioners that they belonged to a union because unions had taken such a public relations beating from government officials. 
But Professor Wong of U.C.L.A. said he doubted that any union members questioned in the household survey would be too scared to acknowledge belonging to a union.
Mr. Pulaski, head of the California Labor Federation, foresees more unionization gains in California this year - including among port truck drivers and car washes and from the continued efforts by two of the nation's most aggressive organizing unions, the Service Employees International Union and the California Nurses Association. 
 "I think we're on the cutting edge of what unions are doing in the United States," Mr. Pulaski said. In other words, he says, California unions have put together a silver linings playbook that unions in other states can learn from.

HEADLINE: A Solar-Powered Shed for India's Perishable Food

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: While the unit is too costly for the vast majority of India's farmers, designers hope one day to make it available to the poorest of the poor. 

 BODY:
Milk? Garbage. Spinach? Garbage. Leftover Thai takeout? Garbage. For millions in the Northeast, clearing out the fridge after days without power was just one more unsavory chore that was part of the cleanup process after Hurricane Sandy passed through. 
But in the developing world, throwing out food because of inadequate refrigeration isn't just annoying, it's a devastating and irreparable economic blow that keeps farmers trapped at the level of subsistence and threatens food security. In India, the government estimates that anywhere from 30 to 40 percent of food spoils long before it finds its way to the table. 
Such waste is endemic because so few farmers have access to electricity. Even in Tamil Nadu, one of the most industrialized states in the country and sometimes referred to as India's California, only 40 percent of the population has electricity. Without power, tomatoes and okra stand no chance in 104-degree weather. 
To address the problem, business students and engineers from the University of Cincinnati have teamed with local Ohio companies to create a small solar-powered refrigerated shed for storing food. The SolerCool container runs on just eight solar panels and keeps produce at a comfortably cool temperature, even at night, thanks to a battery that charges during the day.

Mohsen Rezayat, chief solutions architect at Siemens PLM and an adjunct professor in the University of Cincinnati's engineering school, helped bring all the technology for the shed together. One of its more unusual components is the compressor. 
"Compressors, which generate the cold air for refrigeration, are huge energy hogs," Dr. Rezayat noted. But the team found a company that had created a small portable one that could be run on the power from just a few solar panels. 
The unit was designed so that vending machines wouldn't have to be hauled out for repair, he said. "When something went wrong with the cooling system, a new one could just be popped in like a fresh ink cartridge," Dr. Rezayat explained. "Turns out, what's good for vending machines at universities in Ohio is good for cabbages on farms in India. "
For now, the cold shed costs about $5,000, a price that the Ohio team knows is well beyond the reach of most small farmers. 
"At the moment the price means that several farms would have to pool resources and share one unit," Dr. Reyazat said. "We are very price-conscious and are looking at ways to bring the price down to really help the poorest of the poor increase their earning potential." One possibility is to manufacture some smaller units for farmers with just a few acres. 
In the meantime, a field prototype is on its way to an aloe farm near Pune, India, to see if it performs as well in that climate as it does in Ohio.

HEADLINE: Davos Needs Parents of Both Sexes

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: The world economic summit would be a different conference if half the attendees were women, and all attendees had a different view of what creates and supports an economically viable family life. 

 BODY:
Reporting from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Nicholas Kristof describes a "sea of men." In "She's (Rarely) the Boss,"he writes that female participation at the "annual conclave of the presumed powerful" is 17 percent. No word on how many of those 17 percent are mothers of young children, or how many of the 83 percent of male attendees are fathers who made sure to arrange for suitable child care before they came. 
Why so few women? Mr. Kristof offers Sheryl Sandberg's "provocative" general answer to the question of why women are underrepresented in positions of power from her forthcoming book, "Lean In": 
"We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in. We internalize the negative messages we get throughout our lives, the messages that say it's wrong to be outspoken, aggressive, more powerful than men. We lower our own expectations of what we can achieve. We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care. We compromise our career goals to make room for partners and children who may not even exist yet." 
There is something real and important in what she says, Mr. Kristof argues, citing his experiences of men asking questions more readily, along with a McKinsey survey (36 percent of male employees at major companies aspired to be top executives, compared with 18 percent of the women) and a study of Carnegie Mellon M.B.A. graduates in 2003 (57 percent of the men, but only 7 percent of the women, tried to negotiate a higher initial salary offer). 
Neither Ms. Sandberg nor Mr. Kristof blames women for the numeric effect of their many failures and compromises, and both give significant weight to history, nature, social mores and the fact that, as Mr. Kristof puts it, "the modern job was built for the distracted father." But there is so much more to the story of why women are underrepresented in Davos, in boardrooms and in corporate executive roles. 
In a complex, forthcoming study from the researchers Serena Chen at the University of California, Berkeley and Melissa Williams of Emory University, women who were asked to imagine a life in which they made most of the household decisions for a family consisting of a small child and a spouse showed less interest in achieving power in the workplace than women who imagined sharing those household decisions with a spouse, whereas men asked to imagine the same situations showed no change in their workplace ambitions. 
A (male) writer, considering this data, produced a piece for The Huffington Post with the headline "Working Moms Study: Household Managers Found to Have Less Ambition at Work" (The short line in the link? "working-moms-less-likely-leaders").
The researchers theorized that women were more likely to value household power, and therefore to feel less hypothetically in need of workplace power (unlike The Huffington Post writer, I find it hard to extrapolate from the imagined desires of research subjects to the real world), but the result was still yet another negative headline about women in the workplace.
This research seems to support Ms. Sandberg's argument: even women imagining managing a household with a child "lean back." But we have to consider the extent to which that household (even the hypothetical household) pushes mothers back. 
From birth to age 5 or 6, that single child will need someone present to care for her during every one of her waking and sleeping hours. That care has to be provided by a parent or paid for (and the parent who works at home caring for his or her child is "paying" for child care in lost earnings elsewhere). Only when she's old enough for public school does society support - in the purely economic sense - the idea that both of that child's parents could work outside the home, and then one parent is expected (again, in the economic sense of a publicly provided alternative to the child being at home with the parent) to be present after 3 p.m.
Those are cold, hard economic facts (and please understand that they aren't meant to reflect the very real emotional pleasures and even economic gains of having children). Men, who are accustomed to having women deal most fully with the consequences of that unavoidable requirement, may be more able to see it as less limiting. The fact that the men in the above hypothetical study weren't daunted by the proposition of being wholly responsible for arranging that care may show an admirable level of ambition, but it may also show a poor grasp of reality. 
The most salient line in Ms. Sandberg's words was this one: "We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care." We - as in, we women - do, and that makes it difficult. But do we women continue to do the majority of the housework and child care because we want to? Because we have to? Because we're expected to?
I'm not even sure we know the answer to that question. Regardless, until that greater household burden on women changes, the number of mothers in Davos won't change. Two things could help: more fathers taking on real equal roles in child-rearing, and more structural support, not for women, but for families. Families who need paid sick leave. Families who need paternity and maternity leave. Families who need access to affordable, high-quality day care, and to birth control, and to preventative health care. (And unless you sprang from the brow of Zeus fully formed, those issues affect those without children as well.)
All of those are economic issues, and they certainly have an economic impact, in different ways, in different societies, worldwide. Lifting families from poverty requires all of those things. So they'll probably be at least touched on in Davos. But will they be discussed in the same way as if 50 percent of the attendees were women, and if the other 50 percent were men who had always had, and expected to have, a gender-neutral equal role in family life?
No.

HEADLINE: Dodgers, Signing Lucrative TV Deal, Plan to Start Regional Sports Network

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: The baseball team said it would start its own sports network, called SportsNetLA, in a deal with Time Warner Cable that is worth $7 billion to $8 billion. 

 BODY:
The owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers said Monday that they intended to start a regional sports network in southern California, confirming weeks of reports about the team's plans.
The network, to be named SportsNet LA, will be backed by Time Warner Cable, one of the main television distributors in the region, with a commitment of $7 billion to $8 billion over the next 25 years. The price tag, though not made public by the parties, was confirmed by a person with direct knowledge of the deal. Analysts said it was the most lucrative television deal for a single team in sports history.
Time Warner Cable will carry the Dodgers network and will be in charge of convincing others to carry it, as well. In exchange, Time Warner Cable will keep all the advertising revenue that it sells for the network. The Dodgers owners said in a news release on Monday that SportsNet LA would carry all the team's games and "comprehensive behind-the-scenes Dodger programming." 
The multibillion-dollar deal with the Dodgers seemingly flies in the face of Time Warner Cable's public statements about tamping down on the rising costs of programming. SportsNet LA is likely to amount to $4 to $5 a month per subscriber in southern California, and some of that cost will be passed on subscribers through their monthly cable bills, with Time Warner Cable also absorbing some of the cost.
But Time Warner Cable says that doing business directly with the Dodgers cuts out the middleman, in this case Fox Sports, which was also bidding for rights to the Dodgers games. The company said the same thing when it outbid Fox to carry Los Angeles Lakers games in 2011, a 20-year deal valued at $3 billion. 
"This deal, like our Lakers' deal, furthers our efforts to attain greater certainty and control over local and regional sports programming costs," David Rone, the president of Time Warner Cable Sports, said of the Dodgers agreement in a statement.
Fox Sports, owned by the News Corporation, disputes this notion, in part because its bid for the Dodgers was significantly less than Time Warner Cable's bid. Dodgers games will continue to be televised on Fox Sports' Prime Ticket network until the new network starts in 2014.
A group led by Magic Johnson and financed by Guggenheim Partners bought the Dodgers last year in a deal valued at $2.3 billion. "We concluded last year that the best way to give our fans what they want -- more content and more Dodger baseball -- was to launch our own network," Mark Walter, the founder of Guggenheim Partners and the chairman of the Dodgers franchise, said in a statement.
The network will be operated by American Media Productions, a subsidiary of the Dodgers ownership group. "The creation of AMP will provide substantial financial resources over the coming years for the Dodgers to build on their storied legacy and bring a World Championship home to Los Angeles," Mr. Walter said.
The financial terms of the arrangement were not released. The arrangement will require the approval of Major League Baseball.
Assessing the impending deal last week, the Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson said Time Warner Cable should "be careful what they wish for." In a note to investors, he pointed out that the News Corporation is likely to use the high rates for the Lakers and Dodgers channels as negotiating leverage for other regional sports networks. News Corp. recently acquired 49 percent of YES, the Yankees channel in New York, and full ownership of a channel that carries the Cleveland Indians in Ohio. Time Warner Cable is a major distributor in New York and Ohio.
Mr. Nathanson also said, "Clearly, the L.A. sports market is experiencing significant price inflation, and it is still early days whether these levels of investments will prove to be justified many years down the road or if we have reached the top of the sports-rights bubble."

HEADLINE: Former Jefferies Trader Is Charged With Fraud

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal prosecutors charged a former trader from the Jefferies Group with defrauding clients and the government while selling them mortgage-backed securities. 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors charged a former senior trader at the Jefferies Group on Monday with defrauding his clients - and the government - while selling them mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis.
Jesse C. Litvak, the former Jefferies trader, is accused of generating more than $2 million in revenue for Jefferies by overcharging his customers through deceitful conduct. Those who are said to have been his victims include some of the world's largest investment firms, including Soros Fund Management, Magnetar Capital, BlackRock and Wellington Management.
The government was also a victim in this case, prosecutors said, because Mr. Litvak's clients were managing money that was part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, the $700 billion bailout fund. As part of a public-private investment program, the Treasury picked nine private firms to invest in toxic mortgage-backed securities and help remove them from the clogged balance sheets of the large banks. 
While the alleged violations - cheating brokerage clients by misrepresenting the prices of securities - might typically prompt the loss of a job or civil lawsuits, such conduct rarely, if ever, rises to the level of a federal criminal prosecution.
The case demonstrates the aggressive prosecutorial stance of the special inspector general for TARP, or Sigtarp, which led the investigation. The office, now led by Christy Romero, has been responsible for criminal cases filed against 121 individuals.
"Illegally profiting from a federal program designed to assist our nation in recovering from one of our worst economic crises is reprehensible," said David B. Fein, the United States attorney in Connecticut, whose office brought the charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil action in the case.
Federal agents arrested Mr. Litvak, 38, early Monday morning at his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He made an appearance in Federal District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., and was released on $1 million bail. Mr. Litvak, who worked at RBS Greenwich Capital earlier in his career, joined Jefferies in 2008 and was fired in December 2011.
"Jesse Litvak did not cheat anyone out of a dime," said Patrick J. Smith, Mr. Litvak's lawyer at DLA Piper, in a statement. "In fact, most of these trades turned out to be hugely profitable. Jesse looks forward to the trial in this case so that his name can be cleared and he can get on with his career."
While the market for mortgage-backed securities is complex and opaque, the charges against Mr. Litvak are rather simple. Prosecutors said that he deceived his customers about the prices of the securities that he sold to them. The indictment said that Mr. Litvak deployed the scheme in part to increase the size of his year-end bonus.
In some cases, they said, Mr. Litvak would lie about the price at which his firm had bought a security so he could resell it to another customer at a higher price and earn more money for the firm. In other instances, the government said, he created a fake seller to give the impression that he was arranging a trade between two customers, when in fact he was selling the security out of his firm's inventory at a high price.
"The kind of false claims made by Litvak were unfit for a used-car lot, let alone a marketplace for mortgage-backed securities," said George S. Canellos, the S.E.C.'s deputy director of enforcement.
Mr. Smith, the lawyer for Mr. Litvak, said that the trades were transactions between sophisticated market participants and that the profits that Jefferies earned on each trade were well within industry norms for the mortgage-backed securities market.
Mr. Litvak wants Jefferies to pay his legal fees related to the government's investigation, and he has filed papers in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding compensation from the bank. Jefferies has refused to reimburse him, arguing that it fired Mr. Litvak for cause. Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for Jefferies, declined to comment.
The case first showed up on the government's radar after one of Mr. Litvak's customers, AllianceBernstein, complained to Jefferies that the bank had overcharged it for mortgage-backed securities, according to people briefed on the case. According to records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Jefferies settled the case with AllianceBernstein for $2.2 million.
Court papers depict Mr. Litvak as an exuberant salesman, frequently communicating with instant messages and peppering his communications with slang. When Mr. Litvak reported to a client, Wellington Management, about a sham purchase, he wrote "winner winner chicken dinner." Another time, the complaint said, Mr. Litvak gave a false report on the price of a security that he sold to a hedge fund, York Capital Management. "We are doneski gorgeous!" he wrote.

HEADLINE: 'Les Miserables' and Irony

BYLINE: STANLEY FISH


HIGHLIGHT: Why the new film version of 'Les Mis&#233;rables' has so upset the critics. 

 BODY:
I may have missed it, but I don't recall USA Today devoting a full one and three-quarters pages to a movie, never mind a movie that's been out for some time now. But there in the Life section of the Weekend edition was a lengthy discussion of "Les Misérables," or, more precisely, a discussion of the furiously negative responses the musical epic has evoked from a gaggle of critics who simultaneously trash the film and express an incredulity verging on outrage at fellow moviegoers who don't share their view. 
David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, after declaring that the movie is not "just bad," but "dreadful," goes on to report himself "deeply embarrassed because all around me people were sitting rapt, awed, absolutely silent, only to burst into applause after some of the numbers." What embarrasses Denby is the decline in "the taste of my countrymen" in the face of something that is to him so obviously "overbearing, pretentious, madly repetitive"; and he seconds , also a New Yorker reviewer, who dismisses the film as "inflationary bombast." (Something a bit inflationary about that phrase, perhaps.) 
And then there is Matt Walsh, who was dragged to the movie by his wife and found it "a thousand times worse than I could have imagined [v]apid, shallow, self-indulgent and emotionally manipulative." All that crying, you know.

After reading the full versions of these diatribes and a bunch more, I decided that I just had to go see for myself. So I saw the movie twice, last Friday and Saturday. The first time I liked it, the second time I loved it. Part of the reason for my increased enthusiasm was that I could better understand what the director, Tom Hooper, was up to when he employed two techniques every reviewer comments on: (1) the actors do not lip-sync the songs, but perform them "live" (what is and is not real and authentic is always a difficult question) as the camera rolls, and (2) that camera is literally "in your face"; the close-ups are so close up that, as a viewer, you are almost inside the singer's larynx. (not in admiration) in Slate, while many movies "cram ideas and themes down our throats," this one may be the first "to do so while also cramming us down the throats of its actors." 
The key to what is intended by these technical choices was provided for me by Hooper himself when he remarked in an interview (also printed in USA Today) that while "we live in a postmodern age where a certain amount of irony is expected, [t]his film is made without irony." Irony is a stance of distance that pays a compliment to both its producer and consumer. The ironist knows what other, more naïve, observers do not: that surfaces are deceptive, that the real story is not what presents itself, that conventional pieties are sentimental fictions. 
The artist who deploys irony tests the sophistication of his audience and divides it into two parts, those in the know and those who live in a fool's paradise. Irony creates a privileged vantage point from which you can frame and stand aloof from a world you are too savvy to take at face value. Irony is the essence of the critical attitude, of the observer's cool gaze; every reviewer who is not just a bourgeois cheerleader (and no reviewer will admit to being that) is an ironist. 
"Les Misérables" defeats irony by not allowing the distance it requires. If you're looking right down the throats of the characters, there is no space between them and you; their perspective is your perspective; their emotions are your emotions; you can't frame what you are literally inside of. Moreover, the effect - and it is an effect even if its intention is to trade effect for immediacy - is enhanced by the fact that the faces you are pushed up against fill the screen; there is no dimension to the side of them or behind them; it is all very big and very flat, without depth. The camera almost never pulls back, and when it does so, it is only for an instant.
By means of these devices, Hooper manages to create on the screen something like what the Color Field painters (Mark Rothko, Helen Frankenthaler, Barnett Newman, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis) were always striving for: "We are for flat forms because they destroy illusion and reveal truth" (Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb, letter to The New York Times, 1943). In Color Field painting, "figure and ground are one, and the space of the picture, conceived as a field, seems to spread out beyond the edges of the canvas." As a result you are not encouraged to engage in higher-order thoughts about what you are viewing; it's all very elemental; it hits you straight on. Rothko declared that "The fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted by my pictures shows that I communicated basic human emotions." Newman echoed the point: "I present no dogma, no system I work only out of high passion."
Endless high passion and basic human emotions indulged in without respite are what "Les Misérables" offers in its refusal to afford the distance that enables irony. Those who call the movie flat, shallow, sentimental and emotionally manipulative are not wrong; they just fail to see that what appear to them to be bad cinematic choices (in addition to prosaic lyrics that repel aesthetic appreciation, and multiple reprises of simple musical themes) are designed to achieve exactly the result they lament - an almost unbearable proximity to raw, un-ironized experience. They just can't go with it. And why should they? After all, the critic, and especially the critic who perches in high journalistic places, needs to have a space in which he can insert himself and do the explicatory work he offers to a world presumed to be in need of it. "Les Misérables," taken on its own terms, leaves critics with nothing to do except join the rhythms of rapt silence, crying and applause, and it is understandable that they want nothing to do with it.
Understandable but not admirable, if what you desire from criticism is some kind of affirmation. Irony - postmodern or any other - is a brief against affirmation, against the unsophisticated embrace of positive (unqualified) values. No one has seen this more clearly than David Foster Wallace, who complains that irony "serves an exclusively negative function," but is "singularly unuseful when it comes to replace the hypocrisies it debunks" ("E Unibus Pluram," Review of Contemporary Fiction, 1993). Irony, he adds, is "unmeaty"; that is, it has nothing solid inside it and is committed to having nothing inside it. Few artists, Wallace says, "dare to try to talk about ways of redeeming what's wrong, because they'll look sentimental and naïve to all the weary ironists." But perhaps there is hope. "The next real 'rebels' might well emerge as some weird bunch of 'antirebels,' born oglers who dare to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse single-entendre values. Who treat old untrendy human troubles and emotions with reverence and conviction" ("E Pluribus Unam"). Enter "Les Misérables."

HEADLINE: The Uneven Progress of Equal Opportunity

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Lack of accountability has made it harder to chart the progress of equal opportunity in the workplace, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
The central theme of President Obama's inauguration speech was equal opportunity and its refrain, "Our journey is not complete."
He never referred directly to equal opportunity in employment, perhaps because his very election testifies to certain progress since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination on the basis of race and sex. 
But looking at the United States labor force as a whole, how broad has that progress actually been? Lack of systematic data on workplace segregation over time has long made that question difficult to answer. Recently, however, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission made available to researchers a rich legacy of private-sector employer reports known as the EEO-1 survey.
These data star in "Documenting Desegregation," a new book by the sociologists Kevin Stainback and Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, which analyzes the trajectory of change in workplaces from 1964 to 2005 in careful detail. Their narrative reveals a jagged and uneven process of change driven by political mobilization, electoral outcomes and personnel-department practices, as well as specific legislative actions.

While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 destabilized a system of institutionalized obstacles to equal opportunity for both women and African-Americans, it failed to establish practical mechanisms that could guarantee steady progress toward equal opportunity.
From 1960 to 1972, many African-Americans, particularly men, moved out of segregated jobs. From 1972 to 1980, white women also began to gain access to new opportunities.
After Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, however, the federal government backed off from activist equal-opportunity enforcement, and racial desegregation stalled. White women continued to make inroads based on increased access to professional and managerial occupations, including human resource departments of major corporations, where they became an internal force for change.
The authors contend that increased education alone does not explain white women's relative success, because African-Americans steadily improved their educational attainment relative to whites throughout the 1980s and 1990s, even as employment progress stalled. Further, for reasons that may be related to political and cultural backlash, white women's movement out of gender-segregated work slowed in the 1990s and stalled after 2000.
Five years into the 21st century, the data reveal a surprisingly high level of job segregation in which African-American men, white women and especially African-American women only rarely worked in the same occupation in the same workplace as white men. In order to create a completely integrated private-sector workplace, more than half of all private sector workers would need to change jobs.
In most workplaces, the face of authority looks predictable. As the authors put it, "White men are often in positions in management over everyone; white women tend to supervise other women, black men to supervise black men and black women tend to supervise black women."
While overt discrimination based on race and sex is no longer culturally condoned, both covert bias and institutional inertia perpetuate inequality. Drawing on a wide range of social-science research, Professors Stainback and Tomaskovic-Devey contend we have shifted from a regime of "condoned exploitation" to one of "contested prejudice," from a hegemonic regime of bright social boundaries to a fractured social world of blurry, criss-crossed lines.
In this world, remarkable successes like the election of an African-American president coexist with continuing failures, especially in domains where disadvantages based on race, gender and class coincide and collide.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 might have led to steadier desegregation had we monitored its impact from the very outset, developing an analysis of institutional practices that could be renegotiated rather than relying largely on costly and contentious lawsuits based on particularly striking instances of discrimination.
Indeed, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has recognized the need to move toward a strategy of strategic enforcement, to examine industry-specific, regional and local patterns of occupational segregation and pay inequality.
The commission is currently barred from releasing data on the worst or best corporate citizens. By contrast the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission regularly make public company-specific data on the release of toxic chemicals, workplace injuries and financial standing.
Professors Stainback and Tomaskovic-Devey suggest that a similar level of public accountability for equal opportunity in employment could positively influence future corporate behavior.
It could also speed the journey the president urged us to complete.

HEADLINE: SAC's Efforts to Retain Clients and Staff Members

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: SAC Capital Advisors is working hard to contain the fallout from a Justice Department inquiry. | After fleeing equities after the financial crisis, individual investors are now pouring money into stock mutual funds. | BlackRock is said to be buying a stake in Twitter that values the company at more than $9 billion. | Wall Street executives in Davos pondered whether the financial industry was experiencing a brain drain. 

 BODY:
Steven A. Cohen of SAC Capital Advisors does not appear concerned about the ongoing insider trading investigation, with plans to show up at a hedge fund conference in Florida on Monday after making the rounds in Davos, Switzerland, last week. But beneath the calm exterior, employees and lawyers of SAC are working hard to contain the fallout from the Justice Department's inquiry into the firm, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports.
The question looming over Mr. Cohen's fund is whether clients will stick around or pull their money. A prominent departure came last week, when a Citigroup unit that manages money for wealthy families disclosed it was withdrawing $187 million. Though the withdrawal represents a small fraction of SAC's $14 billion in assets, "the Citigroup decision stung, say people close to SAC's business, because of the longstanding and lucrative relationship between the bank and the fund," Mr. Lattman reports. "Another concern, said these people, is that the move could influence other large SAC investors currently weighing whether to keep their money at the fund." Investors have a deadline of Feb. 15 to ask for their money back. 
 The firm is also worried about the effect on employees. This month, SAC told its portfolio managers that it would increase year-end bonuses by three percentage points in an effort to prevent them from leaving. "This has always been a stressful place to work," said an SAC employee who requested anonymity because he was unauthorized to speak publicly about the fund. "Now it's just more stressful."
 SMALL INVESTORS WARM TO STOCKS | After fleeing equities after the financial crisis, individual investors are now pouring money into stock mutual funds and pushing the market close to its highest nominal level ever. On Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500 broke 1,500 to finish at 1,502.96 points. The optimism of the last few weeks - fueled by a sense that crises are dissipating - is a significant change from recent years. But some market experts warn that the current rally may be driven by an investing public that fears missing out, Nathaniel Popper writes in The New York Times. "Americans' latest stock-market romance is young, and it could easily fade before it becomes something more serious. Some market watchers warn that given the big run-up in prices, the market is already ripe for at least a brief correction."
TWITTER COMMANDS $9 BILLION VALUATION | Twitter continues to grow up. BlackRock, the huge asset manager, is buying an $80 million stake in Twitter that values the company at more than $9 billion, according to Reuters. That is an increase over Twitter's reported $8.4 billion valuation in 2011. In the current deal, early Twitter employees will be able to sell their holdings, and the company itself will not raise money, according to The Financial Times.
 ON THE AGENDA | The American Securitization Forum conference in Las Vegas this week discusses the challenges facing the securitization industry. Thomas Curry, the comptroller of the currency, delivers the conference's keynote address at 11:20 a.m. Caterpillar reported earnings on Monday morning, and Yahoo announces results on Monday evening. Data on pending home sales for December is released at 10 a.m.
AT DAVOS, BANKERS FRET OVER THE FUTURE | One question seemed to dominate the Wall Street executives who gathered for the World Economic Forum in Davos: Is the financial industry experiencing a brain drain? Reuters writes: "The issue, executives say, is not pay, but how much scope there is to innovate and build businesses, which is why more bankers and traders are leaving the big Wall Street firms for Silicon Valley, joining private investment partnerships like hedge funds and private equity funds, or going into energy and other industries."
Still, the uncertainty didn't dampen the mood too much. Parties have not completely died out in Davos, as evidenced by a bash on Friday thrown by Sean Parker, a founder of Napster and former president of Facebook. The likes of Lloyd C. Blankfein, Marissa Mayer and Daniel S. Loeb gathered near taxidermy animals with lasers coming from their eyes. Andrew Ross Sorkin singled out the performance by John Legend as particularly memorable.
FROM BLOOMBERG TO JOHNS HOPKINS, A $1.1 BILLION THANK-YOU | Michael R. Bloomberg, the New York City mayor, made a $350 million gift to Johns Hopkins University on Sunday, bringing the sum of his donations over the past four decades to $1.1 billion, Michael Barbarbo reports in The New York Times. "That figure, kept quiet even as it transformed every corner of the university, makes Mr. Bloomberg the most generous living donor to any education institution in the United States, according to university officials and philanthropic tallies." Mr. Bloomberg, who graduated in 1964, explained his fidelity to the university in personal terms. "Let's be serious - they took a chance on me," he said.

HEADLINE: How Mary Jo White's Connections Could Complicate Her S.E.C. Job

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The nomination of Mary Jo White as S.E.C. chief has been hailed as a sign a tough regulator will patrol Wall Street. But there are also questions about whether her defense work will raise conflicts of interest. 

 BODY:
The nomination of Mary Jo White as chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has been hailed as a signal that a tough regulator will be patrolling Wall Street. But there are also questions being raised about whether her work as a leading white-collar defense lawyer over the last decade might hamper her effectiveness.
As DealBook noted, Ms. White represented top Wall Street banks and other major companies in private practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. Recent clients included JPMorgan Chase on financial crisis cases, News Corporation over its cellphone-hacking problems, and a former Bank of America chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, in a civil fraud suit by the New York attorney general over the firm's acquisition of Merrill Lynch. No doubt she had other clients who have not been revealed because their cases are not yet - or never became - public. 
As the S.E.C. chairwoman, Ms. White would have a hand in every decision of importance. But the conflict-of-interest rules could force Ms. White to recuse herself from some matters. If that happens, it could raise the prospect of a 2-2 split along party lines among the other commissioners. Currently, it's a highly polarized group, so her recusal could effectively freeze the S.E.C. from moving on an issue.
 Making things more complicated, her husband, John W. White, is a partner at Cravath Swaine & Moore, a leading corporate law firm. According to his biography on the firm's Web site, Mr. White represents a number of public companies and is deeply involved in accounting issues, a topic the S.E.C. deals with regularly. Under the law, his interests are considered to be hers.
Describing the federal conflict-of-interest rules as a minefield is probably an understatement. Like most ethics codes, they are broadly written so that most anything could plausibly come within their proscriptions. That means a claim of bias can be asserted by opponents of Ms. White who might be seeking an advantage on an issue by trying to keep her out of a decision. Those claims can be difficult to rebut and often prove to be a distraction.
The primary prohibition in the conflict-of-interest rules is a bar on involvement in a decision that will impact the government employee's personal or close family financial interests. This would prevent Ms. White from participating in any proceeding in which her husband represented a party with a stake in the outcome. As experienced lawyers, it should not be too difficult for them to avoid this problem, although she will have to be careful to consider Cravath's role in any matter.
Of greater concern is whether Ms. White's impartiality could be questioned because of her prior representation of a client. Under a policy adopted by President Obama on his first day in office in 2009, all appointees must agree to an ethics pledge that includes the following prohibition: "I will not for a period of 2 years from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts."
The crucial term is "any particular matter," which covers any investigation or enforcement action involving one of Ms. White's former clients. Thus, for two years she will need to recuse herself from the decision of whether to pursue a case even if she had did not have any direct involvement in the specific matter.
Knocking Ms. White off enforcement cases may not have much of an effect in most situations. The agency's commissioners do not get involved in dealing with a case until the investigation is nearly complete; the director of the enforcement division has the authority to authorize the issuance of subpoenas to compel records and testimony.
Most enforcement matters, particularly insider trading cases, do not generate much controversy. There have been cases that divided the commissioners, however, so her recusal could have an impact. For example, it was reported that the decision to sue Goldman Sachs for fraud in April 2010 over the sale of a synthetic credit derivative obligation was by a 3-2 vote along political party lines. 
On the regulatory side, Ms. White will be dealing with a range of controversial issues of great importance to Wall Street, like the implementation of the Volker Rule and potential limits on high-frequency trading. This is the type of rule-making that has divided the S.E.C. commissioners in the past, and close votes occur regularly.
Ms. White's former clients, like JPMorgan Chase, will have a significant interest in those rules, so her involvement may trigger questions about whether she should be participating in the decision. Her recusal could have a significant impact on how the rules are shaped, and whether they can even be adopted.
Unlike dealing with enforcement cases, her prior work for financial firms will not necessarily keep her from participating in rule-making about a subject involving a former client. The federal conflict-of-interest rules provide that rule-making by an agency is a matter of general applicability, and therefore is not "any particular matter involving specific parties" that would trigger the two-year ban under the President's ethics pledge.
Nevertheless, Ms. White will have to be careful because a rule also provides that a government employee should avoid situations in which there will be even an appearance of impropriety arising from a business or personal relationship. She can obtain clearance to deal with an issue from the S.E.C.'s Office of the Ethics Counsel, which can provide a measure of protection from criticism.
The problem with ethics issues is that they can arise at any time, and often the person does not recognize the issue until it is too late. Ms. White brings a wealth of experience to her new job, in part deftly navigating the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. But in this new role, she'll have to walk a fine line, more cautiously than even before.
An earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of John White. It is W., not J.

HEADLINE: Online Reaction to Immigration Overhaul Plan

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Online reaction to the prospect of an agreement on overhauling immigration that could include a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants 

 BODY:
[Video: Video: A bipartisan group of senators has agreed on a set of principles for a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system. Watch on Youtube.]
As my colleague Julia Preston reports, a bipartisan group of senators announced on Monday that they have agreed to work toward overhauling the immigration system with the aim of providing a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants.
Under the set of principles, unveiled one day before President Obama is scheduled to outline his immigration proposals, the agreement hinges on stronger border and interior enforcement, including requiring foreigners to leave the country once their visas expire. 
Extremely pleased that a bipartisan group of Senators has agreed on what basic principles must be included in #ImmigrationReform legislation
- Sen. Robert Menendez (@SenatorMenendez)28 Jan 13

The online reaction to the first significant bipartisan Congressional effort on immigration in recent years was a mix of cautious optimism, elation and concern among some conservatives that Republicans were not demanding tougher enforcement. 
In some posts on Twitter, mostly conservatives referred to the eight senators who hammered out the agreement as the "Gang of 8."
Both Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, spoke about the plan on television news programs on Sunday. They were joined on Monday afternoon by the six other senators. They included the Charles E. Schumer and Dick Durbin, both Democrats, and Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, both Republicans.
We can reform #immigration in a responsible & reasonable way. http://t.co/ly2vo6rq
- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)27 Jan 13
In a post on Twitter, Jose Antonio Vargas, a former Washigton Post reporter who has become one of the most vocal leaders among young immigrant activists who call themselves #Dreamers, after the Dream Act, asked: 
Is this bipartisan #immigration Senate deal the best they can come up with? cc @whitehouse
- Jose Antonio Vargas (@joseiswriting)28 Jan 13
Others worried that the bipartisan agreement would not succeed.
We've been here b4! DreamAct was originally proposed in 2001. Many legislators turned their back. Now they claim to care. #Immigration
- Johanna Calle (@jnena08)28 Jan 13
For many in the burgeoning online and offline movement of young activists who call themselves the Dreamers, a path to citizenship is vital. 
There must be a direct and clear way for DREAMers, our families, and members of our community to become citizens #immigration
- Lorella Praeli (@lorellaluciana)28 Jan 13
.@SenatorDurbin: #DREAMAct will be major part of bipartisan #immigration reform
- NalImmigration Forum (@ImmPolitic)28 Jan 13
On the other side of the debate, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which has long argued for tougher borders and enforcement, predicted a "fiscal nightmare" if the bipartisan approach were adopted.
26M in the US are unemployed or underemployed. America needs a system that frees up & ensures jobs for its workforce #immigration #everify

CC @RepPaulRyan "@michellemalkin: Illegal alien amnesty plus Obamacare = fiscal nightmare ==> http://t.co/S4G76H4l" #immigration
- FAIR (@FAIRImmigration)28 Jan 13
At the news conference, several of the senators spoke in Spanish. And the Twitter account for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York posted a message in Spanish, in support of the law. 
Yo me gusta grande buttos y yo no que can lie. Los otros hermanos no can puede deny.
- Miguel Bloombito (@ElBloombito)28 Jan 13
But some people on Twitter were annoyed about the focus on Latinos, when they noted that it was an issue that affected people who came to this country from other parts of the world as well.
Immigration isn't a Latino issue I really find the simplicity w/ which leaders speak to this insulting to my Hispanic heritage. #immigration
- Enriqueta Turanzas (@EnriquetaT)28 Jan 13
#Immigration is about family; about economic/cultural future of our country; about more than the Mexican border @DefineAmerican?
- Jose Antonio Vargas (@joseiswriting)28 Jan 13
At the news conference, Senator McCain indicated there was support in the House for considering change.
McCain: I'm "encouraged" that Speaker Boehner thinks comprehensive immigration reform should be taken up in the House.
- jennifer bendery (@jbendery)28 Jan 13
In the Senate, several other senators, including Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, posted their support for the approach on Twitter.
I support immigration reform with tough border security. We simply can't deport 11 million people. For one thing, it would ruin our economy.
- Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson)28 Jan 13
I commend my colleagues for forging bipartisan framework for comp immigration reform. Lk fwd to seeing details of bill http://t.co/tHFxU4Lv

Encouraged by bipartisan consensus on comprehensive #immigration reform. Looking forward to POTUS speech tomorrow.
- Mark Warner (@MarkWarner)28 Jan 13
In Texas and other border states, there remained considerable skepticism.
Texas, with an estimated 1.7 million undocumented immigrants, (600,000 in #Houston alone) has no leadership in Washington on #immigration.
- Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock)28 Jan 13
But the plan, while still a framework, seeks to put the state front and center of the immigration overhaul.
Under Senate immigration framework, governors and AG would have a say in when pathway to citizenship begins. #txlege http://t.co/jfo7WdRN

HEADLINE: Nominee for 'Sheriff' Has Worn Banks' Hat

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Mary Jo White, President Obama's pick to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, is a former defender of those she'd be expected to oversee. 

 BODY:
"You don't want to mess with Mary Jo."
That's what President Obama said about his pick to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White. The nomination of Ms. White, a former prosecutor who took on the terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Mafia boss John Gotti, was meant to signal that the S.E.C. would be getting tough on Wall Street. CBS called her "Wall Street's new sheriff." The Wall Street Journal said she would be "putting a tougher face on an agency still tainted by embarrassing enforcement missteps in the run-up to the financial crisis." The New York Times said her appointment represented a "renewed resolve to hold Wall Street accountable."
Hold on. 
While Ms. White is a decorated prosecutor, she has spent the last decade vigorously defending - and billing by the hour - Wall Street's biggest banks, as a rainmaking partner at the white-shoe law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. The average partner at the firm was paid $2.1 million a year, according to American Lawyer; but she was no average partner, very likely being paid at least double that. Her husband, John W. White, is a corporate partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He counts JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and UBS as clients. The average partner at Cravath makes $3.1 million. He, too, was a former official at the S.E.C. - he left Cravath to run the corporate division of the S.E.C. starting in 2006 just in time for the run-up to the financial crisis. He left in November 2008, a month after the bank bailouts, to return to Cravath.
It seems Mr. and Ms. White have made a fine art of the revolving door between government and private practice.
So how conflicted is Ms. White? Let's count the ways.
They are well documented: she was JPMorgan Chase's go-to lawyer for many of the cases brought against it relating to the financial crisis. She was arm-in-arm with Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's former chief executive, keeping him out of trouble when the New York attorney general accused Mr. Lewis of defrauding investors by not disclosing the losses at Merrill Lynch before completing Bank of America's acquisition of the firm. (And empirically, Mr. Lewis did keep crucial information about the deal from investors.)
This is what she had to say about Mr. Lewis, in a court filing submitted on his behalf: "Some have looked to assign blame for every aspect of the financial crisis, even where there is no evidence of misconduct. This case is a product of that dynamic and does not withstand either legal or factual scrutiny." It was a refrain she often made about her clients related to the financial crisis.
And then there was Senator Bill Frist, the Republican from Tennessee, whom she successfully represented when the S.E.C. and the Justice Department started an investigation into whether he was involved in insider trading in shares of HCA, the hospital chain. She persuaded them to shut down the investigation.
She also worked with Siemens, the German industrial giant, when it pleaded guilty to charges of bribery, paying a record $1.6 billion penalty.
And then, of course, there was John Mack. She worked for the board of Morgan Stanley during a now well-publicized 2005 investigation into insider trading that ended soon after she made a phone call to the S.E.C. Using her connections at the top of the agency, she dialed up Linda Thomsen, then the commission's head of enforcement, to find out whether Mr. Mack, who was being considered for Morgan Stanley's chief executive position, was being implicated. He ultimately wasn't. As the Huffington Post pointed out in a recent article about Ms. White, Robert Hanson, an S.E.C. supervisor, later testified, "It is a little out of the ordinary for Mary Jo White to contact Linda Thomsen directly, but that White is very prestigious and it isn't uncommon for someone prominent to have someone intervene on their behalf."
All of Ms. White's previous engagements create not only an "optics" problem, but a practical, on-the-job problem. She will most likely need to recuse herself from just about anything related to her previous work.
"I will not for a period of two years from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts," is the language in an ethics pledge that she will have to agree to follow.
Some appointees, including Mary L. Schapiro, the former chairwoman of the S.E.C., recused themselves from any involvement in work that was related to a previous employer even after the two-year moratorium. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recused himself from the investigation into MF Global because of his previous employment at Goldman Sachs, where Jon Corzine was the firm's head, even though it had been years since the two had worked together.
And then there is the issue of Mr. White's husband, who will have a continuing role at Cravath, one of the most pre-eminent firms in the country, whose clients include some of the nation's largest corporations.
"This president has adopted the toughest ethics rules of any administration in history," said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, "and this nominee is no exception. As S.E.C. chair, Mary Jo White will be in complete compliance with all ethics rules."
None of these conflicts gets at another potential problem for Ms. White. The job of chairwoman of S.E.C. isn't simply about enforcement; she has a deputy for that. The biggest challenge anyone who takes the job will have to confront over the next several years will be executing and enforcing provisions of Dodd-Frank and working to regulate electronic trading - something that even the most sophisticated financial professionals, let alone a lawyer, often have a tough time understanding. She has zero experience in this area.
Of course, there can always be a value to inviting a onetime rival onto the team.
"I believe she is one of those people who will understand that her public role will be very, very different than her role as a defense lawyer," Dennis M. Kelleher of Better Markets, a watchdog group, told me. "I don't think she's going to be like so many others who don't get that they have a very different role when they hold high public office.
"No question, she's said some things that are controversial and questionable," Mr. Kelleher said. "Moreover, I hope and expect that she will be asked publicly about them in the confirmation process and that she will have convincing answers."
Of course, if she is confirmed, we must all hope that she can put her previous client relationships behind her and work for her new client - us.

HEADLINE: In California, Son Gets Chance To Restore Luster to a Legacy

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- During a 1960s renaissance, California's public university system came to be seen as a model for the rest of the country and an economic engine for the state. Seven new campuses opened, statewide enrollment doubled, and state spending on higher education more than doubled. The man widely credited with the ascendance was Gov. Edmund G. Brown, known as Pat.
Decades of state budget cuts have chipped away at California's community colleges, California State University and the University of California, once the state's brightest beacons of pride. But now Pat Brown's son, Gov. Jerry Brown, seems determined to restore some of the luster to the institution that remains a key part of his father's legacy. 
Last year, he told voters that a tax increase was the only way to avoid more years of drastic cuts. Now, with the tax increase approved and universities anticipating more money from the state for the first time in years, the second Governor Brown is a man eager to take an active role in shaping the University of California and California State University systems.
Governor Brown holds a position on the board of trustees for both Cal State and UC. Since November, he has attended every meeting of both boards, asking about everything from dormitories to private donations and federal student loans. He is twisting arms on issues he has long held dear, like slashing executive pay and increasing teaching requirements for professors -- ideas that have long been met with considerable resistance from academia. But Mr. Brown, himself a graduate of University of California, Berkeley, has never been a man to shrink from a debate.
''The language we use when talking about the university must be honest and clear,'' he said in a recent interview. ''Words like 'quality' have no apparent meaning that is obvious. These are internally defined to meet institutional needs rather than societal objectives.''
California's public colleges -- so central to the state's identity that their independence is enshrined in its Constitution -- have long been seen as gateways to the middle class. Mr. Brown said his mother had attended the schools ''basically free.'' Over the last five years tuition at UC and Cal State schools has shot up, though the colleges remain some of the less costly in the country.
Governors and legislatures are trying to exert more influence on state colleges, often trying to prod the schools to save money, matters that some say are ''arguably best left to the academic institution,'' said John Aubrey Douglass, a senior research fellow of public policy and higher education at Berkeley. So far, Mr. Brown has not taken such an aggressive approach, but half of the $250 million increase for the university systems is contingent on a tuition freeze.
''He's creating stability, but basically he's looking at cost containment with an eye on the public constituency,'' Mr. Douglass said. ''But the system has been through a very long period of disinvestment, and this may meet an immediate political need, but it is not what is going to help in the long term.''
Over all, the University of California receives 44 percent less from the state than it did in 1990, accounting for inflation. The governor's proposed increase still leaves the schools with about $625 million less than they received in 2007. At the same time, a record number of students applied for admissions to the system's 10 campuses for next fall. While the California State University system has capped freshman enrollment, administrators at the UC system, which has about 190,000 undergraduate students, have been reluctant to formally do so, in part to prevent limiting access to in-state students.
Spurred by grumbling from voters, legislators have repeatedly complained that too many out-of-state students are enrolling in the University of California, arguing that they take spots away from talented local students. But others argue that without the out-of-state students, who make up less than 9 percent of undergraduates and pay much more in tuition, the university would have to make even deeper cuts.
Timothy White, the newly appointed chancellor for California State University and the former chancellor at UC Riverside, said the systems were facing a fundamental dilemma over access.
''Our budget is not going to allow us to grow enrollment at all, so I'm concerned that we are going to disappoint a lot of people in a lot of communities,'' he said.
So far, the governor has focused his attention on whether the universities should be offering more courses online, requiring faculty to teach more classes and cutting administrators' pay.
His plea that faculty members, particularly at the University of California, teach more undergraduate classes has been met with resistance, with one trustee fretting that doing so would ''turn this place into a junior college in about 15 years.'' Faculty members say that requiring more teaching would take away from crucial research areas, which will bring in roughly $5 billion this year.
''You can talk abstractly about faculty teaching more, but that begs the question of what you give up by requiring them to teach more,'' said Daniel Dooley, the senior vice president for external relations for the University of California. Mr. Dooley, who worked in Mr. Brown's first administration in the 1970s, has had several conversations with the governor about the state colleges.
Even before he began attending the board of trustee meetings, Mr. Brown repeatedly criticized high salaries for university administrators, arguing that they should serve as ''public servants'' and be willing to accept smaller paychecks. During his last term he famously remarked that professors derived ''psychic income'' from their jobs. When the University of California board of trustees voted to approve the new chancellor at Berkeley, in November, Mr. Brown voted in favor of his appointment, but voted against his $486,000 salary.
Some see the governor's new focus as a sign that there could be major improvements afoot, but others are less optimistic.
''The old days of the social compact with the state is gone,'' Mr. Douglass said. ''It seems clear that it will not come back.''

HEADLINE: And Now for Some Real-Life Enemies

BYLINE: By STEPHEN TOTILO. 
Stephen Totilo is the editor in chief of the gaming site Kotaku.com.

 BODY:
Action movies illuminate the anxieties of their age. Their villains represent our fears, or at least those that the filmmakers presume we have. These bad guys are the evil-of-the-moment that we might most want to see punched in the face: Soviet masterminds, drug dealers, Silicon Valley moguls, terrorists, media barons.
Action video games seem to have an advantage over movies here. Audience members don't just watch. They press buttons. They have, via game controllers, a chance for catharsis. 
But many mainstream games, steering clear of almost all social commentary, have remained preoccupied with the hell of war, the coolness of aliens and the ever-present danger that someone out there might want to kidnap Super Mario's girlfriend, Princess Peach. Real-life anxieties are rare. It is apparently hard to concoct an experience that enables players to punch the global economic downturn squarely on the jaw. The new game DmC at least tries.
DmC's opening moments stand out. A barrel-chested bald man in a general's uniform completes a cellphone call with a president he has just threatened to blame for the ruin of the economy. We'll eventually know the bald man as Mundus. He surveys an array of monitors that show offshore drilling platforms. He turns to a haggard, skimpily dressed woman and boasts: ''Soon I will own everything worth owning. I will control the world through debt. I have absolute power.'' We will later learn that he controls his own 24-hour news channel. What's more blood-boiling these days than that?
This guy, in this game, is going to be punched. By you. That's the implicit promise of the medium and the genre.
DmC is the latest video game in the Devil May Cry series born on the PlayStation 2 in late 2001. As before, its playable protagonist is a man named Dante, who needs to kill demons for some greater good, this time in a modern city possessed by them.
To someone only watching them, Devil May Cry games seem like a teenage boy's profane hormonal vision of what the most fantastic adulthood might be like: the adventures of a carefree, impossibly coifed man who enjoys the admiration of sexy women, has easy access to pizza and wields the weapons needed to eliminate the many devils infesting our world.
To those who play them, Devil May Cry games are virtual violence as jazz, with points for variety and deductions for doing the same thing repeatedly. Players have a character to control and demonic enemies to dispatch using an extraordinary mix of sword- , ax- and gun-based maneuvers. The games' creators have mapped dozens of strikes, shots, parries and evasions to different combinations of button presses on a controller. As fingers stretch, reach and tap with purposeful changes in timing, you might guess that this is what a master trumpet player's hands feel like.
To those fingers, the new DmC is familiar, though less stressful than its predecessors. Like so many modern games, it is easier than those before it. Our hero is tougher, and survival through the game's 10 hours is all but guaranteed. Going unhit, however, remains a challenge that will be met only by those players swift of reflex and interested in improv.
To the eyes and ears, the new DmC has just a little more to do with things that might matter to an adult. The debt-obsessed master villain ensures this. Dante himself remains a fantasy of puberty, opening this game in bed with two attractive women before reluctantly assuming responsibility for fighting an evil only he, of course, can defeat to save the world. But what wakes him feels more real. There's a report blaring on the Raptor News Network, the game's fake Fox News, about supposed terrorist threats that turn out to be the exhortations of the in-game version of Occupy activists or Anonymous hacktivists. Bob Barbas, who is Raptor's Bill O'Reilly, grumbles about these people and then wishes aloud that someone would shoot them. The game assumes you might have an opinion about this. That's new for this series.
It doesn't take long to deduce that DmC's main economy-wrecking bad guy is a demon king, and that Bob Barbas is a demon minion. That is its own kind of simple, blame-absolving fantasy. DmC isn't asking us to think too much.
Players spend most of the time fighting street-level demons who neither invite nor evoke any social commentary. The eventual confrontation with Mundus feels disappointingly less like recession revenge and more like a clip from a monster movie, though the scene preceding it -- a climb up the floors of a skyscraper in which employees have been motivated with the slogans ''Sell More Debt'' and ''Greed Is Great'' -- will fit a time capsule well.
The showdown with Barbas is more specific and perhaps contains a bit of acting out against news media that have had so much to say about violent games. Dante plunges into a city's reflection in a river and approaches an inversion of the Raptor News tower. He walks on the underside in this flipped cityscape; at this moment, the whole scene is upside down. The player and Dante find Raptor's core, where a huge digitized version of Barbas's head taunts and attacks with cackles and energy beams. It's Dante's demon-fighting skills versus an avatar of punditry.
Mr. O'Reilly isn't the only possible target here and maybe not even the most apt. But while DmC may tease and then fail to deliver the satisfaction of giving those responsible for the great recession a hearty wallop, it offers this consolation prize. In DmC we can't vicariously slay that which would destroy real society, but we can at least have a showdown with an entity whose contributions are dubious: a television talking head.
DmC, developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom Entertainment, is available for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated M (Mature) for gore, intense violence, nudity and strong language.

HEADLINE: Battle in States On Generic Copies Of Biotech Drugs

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
In statehouses around the country, some of the nation's biggest biotechnology companies are lobbying intensively to limit generic competition to their blockbuster drugs, potentially cutting into the billions of dollars in savings on drug costs contemplated in the federal health care overhaul law.
The complex drugs, made in living cells instead of chemical factories, account for roughly one-quarter of the nation's $320 billion in spending on drugs, according to IMS Health. And that percentage is growing. They include some of the world's best-selling drugs, like the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drugs Humira and Enbrel and the cancer treatments Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan. The drugs now cost patients -- or their insurers -- tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
Two companies, Amgen and Genentech, are proposing bills that would restrict the ability of pharmacists to substitute generic versions of biological drugs for brand name products.
Bills have been introduced in at least eight states since the new legislative sessions began this month. Others are pending. 
The Virginia House of Delegates already passed one such bill last week, by a 91-to-6 vote.
The companies and other proponents say such measures are needed to protect patient safety because the generic versions of biological drugs are not identical to the originals. For that reason, they are usually called biosimilars rather than generics.
Generic drug companies and insurers are taking their own steps to oppose or amend the state bills, which they characterize as pre-emptive moves to deter the use of biosimilars, even before any get to market.
''All of these things are put in there for a chilling effect on these biosimilars,'' said Brynna M. Clark, director of state affairs for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. The limits, she said, ''don't sound too onerous but undermine confidence in these drugs and are burdensome.''
Genentech, which is owned by Roche, makes Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, the best-selling cancer drugs in the world Amgen makes Enbrel, the anemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp, and the drugs Neupogen and Neulasta for protecting chemotherapy patients from infections. All have billions of dollars in annual sales and, with the possible exception of Enbrel, are expected to lose patent protection in the next several years.
The trench fighting at the state level is the latest phase in a battle over the rules for adding competition to the biotechnology drug market as called for in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.
A related battle on the federal level is whether biosimilars will have the same generic name as the brand name product. If they did not, pharmacists could not substitute the biosimilar for the original, even if states allowed it.
Biosimilars are unlikely to be available in the United States for at least two more years, though they have been on the market in Europe for several years. And the regulatory uncertainty appears to be diminishing enthusiasm among some companies for developing such drugs.
''We're still dealing with chaos,'' said Craig A. Wheeler, the chief executive of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, which is developing biosimilars. ''This is a pathway that neither industry nor the F.D.A. knows how to use.''
Biotech drugs, known in the industry as biologics, are much more complex than pills like Lipitor or Prozac.
That makes it extremely difficult to tell if a copy of a biological drug is identical to the original. Even slight changes in the cells that make the proteins can change the drug's properties.
The 1984 law governing generics does not cover biologicals, which barely existed then. That is why it was addressed in the 2010 law.
One reason generic pills are so inexpensive is that state laws generally allow pharmacists to substitute a generic for a brand-name drug unless the doctor explicitly asks them not to. That means generic drug manufacturers need not spend money on sales and marketing.
The bills being proposed in state legislatures would expand state substitution laws to include biosimilars. So Amgen and Genentech say the bills support the development of biosimilars.
But the bills would impose restrictions that do not apply to chemically produced pills. For a substitution, they say, the Food and Drug Administration must find a biosimilar ''interchangeable'' with the branded product. The F.D.A. has said interchangeability will be a higher standard than merely being similar to the branded product.
Some of the bills would also require patient consent for the substitution, for the pharmacist to notify the doctor if a switch is made and for the pharmacist and doctor to maintain records of the switch for years.
Backers say these safeguards are necessary to enable the tracing of any safety problems that might arise with a biosimilar.
''These are really complex, highly sensitive molecules,'' said State Senator Patricia Vance of Pennsylvania, who plans to introduce a bill. ''We want to make sure we are not hurting people.''
The generic drug association and insurers do not object to limiting substitution to drugs declared interchangeable by the F.D.A.
But they say that once the F.D.A. makes that determination, the other restrictions are unnecessary and are there merely to deter substitution.
Gillian Woollett, who tracks biosimilars for Avalere Health, a Washington advisory firm, said extra restrictions on substitution could put the state bills into conflict with the federal law, which defines interchangeability as meaning that a biosimilar can be substituted without the involvement of the prescribing doctor.
Ms. Woollett said the lobbying efforts by the biotech companies, which she characterized as ''putting a few more tree trunks on the road,'' might not make much difference as long as insurers have policies encouraging use of the biosimilars. She noted that only a small percentage of biologicals are dispensed through retail pharmacies. Most are infused or injected in a hospital or doctor's office. That has not reduced the intensity of the skirmishes in state houses.
Dr. John O'Bannon III, a Republican delegate who introduced the bill that was passed last week in the Virginia House, said he did so because as a practicing neurologist, he was familiar with biologicals. Then he added, ''The Amgen folks actually did come and talk to me.''
Amgen gave $22,000 to Virginia state legislators in both 2011 and 2012, more than double the $11,000 it gave in 2010, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Dr. O'Bannon received $1,500 over the last two years.
In North Dakota, a bill has cleared a committee in the State Senate, though it was amended to remove some restrictions.
''Genentech was the one that brought the bill to me,'' said State Senator Dick Dever, a Republican, who introduced the bill.
In Indiana on Monday, the House Public Health Committee approved a bill, but lawmakers, responding to objections from the generic association, removed the requirement that patients consent to any substitution. Ed Clere, chairman of the committee and author of the bill, said the bill ''doesn't do anything to prevent or discourage the use of biosimilars.'' He said the bill had been brought to him by Genentech and supported by Eli Lilly, which is based in Indiana.
Also supporting the push for such legislation is the Alliance for Safe Biologic Medicines.
This is not the first time drug companies have turned to states to try to blunt generic competition. In the late 1990s, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical pushed for laws that would restrict substitution for its blood-thinning drug Coumadin, known generically as warfarin, on the grounds that the drug was extremely difficult to use safely.

HEADLINE: Measure of Business Spending Improved 4.6% in December

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- A gauge of investment plans by American businesses improved in December, a sign that companies were betting that the economy would pick up despite fears over tighter fiscal policy. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday that new orders for capital goods increased 4.6 percent last month. The category of nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for investment plans, edged up 0.2 percent in December.
In a further sign of business confidence, the November reading on capital spending plans was revised higher to show a 3 percent gain, up from the 2.6 percent rise reported a month ago.
Many economists had expected businesses to invest more timidly late last year because of uncertainty over government spending cuts and tax increases that had been scheduled to begin this month. But Congress struck a deal to avoid or postpone most of the austerity measures.
Despite the uncertainty, the new data pointed to growing economic momentum as companies sensed improved consumer demand.
''It certainly seems to us that companies are slowly but surely expanding,'' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at the Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
A second report showed that a measure of pending home sales slipped 4.3 percent in December. Still, the housing sector posted a rebound last year and economists expect it will add to growth again in 2013.
New orders for overall durable goods -- long-lasting factory goods as diverse as toasters and automobiles -- jumped 4.6 percent in December, beating economists' expectations for a 1.8 percent gain. The gains were broad-based, with orders for machinery, cars and primary metals all increasing.
Orders for civilian aircraft surged 10.1 percent.

HEADLINE: A Break for Embattled Ranchers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM and HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
Reflecting diminishing fears over mad cow disease, Japan eased its decade-old restriction on imports of American beef on Monday, but industry experts said beef producers faced many more challenges to reverse a prolonged slump that has pared the nation's herd to its lowest level in 60 years and sent prices soaring.
A Japanese government council that oversees food and drug safety cleared a change in import regulations that would permit imports of meat from American cattle 30 months old or younger, rather than the current 20 months.
The change is set to take effect on Friday for American beef processed after that date, and shipments could start arriving in Japan in mid-February, according to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 
Japan, the world's largest net importer of food, instituted the ban in 2003 after bovine spongiform encephalopathy, an illness more commonly known as mad cow disease, was found in a single cow in Washington State. Humans are thought to catch the disease's fatal human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, by eating meat, including the brain and spinal cord, from contaminated carcasses.
Japan eased the ban in 2006 but only for meat from cattle 20 months or younger. Japanese officials argued that the incidence of the disease was higher in older animals.
Aside from the reduction in exports, ranchers have also been grappling over the last half-dozen years or so with rising feed prices as ethanol producers drove up the price of corn, and with drought that has parched grazing land and deprived their animals of water. The recession and changing consumer tastes contributed to the woes. While the industry has had boom and bust cycles lasting on average four to five years, the current decline is firmly entrenched.
''Previous cycles of production and prices going back 100 years related to the particular workings of the beef industry and were usually self-correcting,'' said Derrell Peel, professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University. ''But the current cycle is largely due to external factors and that is really why we are at this historic low.''
Cameron Bruett, the spokesman for one of the largest beef processors, JBS, welcomed Japan's decision, saying it would help increase business certainty and reduce complexity for the company's beef production, which operates in Brazil, Argentina, Canada and the United States. ''While the declining herd remains a challenge for the industry, any time you increase access to additional consumers, that benefits the whole supply chain,'' Mr. Bruett said.
JBS has eight processing facilities in the United States and Canada. While another major producer, Cargill, announced plans two weeks ago to close a plant in Texas, one of 10 it has in the United States, Mr. Bruett said JBS had no closure plans.
Japan's decision will be a bright spot at the annual gathering next week in Tampa of what Chandler Keys, a beef industry consultant, calls ''the hat and boots crowd,'' or the members of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
''It should be a shot in the arm to the market, which will be helpful,'' said Bob McCan, a rancher who will be named the association's president-elect at that meeting. Mr. McCan and his family operate a ranch in Victoria, Tex., with more than 3,600 head of Braford cattle, down from 5,000 six years ago. ''Everyone looks at the high price of beef and says we must be making money,'' he said. ''But profitability is more difficult due to the drought that started in Texas, the biggest cattle-producing state, almost five years ago and has since widened into the Midwest.''
That has raised the cost of production, as corn used in feed has become scarcer and animals have to rely on pumped water rather than waterholes.
''The bottom line is that the beef production system we have used for the last 40 or 50 years depends heavily on the incentive of very cheap grain,'' Professor Peel said. ''Now we don't have cheap grain, and we are seeing fundamentally higher production costs that I don't think are going to go away.''
The nation's beef cattle herd has dropped from a peak of 35.3 million head in 1996 to 29.9 million as of January 2012, said Professor Peel, who estimates that it will have dropped another 1.6 percent when the new figures are announced next week.
Beef production has not dropped nearly as much, in large part because cattle today are bigger. While the slaughter of animals dropped 3.3 percent in 2012, total beef production was down only 1.1. percent because of heavier carcasses, he said.
This year, he expects slaughter to drop by 5 percent.
''We're going to take beef prices to levels we have never seen, and I don't know how that will play out,'' Professor Peel said.
Japan was the largest market for American beef in 2003, when it restricted imports because of the cow in Washington State. That animal, now famous as ''the cow who stole Christmas'' because news of its infection broke right before the holidays, essentially shut down the United States export market, as some two dozen other countries followed Japan's lead.
''In one fell swoop, the export market that Japan had helped establish was gone,'' said Mr. Keys, the beef industry consultant.
But while other countries have long since eased or reversed their restrictions on American beef imports, Japan's decision to allow imports only of beef derived from cattle 20 months or younger created a hurdle that was difficult to overcome -- most cattle are slaughtered at 24 or 25 months -- and costly, because of the paperwork that had to accompany exports to Japan.
From January to November, the United States shipped some 143,900 metric tons of beef valued at $969.8 million to Japan, compared with exports of 375,455 metric tons with a value of $1.4 billion in 2003, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.
The United States trade representative's office estimated that the changes Japan made to its import restrictions would amount to ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' more in exports.
Cattle futures jumped 2 percent on Monday after Japan's decision was announced, recovering from a decline that followed Cargill's announcement of its Texas plant closure.
Clay Burtrum, a rancher in Stillwater, Okla., whose family has about 400 head of cattle, said the news about Japan was nice but was unlikely to make a difference to him.
''The drought is what's challenged us,'' Mr. Burtrum said. ''The ground is bare, feed is twice the price and there's no water. Japan opening back up, that's fun -- but only if we have cows left to sell.''

HEADLINE: Toyota Is Back on Top in Sales

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Toyota Motor sold a record 9.75 million vehicles last year, the company said Monday, moving past General Motors and Volkswagen to reclaim its title as the world's top-selling automaker in 2012. 
G.M., which held the top spot in 2011, sold 9.29 million vehicles last year. It had been the top-selling automaker for decades before losing its lead to Toyota in 2008.
Volkswagen sold 9.1 million vehicles last year, a record for the German automaker, which has expanded its presence in emerging markets. VW also outsold Toyota in 2011.
Toyota estimated last month that it sold 9.7 million vehicles for the year, and final figures released Monday were slightly higher.
By recovering its No. 1 title, Toyota cements a strong comeback from several years of tumbles.
A sharp slowdown in exports during the global economic crisis led to the automaker's biggest loss in decades while controversy over its handling of recalls greatly tarnished its image for quality and reliability.
In 2011, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, as well as widespread flooding in Thailand later that year, disrupted production, weighing on sales in important markets like the United States and pushing Toyota to No. 3 in global sales.
Toyota recovered in 2012, however, as production rebounded and the automaker went on an offensive to win back market share. Toyota sales in the United States surged 27 percent, to 2.08 million vehicles. In Japan, sales rose 35 percent, to 2.41 million vehicles, helped by government incentives for fuel-efficient cars.
Those increases were enough to offset a decline in sales in China, where Japanese businesses have been hurt by consumer boycotts stemming from a bitter territorial dispute between the two countries. In Europe, sales of Toyota cars rose by 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Weak Housing Report Leads to Mixed Finish

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed on Monday, lifted by good economic data on the manufacturing industry but held down by a report that the rate of home sales fell short of expectations. 
The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The durable goods report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.
A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting sales of previously occupied homes could slow. The report was weaker than many economists had expected.
The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59 points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,154.30.
The heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.
Caterpillar was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.
The Dow and the S.& P. 500 are approaching their closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S.& P. is 65 points below its record of 1,565.
Economic data may be less likely to support the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with the PNC Asset Management Group.
''Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,'' he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, ''you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.''
The oil company Hess was the biggest gainer in the S.& P. 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it planned to sell its terminal network in the United States, close its New Jersey refinery and shift its focus to exploration and production.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 97 flat, and the yield rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Costly Last-Minute Deals For the Super Bowl Crowd

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HOW much? For corporations and individuals headed to New Orleans for the Super Bowl this weekend, the answer is: a lot.
Super Bowl weekend and related pregame activities represent the biggest single-event corporate travel and entertainment spending spree of any year.
This year, the Super Bowl will probably generate about $185 million in local spending by visitors on hotels, meals and entertainment, according to a report released on Monday by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
That's an increase of almost 25 percent from the $150 million that the firm estimated was spent in Indianapolis during Super Bowl week last year. But it's down from the $200 million spent in Dallas for the 2011 Super Bowl, where a new stadium and two teams with big followings, the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers, helped increase spending despite a slack economy.
Adam W. Jones, the director of the sports and tourism sector at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the increase over last year was an affirmation of perceptions about a successful recovery in New Orleans.
So what are your prospects for finding a last-minute hotel room in New Orleans for the weekend? You're pretty much out of luck -- unless you have a prime contact at the National Football League or its corporate affiliates, which long ago booked more than 25,000 of the estimated 37,000 hotel rooms in the area.
On Monday, the only hotel accommodations I could find in New Orleans were at LaPlace Motel near the airport (a motel about which a review last year on Hotels.com says succinctly, ''It's cheap and we needed a dog friendly so we pick this one.'') LaPlace could still accommodate you (and your dog) on Saturday and Sunday night for $839.48. But come back a week later and the Saturday and Sunday night price is $169 -- a difference that would cover a lot of dog biscuits.
Some Super Bowl packages offered by brokers include game tickets costing more than $7,000 each (one offers a luxury suite that holds about 30 people for $300,000). Another offered a room for two at a modest three-star hotel and two end-zone tickets for $14,000.
Airlines have also raised prices for the Super Bowl -- at least in the markets for the two teams, the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens.
On Monday, San Francisco-to-New Orleans round-trip coach fares were listed in the $1,300 to $2,000 range on booking sites like Orbitz and Travelocity. But it always pays to check the airlines' Web sites. On Monday morning, American Airlines still had an available flight departing San Francisco on Saturday and returning on Monday at $560 for the cheapest coach seat and $1,013 for first class. But a few hours later, American's Web site listed no available flights.
Of course, you could always fly private. Super Bowl destinations always experience a big influx of corporate jets. And assuming you don't already have your own corporate or private jet, or at least a fractional share in one, it also pays to shop around. This year, demand for private flights to the Super Bowl is ''just not as high as we've seen in the past,'' said Chet Dudzik Jr., the president of JetWay Private Air, a broker for charter flights on private jets of all models. Last year, with the Super Bowl played by teams from New York and Boston, a record of about 1,100 private jets descended on Indianapolis. This year, with teams from smaller markets playing, flights and parking slots for planes at area airports were still available.
How much? Well, there's a vast range of prices for chartering a private jet, often with numerous extra fees to cover things like fuel and repositioning a plane or crew. JetWay Private Air, which Mr. Dudzik says has ''no surprises'' in hidden fees, was offering charter flights at these prices last week: For a light-jet round-trip flight seating six to eight passengers between San Francisco and New Orleans, $34,998. For big heavy-jet models, with cabins seating 10 to 16 people, $71,998.
Private jets also offer the convenience of using general aviation airports to avoid the hassles of commercial airports. For one thing, there are no Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. Instead, after being cleared against security watch lists, passengers simply stroll on board.
On the other hand, commercial airlines will be taking off as usual from New Orleans right after the game. But for security reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration imposes special restrictions on noncommercial flights in airspace over New Orleans in the hours before, during and immediately after the Super Bowl. Traffic jams for private planes trying to take off on Sunday night are notorious.
For clients who insist on leaving right after the game rather than staying the night, ''you just have to warn people'' about takeoff delays, Mr. Dudzik said. ''We'll order additional complimentary catering, a few extra bottles of wine or more food,'' he said. Crews are trained to deal with impatient passengers, often wealthy individuals who ''are able to control a lot of things in their lives, and who think they can control when they depart right after the game -- but they just can't.''
Oh well, as Gilda Radner usually said woefully in character as Roseanne Roseannadanna years ago on ''Saturday Night Live'': ''It's always something. If it's not one thing, it's another.''

HEADLINE: In the Air, Minor Tiffs Can Escalate Fast

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
At a time of heightened security concerns, disgruntled airline employees and frustrated passengers can be a combustible combination in a crowded aircraft, as travelers find themselves subject to lots of rules and little wiggle room to challenge them.
On a United Airlines flight from Zurich to Washington Dulles International Airport on Jan. 2, Bill Pollock asked a flight attendant about a sign telling passengers not to venture beyond the curtain separating economy class from the rest of the plane. Mr. Pollock, a book publisher from Burlingame, Calif., said he wanted to stretch his legs and visit his wife seated on the opposite aisle, using the passageway behind the galleys in the plane's midsection.
But when he questioned a flight attendant on the policy and began recording their conversation using his cellphone, the situation quickly escalated: the flight attendant grabbed his phone and nearby federal air marshals intervened.
''Two marshals held me up against the counter, they had my hands behind my back,'' Mr. Pollock said. ''I wasn't violent, I didn't use four-letter words. All I did was ask this guy about the sign on the curtain and they flipped out.'' 
The flight was met by United personnel and security agents, who, Mr. Pollock said, took his statement and then sent him on his way. But the incident left him with lingering questions about his rights -- like whether there is a policy restricting economy-class passengers to their own cabin (not just their own bathrooms), whether travelers are prohibited from videotaping flight crew and what recourse passengers have if airline or security personnel overreact.
It turns out, none of these questions has a clear answer.
Les Dorr, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the agency did not have a rule limiting passenger movement on a plane, but federal regulations state, ''No person may assault, threaten, intimidate or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft.''
Rahsaan Johnson, a United spokesman, said flight attendants routinely made an announcement asking customers not to pass through the curtains separating cabins, adding that federal regulations require passengers to ''comply with lighted signs, placards and crew member instructions.''
Mr. Pollock conceded that he told the flight attendant he planned to ignore the sign, which other travelers had questioned in online travel forums.
On a United flight from Dulles airport to Zurich last January, David Snead said he saw a flight attendant pin a similar sign to the curtain in front of the economy cabin. To him, it appeared ''handmade.''
''She got in arguments with people who tried to pass through,'' he said. ''She was not a nice flight attendant.''
He added that he sympathized with airline employees who must enforce a growing number of rules. ''Flight attendants have a ridiculously hard job dealing with passengers unwilling to accept every rule the airline comes up with,'' he said.
Rules that cause friction between flight attendants and travelers often involve electronic devices and carry-on bags. But as carriers invest more money in amenities for higher-paying customers, stricter divisions between passenger classes contribute to the tension.
Veda Shook, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said she was not aware of a policy limiting where passengers could walk, especially if a cart was blocking an aisle or a family member was seated on the other side of the plane.
''I think it's generally understood that you hang out in the cabin that you're in,'' she said. ''But I've never really encountered a situation where someone couldn't move about the cabin to get from point A to B.''
Given the potential consequences of a disruptive event, Ms. Shook said, flight attendants are trained to avoid any escalation of conflict, a ''nip it in the bud'' approach that may seem aggressive.
''You have to be prepared to shut anything down immediately,'' she said.
Airlines report to the F.A.A. incidents involving ''unruly passengers'' who interfere with the duties of a crew member. The agency said there were 101 such incidents in 2012, well below the 140 to 176 reports in each of the previous three years. The statistics do not include security violations, which are handled by the Transportation Security Administration.
David Castelveter, a T.S.A. spokesman, said the agency could not comment on the incident involving Mr. Pollock. But in an e-mail message, Mr. Castelveter explained: ''Federal air marshals are trained to protect the safety and integrity of the aircrew, passengers and aircraft. Due to the sensitive nature of their job, T.S.A. cannot discuss specific tactics or training.''
The Federal Air Marshal Service operates largely out of public view, but the secrecy surrounding its operations can put travelers in a difficult position when interacting with agents whose role is not always clear.
On a different flight, a passenger who had made several trips to the bathroom was questioned by an air marshal and detained by the police after the plane landed.
''We have reached a point where you check in your civil liberties when you check in your bag,'' the traveler said, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the situation. ''It's a little over the top what's going on.''
Customer complaints about the airlines' service and performance have risen. The Department of Transportation received 7,524 complaints about carriers in the United States in the first nine months of 2012, compared with 5,231 in the same period in 2011. Complaints about United topped the rankings, with 3,414 filed in the first three quarters, versus 1,132 for American Airlines, No. 2 on the list.
No federal regulation restricts what passengers can photograph or videotape on a plane, but Mr. Johnson said United published in its in-flight magazine a rule against photographing or recording aircraft equipment and airline personnel.
So where does that leave Mr. Pollock?
He said a United representative told him that their investigation indicated he refused to return to his seat, refused to stop taking pictures and refused to move away from the curtain when asked -- all untrue, Mr. Pollock said.
''It's just emblematic of what air travel has become,'' he said. ''If you ask a question on a plane, you're going to be identified as a problem and you're going to get whatever response they choose to take -- and there's no recourse.''
That feeling of ''no recourse'' has been heightened in the digital era, as customers are directed to Web sites to submit complaints and find it difficult to get more than a form response.
Jeremy Cooperstock, an engineering professor in Montreal, created the Web site Untied.com to help passengers in that bind. Besides collecting complaints about United -- the site received 4,500 last year -- Mr. Cooperstock lists contact information for United customer service managers and advises passengers, and airline employees, on their legal options.
United is suing him, seeking an injunction against disclosure of its managers' contact information.
''Passengers are increasingly dissatisfied with the service and treatment they receive,'' he said. ''I feel the need to alert the public to their rights and help employees who have been victimized by their management.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Trader For Jefferies Is Charged With Fraud

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors charged a former senior trader at the Jefferies Group on Monday with defrauding his clients - and the government - while selling them mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis.
Jesse C. Litvak, the former Jefferies trader, is accused of generating more than $2 million in revenue for Jefferies by overcharging his customers through deceitful conduct. Those who are said to have been his victims include some of the world's largest investment firms, including Soros Fund Management, Magnetar Capital, BlackRock and Wellington Management.
The government was also a victim in this case, prosecutors said, because Mr. Litvak's clients were managing money that was part of the Treasury Asset Relief Program, or TARP, the $700 billion bailout fund. As part of a public-private investment program, the Treasury picked nine private firms to invest in toxic mortgage-backed securities and help remove them from the clogged balance sheets of the large banks. 
While the alleged violations - cheating brokerage clients by misrepresenting the prices of securities - might typically prompt the loss of a job or civil lawsuits, such conduct rarely, if ever, rises to the level of a federal criminal prosecution.
The case demonstrates the aggressive prosecutorial stance of the special inspector general for TARP, or Sigtarp, which led the investigation. The office, now led by Christy Romero, has been responsible for criminal cases filed against 121 individuals.
"Illegally profiting from a federal program designed to assist our nation in recovering from one of our worst economic crises is reprehensible," said David B. Fein, the United States attorney in Connecticut, whose office brought the charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil action in the case.
Federal agents arrested Mr. Litvak, 38, early Monday morning at his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He made an appearance in Federal District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., and was released on $1 million bail. Mr. Litvak, who worked at RBS Greenwich Capital earlier in his career, joined Jefferies in 2008 and was fired in December 2011.
"Jesse Litvak did not cheat anyone out of a dime," said Patrick J. Smith, Mr. Litvak's lawyer at DLA Piper, in a statement. "In fact, most of these trades turned out to be hugely profitable. Jesse looks forward to the trial in this case so that his name can be cleared and he can get on with his career."
While the market for mortgage-backed securities is complex and opaque, the charges against Mr. Litvak are rather simple. Prosecutors said that he deceived his customers about the prices of the securities that he sold to them. The indictment said that Mr. Litvak deployed the scheme in part to increase the size of his year-end bonus.
In some cases, they said, Mr. Litvak would lie about the price at which his firm had bought a security so he could resell it to another customer at a higher price and earn more money for the firm. In other instances, the government said, he created a fake seller to give the impression that he was arranging a trade between two customers, when in fact he was selling the security out of his firm's inventory at a high price.
"The kind of false claims made by Litvak were unfit for a used-car lot, let alone a marketplace for mortgage-backed securities," said George S. Canellos, the S.E.C.'s deputy director of enforcement.
Mr. Smith, the lawyer for Mr. Litvak, said that the trades were transactions between sophisticated market participants and that the profits that Jefferies earned on each trade were well within industry norms for the mortgage-backed securities market.
Mr. Litvak wants Jefferies to pay his legal fees related to the government's investigation, and he has filed papers in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding compensation from the bank. Jefferies has refused to reimburse him, arguing that it fired Mr. Litvak for cause. Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for Jefferies, declined to comment.
The case first showed up on the government's radar after one of Mr. Litvak's customers, AllianceBernstein, complained to Jefferies that the bank had overcharged it for mortgage-backed securities, according to people briefed on the case. According to records from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Jefferies settled the case with AllianceBernstein for $2.2 million.
Court papers depict Mr. Litvak as an exuberant salesman, frequently communicating with instant messages and peppering his communications with slang. When Mr. Litvak reported to a client, Wellington Management, about a sham purchase, he wrote "winner winner chicken dinner." Another time, the complaint said, Mr. Litvak gave a customer a false report on the price of a security that he sold to a hedge fund, York Capital Management. "We are doneski gorgeous!" he wrote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Iranian Journalists Are Arrested and Accused of Links With Foreign News Media

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Ramtin Rastin contributed reporting from Tehran, and Thomas Erdbrink from Amsterdam.

 BODY:
Security forces in Iran have arrested journalists from at least four Iranian newspapers and one news agency over the past few days and accused them of consorting with hostile foreign news media, the state-run press reported Monday. Iranian rights advocates called the arrests part of a broader campaign of intimidation to forestall political unrest before the presidential election in June.
The official accounts did not clarify how many journalists had been arrested, the precise nature of the accusations against them or when they might be formally charged. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a media advocacy group based in New York, said at least 11 journalists had been seized, calling the crackdown the largest on Iranian news media since the unrest that swept the country four years ago. 
Accounts by the Mehr news agency and other official news outlets said many of the journalists had been taken into custody on Sunday after the raids on the outlets, all of which are regarded as reform-minded. One of the newspapers, Etemad, is close to a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and had been raided the previous day as well.
None of the arrests were reported by the raided organizations themselves. Some Iranian journalists said the omissions appeared to reflect fears of further antagonizing the Revolutionary Guards and affiliated security forces whose loyalties lie with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The Mehr news agency said the arrested journalists had been accused of ''collaborating with some of the Persian-language foreign media'' -- apparently an allusion to the Persian services of both the BBC and the Voice of America. The Fars news agency, without citing sources, said the suspects had tried to contact the foreign news media and had sought training on photography and filming with cellphone cameras. ''Moreover, they wanted to learn how to assemble the pieces and send them to the BBC,'' Fars said.
The Iranian Students' News Agency quoted the culture minister, Mohammad Hosseini, as saying none of the accusations were media related.
''We are investigating this issue, and once we have more information, we will inform the media,'' he was quoted as saying. ''It seems that these individuals have been arrested for security reasons.''
But Sherif Mansour, the program coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa for the Committee to Protect Journalists, assailed the raids, saying, ''With this wave of arrests, the authorities appear to be attempting to pre-emptively silence independent news coverage ahead of the presidential elections in June.''
Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, an advocacy group based in New York, said the arrests came against the backdrop of increased political tensions in Iran over the coming election and Ayatollah Khamenei's wish to avoid a repeat of the mayhem that followed the disputed 2009 campaign, which reformist candidates said was rigged in favor of the incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Although the next vote is five months away, Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates have been warning that Iran's domestic and foreign enemies will use the campaign to foment discord in attempts to subvert the Islamist government that has been in power since the 1979 revolution.
''There is a lot of nervousness in the regime, including a lot of infighting,'' Mr. Ghaemi said. ''This is the beginning of an attempt to have a very controlled and quiet election coming up, and not result in any popular outbursts.''
News organizations in Iran that are regarded as reformist, he said, ''were the easiest to quiet down.''
Some political infighting in Iran broke into the open last week with the disputed dismissal of the central bank governor, a move that appeared to precipitate a roughly 10 percent drop in the value of the rial, the national currency, already weakened from what government critics call economic mismanagement and the effects of Western sanctions on Iran.
Cliff Kupchan, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington, said it appeared that Ayatollah Khamenei has become increasingly unsettled by Iran's acute economic problems because of the possibility of instability. Mr. Kupchan said the ayatollah's worries may have been reflected in a Jan. 15 statement by the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, Brig. Gen. Nasser Shabani, that economic troubles could cause regional unrest.
''Currently, the state of the economy is a national security issue, and it is very likely that Khamenei and his apparatus, the office of the leader, have become directly involved in major economic decisions,'' Mr. Kupchan wrote Monday in an advisory to clients.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Nation Gets an International Go-Ahead to Break U.S. Copyright Laws

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A long-simmering trade conflict between the United States and Antigua and Barbuda appears to be boiling over.
Antigua and Barbuda, which has a $1 billion economy, is planning on getting legal retribution from the United States' $15 trillion economy over its refusal to let Americans gamble at online sites based in the Caribbean nation -- perhaps by offering downloads of American intellectual property, like Hollywood films, network television shows or hit pop songs. On Monday, the World Trade Organization gave its go-ahead for Antigua and Barbuda's tentative plan.
''The economy of Antigua and Barbuda has been devastated by the United States government's long campaign to prevent American consumers from gambling,'' Harold Lovell, Antigua's finance minister, said in a statement. ''These aggressive efforts to shut down the remote gaming industry in Antigua have resulted in the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and seizure by the Americans of billions of dollars belonging to gaming operators and their customers.'' 
The conflict's roots are a decade old. The World Trade Organization said that the United States had violated its trade agreements by preventing Americans from betting at sites based in Antigua and Barbuda. Because Washington is unwilling to make the betting legal, the countries have been locked in a dispute over what constitutes fair trade practices and fair compensation.
The online gambling industry was at one point the second-largest employer in the Caribbean country, its government has said, and economists estimated its worth at $3.4 billion. Gambling employment has dropped to fewer than 500 people from more than 4,000 as a result of the United States' trade policy, it said.
On Monday, a dispute settlement body in Geneva gave Antigua and Barbuda the nod to, in essence, violate American intellectual property rights to make up its losses, calculated at $21 million a year.
It remains murky just how the Antigua and Barbuda government might go about it. But trade watchers suggested it might set up a site where viewers could pay a pittance to watch a film or television show with an American copyright. The United States might not be able to shut the site down under international law.
''We are disappointed with Antigua and Barbuda's decision to abandon constructive settlement discussions,'' Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said in an e-mail. ''As recently as Friday, our two countries held high-level discussions on possible settlement options that would have brought real benefits to Antigua's businesses and people.''
The Obama administration said that the proposed plan might further hurt trade relations between the two countries.
''If Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft of intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua's own interests,'' Ms. Harmon said. ''Government-authorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major impediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.''
Trade experts said that Antigua and Barbuda's plan for retribution seemed designed to provoke American filmmakers and recording artists into pushing for Congress to allow foreign Internet gambling sites to serve American customers.
They also noted that it was the United States that had pushed for the unusual ''cross-retaliation'' mechanism at the W.T.O., where trade violations that hurt one industry could be countered with trade actions against a completely different industry.
''The irony is rich, rich, rich,'' said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.
''The practical question is, Is there a majority in the House and Senate to vote to revoke the ban, and would Congress do it because the W.T.O. told them?'' she said, saying it was unclear how the two countries would proceed.

HEADLINE: Pay Still High At Bailed-Out Companies, Report Says

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Top executives at firms that received taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis continue to receive generous government-approved compensation packages, a Treasury watchdog said in a report released on Monday. 
The report comes from the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bank bailout law passed at the end of the George W. Bush administration. The watchdog, commonly called Sigtarp, found that 68 out of 69 executives at Ally Financial, the American International Group and General Motors received annual compensation of $1 million or more, with the Treasury's signoff.
All but one of the top executives at the failed insurer A.I.G. -- which required more than $180 billion in emergency taxpayer financing -- received pay packages worth more than $2 million. And 16 top executives at the three firms earned combined pay of more than $100 million.
''In 2012, these three TARP companies convinced Treasury to roll back its guidelines by approving multimillion-dollar pay packages, high cash salaries, huge pay raises and removing compensation tied to meeting performance metrics,'' Christy Romero, the special inspector general, said in a statement. ''Treasury cannot look out for taxpayers' interests if it continues to rely to a great extent on the pay proposed by companies that have historically pushed back on pay limits.''
The report charges that Treasury has failed to rein in excessive pay at the three firms. It found that Treasury approved all pay raises requested for A.I.G., Ally and General Motors executives last year, with individual compensation increases of $30,000 to $1 million. It also faults the Treasury overseer for allowing pay packages above what comparable executives at other firms receive.
The report also accuses Treasury of failing to follow up earlier recommendations made by the special inspector general. A report issued a year ago made many similar criticisms, arguing that the Treasury officials ''could not effectively rein in excessive compensation'' because the most ''important goal was to get the companies to repay'' the government.
''Treasury made no meaningful reform to its processes,'' it said in this year's report. ''Lacking criteria and an effective decision-making process, Treasury risks continuing to award executives of bailed-out companies excessive cash compensation without good cause.''
In a response letter included in the report, Patricia Geoghegan, acting special master for TARP executive compensation, disputed several of its assertions. For one, the compensation packages for A.I.G. and General Motors executives were comparable to those received by executives at other firms, Treasury said. Pay packages at Ally were higher than the median because of ''unique circumstances,'' it said.
Treasury also noted that the Obama administration had cut pay for executives at bailed-out firms and required that the companies pay top employees with more stock and less cash. Treasury ''continues to fulfill its regulatory requirements,'' the letter said. It has ''limited executive compensation while at the same time keeping compensation at levels that enable the 'exceptional assistance' recipients to remain competitive and repay Tarp assistance.''
The Treasury is selling off its remaining shares of General Motors. In December, Treasury sold its final shares in A.I.G., bringing its and the Federal Reserve's total profit on its investment in the company to nearly $23 billion.

HEADLINE: Online Courses: Possibilities and Pitfalls

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (''Revolution Hits the Universities,'' column, Jan. 27) writes about a revolution in higher education through massive open online courses, or MOOCs. This is far from the case.
Disappointment is twofold. Most of the participants, as Mr. Friedman states, are middle to upper class -- the same students currently taking advantage of higher education. And in the words of L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T., whom Mr. Friedman cites, an M.I.T. degree will remain as it is today -- ''connected with bricks and mortar.'' MOOCs are on the margin. 
MOOCs are separate from that highly desirable and precious residential degree. Online courses represent auxiliary income to support bricks and mortar and to increase brand recognition globally. New wine for an old bottle.
The high cost of a degree at M.I.T. -- or most universities -- is not lowered. That would be a revolution. In fact, their bricks and mortar will become only more desirable and probably more costly because of the peripheral global-brand diffusion and applicant-pool penetration. Their selectivity might even increase further.
This is no revolution. It is the rich getting richer because they have the wealth and the brand to do so.
WILLIAM G. DURDEN President, Dickinson College Carlisle, Pa., Jan. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman's optimism for a future made better by MOOCs is well founded. MOOCs are not a substitute for traditional higher education, and they do not endanger it. They expand higher education by widening access, which will improve the world in many ways.
As president of the first liberal arts college to join edX, the consortium of universities offering free online courses, and the first women's college to offer MOOCs (beginning this fall), I am hopeful for positive changes to result from educating many more people around the globe.
MOOC technology could enable even more than unparalleled access to top faculty and courses. I envision women in Riyadh and Islamabad taking literature and economics courses alongside students in Kansas City and Anchorage, engaged in discussions that are informed, impassioned and ultimately transformative -- the kind of exchange that is the hallmark of a liberal arts education.
Higher education for women was, and still is for some in the world, a radical idea. By offering unrationed opportunities for women, Wellesley is ensuring that this revolution will be one that does not leave anyone behind.
H. KIM BOTTOMLY President, Wellesley College Wellesley, Mass., Jan. 28, 2013
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman celebrates the possibilities offered by MOOCs, but gives short shrift to some key limitations. Completion rates are terrible, at roughly 10 percent to 15 percent. There is limited formative feedback to help students develop critical thinking and writing skills; assessment is typically either computer-graded or ''crowd sourced.'' While thousands of students may post in online discussions, most students do not get known as individuals, so there is little sense of social presence.
Together these factors cause the biggest problem with MOOCs: generally only the driven, self-motivated and organized students who already have strong basic skills succeed. This has the likely effect of increasing, rather than decreasing, the digital divide.
Much like standardized college placement tests such as the SATs, online classes -- an intervention that has great possibilities, created with the hope of increasing access to higher education -- may end up limiting it.
BETH RUBIN Chicago, Jan. 28, 2013
The writer is director of SNL Online at the School for New Learning, DePaul University.
To the Editor:
MOOCs are wrongly viewed as a free form of education. But when universities offer MOOCs, these courses require extensive commitments of time and expensive resources, from I.T. professionals and faculty members alike, all coming out of the tuition of undergraduates enrolled in degree programs.
Professors will not be teaching these as ''extras''; each MOOC means one fewer course taught to and for the students who actually pay their salaries and the institution's overhead costs. Hours spent supervising online MOOC conversations reduce the hours available to paying students.
It may be ego-boosting to have an audience of thousands. But the financially struggling students who have sacrificed to be in a classroom deserve our full attention and are being cheated.
MARGARET D. STETZ Newark, Del., Jan. 27, 2013
The writer is a professor of women's studies and humanities at the University of Delaware.
To the Editor:
Online ventures undeniably open access to university courses and facilitate communication and networking for those who are already prepared to benefit from them. As currently practiced, however, they also limit the diversity of perspectives, languages of instruction and ways of disseminating knowledge.
If we want a better-educated global citizenry, should we not foster a multitude of professors with different views who can share deep critical thinking in a community of learners such as only the embodied experience of the classroom can yield? Rather than renting space and computers in Egyptian villages, let us train teachers, lower costs of higher education and widen its reach, in American cities and Egyptian villages alike.
MARIANNE HIRSCH New York, Jan. 28, 2013
The writer is president of the Modern Language Association of America and a professor at Columbia University.

HEADLINE: As Music Streaming Grows, Artists' Royalties Slow to a Trickle

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Like plenty of music fans, Sam Broe jumped at the chance to join Spotify two summers ago, and he hasn't looked back.
Spotify, which began streaming music in Sweden in 2008, lets users choose from millions of songs over the Internet free or by subscription, and is increasingly seen as representing the future of music consumption. Mr. Broe, a 26-year-old from Brooklyn, said that having all that music at his fingertips helped him trim his monthly music budget from $30 to the $10 fee he pays for Spotify's premium service.
''The only time I download anything on iTunes is in the rare case that I can't find it on Spotify,'' he said.
A decade after Apple revolutionized the music world with its iTunes store, the music industry is undergoing another, even more radical, digital transformation as listeners begin to move from CDs and downloads to streaming services like Spotify, Pandora and YouTube. 
As purveyors of legally licensed music, they have been largely welcomed by an industry still buffeted by piracy. But as the companies behind these digital services swell into multibillion-dollar enterprises, the relative trickle of money that has made its way to artists is causing anxiety at every level of the business.
Late last year, Zoe Keating, an independent musician from Northern California, provided an unusually detailed case in point. In voluminous spreadsheets posted to her Tumblr blog, she revealed the royalties she gets from various services, down to the ten-thousandth of a cent.
Even for an under-the-radar artist like Ms. Keating, who describes her style as ''avant cello,'' the numbers painted a stark picture of what it is like to be a working musician these days. After her songs had been played more than 1.5 million times on Pandora over six months, she earned $1,652.74. On Spotify, 131,000 plays last year netted just $547.71, or an average of 0.42 cent a play.
''In certain types of music, like classical or jazz, we are condemning them to poverty if this is going to be the only way people consume music,'' Ms. Keating said.
The way streaming services pay royalties represents a major shift in the economic gears that have been underlying the industry for decades.
From 78 r.p.m. records to the age of iTunes, artists' record royalties have been counted as a percentage of a sale price. On a 99-cent download, a typical artist may earn 7 to 10 cents after deductions for the retailer, the record company and the songwriter, music executives say. One industry joke calls the flow of these royalties a ''river of nickels.''
In the new economics of streaming music, however, the river of nickels looks more like a torrent of micropennies.
Spotify, Pandora and others like them pay fractions of a cent to record companies and publishers each time a song is played, some portion of which goes to performers and songwriters as royalties. Unlike the royalties from a sale, these payments accrue every time a listener clicks on a song, year after year.
The question dogging the music industry is whether these micropayments can add up to anything substantial.
''No artist will be able to survive to be professionals except those who have a significant live business, and that's very few,'' said Hartwig Masuch, chief executive of BMG Rights Management.
Spotify has 20 million users in 17 countries, with five million of them paying $5 to $10 a month to eliminate the ads seen by freeloaders.
In a recent interview, Sean Parker, a board member, said he believed Spotify would eventually attract enough subscribers to help return the music industry to its former glory -- that is, to the days before Mr. Parker's first major enterprise, Napster, came along.
''I believe that Spotify is the company that will make it succeed,'' said Mr. Parker, who is also a former president of Facebook. ''It's the right model if you want to build the pot of money back up to where it was in the late '90s, when the industry was at its peak. This is the only model that's going to get you there.''
As the largest music market, the United States has been a critical proving ground for streaming companies, but competition is also quickly spreading globally. Deezer, a French on-demand service, has announced plans to be in more than 100 countries. And localized streaming services have also sprouted up: Anghami, for example, serves listeners in the Middle East, and the Indian music market has Dhingana and Saavn.
For the biggest pop stars, hit streams can provide substantial revenue. Last week, a Google executive said in a company earnings call that Psy's viral video sensation ''Gangnam Style'' had generated $8 million from YouTube, where it had been watched 1.2 billion times, yielding a royalty of about 0.6 cent a viewing.
Many musicians whose work does not reach the top of the charts, however, are not as sanguine.
Complicating the issue, each type of service pays different rates. Pandora's are set by law. Spotify declined to comment on its rates, but according to a number of music executives who have negotiated with the company, it generally pays 0.5 to 0.7 cent a stream (or $5,000 to $7,000 per million plays) for its paid tier, and as much as 90 percent less for its free tier.
The companies behind streaming are ballooning quickly. Pandora, with 67 million regular users, is publicly traded, with a market capitalization of nearly $2 billion, and Spotify's investors have reportedly valued the company at $3 billion. Yet so far they have contributed relatively little to the American recording industry's $7 billion in annual revenue.
In its last four reported quarters, Pandora paid $202 million in ''content acquisition costs,'' including licensing fees, and Spotify recently announced that it has paid $500 million in royalties since its inception. Downloads, by comparison, had $2.6 billion in sales in 2011, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
For those whose income depends on royalties, the biggest concern has been whether streaming cannibalizes CD and download sales by offering a cheap or free alternative.
Cliff Burnstein, whose company, Q Prime, manages Metallica and other major acts, said that even if streaming hurts sales, all is not lost as long as the number of paying subscribers continues to climb rapidly.
''There is a point at which there could be 100 percent cannibalization, and we would make more money through subscriptions services,'' Mr. Burnstein said. ''We calculate that point at approximately 20 million worldwide subscribers.''
Metallica recently announced an exclusive deal with Spotify.
If those subscriber ranks grow, royalty rates will also climb, recapitulating a process seen whenever new technologies have been introduced, said Donald S. Passman, a top music lawyer and the author of the book ''All You Need to Know About the Music Business.''
''Artists didn't make big money from CDs when they were introduced, either,'' Mr. Passman said. ''They were a specialty thing, and had a lower royalty rate. Then, as it became mainstream, the royalties went up. And that's what will happen here.''

HEADLINE: A Second G.O.P.

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
On the surface, Republicans are already doing a good job of beginning to change their party. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana gave a speech to the Republican National Committee calling on Republicans to stop being the stupid party, to stop insulting the intelligence of the American people.
Representative Paul Ryan gave a fine speech to the National Review Institute calling for prudence instead of spasmodic protest. The new senator for Texas, Ted Cruz, gave a speech to the same gathering saying the Republicans should be focusing on the least fortunate 47 percent of Americans. 
But, so far, there have been more calls for change than actual evidence of change. In his speech, for example, Jindal spanked his party for its stale clichés but then repeated the same Republican themes that have earned his party its 33 percent approval ratings: Government bad. Entrepreneurs good.
In this reinvention process, Republicans seem to have spent no time talking to people who didn't already vote for them.
Change is hard because people don't only think on the surface level. Deep down people have mental maps of reality -- embedded sets of assumptions, narratives and terms that organize thinking. Since Barry Goldwater, the central Republican narrative has been what you might call the Encroachment Story: the core problem of American life is that voracious government has been steadily encroaching upon individuals and local communities. The core American conflict, in this view, is between Big Government and Personal Freedom.
While losing the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, the flaws of this mentality have become apparent. First, if opposing government is your primary objective, it's hard to have a positive governing program.
As Bill Kristol pointed out at the National Review event, the G.O.P. fiercely opposed the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law but never offered an alternative. The party opposed Obamacare but never offered a replacement. John Podhoretz of Commentary added that as soon as Republicans start talking about what kind of regulations and programs government should promote, they get accused by colleagues of being Big Government conservatives.
The next problem with this mentality is that it makes it hard for Republicans to analyze social and economic problems that don't flow directly from big government. For example, we are now at the end of the era in which a rising tide lifts all boats. Republicans like Mitt Romney can talk about improving the overall business climate with lower taxes and lighter regulation, but regular voters sense that that won't necessarily help them because wages no longer keep pace with productivity gains.
Americans are still skeptical of Washington. If you shove a big government program down their throats they will recoil. But many of their immediate problems flow from globalization, the turmoil of technological change and social decay, and they're looking for a bit of help. Moreover, given all the antigovernment rhetoric, they will never trust these Republicans to reform cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare. You can't be for entitlement reform and today's G.O.P., because politically the two will never go together.
Can current Republicans change their underlying mentality to adapt to these realities? Intellectual history says no. People almost never change their underlying narratives or unconscious frameworks. Moreover, in the South and rural West, where most Republicans are from, the Encroachment Story has deep historic and psychological roots. Anti-Washington, anti-urban sentiment has characterized those cultures for decades.
It's probably futile to try to change current Republicans. It's smarter to build a new wing of the Republican Party, one that can compete in the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic states, in the upper Midwest and along the West Coast. It's smarter to build a new division that is different the way the Westin is different than the Sheraton.
The second G.O.P. wouldn't be based on the Encroachment Story. It would be based on the idea that America is being hit simultaneously by two crises, which you might call the Mancur Olson crisis and the Charles Murray crisis.
Olson argued that nations decline because their aging institutions get bloated and sclerotic and retard national dynamism. Murray argues that America is coming apart, dividing into two nations -- one with high education levels, stable families and good opportunities and the other with low education levels, unstable families and bad opportunities.
The second G.O.P. would tackle both problems at once. It would be filled with people who recoiled at President Obama's second Inaugural Address because of its excessive faith in centralized power, but who don't share the absolute antigovernment story of the current G.O.P.
Would a coastal and Midwestern G.O.P. sit easily with the Southern and Western one? No, but majority parties are usually coalitions of the incompatible. This is really the only chance Republicans have. The question is: Who's going to build a second G.O.P.?

HEADLINE: Nominee For 'Sheriff' Has Worn Banks' Hat

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
"You don't want to mess with Mary Jo."
That's what President Obama said about his pick to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White. The nomination of Ms. White, a former prosecutor who took on the terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Mafia boss John Gotti, was meant to signal that the S.E.C. would be getting tough on Wall Street. CBS called her "Wall Street's new sheriff." The Wall Street Journal said she would be "putting a tougher face on an agency still tainted by embarrassing enforcement missteps in the run-up to the financial crisis." The New York Times said her appointment represented a "renewed resolve to hold Wall Street accountable."
Hold on. 
While Ms. White is a decorated prosecutor, she has spent the last decade vigorously defending - and billing by the hour - Wall Street's biggest banks, as a rainmaking partner at the white-shoe law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. The average partner at the firm was paid $2.1 million a year, according to American Lawyer; but she was no average partner, very likely being paid at least double that. Her husband, John W. White, is a corporate partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He counts JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and UBS as clients. The average partner at Cravath makes $3.1 million. He, too, was a former official at the S.E.C. - he left Cravath to run the corporate division of the S.E.C. starting in 2006 just in time for the run-up to the financial crisis. He left in November 2008, a month after the bank bailouts, to return to Cravath.
It seems Mr. and Ms. White have made a fine art of the revolving door between government and private practice.
So how conflicted is Ms. White? Let's count the ways.
They are well documented: she was JPMorgan Chase's go-to lawyer for many of the cases brought against it relating to the financial crisis. She was arm-in-arm with Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's former chief executive, keeping him out of trouble when the New York attorney general accused Mr. Lewis of defrauding investors by not disclosing the losses at Merrill Lynch before completing Bank of America's acquisition of the firm. (And empirically, Mr. Lewis did keep crucial information about the deal from investors.)
This is what she had to say about Mr. Lewis, in a court filing submitted on his behalf: "Some have looked to assign blame for every aspect of the financial crisis, even where there is no evidence of misconduct. This case is a product of that dynamic and does not withstand either legal or factual scrutiny." It was a refrain she often made about her clients related to the financial crisis.
And then there was Senator Bill Frist, the Republican from Tennessee, whom she successfully represented when the S.E.C. and the Justice Department started an investigation into whether he was involved in insider trading in shares of HCA, the hospital chain. She persuaded them to shut down the investigation.
She also worked with Siemens, the German industrial giant, when it pleaded guilty to charges of bribery, paying a record $1.6 billion penalty.
And then, of course, there was John Mack. She worked for the board of Morgan Stanley during a now well-publicized 2005 investigation into insider trading that ended soon after she made a phone call to the S.E.C. Using her connections at the top of the agency, she dialed up Linda Thomsen, then the commission's head of enforcement, to find out whether Mr. Mack, who was being considered for Morgan Stanley's chief executive position, was being implicated. He ultimately wasn't. As the Huffington Post pointed out in a recent article about Ms. White, Robert Hanson, an S.E.C. supervisor, later testified, "It is a little out of the ordinary for Mary Jo White to contact Linda Thomsen directly, but that White is very prestigious and it isn't uncommon for someone prominent to have someone intervene on their behalf."
All of Ms. White's previous engagements create not only an "optics" problem, but a practical, on-the-job problem. She will most likely need to recuse herself from just about anything related to her previous work.
"I will not for a period of two years from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts," is the language in an ethics pledge that she will have to agree to follow.
Some appointees, including Mary L. Schapiro, the former chairwoman of the S.E.C., recused themselves from any involvement in work that was related to a previous employer even after the two-year moratorium. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recused himself from the investigation into MF Global because of his previous employment at Goldman Sachs, where Jon Corzine was the firm's head, even though it had been years since the two had worked together.
And then there is the issue of Mr. White's husband, who will have a continuing role at Cravath, one of the most pre-eminent firms in the country, whose clients include some of the nation's largest corporations.
"This president has adopted the toughest ethics rules of any administration in history," said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, "and this nominee is no exception. As S.E.C. chair, Mary Jo White will be in complete compliance with all ethics rules."
None of these conflicts gets at another potential problem for Ms. White. The job of chairwoman of S.E.C. isn't simply about enforcement; she has a deputy for that. The biggest challenge anyone who takes the job will have to confront over the next several years will be executing and enforcing provisions of Dodd-Frank and working to regulate electronic trading - something that even the most sophisticated financial professionals, let alone a lawyer, often have a tough time understanding. She has zero experience in this area.
Of course, there can always be a value to inviting a onetime rival onto the team.
"I believe she is one of those people who will understand that her public role will be very, very different than her role as a defense lawyer," Dennis M. Kelleher of Better Markets, a watchdog group, told me. "I don't think she's going to be like so many others who don't get that they have a very different role when they hold high public office.
"No question, she's said some things that are controversial and questionable," Mr. Kelleher said. "Moreover, I hope and expect that she will be asked publicly about them in the confirmation process and that she will have convincing answers."
Of course, if she is confirmed, we must all hope that she can put her previous client relationships behind her and work for her new client - us.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Skilled Science Workers at Focus of Second Senate Proposal on Immigration

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
As one bipartisan group of senators released its blueprint on Monday for a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration laws, another group in the Senate was ready to present a proposal addressing one dysfunctional aspect of the system: a shortage of visas for highly skilled immigrants working in science and technology fields.
Four senators, led by Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah, will introduce a bill on Tuesday that would greatly increase the number of temporary visas available for those immigrants, and would also free up permanent resident visas, known as green cards, so more of those immigrants could settle in the United States and eventually become citizens. 
The bill will be the first legislation introduced in Congress on immigration in a year when the once-toxic issue has gathered surprising political momentum. Lawmakers who have shied away from it in recent years are now offering proposals that they are framing as practical solutions to fix a failing system.
Major technology employers like Microsoft, Oracle and others have been calling for years for more visas for foreigners with computer, engineering and mathematics skills, saying they have more jobs than they can fill with Americans who are graduating in those fields from American universities. White House officials and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle acknowledge that a broad overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants, would have a better chance at attracting votes for passage, especially among Republicans, if it had vigorous support from business.
A group of eight senators, led by Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat, and John McCain of Arizona, a Republican, on Monday unveiled principles for an overhaul that focused on solving illegal immigration, with increased border security and measures to give legal status to illegal immigrants. Their blueprint referred to changes for highly skilled immigrants, without specifics.
The bill by Mr. Hatch's smaller group, by contrast, is a detailed plan to recalibrate the high-skilled visa system. It would immediately increase the cap on temporary visas for those immigrants, known as an H-1B, to 115,000 a year from the current maximum of 65,000. It would also create, for the first time, a ''market-based'' system that would rapidly increase the numbers of those visas if the supply ran out, to a maximum of 300,000 H-1B visas in one year.
In the boom before the recession took hold in 2008, there were several years when businesses snatched up all the available H-1B visas in a few days. The market mechanism in Mr. Hatch's bill would lower the cap on temporary visas if demand from employers declined.
Also sponsoring the bill are Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican who was among the eight senators endorsing the broader blueprint, and Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Chris Coons of Delaware, both Democrats.
In a statement on Monday, Brad Smith, general counsel and executive vice president of Microsoft, said the company ''strongly supports efforts to permanently reform our high-skilled immigration system and enact broad immigration reform in 2013.'' He enumerated measures the company would like to see in any legislation, including all those in Mr. Hatch's bill.
Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said his organization had worked closely with the senators on the bill and would send ''a letter of strong support.''
Ms. Klobuchar said immigrants had brought new ideas and businesses to the United States. ''I truly believe we have to be a country that makes stuff again, that exports to the world,'' she said in an interview. ''To do that, we have to have innovation.''
''Sadly,'' Ms. Klobuchar said, under the current system ''we have been training our competition,'' because many skilled immigrants were forced to return home after studying and working in the United States.
Mr. Hatch, who fought off a re-election challenge from the right last year, has not said whether he would support comprehensive legislation including legal status for illegal immigrants. Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Coons said they expected their bill would become part of the broader overhaul.
The bill would allow spouses of temporary immigrants to work, a change that would bring relief to many foreigners -- many of them educated women from Asian countries like India -- whose careers languished when their spouses came to work in this country. The bill would make it easier for temporary immigrants who are tied to one employer to find a new job if their first job did not work out.
It would also tinker with the system to make more permanent resident green cards available for immigrants in science and technology fields, but without increasing the number of green cards over all, something many Republican lawmakers are loath to do. It would allow the immigration authorities to distribute as many as 300,000 green cards that went unused over the years because of twists in the system.
The bill would make changes to ensure that a much higher percentage of 140,000 employment green cards available each year would go to the skilled immigrants, and not to their family members, as happens now.
Responding to insistent demands from universities, the bill would make an unlimited number of green cards available for foreigners graduating from American universities with advanced science and technology degrees. It would increase visa fees and use the money for training programs for Americans.
Some employee groups said they would oppose the bill, saying the large number of temporary immigrants would undercut wages for Americans. ''America is a nation of immigrants, not of guest workers,'' said Keith Grzelak, vice president of the IEEE-USA, which represents more than 400,000 engineers.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
9 P.M. (13, 49) HENRY FORD ''American Experience'' chronicles the life and times of Ford, from his childhood on a Michigan farm in the 1860s and his dream of becoming a machinist in Detroit to his pursuit of racecar driving, the winnings from which allowed him to incorporate his Ford Motor Company. The result was the revolutionary Model T, a lightweight, durable and fast automobile that cost $850 at a time when the average car sold for more than $2,000. Soon the company was producing 1,000 cars a day. Taking its cue from the meatpacking industry, the company established the first automobile assembly line and controlled nearly half of the American car market. Ford, above with the Model T, also paid a $5 daily wage to reduce turnover, with strings attached. 
Immigrant workers had to attend the company's English-language schools, and inspectors from the ''sociological department'' would delve into their private lives. As Ford became one of the richest men in the world, he found his hatred for the wealthy elite increasing; he allied himself with the common people. But as his ego expanded, so did his anger. Ford blamed Jews for the country's problems, bullied those who worked for him and displayed withering cruelty toward his only son, Edsel, who died at 49 -- a death many blamed on the unrelenting stress of trying to please his father.
11 A.M. (HBO2) GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING (2003) In his feature directorial debut, Peter Webber imagines the life of Griet (Scarlett Johansson), a maid in the Netherlands in the 1660s who becomes the muse for Vermeer (Colin Firth) and is immortalized in one of his most famous paintings. ''Ms. Johansson is photographed so that her skin is as opalescent as her earring, but the movie is opaque,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of the novel by Tracy Chevalier. Yet, he added, the film is ''a dexterous and absorbing visual re-creation of the lighting and the look that Vermeer achieved in his work.''
6:40 P.M. (Starz) MONEYBALL (2011) Brad Pitt, below, received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics who transformed the team -- one of the poorest in baseball -- into a contender against wealthier franchises by rethinking everything he'd been taught about the game in this fictionalized adaptation of the book by Michael Lewis. Jonah Hill, also nominated, plays Peter Brand, a computer whiz with an economics degree from Yale who's a disciple of Bill James, the statistician who devised a new way to interpret baseball data. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is the team's manager, Art Howe, who isn't about to buy into the approach that his boss and his protégé insist will create a winner. Manohla Dargis, writing in The Times, said that the director Bennett Miller ''takes all this seemingly dry, dusty, inside-baseball stuff and turns it into the kind of all-too-rare pleasurable Hollywood diversion that gives you a contact high.''
6:50 P.M. (MoreMax) ALMOST FAMOUS (2000) The director Cameron Crowe looks back on his career as a teenage music journalist in this coming-of-age story about his fictionalized alter ego, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a 15-year-old from San Diego who makes a fairy tale ascent from nerdy schoolboy to Rolling Stone reporter. Frances McDormand portrays William's protective mother, a college professor; Zooey Deschanel plays his rebellious older sister; Philip Seymour Hoffman is the critic Lester Bangs; Billy Crudup is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist of the band Stillwater, to whom William is especially drawn; and Kate Hudson is Penny Lane, the ringleader of a troupe of liberated groupies who call themselves the Band-Aids. ''We don't have intercourse,'' she says. ''We inspire the music.'' Mr. Crowe ''may be the least cynical director working in Hollywood today,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Rock 'n' roll is not always about being nice.''
8 P.M. (Fox News) THE O'REILLY FACTOR Bill O'Reilly interviews former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell about developments in Washington and President Obama's second term.
10 P.M. (A&E) SOUTHIE RULES Pahk yah cah in Hahvahd Yahd: the South Boston accent is worn proudly in this new reality series in which an original family from this neighborhood embraces tradition -- jumping in the icy harbor on New Year's Day and living with three generations under the same roof -- while fending off the outsiders they call yuppies.

HEADLINE: When Good Drivers Pay More for Insurance Than Bad Ones

Some big insurance companies charge higher auto rates for lower-income drivers, even if the drivers have safe driving records, an analysis from the Consumer Federation of America finds.
The federation, a nonprofit comprising 250 consumer groups, has argued that insurers often give nondriving-related factors, like occupation and education, more weight than driving-related factors, and that such practices unfairly penalize lower- and moderate-income drivers. Occupation and education, the federation says, are proxies for income.
In its latest report, the federation obtained insurance quotes in 12 different cities from the public Web sites of five big auto insurers, using information for two hypothetical women. The insurers -- State Farm, Allstate, Geico, Farmers and Progressive -- represent more than half of the private auto insurance market, the federation said. 
Both drivers shared certain characteristics: Each was 30 years old; had been a driver for 10 years; lived in a ZIP code with a median income of $50,000; owned and drove a 2002 Honda Civic; drove 7,500 miles per year; and carried the minimum auto liability insurance required by state law (minimums vary from state to state).
The first driver, however, was a single receptionist with a high school education who had a 45-day gap in her insurance coverage, but had never had an accident or moving violation. (Gaps in coverage often occur because drivers can't afford their premiums, said Robert Hunter, the federation's director of insurance and a former Texas state insurance commissioner.)
The second driver was a married executive with a master's degree who owned a home, had continuous insurance coverage and one at-fault accident with $800 of damage in the last three years.
In two-thirds of the 60 quotes, the receptionist was quoted higher premiums, even though her driving record was clean. And in more than three-fifths of the cases, the premium quoted the receptionist exceeded the quote for the executive, who wasn't as safe a driver, by at least 25 percent.
The federation argues that "largely uncontrollable" factors, like education and occupation, are often given greater weight in rate setting than actual losses.
Robert Passmore, senior director of personal lines for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said in a telephone interview that it was reasonable to use such factors because "they are predictive of loss." Different insurers give different weights to different factors, he said, depending on what they saw as the best way to predict a given driver's risk.
During a conference call with reporters, Mr. Hunter and Stephen Brobeck, the federation's executive director, were asked why the analysis didn't include smaller automobile insurers as well. They said it was because the analysis was time consuming and because the largest companies tend to offer the lowest rates, even though the federation still considered many of them to be unreasonably high for lower-income drivers.
The federation argues that the wide disparity in rates quoted, from company to company and market to market, suggests that the auto insurance market is not truly competitive, but the insurance industry rejects that position.
"Auto insurance provides important, cost-effective financial protection to millions of Americans, and most drivers have dozens of auto insurers constantly competing for their business," said Steven Weisbart, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, in a prepared statement. "The price is risk-based and always will be."
The federation's analysis found that in every case, Geico and Progressive quoted the safe driver -- the receptionist -- a higher premium than the driver who had caused an accident. In several cases, companies refused to provide a quote to the "good" driver, but offered one to the executive.
"We work to price each driver's policy as accurately as possible, so that every driver pays the appropriate amount based on his or her risk of having an accident," said Jeff Sibel, a spokesman for Progressive, in an e-mail. "We use multiple rating factors, which sometimes include nondriving factors that have been proven to be predictive of a person's likelihood of being involved in a crash."
Geico didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
State Farm, however, charged the receptionist (the good driver) less than the bad driver in all 12 cities. In addition, in all the markets, State Farm's quotes were either the lowest or the second lowest.
That suggests, said Mr. Hunter, that State Farm gives less weight to nondriving factors than other companies. A State Farm representative declined to comment.
Mr. Hunter said states should insist that insurance companies make the factors used in setting their rates transparent, so consumers know how their applications for coverage were being considered.
Do you think factors like education and occupation should be used to set auto insurance rates?

HEADLINE: Everyday Voices: Finding Black History in Unexpected Places

BYLINE: TOM MARSHALL, MICHAEL GONCHAR and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: How can we teach African-American history through the everyday voices of ordinary people and not just iconic leaders? In recognition of Black History Month, we invite students and teachers to explore the interplay between iconic events and ordinary people. 

 BODY:
How can we teach African-American history through the everyday voices of ordinary people and not just iconic leaders? How does history have a way of cropping up where you least expect it: at the bottom of a forgotten old storage box, under the dirt of Central Park or in the memories of a long-running TV dance show
In recognition of Black History Month, we offer a different take on the significant events and eras of the African-American experience. We invite students and teachers to explore the interplay between extraordinary events and ordinary people. 
In this post, we first offer general activities for considering how the stories of African-American history are told, as well as ideas for contributing to the telling yourself. Next, we have suggested a handful of examples of news articles and other resources about ordinary people witnessing, or reacting to, extraordinary events. 
Please tell us what you'll do this year to celebrate Black History Month. 
 Suggested Activities 
 1. Find New Heroes. Use the resources below as well as the oral history sites at StoryCorps Griot and the National Visionary Leadership Project to browse for interesting stories or use keyword searches to find sources on particular topics or eras - whether something general, like blues music, or something more specific, like the 1968 Memphis sanitary workers' strike. 
Ask each student to pick a source whom they have never heard of and make a presentation nominating that person for inclusion to a class museum of Unsung Heroes of Black History. How would they tell their selected hero's story? What images and multimedia would they use? What artifacts would they want to include?
 2. Interview the Heroes Among You: Using sources like Storycorps as a model, find people in your own family or community who can add to the story of African-American history in some way. 
You might choose an era or an issue that we've highlighted in this post or that you've read about in our Black History Month collection of archival Times articles and create questions related specifically to it, or you might just invite this person to tell the story of his or her life. Record it on audio or video, then consider inviting a panel of interesting people from your community to your school to speak and take questions.
 3. Listen to the Voices in the Crowd: How can the impressions of ordinary people shape our understanding of historic events and offer something beyond the official version you might have read in a textbook? Ask students to find and read stories and interviews with people who lived through or witnessed extraordinary events and note how their perspective adds to or differs from the way a textbook or news article has presented the information. (Students might use our Multiple Point of View graphic organizer to record various voices on one topic.) 
For example, how did people of different ages and backgrounds react to the election of the first African-American president
 4. Redefine "Black History": What belongs under the heading "black history"? Does it include sports, entertainment and business? Does it include people with no claim to fame whatsoever? What is missing? 
Discuss the attributes of "history" as a field, including popular and oral history. Then ask students to look through the stories below, explore the archives of The Times or follow continuing coverage, looking for unusual stories that fill in our knowledge of the African-American experience. Students can compile a collection of "new history" sources and explain how each contributes to our understanding of African-American history.
 5. Look for Echoes: What issues that we first wrestled with as a nation in long-ago African-American history continue to echo today? How have they morphed into a 21st century version of the same idea, question or conflict? How can you trace their evolution? What solutions have been offered along the way? How did they, and do they, affect ordinary people? Students might create timelines, collages or multi-genre research papers that trace one issue through history, perhaps even providing predictions of how it will continue to morph in years to come.
 Resource Examples: Everyday Voices Making History 
Below, we have selected only a few of the potentially thousands of articles and resources that tell the story of everyday people during the time periods featured. We hope that teachers and students will use resources like The Times archives, or StoryCorps Griot and the National Visionary Leadership Project to find more.
As you read, you might consider the following:

        
Why do some voices become part of the historical narrative, while others don't?
        
How does the voice (or voices) featured in this article deepen our understanding of a historical event or time period?
        
How do ordinary people change history?
 Emancipation and Jim Crow 
 Even 150 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, new photographs and scholarship are adding to our understanding of what freedom looked like for millions of black Americans. "We consciously looked for black photographers," said Deborah Willis, co-author of the book "Envisioning Emancipation: Black Americans and the End of Slavery." "We consciously looked for images of women, whose stories have often not been included."
 Many African-Americans cultivated "Juneteenth gardens" in order to survive. Luckily, historical gardeners have preserved generations of heirloom seeds in order to protect an agricultural legacy that stretches from cowpeas to fish peppers. 
 In 1942 thousands of black soldiers helped build the Alaska Canada Military Highway. Besides the fact that they faced "vicious cold, heat, mosquitoes and mud," just like the other soldiers, they also had to deal with the racism of a segregated Army. Many historians cite the contribution of black soldiers to the 1,250-mile-long highway as helping to lead to the Army's desegregation six years later. 
 The Civil Rights Era 
 For many, the years in which African-Americans and their supporters fought for legal freedom and equality bring a flood of well-known images - sit-ins, marches and brave schoolchildren facing hostile crowds.
But recently discovered photographs taken by Gordon Parks show a different side of that struggle. They are all in color, and they portray the daily efforts of a single extended family in Alabama as they navigate the treacherous currents of the civil rights struggle in 1956. By narrowing his focus, critics say Parks offered a unique view into one family's passage through history.
 The Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56 ended bus segregation in that city and helped lead to an end of segregation on buses across the country. The stories of Rosa Parks and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are frequently taught in history classes, but who else was responsible for the boycott's great success? What role did ordinary people play in the boycott? The Historical Thinking Matters Web site provides a Document Based Question that lets students explore this very question. 
 Another story related to the bus boycott is the story of Claudette Colvin, the 15 year old girl who was arrested in Montgomery for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman, nine months before Rosa Parks made history. Ms. Colvin's story was once a forgotten footnote in history, but now she has acquired some recognition - especially because she is the subject of the book, "Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice", a National Book Award winner for Young People's Literature.
 The history of the civil rights movement, as measured in landmark legislation to extend and protect African-American rights in the 1950s and '60s, is far from settled. 
Courts are still weighing challenges to the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action laws. Researchers see uneven progress in achieving the equal opportunity goals of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Police departments continue to debate the legality of stop-and-frisk policies aimed at reducing urban crime. And civil rights organizations are suing New York City over public school admission standards that they say discriminate against black and Hispanic children.
 Recent History 
 Times are changing for organizations that once made headlines for barring African-Americans. These days black people are joining the Daughters of the American Revolution, which permits only members with an ancestor who fought against the British.
 In other places, the work goes on. Dr. Aaron Shirley, once lauded as a civil rights pioneer and the only black pediatrician in Mississippi, is still fighting to provide adequate health care for rural residents there. Activists continue to search for measures to improve urban life in Roseland, a blighted Chicago neighborhood where President Obama worked as a community organizer as a young man. And struggling black residents of New York City are relocating to the South in order to find more economic opportunity, in a reversal of the Great Migration that brought many of their ancestors to the region a century before.
 And Lonnie G. Bunch III continues to build his museum. Mr. Bunch, the director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, is racing to finish construction of its permanent building on the National Mall in Washington. Since his appointment in 2005 after an act of Congress, his staff at the Smithsonian Institution has been struggling to figure out which stories to tell about black history. Mr. Bunch says the museum will use African-American culture to teach all Americans about their country. "If my ancestors are smiling," he said, "then I know we've done a good job."

HEADLINE: Diving Into the Coral Triangle

BYLINE: C. DREW HARVELL


HIGHLIGHT: An expedition begins to save the spectacular biodiversity of Indonesia's seas, which are threatened by an unholy trio of coastal pollution, climate change and habitat destruction. 

 BODY:
 Drew Harvell is associate director for environment at the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University. She is studying the health of coral reefs and marine ecosystems in Indonesia. 
 Thursday, Jan. 17 
As I awoke to the sounds of the mullahs' calls for morning prayer in Ujung Padang, I pondered barriers being crossed in my latest research project: cultural, gender and even scientific. Our goal is to save the spectacular biodiversity of Indonesia's seas, which are threatened by an unholy trio of coastal pollution, climate change and habitat destruction. We are working on coral reefs, which are the most biodiverse marine habitat, and Indonesia, within the Coral Triangle, is at the center of marine biodiversity. 
What does it mean to be in the Coral Triangle at the center of marine biodiversity? It means there are roughly 590 species of reef-building coral here, more than any other region on the planet. Compare that with about 67 species in the Caribbean. There are also almost 4,000 species of tropical fishes in Indonesia, with 1,500 in the top-ranked region of Papua here. The Coral Triangle includes Indonesia; the Philippines; Malaysia; Papua New Guinea; the Solomon Islands; and Timor-Leste. 
Our scientific mission is twofold: to measure the health of coral inside Marine Protected Areas in Indonesia, and to assess sites that could be included in the new Capturing Coral Reef Ecosystem Services program in Indonesia, the Philippines and the Pacific Islands. 
On the measurement project, we are collaborating with Jamaluddin Jompa of Hasanuddin University on a project financed by the international programs division at the National Science Foundation and the PEER program of the United States Agency for International Development. The focus is on improving the resilience of Indonesia's reefs and associated habitats, like mangroves and sea grasses, to climate stress, while increasing their value by creating no-take fishing zones. 
Fishing pressure is so high in many locations that the only hope for the continuation of sustainable fishing is to create refuges where fish can breed and produce young that will spill over into other areas to be fished. In the process, we have discovered that these no-fishing zones also increase the health of the coral reefs in them. 
Scientists have shown that the corals inside marine protected areas in the Philippines, Palau and Australia have fewer diseases. For example, black band disease is lower inside some marine protected areas than outside.
 So our project is surveying, through intensive scuba transects, how marine protected areas affect the health of coral reefs. 
But coastal pollution is a big threat to all marine biodiversity, as well as to successful no-take preserves, and so can't be ignored. On Wednesday we sampled the bacteria adjacent to a series of islands at different distances from the large coastal city of Makassar, Sulawesi (also known as Ujung Padang). 
The "we" was me and the students and faculty members working with Professor Jompa, who is the director of Coremap, the largest effort in the Coral Triangle to develop community-based marine protected areas. 
There are many waterborne diseases that move downstream into the ocean through human sewage, even some that cause deadly coral diseases, and our goal is to investigate the twin problem of sewage pollution for human health and coral health, particularly inside marine protected areas. This focus on how human health is often intertwined with wildlife and the health of the environment is called One Health. 
The argument we are making is that sewage pollution at the level we are seeing is not only a threat to the coral reefs, but also to the humans who are dependent on them and live in the same waters. It feels like a scientific barrier because as the world finally shifts attention to the large-scale effects of climate and wrestles with adapting to climate, the more immediate problem for many coral reefs is local and in theory more easily fixed - reducing overfishing and coastal pollution. Improving local conditions is really the only climate adaptation that can change the resilience of coral reefs in the short term of the next five decades. 
The other part of my work here in Indonesia is to help plan a new project financed by the Global Environmental Facility-World Bank and University of Queensland, Australia, to enumerate and bolster the ecosystem services associated with coral reefs. Ecosystem services are what nature provides by virtue of its intact functioning. The primary ecosystem services we already know and appreciate from coral reefs include: nursery areas for fisheries and valuable biodiversity, protecting villages from large waves, filtering toxins and pollution, and increasing revenue through ecotourism and aquaculture. 
Everyone would like the coral reefs of Indonesia to keep producing these priceless services, but to do so we need to put a price on nature and demonstrate to the government and the world what the hidden economic value of these services is. 
For example, consider how the value of coastal mangroves goes beyond local value to global. A mangrove forest provides local services to its owners like filtering pollutants, reducing sedimentation and protecting villages and cities against rising seas and tsunamis. But mangroves also provide critical habitat for some young fish from the region's coral reefs and stabilize killing sediments, which benefits additional people farther from the mangrove site. 
Finally, mangroves have very high potential as blue carbon, which means that the carbon sequestration capabilities of coral reefs are so high that if you plant enough they will provide a global benefit of reducing greenhouse gases. It has been estimated that their carbon sequestration potential exceeds terrestrial forests on a per-area basis. 
Without carefully estimating the actual value of all these services, they go unappreciated and often unknown, and there is no incentive to enact more strict and costly laws to protect them. 
For example, across Southeast Asia there has been widespread destruction of coastal mangroves, often to clear a space to grow shrimp in shrimp farms. 
This is a double whammy. Removing the mangroves is bad because it removes the ecosystem service that both filters the water and cleans it of rampant coastal pollution, while also removing critical nursery areas for fish. The shrimp farms, conversely, contribute to coastal pollution by exporting nutrients, sediments and even disease-causing microorganisms onto the reef.
On top of that, the economic benefits of shrimp farms can be a red herring, since many of the enterprises fail because of viruses that infect and kill the shrimp, leaving a muddy pit where once was thriving mangrove. So these costs must also be added to the equation. 
Making a clear scientific case for the value of different valuable marine ecosystems will hopefully short-circuit some of the worst short-sighted problems. 
The other part of the ecosystem services project is to examine the potential to help coral reef-based enterprises like abalone, algal culture and seahorse farming thrive, by examining the business models and detecting any hitches in the values chains. We will visit some of these enterprises in the next few days. 
Friday we head to some of the more remote coral reefs in Indonesia, the reefs of Biak, Papua, on the far northeastern shore, exposed directly to the large fetch of the Pacific Ocean and reputed to have reefs of spectacular biodiversity. There are 41 small communities that have established community-based marine protected areas through the Coremap program, and we will interview stakeholders there about how to improve the linkages involving their coastal ecosystem services.

Four senators will introduce a bill on Tuesday that would address one dysfunctional aspect of the immigration system: a shortage of visas for highly skilled immigrants working in science and technology fields, Julia Preston writes. Lawmakers who have shied away from the issue in recent years are now offering proposals that they are framing as practical solutions to fix a failing system.

HEADLINE: Obama Speech Expected to Embrace Immigration Plan

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama likes most parts of an immigration proposal devised by a bipartisan group of senators. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President Obama is expected to embrace an ambitious proposal by a bipartisan group of senators to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, using a speech in Las Vegas Tuesday as a call to arms for one of his top legislative priorities.
Mr. Obama differs with the group on some key issues, notably whether to make a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants conditional on further tightening the nation's borders. 
But administration officials said Monday evening that the principles in the Senate proposal were largely consistent with those in Mr. Obama's 29-page blueprint for immigration reform, which he issued in May 2011 and made a plank of his re-election campaign.
The president's goal, the officials said, will be less to underline differences with the bipartisan plan than to marshal public support behind immigration reform. Mr. Obama, having failed to achieve that in his first term, has put it at the top of his second-term agenda.
With the senators pledging to pass a law by this summer, the White House has shelved, for now, plans to introduce its own immigration bill, the officials said. Indeed, after two years of nearly constant feuding with Congress, Mr. Obama finds himself in rare alignment with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on a major issue.
That could make Mr. Obama's speech, at a high school in Las Vegas, a novelty in his polarized presidency: a pat on the back to Congress and a pledge to work toward a shared goal.
On Monday, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, went out of his way to say the president welcomed the senators' plan, even though they rushed their efforts to get in front of his speech.
The four pillars in the bipartisan proposal - border security, employer enforcement, provisions for granting entry to farm workers and highly skilled engineers, and the pathway to citizenship - mirror the main components of Mr. Obama's blueprint.
Administration officials said Mr. Obama would push for a clear path to citizenship from the outset for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States, suggesting he would reject any attempts to link that to improved border security. The White House insists it has already tightened the nation's borders.
Plenty of other hurdles remain. Republican senators including Marco Rubio of Florida are putting together their own immigration proposals that are likely to be more restrictive than the plan put forward by the bipartisan group.
House Republicans are expected to resist the concept of offering a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, though there was talk on Monday of attempts to find a bipartisan approach in the House as well.
In his address, Mr. Obama is expected to fill in the details of his own plan, though the officials declined to give specifics in advance. They said the speech would be the first step in a months-long campaign to build public support for immigration reform.
The president's choice of Nevada as the locale for the speech underlines the political threat that immigration poses to Republicans. Mr. Obama beat his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, by more than six percentage points in the state, though Nevada's economy was devastated by the housing collapse.

HEADLINE: Does Championing Marriage Exclude Single Parents?

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: There's more to the story of what makes raising children more difficult as a single parent than just the lack of a partner. 

 BODY:
The Institute for American Values has issued a fairly remarkable "Call for a New Conversation on Marriage." Its president, David Blankenhorn, is perhaps best known as the expert who testified against gay marriage in the Proposition 8 trial in California, and then changed his mind, publicly, with an Op-Ed article in The New York Times. 
The "Call for a New Conversation" brings together 74 well-known activists, writers and scholars, on both the left and the right, described by Mark Oppenheimer in the article "Traditional Marriage's Activist's New Allies: Gays." It calls not just for a new conversation, but for a truce: "We propose a new conversation that brings together gays and lesbians who want to strengthen marriage with straight people who want to do the same." 
Why worry about strengthening marriage? 
Marriage is fracturing in America. While the nation's attention is riveted by a debate about whether a small proportion of our fellow citizens (gays and lesbians) should be allowed to marry, marriage is rapidly dividing along class lines, splitting the country that it used to unite. While marriage is stable or strengthening among our college-educated elites, much larger numbers of Americans, particularly in middle and working-class America, are abandoning the institution entirely, with harmful social and personal consequences.
This hollowing out of marriage in mainstream America is among the most consequential social facts of our era. It's contributing to the growth of inequality, harming countless children, and weakening, perhaps fatally, our formerly strong middle class. 
The theory that the "hollowing out of marriage" is harming children comes from the kinds of statistics and anecdotes described earlier this year in "Two Classes, Divided by 'I Do'": lower scores on standardized tests, poorer grades and an increased likelihood of dropping out of high school or failing to attend college; and stories of single parents with little time left after work, who struggle to provide the same access to activities, help with homework or even to read aloud. 
Neither those statistics nor the anecdotes are true of every home headed by a single parent. But some observers, like Jason DeParle, who wrote "Two Classes" and an accompanying Economix blog post, suggest a link between rising income inequality, particularly among households with children, and the increase in the number of households headed by a single parent in the "second quarter" of families - the working class. 
That rising income inequality is a likely driver for many of the risk factors for children in single-parent households. The "Call for a New Conversation" echoes that concern: "We propose a new conversation that re-establishes the link between marriage and money, the nest and the nest egg. What economic policies strengthen marriage? What marriage policies create wealth?"
But just as I wrote earlier that there's more to why there weren't many women at Davos than history, nature, and social mores, there also is much more to the story of why it is difficult to raise children as a single parent than just marriage. A focus on marriage (and wealth) can put the onus for supporting a family squarely back on the parents, even when there are some things - like paid sick leave, preventive health care, maternity and paternity leaves, affordable birth control and day care - that "takes a village" to provide, except for the wealthiest among us.
Any new conversation sounds promising, particularly when it's offered up as part of what appears to be a centrist coalition in extremely divisive political times. But what we need most is to find a way to talk about strengthening families without excluding families. Strengthening marriages may be one way to create a better structure for raising children - but marriage is far from the only structure we need.

HEADLINE: MF Global's Bankruptcy Nears a Happy Conclusion

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The push to make MF Global customers nearly whole, a goal now surprisingly within reach, is a remarkable turnaround for the brokerage firm. 

 BODY:
When Mahesh Desai checked his MF Global account 15 months ago, his $580,000 nest egg was gone.
Like thousands of investors and farmers who had their savings with MF Global, Mr. Desai lost his money in the brokerage firm's chaotic final days. Regulators discovered that $1.6 billion was trapped in a web of improper wire transfers, a stunning breach that sent federal investigators scrambling to build a case.
On Thursday, a bankruptcy court will review a proposal that would return 93 percent of the missing money to customers like Mr. Desai. And the trustee who has submitted the proposal, James W. Giddens, has quietly identified a way that, if sent to the judge and approved, could plug the remaining shortfall for customers in the United States, according to people involved in the case.
The broad push to make MF Global customers nearly whole, a goal now surprisingly within reach, is a remarkable turnaround from the firm's 2011 bankruptcy filing when such a recovery seemed impossible. 
"I'm surprised that, magically, the money has shown up," said Mr. Desai, a software account executive who, like most customers in the United States, has only 80 percent of his money. "I feel very relieved."
Customers are not the only ones exhaling. The hearing on Thursday presents a turning point for several major players in the MF Global case, including the firm's trustees, creditors and former executives.
For one, Mr. Giddens late last year made peace with an overseas administrator tending to the firm's British unit and Louis J. Freeh, the MF Global trustee recovering money for creditors. The pact ended a bitter fight over access to limited resources.
And Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor who headed MF Global when it collapsed, can now claim some small degree of vindication. The European bonds at the center of a $6.3 billion bet by Mr. Corzine fully paid out when they matured in recent months.
The large position in European sovereign debt in 2011 unnerved MF Global's investors and ratings agencies. Yet it is now clear that the bonds, which were sold to George Soros and other investors, were not by themselves to blame for felling MF Global. The firm also struggled after a one-time charge depressed its earnings.
Mr. Corzine, a former chief of Goldman Sachs, has started to regain his footing. He spent the summer on Long Island, traveled to France around the holidays and visited Central America for a humanitarian project involving children, setting up what he hopes will become a broader charitable effort. Mr. Corzine, 66, also spends time with his grandchildren and has office space in Midtown Manhattan, where he writes and trades with his own money.
In the most telling indication that Mr. Corzine is taking steps to put MF Global behind him, he was close to cooperating with Richard Ben Cramer, an author and a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, on a biography. Mr. Corzine's lawyers were in the final stages of negotiating with Mr. Cramer this month when the author died from complications of lung cancer.
Despite Mr. Corzine's progress, he still must shake a nagging federal investigation. While investigators have long doubted their ability to file criminal charges against him, suspecting that chaos and lax controls were at play, rather than outright fraud, they continue stitching together evidence on the firm's demise.
Federal authorities interviewed the former chief over two days in September, according to people close to the case, a sign that the government saw him more as a witness than a suspect. When prosecutors have damning evidence, they often file charges rather than offer a voluntary interview.
But Mr. Corzine, unsurprisingly, has yet to receive assurances that he is in the clear. And investigators continue to examine one of his statements from the September session, the people close to the case said. The statement involved Mr. Corzine's recollection about a phone call he had with JPMorgan Chase, which received a suspicious $175 million transfer from MF Global on its last day of business. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine declined to comment on the case.
JPMorgan sought written promises that the money did not belong to customers, but never received such assurances. An e-mail reviewed by The New York Times shows that Edith O'Brien, an MF Global employee who oversaw the transfer, told Mr. Corzine that the money belonged to the firm, not clients.
Ms. O'Brien declined to cooperate with the investigation without receiving immunity from criminal prosecution. But the government is hesitating to grant her request, according to the people close to the case, fearing that doing so would set a bad example for future investigations.
Other MF Global employees, including several who stayed to help unwind the firm, are moving on. Henri Steenkamp, MF Global's chief financial officer, recently departed. And Bradley Abelow, the firm's chief operating officer, who worked for Mr. Corzine at Goldman and the New Jersey governor's mansion, left late last year. Weeks earlier, he bought a $1 million condominium in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, according to property records.
With Mr. Abelow gone, Laurie Ferber, the firm's general counsel, remains the highest-ranking executive on Mr. Freeh's payroll.
For Mr. Freeh, the most significant breakthrough came in late December when he joined a deal with Mr. Giddens and the British administrator.
Under the terms of the broad settlement, the administrator will pay an estimated $500 million to $600 million to Mr. Giddens, ending a dispute over customer money trapped overseas. The deal also prompted Mr. Freeh to drop more than $2 billion in claims against Mr. Giddens, who hailed the pact as a "critical milestone."
"This is the eighth-largest bankruptcy in history and we've been able to sprint ahead on some occasions, but this is a marathon," Mr. Giddens's spokesman, Kent Jarrell, said in a statement.
The deal, if approved by the bankruptcy judge on Thursday, will enable Mr. Giddens to return up to 93 percent of the money of MF Global's United States customers. If a series of settlements with JPMorgan and other firms fall into place, people involved in the case said, Mr. Giddens could ultimately return 100 percent of the missing money.
To plug the gap, he must also pursue a small pot of money sitting in MF Global's general estate, a move that would require court approval. Even if he takes that path, foreign clients will still face significant shortfalls.
For some creditors, the race to recover their millions has moved too slowly. Some have grumbled about the roughly $42 million in fees for Mr. Freeh and other lawyers, focusing on parking bills and first-class air travel.
A group of hedge funds and other companies that held MF Global bonds at the time of the bankruptcy recently introduced a plan to liquidate the firm's remains and accelerate the payout process. The group, led by Silver Point Capital, said it expected customers to recover 100 percent of their money.
But not every customer will cash in. Some, in desperation, sold their claims last year at 89 or 91 percent to hedge funds and banks. Mr. Desai held out. "My hope has always been 100 percent," he said.
Mr. Desai credits the turnaround to Mr. Giddens and James L. Koutoulas, a Chicago hedge fund manager who became a voice for thousands of customers whose money disappeared.
While Mr. Koutoulas continues to fight, it has come with collateral damage. After he appeared on CNBC in 2011 to criticize JPMorgan Chase over its role in the bankruptcy, the bank closed his account and froze his credit card. The bank declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Gallows Humor, and Smog, Engulf China

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: As Beijing and large parts of the country suffer persistent, heavy smog, a former environment chief blamed chaotic economic growth, rooted in a "rule of men," not law, for the mess. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Here's a joke circulating among 10-year-olds at my son's state elementary school in Beijing:
A Chinese man recently arrived in America visits the doctor.
"Doctor, I feel unwell."
"Where have you come from?"
"Beijing."
"Breathe this," the doctor says, holding out a pipe attached to a car exhaust.
"Thanks, I feel much better!" the man says.
Gallows humor is circulating in Beijing these days as a yellowish-gray miasma once again drapes the city and air pollution indices hit hazardous highs or largely unknown, "Beyond Index" territory, for the fourth time this month. 
Shockingly, Beijing isn't even the worst place to be: a quick check of the China Air Pollution Index app showed that at the time of writing it was merely the 21st most polluted city in the country today. No. 1, as nearly always, was the unfortunate town of Shijiazhuang, an industrial base about 280 kilometers southwest of Beijing in Hebei province.
The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reports that almost one-seventh of China was shrouded in smog this week.
Hundreds of flights, including some international ones, were canceled or delayed and highways shut due to the "haze," the state-run China Daily reported, adding that Beijing's pollution was the highest possible level, "severe."
And, indicating a source of the problem, a report on Tuesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that China consumed 3.8 billion tons of coal in 2011, or 47% of global consumption, "almost as much as the entire rest of the world combined." Coal consumption grew more than 9 percent in 2011, the report said. Coal is, of course, a key source of the particulate pollution plaguing the country today and of global warming via greenhouse gases.
How did things get this bad?
In a rare interview published last week, Qu Geping, China's first environmental protection chief, placed the blame squarely on the country's "economic growth at all costs" mentality and on the political system.
Developing countries commonly suffer from worse pollution than developed ones, yet Mr. Qu told the South China Morning Post that pollution had run wild over the last 40 years as a result of unchecked economic growth under "rule of men," a term often used here to refer to decision-making that flouts the law.
"Their rule imposed no checks on power and allowed governments to ignore environmental protection laws and regulations," the Post wrote in the article.
The article quoted Mr. Qu, 83, China's first environmental protection administrator between 1987 and 1993, as saying, "I would not call the past 40 years' efforts of environmental protection a total failure."
"But I have to admit that governments have done far from enough to rein in the wild pursuit of economic growth," he said, "and failed to avoid some of the worst pollution scenarios we, as policymakers, had predicted."
After 1993, Mr. Qu headed the environment and resource committee of China's Parliament, the National People's Congress, for 10 years, the Post said.
China early recognized it faced a pollution problem amid high-speed growth and had some forward-looking strategies that emphasized a more balanced approach to development, Mr. Qu said.
"Why was the strategy never properly implemented?" he said. "I think it is because there was no supervision of governments. It is because the power is still above the law."
"There was an obvious contradiction in the central government's claim to co-ordinate growth with conservation and its unchecked thirst for economic development rooted in a political system," the newspaper wrote, in a comment attributed to Mr. Qu.
Since the early 1980s, when economic growth took off, China witnessed at least three waves of pollution, the Post wrote.
The first was caused by the boom in so-called township enterprises - businesses run by farmers in the countryside - that started 1984 and led to the "chaotic spreading of pollution."
The second was the rush to develop infrastructure and industrial projects after 1992 that resulted in pollution of major rivers and lakes and the degradation of urban air quality.
The third occurred over the last decade under President Hu Jintao, which saw a renewed wave of building of energy-intensive and highly polluting heavy industries, including petrochemical, cement, iron and steel plants, that turned China into the world's biggest polluter.
"In the face of such mounting pressures, all the administrative orders and technical solutions on pollution control became inadequate," Mr. Qu said.
Leaving China where it is today, with large areas engulfed in smog.

HEADLINE: Redefining Home in Tidewater Virginia

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: After some early successes as a photographer, Matt Eich returned to his home in Virginia to raise his family and confront the realities of home and career. 

 BODY:
Matt Eich was raised in the Tidewater area of Virginia, a series of seven cities and smaller shore communities separated by water yet connected by bridges, tunnels and the presence of many large United States military bases. 
The military dominates the economy and the politics tend to be conservative. Traces of over 400 years of history can be seen in the remnants of the Jamestown settlement and in the new old houses of Colonial Williamsburg. 
But, truth be told, Mr. Eich never felt particularly connected to the area growing up. He experienced it as a never-ending series of strip malls punctuated by a few places of profound natural beauty. 
"Outside of some rural areas and a few pockets of the cities, my perception was it that it was pretty lackluster place," Mr. Eich said. 
After finishing his degree in photojournalism at Ohio University, Mr. Eich returned to home in 2009, not so much out of a yearning for the place but because of practical concerns. At 22, Mr. Eich was married with a 1-year-old daughter, and his parents and all three of his siblings were in the area.
Living there would allow him to pursue his peripatetic career as a photographer while his wife, Melissa, studied for a graduate degree in speech pathology. This year they had another daughter.
So far, Mr. Eich's career has gone well. He became known as a member of the collective - which he left last summer - and has been fairly successful in landing editorial assignments and winning grants to fund his projects. 
He pursued a long-term project in Greenwood, Miss., "Sin and Salvation in Baptist Town," raising money for it on the photography crowd financing platform, emphas.is.
He is now using emphas.is again to pay for an exhibition of "The Seven Cities" at the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art in Virginia Beach this fall.
The exhibit will showcase his documentary photographs of the Tidewater community and its military influence, interspersed with photos of his family. "I'm trying to put my family's narratives into the context of the community," Mr. Eich said. "I'm also photographing my wife and daughters and parents and siblings and friends we grew up with."
As he works on decoding the area in which he grew up and defining his own relationship to home, he is also trying to determine whether there is a place in photography for someone to do personal work, have a career and support a family.
Rapid changes in the photography industry have made it impossible to predict if one year of editorial assignment bounty will be followed by another of famine. It is hard to plan a career. Like many photographers, Mr. Eich continually struggles to come up with reliable models to tame the turbulent economic forces. 
In planning "The Seven Cities," he endeavored to put together a meaningful project that would keep him near his wife and daughters. He carefully drew up a budget of $70,000 to cover printing and framing, pay a collaborator to gather audio, produce sound installations and build an interactive Web site where community members could upload their stories. It would also pay Mr. Eich a modest amount. 
The result so far?
"I haven't come up with a cent for any of it," he said. 
Mr. Eich did receive a $3000 Short Grant from the National Press Photographers Association, which paid for two weeks of shooting last year. This July, he will participate in a Lightwork artist residency in Syracuse, where he will print the work and edit with the photo editors Mike Davis and Deb Davis.
The question facing him and other young photographers in these unpredictable times is how to make pursuing personal work financially sustainable. As he seeks to find solutions he admits, "I don't have an answer to that."
"I can tell you that every time I go to a photo conference some National Geographic guy is there saying he's never struggled to get assignments - they just fell into his lap," Mr. Eich said. "Well, that sounds like a lovely world to live in, but that's not the world I've been given, so I have to figure out how to work with what I got."

HEADLINE: Polls vs. Markets

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: In Italy and the United States, consumers are glum but stock prices have been rising at an impressive clip. 

 BODY:
Who should be believed? The markets or the consumer-confidence polls?
The Conference Board reported Tuesday that the preliminary January figure for consumer confidence in the United States had plunged to its lowest level in more than a year, with a decline in expectations leading the way. 
The stock market has done very well in January.
The consumer confidence numbers are based on answers to only five questions, three of them calling for forecasts six months out. Those determine the expectations index.
All those forecasts -- on business conditions, on employment and on personal income -- got worse this month. People are more negative about the first two than at any time since October 2011, a time when talk of a double-dip recession was widespread and the stock market had done a summer swoon. But the income forecast is where confidence seems to have plunged the most. 
As recently as last October, more Americans polled by the Conference Board expected their income to increase than decrease over the following six months. Now just 14 percent expect an increase and 23 percent expect a decline. That difference, of nine percentage points, is the largest since the spring of 2009, when the credit crisis was at its worst.
What brought this on? One analysis is that it is the payroll tax increase that took effect at the start of the year. Others point to the so-called fiscal cliff fight.
But those looking for only domestic explanations may be missing something. Italy's consumer confidence index for December, reported earlier this week, fell to the lowest level since it began to be calculated in 1996, noted Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management. And yet the Italian stock market has been rising rapidly since last summer, as fears of a euro zone collapse have abated.
The world economy does look better now than it did only a few months ago, at least to economists and stock traders. But a lot of people seem to think things are going in the opposite direction. At some point, that divergence is going to have to end.
Mr. Shaoul, discussing Italy, says "the odds are that it will be a surge in confidence rather than a collapse in the equity market which restores some balance."
Here's hoping he is right.

HEADLINE: Fighting Fat at India Inc., One Dosa at a Time

BYLINE: SARITHA RAI


HIGHLIGHT: The high-carbohydrate, high-calorie Indian vegetarian diet can take a toll on white collar workers. 

 BODY:
Six-footer Sanjay Jain is at least 15 kilograms (33 pounds) overweight at 95 kilograms. Typical of many of his Bangalore peers, Mr. Jain puts on weight, loses weight and then starts the whole cycle anew. 
Like many professionals in Bangalore and urban Indians everywhere, Mr. Jain, 46, works late hours, trains in stops and bursts, and, until recently, paid scant attention to what, when and how much he ate.
But a few months ago Mr. Jain, a software industry professional and a budding entrepreneur at the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla's Khosla Labs in Bangalore, decided to lose weight and signed up as a tester for an app called HealthifyMe. For the first time, the vegetarian began measuring what he ate, not just in calories but also in nutritional content.
Mr. Jain, who said he considered himself well educated about dietary choices, was jolted when he found out that his carbohydrate-laden diet contained barely any proteins. "I was stunned to see that 70 percent or more of my intake consisted of carbs, and it was a high-fat and low-protein diet," he said. 
Mr. Jain's struggle parallels that of HealthifyMe's co-founder Tushar Vashisht, a University of Pennsylvania graduate and former investment banker who gained 18 kilograms within a year of returning to India to work for the country's Unique Identity project.
"Corporate India happened to me," said Mr. Vashisht, who confessed that he used to unthinkingly order entire vegetarian menus at fast food restaurants.
Starting on a fitness regimen was hard enough, but when it came to his diet, Mr. Vashisht said he was flummoxed. In a country of a billion-plus people and a food heritage of thousands of years, there was no easy way to track nutrition and calories in common Indian dishes. Calorie counters developed in the West could not tally the calories of Mr. Vashisht's beloved Indian food.
Around him in Bangalore, entrepreneurs were starting to tackle uniquely Indian problems by devising their own innovative technology solutions. So Mr. Vashisht, 28, and Mathew Cherian, also 28, a computer science graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set to work creating an application for the Indian diet. (Mr. Vashisht and Mr. Cherian once conducted a month-long experiment on the diet of poor Indians by living on 100 rupees a day.)
The two were joined later by a third co-founder, Sachin Shenoy, a holder of five patents who helped build many consumer products at Google.
"India Inc. is a one-way ticket to being obese, diabetic and hypertensive," said Mr. Vashisht, who cited a study by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations that suggested that half of white-collar India is prone to lifestyle diseases and that 71 percent of the workforce and 82 percent of chief executives were overweight.
"Living on salads is unworkable in India, so we need solutions that can work for our own food and eating culture," he said.
Mr. Vashisht and Mr. Cherian first digitized hundreds of pieces of data on Indian raw ingredients, with their micro- and macro-nutrient counts, from dusty files at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad. They integrated them with records from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration database of 10,000 raw ingredients.
After stitching the two together, they built a comprehensive database of nutritional values for thousands of standardized Indian recipes. With expert help from endocrinologists, dieticians and gym trainers, HealthifyMe is set to become the country's first comprehensive calorie tracker for everything from thepla (a western Indian flatbread with greens) to bisibele bath (a rice and lentil dish from the south) to sabudana khichdi (a savory pudding made from sago pearls and peanuts).
In India, even diet experts, fitness professionals and hospitals struggle to provide their clients accurate calorific counts and nutritional data, said Sheela Krishnaswamy, a clinical dietician based in Bangalore.
"Making a database of all Indian foods across cuisines and regions and enumerating their key nutrients and calories is a humongous task," said Ms. Krishnaswamy.
Experts like her have come up with their own approximations with the years of practice. But the average person still had to rely on advice doled out by friends, relatives and co-workers, she said.
In a country where diabetes and cardiovascular disease rates are alarming, any technology that can hold a mirror to the Indian diet is a dire need, said V. Bharathwaj, who runs Myndgenie, a counseling company that promises to reduce stress for professionals, athletes and students in Bangalore.
Mr. Bharathwaj, 40, himself found out the hard way when he was tested with very high levels of triglycerides during a routine blood test five years ago. He put himself through a weight-loss regimen and started looking closely at his diet. The three calorie counter apps on his smartphone were useless when it came to Indian cuisine.
"I had no clue that the six dosas and six dates I consumed daily at breakfast pumped in 900 calories," he said.
Each calorie-counter Internet site provided a different figure for popular Indian foods, and Mr. Bharathwaj worked out a range from the more reliable ones. He eventually taught himself to gauge calorific values of Indian foods over time.
But the general awareness about diet is poor among the average educated Indian. "Plus we are not a data-driven culture like the United States," he said.
The creators of HealthifyMe, which will be officially released March 1, hope to right this very information asymmetry. "Older relatives will keep telling you that desi ghee is good, paneer is great and that dal is entirely protein, all of which is so wrong," said Mr. Cherian. 
The app accommodates transliterations in a dozen Indian languages, and the database provides up to 100 micronutrients for each recipe. It makes thousands of standard Indian dishes customizable.
"Every family has its own khichdi (lentils & rice) recipe, for instance, and the app can calorie-track regional variations and tweaked recipes," Mr. Vashisht said.
The app's basic Android version is available free, but customers must pay for a premium version that can be customized and shared.
India's "global workforce," as it is often described, is increasingly tethered to the work desk. Compounding the situation is the fact that crowded, uneven pavements discourage walking and there are no jogging tracks or public-access playgrounds.
"It is really a lethal combination of what we eat and what we can't or don't do," said Mr. Cherian. He said his company hoped to begin articulating India's dietary expectations and eventually set off a process that would influence the health of its billion-plus citizens.

HEADLINE: German Politician's Remark Stirs Outcry Over Sexism

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY and CHRIS COTTRELL

 BODY:
BERLIN -- A comment by a male politician about how well a female journalist could ''fill out a dirndl'' has prompted an outcry from women across Germany and a furious debate over the prevalence of casual sexism in Europe's largest economy.
The unwelcome aside about the woman and the dirndl, the cleavage-revealing traditional dress, by Rainer Brüderle, a leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, led thousands of women to take to Twitter, sharing personal stories of humiliation, embarrassment and harassment under the hashtag ''aufschrei,'' German for ''outcry,'' in the days since the controversy arose. 
Newspapers and television talk shows have parsed the encounter between Mr. Brüderle and the journalist, Laura Himmelreich, which took place on the eve of a party congress last year. Ms. Himmelreich first wrote about it for the newsweekly Stern after Mr. Brüderle last week was named the top candidate for the Free Democrats in September's parliamentary election.
The article and ensuing furor came less than a month after the leading candidate for the left-leaning Social Democrats declared that Chancellor Angela Merkel benefited from a ''women's bonus'' with the electorate. That drew criticism, though on nothing like the scale of the recent controversy.
Mr. Brüderle tapped a deep vein of resentment among women here, particularly over their treatment in the workplace. Despite the fact that Germany is home to Ms. Merkel, one of the world's most powerful leaders, many professional women say gender relations are surprisingly backward for a developed country and years behind the United States when it comes to workplace equality and, in particular, sexual innuendo.
''Sexual harassment is all too often viewed as a trivial offense, taken as a misunderstanding of the situation because 'it was meant as a compliment,' '' said Sarah Elsuni, an interim professor for public law and gender studies at Humboldt University in Berlin.
She welcomed the debate for drawing attention to what she sees as a serious social problem that usually goes unpunished. ''Women are too often afraid to bring the issue up when it happens,'' she said.
Women in Germany earn on average 22 percent less than men in equivalent positions, placing them fourth from the bottom among their European counterparts in terms of pay equality and well below countries known for macho cultures, like Italy, Portugal and Romania. They are also underrepresented in top-level management. An effort to require equal representation on boards last year went nowhere.
A mother who spends more time focusing on her job than relatives and nosy neighbors deem appropriate is called ''Rabenmutter,'' or ''raven mother,'' an aspersion that sounds as though it came from the era of the Grimm brothers fairy tales but that is still in use today.
Nicole Simon, 42, a social media consultant in Germany, described the outpouring as an example of the years of pent-up frustration over episodes that are so common that women learn to simply block them out.
''Consensus online seemed to be, 'I thought I could not share these stories, but reading all the other things, I am surprised at how much I have suppressed over the years,' '' Ms. Simon wrote in an e-mail.
A woman who gave her name as Gudrun Lux posted about seeing her application for a job rejected because, she was told, ''the boss does not want any women of childbearing age.'' Another calling herself Su-Shee recounted interviewing a young male applicant who asked to see ''the real boss, the man.''
Mr. Brüderle, the politician, has refused to comment publicly on the accusations, and several members of his party have come to his defense. Long before the story broke, however, the Free Democrats came under criticism as an old boys' club.
''You are confronted with unbelievable headwinds if you are a woman,'' said Doris Buchholz, leader of a national group of women associated with the Free Democrats, in a telephone interview. ''I have experienced being told that they would like to have good-looking women on their election posters, 'because sex sells.' ''
The uproar could have political repercussions for Ms. Merkel as well. The Free Democrats are her party's coalition partner in government, and the party hoped that Mr. Brüderle would pull them out of a lasting tailspin that has seen the party drummed out of several state Parliaments. Instead, he has polarized their already fractured voting base. Without a strong showing by the Free Democrats in September Ms. Merkel could have a difficult time winning re-election.
Germany is no stranger to debates over women's roles and image in society. Recent years have seen the extension of parental benefits to include fathers and a push to expand publicly financed day care in an effort to help women with families and careers.
But the comments of many men who weighed in on Twitter reflected the heart of the problem. While there were voices of support, and even shame, at times the number of provocateurs making light of the debate overshadowed those voicing sympathy.
One man calling himself Blawpp wrote, ''The outcry campaign is good because it lets us know how psychotic women talk and think so we can better avoid them.'' Another named Christoph commented, ''Thank God I don't have any female colleagues who get upset every time I tell them to use their feminine charm more.''
According to the Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, 58 percent of German women say they have been subjected to sexual harassment, with more than 42 percent of the cases happening on the job.
Aynur Eroglu, a 20-year-old in Berlin who works in sales, says she is no stranger to sexual harassment at her job, where most of the customers are male.
''It happens all the time,'' Ms. Eroglu said. ''They get touchy or tell me how great my butt looks, saying they'd love to take me home.''
''All you can do is walk by and ignore them, or if it gets to be too much tell them to leave,'' she added. ''They don't always listen.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: After Fire, Some Brazilians Fault a Nation's Sense of Fatalism

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Lis Horta Moriconi contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Jill Langlois from São Paulo, Brazil.

 BODY:
SANTA MARIA, Brazil -- First there was the shock over the chaotic nightclub fire here that killed more than 230 people, many of them promising university students. Then there was the grief as families began burying their dead.
Now the soul-searching has begun, as Brazilians here and abroad ask how such a tragedy could have occurred in the first place.
''This is the most senseless thing I can imagine,'' said José Joel Canto, 64, a retired railroad worker whose daughter, Natana, a 21-year-old law student, died in the blaze early Sunday morning. ''One minute my daughter is dancing, having some fun with friends -- the next minute they are dead. I simply cannot comprehend it.'' 
Nor can many others in this country, setting off a debate across Brazilian society about how -- or even if -- the nation can prevent such a disaster from happening again.
''In a few weeks we will forget our dead, perhaps because we'll be crying over other dead as well, victims of tragedies which we know will occur,'' Sérgio Abranches, a sociologist in Rio de Janeiro, said in a scathing essay about the nightclub fire and the sense of fatalism with which Brazilians often react to such preventable disasters.
Of course, Brazil is far from the only country forced to confront such issues. Just in the last decade, lethal nightclub fires have broken out in Argentina, Russia and the United States. Yet the blaze here has stirred frustrations that the protections for human life that exist on paper are not vigorously enforced, even as Brazil wins plaudits for its vibrant democracy and economic might.
History has something to do with it. Large tragedies that could have been prevented, or at least alleviated to a large degree, have occurred for decades, occupying a painful place in the national consciousness.
In 2011, floods and landslides struck hillside communities precariously built in the state of Rio de Janeiro, leaving more than 600 people dead. In 1989, a boat of partygoers capsized near Rio, killing more than 50 people. And in 1961, a fire at a circus in the city of Niterói killed more than 500 people.
Then there are the smaller tragedies that barely register abroad but are all too common in Brazil. Bus crashes leave dozens of passengers dead. Office buildings collapse. The homicide rate, while lower in large cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro than it was a decade ago, remains higher nationwide than in Mexico, which is in the grip of a war against drug-trafficking organizations.
In another caustic assessment of the nightclub fire, the newspaper O Globo said in an editorial on Tuesday that an array of factors, involving ''administrative ineptitude, corruption, omission of public authorities and conformity of the common citizen,'' contributes to a loss of life in Brazil that is at once alarming and banal.
''The tragedy in Santa Maria imposes on society a reflection about a national culture of leniency,'' O Globo said, singling out traffic deaths on Brazil's roads during national holidays as another example of senseless tragedy in which individual responsibility plays a part.
Still, the swift reaction by the authorities to the nightclub fire has lifted hope among some Brazilians that it could be a turning point. The 1903 fire at Chicago's Iroquois Theater, which killed more than 600 people, spurred tougher safety standards in the United States, and many Brazilians are hoping for the same kind of reaction.
Police investigators detained four people for questioning on Monday, including two owners of the club who the authorities said had been operating with an expired permit and without a fire alarm or sprinklers.
Two members of the band suspected of starting the fire with a pyrotechnics display were also taken into custody. One inspector told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that band members had bought flares meant for outdoor use because they cost $1.25 a piece, compared with $35 for an indoor flare.
In other Brazilian cities, the authorities are reviewing code regulations and are raiding establishments found to be in violation. For instance, in Manaus, the largest city in the Brazilian Amazon, officials shut down 17 nightclubs, some which were found to have had empty fire extinguishers.
But scholars of Brazil's labyrinthine regulatory systems say the real work goes beyond a few arrests and inspections. Moacyr Duarte, a senior researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said complex and inefficient public bureaucracies remained an obstacle to disaster prevention, even as public budgets have been strengthened over the past decade.
''You can't create a police officer or a rescue worker like you do instant noodles, in three minutes,'' Mr. Duarte said. ''We don't need new measures. We need supervision and enhanced integration between public powers.''
But others questioned whether the disaster said anything about Brazil in particular, pointing out that no nation was immune to tragedy.
''You can't put the blame on Brazil or on any other country,'' said Cristiano Marinho, 38, a security guard in São Paulo.
Mr. Canto, the retiree whose daughter died in the fire, said that neither the club owners nor the band members were entirely to blame for the tragedy.
''Those responsible are the people we elected to protect us,'' he said.
''City Hall,'' he specified. ''They failed to prevent this from happening.''

HEADLINE: For Republicans, a Push From Voters on Immigration and a Tug on Gun Control

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Congress and the White House prepare to refight two epic policy battles from the past -- a new agenda to stem gun violence and another to address the nation's heavily criticized immigration system -- political, demographic and economic shifts are propelling immigration changes forward as forcefully as they are pulling lawmakers away on guns.
Bruised by successive presidential defeats in which Hispanic voters played a significant role, Republicans are eager to join in producing legislation that would make it easier for people to immigrate to the United States or stay here in some cases if they entered illegally. The cause has been helped by years of a sputtering economy, which has reduced the flow of illegal immigrants, and thus the red hot anger directed at them, as well as increased border security. 
But while Republicans are drawing back from their outspoken stance on immigration, as well as opposition to gay marriage and other social issues, they have found gun rights a secure policy to defend, often with the help of Democrats from conservative states, and are almost certain to oppose any agenda beyond changes to background checks for gun owners.
The dynamic in Washington mirrors the sentiment back home for many lawmakers. ''We are getting closer to a balanced approach,'' said Chad Connelly, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, about immigration. ''We got spanked in November, and I think what Republicans are looking for is something that enforces border security while making it easier to come here.''
Changes to gun laws, he said, have no such support. ''They will have a rough row to hoe,'' he said. ''I have some donors who own gun stores who said they can't keep stuff in the store.''
One of the most significant changes between 1994, when the omnibus crime bill instituting an assault weapons ban passed, and now, is the number of competitive House seats; there were more than 160 back then, now there are fewer than 100.
This means that Republicans in politically mixed districts who feel the pressure to vote for new gun control measures ''are fewer and farther between than there have ever been,'' said David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Democrats in Republican districts -- there are about a dozen of them -- would also be disinclined toward such legislation.
Further, there are Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 who are loath to get behind the president's broad gun agenda, which includes a renewal of the assault weapons ban, a restriction on ammunition size and new background checks. ''I am a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who said she is hearing both sides of the issue back home. ''Over all, the state is probably more supportive of less restrictions than more.''
Tellingly, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said on Monday that he was ''committed to ensuring that the Senate will consider legislation that addresses gun violence and other aspects of violence in our society early this year,'' but added that when it came to President Obama's immigration agenda, he would ''work tirelessly to make reform a reality in the Senate.''
In 1994, a group of House Republicans banded together to support a broad crime act that included an assault weapons ban. Part of the bill included tough crime measures that appealed to some of them, but it was still an enormous lift; in the end 46 Republicans supported the measure while 131 opposed it.
''I jumped off the cliff with Jon Kyl, who was running for the Senate that year,'' said former Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, referring to his colleague, the former conservative House member and senator from Arizona. The two flew to Tucson, where they faced angry voters at a public meeting, Mr. Kolbe said.
''We explained why we did it, why we thought it was a reasonable trade but a lot of people were very unhappy,'' Mr. Kolbe said. He noted that the National Rifle Association remained supportive -- an unlikely outcome today.
On the flip side, Republicans, who were deeply divided just two years ago on immigration issues now largely believe their party needs to be behind some legislation. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who made tough border enforcement the cornerstone of his 2010 re-election campaign, stood with Democrats this week to nearly reverse his position once again on the issue, saying he would seek a bipartisan plan.
''Necessity is the mother of political invention,'' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. ''Republicans are looking at a third straight presidential defeat if they don't improve their image with Hispanic voters.'' He added, ''You don't have a lot of Republicans walking around town saying he lost an election because of our bad relationship with the gun control lobby.''
A gun bill that is limited to background checks, however, still remains a strong possibility in Congress this year, if the Republican leadership of the House would bring such a measure on the floor. ''I was a co-sponsor of a conceal carry bill in Nebraska that had a significant background check component,'' said Senator Deb Fischer, a newly elected Republican from Nebraska.
Such a measure, many gun experts say, may actually do the most to stem gun violence, because it would help keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill and criminals. ''We might be in a happy place where effectiveness conforms with political feasibility,'' said Jon S. Vernick, the co-director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Surge More Than 5%, the Most Since 2006

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Home prices rose in November, climbing more than 5 percent from a year ago, in the biggest increase since August 2006, when the housing market was just starting to collapse. 
A separate economic report issued Tuesday, on consumer confidence in the United States, held less encouraging data, with moods falling to their lowest level in more than a year as Americans grew more pessimistic about the economic outlook and their financial prospects. In the latest sign that the housing sector is on the mend, the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas gained 0.6 percent in November, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in line with economists' forecasts.
Home prices in the 20 cities rose 5.5 percent year over year, making for the strongest yearly price increase in more than six years.
The housing market became a bright spot for the economy last year as prices rose and inventory tightened, and the sector is expected to contribute to economic growth in 2013.
''What we're seeing is really a gradual improvement in the overall economy,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist for Chase Private Client in New York.
Rising home prices and recent gains in the stock market should blunt the impact of tax increases for consumers and spending should improve by the second half of the year, Mr. Chan said.
Homebuyers also have been enticed by historically low interest rates. The Federal Reserve's latest stimulus efforts are helping to keep rates low, as the central bank buys assets including mortgage-backed securities.
November was the 10th month in a row that home prices increased. The rise in prices last year beat a nine-month run in 2009 and 2010, when the market was aided by a buyer tax credit.
Home prices on a nonadjusted basis slipped 0.1 percent. The nonadjusted numbers showed prices fell in about half of the cities covered by the report, with the winter months typically a weak period for housing, the survey said.
Phoenix led with the biggest yearly gain at 22.8 percent. New York was the only city to fall, down 1.2 percent from the previous year.
A number of challenges remain for the housing market, including tight access to mortgages and foreclosures.
Consumer attitudes dropped more than expected in January, to a reading of to 58.6, data from the Conference Board showed. It was the lowest reading since November 2011.
At the start of the year, lawmakers came to an agreement that averted a fiscal crisis, but the deal raised taxes for many Americans when a payroll tax holiday ended. ''Consumers are probably pretty unhappy to notice that their payroll taxes have gone up,'' said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York.

HEADLINE: Looking for New F.B.I. Headquarters, the Government Proposes a Trade

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For nearly 40 years, the F.B.I. has had its headquarters in a massive example of Brutalist architecture on Pennsylvania Avenue. But the federal government hopes to swap the building and its prime location for a sprawling new home in the suburbs, and there seem to be plenty of developers eager to help make that happen.
The General Services Administration, the federal government's landlord, held an ''industry day'' this month to lay out its wish list for new F.B.I. headquarters, drawing more than 450 interested developers, architects, brokers and consultants.
''The property on Pennsylvania Avenue is pretty much irreplaceable real estate,'' said P. Brian Connolly, senior vice president of Akridge, a major Washington real estate development and management firm. ''Real estate is all about location. It's just a great location.'' 
The G.S.A. meeting was the largest for any such offering in memory, administration officials said. Those in attendance included many well-known industry names, among them the engineering firm Greenhorne & O'Mara; the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Lockheed Martin; Booz Allen Hamilton; Siemens Government Technologies; Jones Lang LaSalle; Tishman Speyer; and Boston Properties.
''Everybody is salivating for this,'' said Ron Kendall, a real estate consultant representing a major local developer that did not want to be publicly identified.
When the monolithic F.B.I. building was completed on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1974, it was, if not a bright light, then at least a glimmer of hope in what was a stagnant downtown in the nation's capital. White flight from the shopping district had followed the 1968 racial riots, and private disinvestment had accelerated.
If the new building was austere and unwelcoming, with no ground floor windows or retail space, it seemed nonetheless to meet the needs of the agency for space to store files and house its thousands of employees, who it was hoped would inject a modicum of consumer spending into a commercial district that had fallen on hard times.
Today, the area around the building, named for the longtime director J. Edgar Hoover, is booming with new life -- new restaurants, upscale shops and high-end residential apartments -- in a stylish neighborhood now known as Penn Quarter. The building itself is deemed obsolete as headquarters for today's Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The G.S.A. hopes to find a developer willing to take over the 2.4 million-square-foot F.B.I. building, and the now highly valued land on which it sits, and build new, 2.1 million-square-foot headquarters on up to 55 acres in the Washington area.
Though the idea is still in its infancy, it has set off a spirited regional competition to land the prestigious federal agency, with local officials fielding calls from prospective developers and others. Written expressions of interest are due March 24 and the administration expects to issue a formal request for proposals this year.
The F.B.I. wants to consolidate its 11,000-employee headquarters staff, now scattered in 20 locations in the area, including the downtown building. For interested parties, it promises to be a high-stakes, long-term investment: any return could be years away, since the new headquarters must be built before the F.B.I. building is swapped. But enthusiasm still runs high.
The overflow crowd at this month's meeting ''bodes pretty well for this project,'' Daniel M. Tangherlini, acting administrator at the General Services Administration, told the group. ''We're looking at the interest of the market in doing this kind of business with us. The amount of interest has continued to grow.''
The F.B.I. building, Mr. Tangherlini said, served its purpose. ''It was developed as a giant file cabinet,'' he said, ''a disk drive before disk drives, to make storage and retrieval of paper easier. The F.B.I. is much less about that now; they're stuck with a building representing the technology of a generation or two ago.''
He said it would be too costly to renovate or to demolish and rebuild the F.B.I. building at its current site. ''It costs too much to operate and diminishes the quality of downtown,'' he said. ''The neighborhood is completely different now.''
But there is more to the project than the F.B.I.'s changing needs. A politically damaging scandal over conference expenses last year forced Mr. Tangherlini's predecessor to resign and brought about a ''top to bottom review'' of the agency's operations, Mr. Tangherlini said, leading it to tighten its belt by looking for new and more economical ways to house government agencies.
Thus, the government wants to dispose of unused or underused properties and, in the case of the F.B.I., take advantage of the property to get a new headquarters building that will cost the government less. The G.S.A. is also seeking to sell an unused heating plant in Georgetown and several underused federal buildings in southwest Washington, but meetings on those projects each turned out only 100 interested parties.
Politics could also play a part in the ultimate decision. Members of Maryland's Congressional delegation, including both senators and Steny H. Hoyer, the House minority whip, have publicly supported a site in Prince George's County, part of which is in Mr. Hoyer's district. A Senate committee resolution said the new headquarters should be within two miles of a Metro station and two and a half miles from the Beltway, but Mr. Tangherlini said the G.S.A. would be flexible in applying those requirements.
At the January meeting, David S. Iannucci, an economic development official in Prince George's County, was seen chatting with representatives from the Atlanta office of Walton Development and Management, whose headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta.
Mr. Iannucci said the firm had recently purchased 2,000 acres in his county, where land is cheaper than in some other jurisdictions. ''We get phone calls practically every day from regional and national developers'' interested in the F.B.I. project, he said. ''All the jurisdictions in the area are focusing on this.''
Steven A. Silverman, Mr. Iannucci's counterpart in neighboring Montgomery County, Md., said: ''We are all suggesting possible sites based on what the private sector is telling us. This is the largest real estate deal in the last 10 years, and of course we're interested.''
Officials in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia are also in the game. Jim Herbert, economic development officer for Loudoun County, Va., home to Dulles International Airport, said his jurisdiction, in the suburban outer ring, offered a planned extension of the region's commuter Metrorail system and more undeveloped farmland. ''You get more for the dollar if you don't have to deal with pre-existing structures,'' he said. ''We've got a lot of developers who are very interested.''
Mr. Connolly, of Akridge, noted that more than land would be involved in meeting the agency's requirements.
''Anything the F.B.I. does is going to be a highly secured campus, is going to have a very sophisticated communications system, very sophisticated electronic demands and needs,'' he said. ''There will be plenty of redundancy built into the project, because the F.B.I. can never afford to lose power.''

HEADLINE: European Cloud Over Ford

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Last year, Ford Motor broke ranks with other auto companies when it announced major cuts in its troubled European operations, including the closing of three factories, to address a sharp downturn in sales on the continent and an oversupply of vehicles.
On Tuesday, Ford, the second-biggest American automaker, behind General Motors, startled the industry again by predicting that Europe, a critical market, would get worse before it begins improving later this year. 
Ford said European auto sales, including commercial vehicles, could fall as low as 13 million this year, and its own annual losses in the region could reach $2 billion. Europe is Ford's second-largest market, after North America.
''The industry did 14 million last year, and that was the worst in 20 years,'' Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, said in an interview. ''But the industry is continuing to decline, and we think 13 million is the trough.''
The dire predictions for Europe overshadowed what were otherwise positive fourth-quarter results, which Ford reported on Tuesday.
The company reported a 54 percent gain in adjusted fourth-quarter profit as strong earnings in North America compensated for heavy losses in Europe. Ford said it earned $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $1.03 billion a year earlier, excluding the impact of tax-valuation allowances in 2011. Those allowances inflated last year's fourth-quarter net income to $13.6 billion.
For the full year, Ford said it earned $5.67 billion, a 5 percent drop from $5.97 billion in 2011, not including the tax-valuation changes, which increased the 2011 earnings to $20.2 billion.
The auto market in Western Europe remains abysmal, but some analysts agree with Ford's assessment that sales may be close to their low point and could start to recover late this year as the euro zone crisis subsides.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast that European auto sales would fall an additional 2.2 percent in 2013, to 12.9 million vehicles. But they will rise 3.9 percent in 2014, Goldman predicted, as car buyers start to feel more secure about their economic prospects.
In the meantime, though, companies like General Motors' Opel unit and PSA Peugeot Citröen are trying to make broad reductions in jobs and production capacity.
The recovery, if it comes, could be too late for many workers and even some of the manufacturers.
The companies that have suffered the most are those that depend on the mass market and on southern Europe, including Fiat, Peugeot and Renault. Steady declines in sales since 2007 have left two-thirds of European auto plants operating at a loss, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated.
North American sales have been a bright spot for the world's automakers, and Ford is no exception. Ford's overall revenue in the fourth quarter was $36.5 billion, a 5 percent increase from $34.6 billion in the same period a year earlier. For all of 2012, revenue was $134.3 billion, 1 percent less than $136.3 billion in 2011.
Healthy sales of new vehicles in North America resulted in good profit margins, particularly in the United States, where the overall industry grew 13 percent last year.
Ford said it had $1.87 billion in pretax earnings in North America during the quarter, a 110 percent increase from $889 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For all of 2012, Ford had pretax profit of $8.34 billion in North America, compared with $6.19 billion in 2011.
But the company's European operations continued to struggle as overall demand plunged, particularly in southern Europe.Ford reported a $732 million pretax loss in Europe for the fourth quarter, compared with a $190 million loss in the same period in 2011.
For all of 2012, Ford said it had a pretax loss of $1.75 billion in the region. By comparison, the company reported a loss of $27 million in Europe for all of 2011.
Investors, apparently shaken by the scale of the losses and Ford's dismal forecast for 2013, sent the automaker's shares down nearly 5 percent to $13.14 in Tuesday's trading.
Industry analysts said Ford's fourth-quarter European losses were higher than they had expected. They expressed doubt about how soon demand would recover in hard-hit markets like France, Italy and Spain.
''Management indicated that Europe would be worse in 2013, suggested that the bottom has not necessarily been reached,'' Matthew Stover, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said in a research note to investors.
Ford plans to reduce its production capacity in Europe by 18 percent and eliminate 5,700 jobs by next year. The company will close an assembly plant in Belgium and two factories in England as part of that cost-cutting.
Mr. Shanks said Ford was confident that the European industry would begin a steady recovery by 2014 and that Ford could again be profitable there by mid-decade.
However, he did not rule out further cost-cutting measures if demand continued to deteriorate. ''If we think we need to do more, we will do more,'' he said.
Other auto companies in the region are expected to post weak fourth-quarter results, starting with the Italian automaker Fiat, which is scheduled to report its 2012 earnings on Wednesday.
G.M. is trying to accelerate the planned 2016 closing of an assembly plant in Bochum, Germany. But efforts to cut factory capacity have met resistance from labor unions. On Tuesday, the union representing Opel workers reiterated a demand that G.M. guarantee jobs at its German plants for another four years.
While Europe is Ford's most pressing trouble spot, the company also faces challenges in South America and Asia.
Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the company's efforts to globalize its products have helped it weather the downturn in Europe while it expands in Asia and delivers new models in North America.
The company's strong performance in North America translated into hefty profit-sharing checks for its American workers. Ford said it would pay an average of $8,300 to each of its 45,800 hourly workers in March.

HEADLINE: It's P.Q. And C.Q. as Much as I.Q.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
President Obama's first term was absorbed by dealing with the Great Recession. I hope that in his second term he'll be able to devote more attention to the Great Inflection.
Dealing with the Great Recession was largely about ''Yes We Can'' -- about government, about what we can and must do ''together'' to shore up the safety nets and institutions that undergird our society and economy. Obama's Inaugural Address was a full-throated defense of that ''public'' side of the unique public-private partnership that makes America great. But, if we're to sustain the kind of public institutions and safety nets that we're used to, it will require a lot more growth by the private side (not just more taxes), a lot more entrepreneurship, a lot more start-ups and a lot more individual risk-taking -- things the president rarely speaks about. And it will all have to happen in the context of the Great Inflection. 
What do I mean by the Great Inflection? I mean something very big happened in the last decade. The world went from connected to hyperconnected in a way that is impacting every job, industry and school, but was largely disguised by post-9/11 and the Great Recession. In 2004, I wrote a book, called ''The World Is Flat,'' about how the world was getting digitally connected so more people could compete, connect and collaborate from anywhere. When I wrote that book, Facebook, Twitter, cloud computing, LinkedIn, 4G wireless, ultra-high-speed bandwidth, big data, Skype, system-on-a-chip (SOC) circuits, iPhones, iPods, iPads and cellphone apps didn't exist, or were in their infancy.
Today, not only do all these things exist, but, in combination, they've taken us from connected to hyperconnected. Now, notes Craig Mundie, one of Microsoft's top technologists, not just elites, but virtually everyone everywhere has, or will have soon, access to a hand-held computer/cellphone, which can be activated by voice or touch, connected via the cloud to infinite applications and storage, so they can work, invent, entertain, collaborate and learn for less money than ever before. Alas, though, every boss now also has cheaper, easier, faster access to more above-average software, automation, robotics, cheap labor and cheap genius than ever before. That means the old average is over. Everyone who wants a job now must demonstrate how they can add value better than the new alternatives.
When the world gets this hyperconnected, adds Mundie, the speed with which every job and industry changes also goes into hypermode. ''In the old days,'' he said, ''it was assumed that your educational foundation would last your whole lifetime. That is no longer true.'' Because of the way every industry -- from health care to manufacturing to education -- is now being transformed by cheap, fast, connected computing power, the skill required for every decent job is rising as is the necessity of lifelong learning. More and more things you know and tools you use ''are being made obsolete faster,'' added Mundie. It's as if every aspect of our lives is now being driven by Moore's Law. This is exacerbating our unemployment problem.
In their terrific book, ''Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy,'' Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology note that for the last two centuries it happened that productivity, median income and employment all tracked each other nicely. ''So most economists have had this feeling that if you just boost productivity, the pie grows, and, in the long run, everything else takes care of itself,'' explained Brynjolfsson in an interview. ''But there is no economic law that says technological progress has to benefit everyone. It's entirely possible for the pie to get bigger and some people to get a smaller slice.'' Indeed, when the digital revolution gets so cheap, fast, connected and ubiquitous you see this in three ways, Brynjolfsson added: those with more education start to earn much more than those without it, those with the capital to buy and operate machines earn much more than those who can just offer their labor, and those with superstar skills, who can reach global markets, earn much more than those with just slightly less talent.
Put it all together, he added, and you can understand, why the Great Recession took the biggest bite out of employment but is not the only thing affecting job loss today: why we have record productivity, wealth and innovation, yet median incomes are falling, inequality is rising and high unemployment remains persistent.
How to adapt? It will require more individual initiative. We know that it will be vital to have more of the ''right'' education than less, that you will need to develop skills that are complementary to technology rather than ones that can be easily replaced by it and that we need everyone to be innovating new products and services to employ the people who are being liberated from routine work by automation and software. The winners won't just be those with more I.Q. It will also be those with more P.Q. (passion quotient) and C.Q. (curiosity quotient) to leverage all the new digital tools to not just find a job, but to invent one or reinvent one, and to not just learn but to relearn for a lifetime. Government can and must help, but the president needs to explain that this won't just be an era of ''Yes We Can.'' It will also be an era of ''Yes You Can'' and ''Yes You Must.''

HEADLINE: French Automakers' Biggest Problem Is the French Consumer

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Shoppers at the Citroën showroom on the Champs-Élysées were conspicuous mostly by their absence on a recent weekday. Earnest-looking employees outnumbered the lone visitor by at least 10 to 1.
Two of the workers were busy refining their already considerable skills at an auto-racing video game.
Down the avenue at the Renault showroom, business was hardly brisker.
Only at the nearby Mercedes-Benz showroom, displaying German automotive arts, was there much sign of life. 
The dormant French dealerships signify the main problem facing the country's auto industry: Consumers in France do not seem very interested in French cars. Or any cars at all, in many cases.
In France, vehicle sales last year were the lowest in 15 years, falling below 1.9 million from a 2009 peak of 2.3 million, according to Georges Dieng, an analyst at Natixis Securities. And even those who are prospective buyers often prefer non-French makes.
Esther Cintract, 40, a banker who takes the Métro to commute into Paris, owns a 10-year-old Citroën. For her next car, she said, she would consider switching to a German model: a Volkswagen, a BMW or a Mercedes.
But many younger French people have other priorities. ''I've never had a car,'' said Jean-Victor Mareschal, 30, who works at a bookstore in Paris. ''I don't need one. I ride a bike, walk or take the Métro.''
In contrast to the United States, where carmakers had a bumper year, France's 2012 sales fell by 13.9 percent, outpacing the 8.2 percent decline in the overall European market, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Industry officials expect another gloomy year in 2013.
The flagging appetite of consumers is a significant economic problem for France. Its auto industry, dominated by Citroën's parent, PSA Peugeot Citroën, and Renault, directly employs about 220,000 people; thousands more jobs depend on it indirectly. The government, which owns a 15 percent stake in Renault, has called the sector a strategic priority, and plays an active role -- some might say actively meddles -- in the industry's affairs.
The downturn is not France's alone. In 2007, before the global financial crisis, the overall European market peaked at just under 16 million newly registered passenger vehicles. Last year, the figure had fallen to just over 12 million, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
Wherever the market bottoms out, French automakers, like many European manufacturers, have more factory capacity and workers than they can profitably use. And that may be the case for years to come -- especially in France, where the job-cutting plans announced so far by Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën have been criticized by many analysts as insufficiently daring, even as they encounter fierce resistance from workers and, in some cases, government officials.
But it is a showdown that appears to be increasingly unrelated to the French market's demands. Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London, noted that most vehicle purchases in the developed world over the last five years had been to replace older cars, with only 2 percent of car sales in the United States and Europe representing net additions to those regions' consumer fleets. In emerging markets, by contrast, 70 percent of new-car sales represented additions to the total stock, Mr. Houchois said.
But even replacement demand is under threat in Europe. As the population ages, car owners drive less, reducing wear on their vehicles. And today's cars last much longer than they did a few decades ago.
Generational change also bodes ill for the industry. Carmakers can be confident that many of those who adopt the car-based lifestyle early will stick with it for life. But the younger customers the industry covets are less interested in driving than they used to be -- particularly, it seems, in France and especially in trendsetting Paris.
''In my parents' generation, pretty much everyone drives,'' said Mr. Mareschal, the bookstore employee. ''With my generation, it's a lot less important. I'm not anti-car, but it's something I just don't care about.''
Being able to go without a car may seem like a luxury available mainly to city dwellers, but even outside the cities, interest in auto ownership seems to have flagged.
''There appears to be a change in priorities for this generation,'' Mr. Houchois said. ''Maybe they'd rather buy a plane ticket for a vacation in Australia than buy a car.''
It is not hard to see why young people would have their doubts about the merits of car ownership. For a start, operating a car is an expensive proposition: Gasoline goes for the euro per liter equivalent of about $7.65 a gallon in France, according to the Economy Ministry, more than double the $3.30-a-gallon average the Energy Information Administration reported for the United States in mid-January.
And unlike the United States, where driver's education classes are often an inexpensive part of the high school curriculum, simply obtaining a driver's license is a major obstacle. In France, there is a minimum cost of more than $1,600 for classes needed to prepare for the written exam and the even more difficult driving test. Nearly 1.4 million people take the French licensing tests each year, but only 57 percent pass; those who fail often spend thousands more preparing for a retest.
Julie Mora, 24, a grocery store cashier, said she would like to have a car to travel around the Essonne suburbs south of Paris where she lives, but has no opportunity to prepare for the licensing exam. ''I work almost every day as it is,'' she said, ''so it's practically impossible to set aside the time for the classes.''
But Ms. Mora said she could wait. ''For my generation, a car and a smartphone are about equally desirable,'' she said, ''and I already have a phone.''
French automakers may also face the kind of buyer skepticism American car companies encountered a generation or two ago, when domestic consumers often felt the choice came down to buying the best car -- meaning a foreign one -- or supporting their compatriots' jobs.
But Mr. Houchois at UBS said the difference in performance between carmakers, at least at the market-entry level, had declined substantially, to the point that other factors, like brand cachet and financing, were more the determining factors.
He noted that French buyers looking at three similar and similarly priced cars -- a Peugeot 308, a Renault Mégane and a Volkswagen Golf -- would probably find that they could finance the Golf at better terms, because of the German maker's stronger balance sheet. That, Mr. Houchois said, was enough to make the decision for many.
By other measures, the French carmakers may still have some ground to make up. J. D. Power, the customer-satisfaction auto research firm, does not survey French car buyers directly. But its studies of buyer preferences in the German and British markets show both major French automakers ranking below-average in owner satisfaction.
In any case, VW is not waiting to ease up in France. The German company is aggressively aiming for French customers. Mr. Houchois said French automakers needed to recognize that the current business model was simply no longer working.
One approach, he said, might be more emphasis on the American Zipcar rental model of car-sharing, or other shared-ownership arrangements, rather than sales to individuals. Such services are still at the fledgling stage in France.
''But the French carmakers, all the European actors, should plan their turnarounds on the assumption of no growth,'' Mr. Houchois said.
''It's hard to make a case for growth in Europe.''

HEADLINE: Judge Dismisses Federal Suit Over Credit Histories in Hiring

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
A federal judge in Ohio has dismissed a lawsuit that accused the Kaplan Higher Education Corporation of discriminating against black job applicants.
In a ruling issued on Monday, Judge Patricia A. Gaughan of the Northern District of Ohio granted partial summary judgment in a case in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had contended that Kaplan in effect discriminated against African-American applicants by rejecting some job seekers because of their credit histories. The commission has asserted that rejections based on aspects of applicant's credit histories, like falling behind on bill-paying, have a disparate effect on black applicants without being directly relevant to their future job performance. 
Judge Gaughan granted Kaplan's motion to exclude an expert witness for the E.E.O.C., concluding that the way he determined which applicants were black was unscientific and unreliable. The expert witness had assembled a group of five ''race raters'' to look at photos of the job applicants and then say which ones they thought were black.
In granting the motion to exclude the expert's testimony, Judge Gaughan said the commission no longer had the evidence needed to make its case.
Kaplan, which is a unit of The Washington Post Company, welcomed the ruling. ''Kaplan maintained from the beginning that the E.E.O.C. lawsuit was without merit,'' the company said in a statement. ''Our practices mirrored what is standard practice for many private companies and some government agencies.''
A spokeswoman for the E.E.O.C. said that the commission ''is reviewing the district court's decision carefully and is considering all options.''
Several states, including Hawaii, Oregon and Illinois, have banned or limited the use of credit reports in hiring, partly out of concern that this practice could prevent unemployed, financially pressed Americans from getting back into the work force.

HEADLINE: Pfizer's Earnings Strengthen Market Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The January rally on Wall Street appeared to be running out of steam on Monday, as stocks pulled back from their highs, but on Tuesday they resumed their climb.
The drug maker Pfizer, in particular, helped to extend the stock market rally, posting strong earnings and nudging the Dow closer to 14,000. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 72.49 points, or 0.52 percent, to 13,954.42, ending higher for the seventh time in eight sessions. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also rose, adding 7.66 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,507.84. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.64 point, or 0.02 percent, to 3,153.66.
Demand was bolstered at the start of the year after lawmakers reached a deal to avoid a fiscal impasse, and was sustained by evidence that the housing market was recovering and the jobs market was slowly healing.
The Dow is 6.5 percent higher this month, and the S.& P. 500 is up 5.7 percent. Both indexes are at their highest levels in more than five years.
Pfizer was the biggest gainer in the Dow, advancing 86 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $27.70, after the company said its fourth-quarter profit more than quadrupled because of a $4.8 billion gain from selling its nutrition business and despite competition from generic drugs hurting sales.
The home builder D. R. Horton gained $2.51, or 11.8 percent, to $23.82, after posting net income that more than doubled as the housing recovery took hold.
Analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings for 2012 to increase by an average of 4.7 percent for S.& P. 500 companies, according to the latest data from S&P Capital IQ. In the previous quarter, profit grew 2.4 percent.
Valero Energy, a refinery operator, was the biggest gainer in the S.& P. 500. The company's stock climbed $4.96, or 13 percent, to $43.77, after it said that fourth-quarter profit soared on higher refining margins, as it swapped out foreign crude for cheaper domestic oil.
Investor optimism was checked by a report that showed consumer confidence sank in January to the lowest level in more than a year as Americans grew concerned about the economic outlook and higher Social Security taxes. The Conference Board said that its consumer confidence index dropped to 58.6 in January.
Stocks also failed to get much of a lift from a report published before the market opened showing that the housing market was sustaining its recovery.
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.5 percent in November compared with the same month a year ago, pushed higher by rising sales and a tighter supply of available homes.
The Federal Reserve started a two-day meeting Tuesday. Investors will watch for the Fed's statement on Wednesday for clues about the outlook for the economy and interest rates.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 96 22/32, and the yield rose to 2 percent, from 1.97 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: In Shift, an Activist Enlists Same-Sex Couples in a Pro-Marriage Coalition

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER

 BODY:
David Blankenhorn, a traditional-marriage advocate and star witness in the Proposition 8 trial in California in 2010, shocked his allies with an Op-Ed article in The New York Times last June announcing that he was quitting the fight against same-sex marriage. ''Instead of fighting gay marriage,'' Mr. Blankenhorn wrote, ''I'd like to help build new coalitions bringing together gays who want to strengthen marriage with straight people who want to do the same.''
He is about to find out how much support such a coalition can get. 
On Thursday, Mr. Blankenhorn's research group, the Institute for American Values in New York, plans to issue ''A Call for a New Conversation on Marriage,'' a tract renouncing the culture war that he was once part of, in favor of a different pro-marriage agenda. The proposed conversation will try to bring together gay men and lesbians who want to strengthen marriage with heterosexuals who want to do the same.
The document is signed by 74 well-known activists, writers and scholars, on the left and the right, including the conservative John Podhoretz, editor of Commentary magazine; John Corvino, a gay philosopher; Robert N. Bellah, a sociologist; Caitlin Flanagan, a social critic; and Glenn C. Loury, an economist -- once conservative, now less so.
''While the nation's attention is riveted by a debate about whether a small proportion of our fellow citizens (gays and lesbians) should be allowed to marry,'' the statement reads, ''marriage is rapidly dividing along class lines, splitting the country that it used to unite.''
Nine states as well as the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage.
Though he has long been a foe of same-sex marriage, Mr. Blankenhorn, who was raised in Mississippi and attended Harvard, never invoked a religious justification and did not oppose civil unions for gay men and lesbians. Instead, he argued that heterosexual marriage was society's most important institution, central to child rearing.
The new coalition, according to the institute's manifesto, would be for anyone who wonders, ''If unwed childbearing is not good for teens, is it good for twenty-somethings?'' Or for those eager to know, ''What economic policies strengthen marriage? What marriage policies create wealth?''
''New Conversation'' is the capstone of a six-month period of rebuilding and rebranding for Mr. Blankenhorn. After his Op-Ed article appeared, five of his institute's board members, including Robert P. George, a prominent conservative Catholic and Princeton professor, resigned almost immediately. The institute lost about half a million dollars in donations, ''half our discretionary spending,'' Mr. Blankenhorn said, referring to money not given by foundations for specific programs. ''We're in a real steep hole,'' he added. ''I laid two people off and am losing one by attrition.''
The staff members, Mr. Blankenhorn wishes he had back. But losing the board members most inflexibly opposed to same-sex marriage allowed him to retool. Mr. Blankenhorn added to his board a gay journalist, Jonathan Rauch, the author of the book ''Gay Marriage,'' and Francis Fukuyama, author of ''The End of History and the Last Man.'' And Mr. Blankenhorn made William A. Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton now at the liberal Brookings Institution, the chairman of the board.
The ''new conversation'' may discomfit many conservatives by including gay men and lesbians. And this conversation may not suit many liberals who are wary of stigmatizing unwed parents or treating marriage as some sort of desirable norm.
As a result, this new coalition may have more luck gaining a few prominent supporters than gaining funds.
''David's personal networks are liberal, but his donor networks are quite conservative,'' said Maggie Gallagher, who used to work at the Institute for American Values and is a well-known opponent of same-sex marriage. It can be tough to find money for what could be called a centrist agenda, Ms. Gallagher cautioned, adding that there may be more conservatives willing to accept gay allies than liberals willing to publicly support marriage. Some financing, she said, ''will be conservative, but the pro-marriage liberals have to step forward, and maybe make it more 50-50.''
Sean Fieler, the president of Equinox Partners, a New York hedge fund, was Mr. Blankenhorn's largest donor, until he quit the board. Mr. Fieler, whose average annual donation ''ranged from $200,000 to $250,000,'' said that a pro-marriage movement could not so easily accept gay and lesbian allies, not if they were seeking marriage rights.
''The problem with gay marriage and the position David has taken,'' Mr. Fieler said, ''is it promotes a very harmful myth about the gay lifestyle. It suggests that gay relationships lend themselves to monogamy, stability, health and parenting in the same way heterosexual relationships do. That's not true.''
But a ''New Conversation'' signatory, Mr. Galston, of the Brookings Institution, said there was no reason that nontraditional families should be excluded from the important discussion at hand: why ''marriage and intact families are now becoming markers of a class divide.'' Increasingly, he said, it is college-educated and middle-class people who are getting married, regardless of sexual orientation.
The debate, he said, should not be about gay versus straight but about why so few poor people are choosing the benefits of marriage.
Mr. Rauch, who has long been criticized by fellow gay writers for being too conservative, said that it is time to raise different questions: ''What does, so to speak, the sexual-orientation-blind, pro-family agenda look like?'' he asked. ''The family values agenda for the postgay world?''

HEADLINE: Modesty in Hasidic Brooklyn Is Enforced by Secret Squads

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The Brooklyn shopkeeper was already home for the night when her phone rang: a man who said he was from a neighborhood ''modesty committee'' was concerned that the mannequins in her store's window, used to display women's clothing, might inadvertently arouse passing men and boys.
''The man said, 'Do the neighborhood a favor and take it out of the window,' '' the store's manager recalled. '' 'We're trying to safeguard our community.' ''
In many neighborhoods, a store owner might shrug off such a call. But on Lee Avenue, the commercial spine of Hasidic Williamsburg, the warning carried an implied threat -- comply with community standards or be shunned. It is a potent threat in a neighborhood where shadowy, sometimes self-appointed modesty squads use social and economic leverage to enforce conformity. 
The owner wrestled with the request for a day or two, but decided to follow it. ''We can sell it without mannequins, so we might as well do what the public wants,'' the owner told the manager, who asked not to be identified because of fear of reprisals for talking.
In the close-knit world of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, community members know the modesty rules as well as Wall Street bankers who show up for work in a Brooks Brothers suit. Women wear long skirts and long-sleeved, high-necked blouses on the street; men do not wear Bermuda shorts in summer. Schools prescribe the color and thickness of girls' stockings.
The rules are spoken and unspoken, enforced by social pressure but also, in ways that some find increasingly disturbing, by the modesty committees. Their power is evident in the fact that of the half dozen women's clothing stores along Lee Avenue, only one features mannequins, and those are relatively shapeless, fully clothed torsos.
The groups have long been a part of daily life in the ultra-Orthodox communities that dot Brooklyn and other corners of the Jewish world. But they sprang into public view with the trial of Nechemya Weberman, a prominent member of the Satmar Hasidim in Brooklyn, who last week was sentenced to 103 years in prison after being convicted of sexually abusing a young girl sent to him for counseling.
Mr. Weberman, an unlicensed therapist, testified during his trial that boys and girls -- though not his accuser -- were regularly referred to him by a Hasidic modesty committee concerned about what it viewed as inappropriate attire and behavior.
The details were startling: a witness for Mr. Weberman's defense, Baila Gluck, testified that masked men representing a modesty committee in the Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel, N.Y., 50 miles northwest of New York City, broke into her bedroom about seven years ago and confiscated her cellphone.
The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who prosecuted the Weberman case, has now received allegations that members of a modesty committee forced their way into a home in the borough, confiscating an iPad and computer equipment deemed inappropriate for Orthodox children, officials say. Allegations have also surfaced that a modesty committee threatened to publicly shame a married man who was having an affair unless he paid the members money for what they described as therapy.
''They operate like the Mafia,'' said Rabbi Allan Nadler, director of the Jewish studies program at Drew University in Madison, N.J.
Rabbi Nadler, who testified at Mr. Weberman's trial, said that modesty committees did not have addresses, stationery or business cards, and that few people seemed to know where their authority originated, though it was doubtful, he said, that they could continue operating without the tacit blessings of rabbinical leaders.
''They walk into a store and say it would be a shame if your window was broken or you lost your clientele,'' he said. ''They might tell the father of a girl who wears a skirt that's too short and he's, say, a store owner: 'If you ever want to sell a pair of shoes, speak to your daughter.' ''
In Israel, there have been similar concerns. Though no modesty committee was overtly involved, there has been anger over ultra-Orthodox zealots who spit on and insulted an 8-year-old girl for walking to school through their neighborhood in a dress they considered immodest.
In Brooklyn, Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who has represented the heavily Hasidic neighborhood of Borough Park for 30 years, said that he had never met a modesty committee member, but that ''there are a lot of independent operators that believe they are protecting God and have to do this kind of stuff, and that's sickening and gives us all a black eye.''
''If you want to advocate modesty,'' he added, ''do your thing, but when you stuff it down my throat physically, that undermines us and hurts us.''
Hasidic leaders contend that the modesty committees are nothing more than self-appointed individuals who, indignant at some perceived infraction, take matters into their own hands.
''These are individual people who decide to take on this crusade,'' said Rabbi David Niederman, who as president of the United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg is a sometime spokesman for the Satmar Hasidim. ''You see posters telling people do this and do that. It does not represent an authorized body.''
But many Hasidim say they have seen or heard how a shadowy group of men seeks to pressure parents to rein in children who wear dresses too short or stockings too thin, or who chat on cellphones with friends of the opposite sex. One family reported being harassed because the wife had stepped outdoors with a robelike housecoat rather than a long dress.
While many of the rules of conduct are announced on Yiddish broadsides posted on trees, lampposts and walls, residents of Hasidic neighborhoods say some store owners have received rough verbal warnings from a modesty committee to stop selling magazines that carry photographs considered too revealing, or articles that dispute the Satmar Hasidim's belief that Israel should not have existed until the Messiah's arrival.
The Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada, in addition to certifying foods as kosher and adjudicating matrimonial and commercial disputes, does at times remind the Satmar community of the community's modesty rules. It is made up of scores of rabbis, but it has an address -- it is housed on the second floor of a Williamsburg row house -- and it signs every decree it issues.
''We give out proclamations,'' said Rabbi Yitzchok Glick, its executive director. ''We don't enforce. It's like people can decide to keep Shabbos or not. If someone wants to turn on the light on Shabbos, we cannot put him in jail for that.''
But Hasidim interviewed said squads of enforcers did exist in wildcat form.
''There are quite a few men, especially in Williamsburg, who consider themselves Gut's polizei,'' said Yosef Rapaport, a Hasidic journalist, using the words for ''God's police.''
''It's somebody who is a busybody, and they're quite a few of them -- zealots who take it upon themselves and they just enforce. They're considered crazy, but people don't want to confront them.''

HEADLINE: Reforming Immigration for Good

BYLINE: By MAE M. NGAI. 
Mae M. Ngai, a professor of history and Asian-American studies at Columbia, is the author of ''Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America.''

 BODY:
IN Las Vegas yesterday, President Obama made it clear that an overhaul of America's immigration laws was his top domestic priority. He expressed cautious support for a bipartisan plan by eight senators that would create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in exchange for tougher border enforcement, employment checks and temporary work visas for farmworkers and highly skilled engineers and scientists.
Many critical details are still missing, but the general framework is notable for its familiarity. Variations on all of these measures have been tried before, with mixed results. Legalization of the undocumented is humane and practical, but the proposals for controlling future immigration are almost certain to fail. 
The promise to ''secure the border'' made for good politics even before 1986, when Congress passed the last comprehensive immigration reform bill. In the last quarter-century we have spent approximately $187 billion on enforcement, mostly along the United States-Mexico border. This included a ninefold increase in the size of the Border Patrol since 1980; nearly 700 miles of fencing; and the deployment of surveillance drones and motion sensors. These efforts reduced but did not stop unauthorized entries (only the Great Recession was able to reduce the net flow of Mexican illegal immigration to effectively zero). In fact, the hazards of crossing an increasingly militarized border led many Mexican workers to settle permanently in the United States.
Similarly, proposals for a new guest worker program, which were scuttled from the 1986 legislation because of opposition from labor and immigrant advocates, should again give us pause. From the agricultural ''Bracero Program'' of the 1940s and '50s to the current H-2 visa for temporary unskilled labor, these programs are notorious for employer abuse.
If we really want to tackle unauthorized migration, we need to understand why it exists in the first place. The most important cause is our system of allocating green cards, or visas for permanent residency, which stipulates that no country may have more than 7 percent of the total each year. With an annual ceiling of 366,000 family- and employer-sponsored visas, the per-country limit is 25,620.
In practice, this means it is easy to immigrate here from, say, Belgium or New Zealand, but there are long waits -- sometimes decades -- for applicants from China, India, Mexico and the Philippines. These four max out on the limit every year. When critics admonish prospective immigrants -- as well as the 11 million plus undocumented migrants currently in America -- to ''go to the back of the line,'' they should realize that for many people the line is a cruel joke.
The United States has followed this one-size-fits-all rule since 1965. It was, admittedly, a vast improvement over the blatantly discriminatory national-origins quota system, which since the 1920s had favored migration from Northern and Western Europe and excluded Asians altogether. But we can do better.
One alternative might be a plan introduced by Senator Philip A. Hart, a Michigan Democrat, in the early 1960s. Senator Hart, who died in 1976, gave his name to the 1965 immigration law, along with Representative Emanuel Celler, a New York Democrat. But before that, he proposed a system that would have given 20 percent of the visas to refugees; 32 percent to countries in proportion to the size of their populations (recognizing need); and 48 percent to countries in proportion to their amount of emigration in the last 15 years (supporting family unification and existing ties in immigrant communities in the United States).
To keep the immigration stream diverse, he proposed maximum and minimum per-country limits. The overall ceiling and the distribution would be revisited every five years to reflect changing conditions. Finally, Senator Hart recommended continuing the policy of pan-Americanism, which had long exempted countries in the Western Hemisphere from quota restrictions.
The proposal had broad support, but the Kennedy administration pressured Senator Hart to sponsor the bill that created our current system instead -- allocating visas in equal number to all countries, a principle inspired by the civil-rights-era ethos of formal equality. And it has been at the root of our ''illegal immigration problem'' ever since.
The federal government continues to pour billions of dollars into border control and to impose punitive sanctions on undocumented workers, and the immigration-detention system has swelled. These approaches are not only inhumane but misguided; the labor market, more than anything, determines migration's ebbs and flows.
The 1986 reform regularized the status of nearly three million undocumented immigrants, but did nothing to change the system that encourages, even guarantees, future unauthorized entries. This time, we need more than half measures. We need not mimic the exact structure of Senator Hart's proposal, but we should push for a similar system, with the same principles of flexibility and fairness. Comprehensive immigration reform must mean a return to the tradition of welcoming immigrants who come here to work, and giving them the opportunity to become Americans.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, proposing a New York budget for the 12th and last time, called on Tuesday for agencies across the city to cut costs as he seeks to keep spending flat despite the prospective loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in state education aid because of a labor dispute.
Mr. Bloomberg offered no major new initiatives, but said the city would spend billions of dollars to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy. All of that money, he said, would be supplied by the federal government. 
The mayor proposed closing 20 firehouses, reducing thousands of city-financed child-care slots, and cutting thousands of teacher positions -- all suggestions he had made in past years, but had dropped after resistance from the City Council.
Over all, Mr. Bloomberg proposed a $70.1 billion budget for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. That is $1.6 billion more than the one approved by the Council for the current fiscal year. But because of emergency city spending connected to the hurricane, the actual figure in the current fiscal year will be $70.4 billion -- meaning that Mr. Bloomberg is proposing a slightly leaner budget.
Much of the increase stems from costs that the city says it cannot control, like those of pensions, health care, Medicaid and debt service. But Mr. Bloomberg said an improving national economy, the recovery on Wall Street and the city's increasingly diversified economy would cushion the blow.
''We've done a lot,'' he said. ''You can always do more, but you can only fight so many battles at a time. We've gone through Sandy, we've gone through Irene, we've gone through a mortgage crisis, and yet with all of those things, the city's budget is still in balance.''
But looming large over the mayor's budget was the uncertainty over an increasingly bitter dispute between the administration and the teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, concerning a teacher evaluation system.
On Monday, Mr. Bloomberg warned of imminent fiscal pain during testimony in Albany, where he urged the State Legislature to intervene so that the city did not lose hundreds of millions of state dollars because it missed a deadline this month to finish negotiating the evaluation system.
And while he noted on Tuesday that the $13.9 billion budget for education he proposed was $8 billion more than when he took office, he also said that the loss of education money would have an impact on schools across the city.
To make up for the lost money, the city would keep 700 fewer teachers on the payroll this school year, with staff reductions coming mainly through attrition, ''as well as the reduction of funds for extracurricular activities and after-school programming,'' according to a budget summary. An additional 1,100 teaching positions would be at risk in the 2014 fiscal year.
After the mayor made his presentation, many city officials -- including several hoping to succeed Mr. Bloomberg as mayor -- expressed exasperation or anger over the education stalemate.
Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who has been a strong ally of Mr. Bloomberg, said she had ''serious concerns'' and that a failure to reach a deal would be ''potentially devastating.'' She also said that she was ''concerned'' about the mayor's proposal, which he has made before, to close 20 firehouses, and make deep cuts to after-school programs.
John C. Liu, the comptroller and a frequent critic of the mayor, said that the mayor wanted to ''scapegoat'' teachers and that ''his reliance on one-shots and a 'my way or the highway' negotiation strategy'' could mean that children ''will pay the price.''
And Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, who, like Ms. Quinn and Mr. Liu, is running for mayor, suggested that Mr. Bloomberg needed to demonstrate more leadership because ''it's the role of the mayor to bring people to the table.''
There were also a few uncertainties in Mr. Bloomberg's budget. He is counting on $600 million from a plan to sell 2,000 new yellow-taxi medallions that remains tied up in court.
His spending plan also assumes that there will be no raises in labor contracts that expired after 2010 -- something that might be difficult for his successor to swallow, especially if unions help a Democrat win the election.
''The next mayor's going to have some very, very serious problems -- very,'' said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, referring to the expired contracts. ''That is a very serious problem looming, and nobody seems to have an answer for it. The mayor is correct to say, 'Look, there's no money,' but I don't know that the next mayor is going to feel that that is a sufficient answer. I think it's something we're going to have to talk about in the course of the campaign.''
When asked by reporters whether he would leave the city on sounder fiscal footing, as he promised when he took office in 2002 and inherited a $4.8 billion deficit in a $42.3 billion budget, he said, ''I think so.''
Later, when asked to reflect on how he felt presenting his final preliminary budget proposal, Mr. Bloomberg sounded wistful and hardly ready to move on.
''I would be hard pressed to come up with anything that I have had to do in the last 11 years and almost one month that I did not enjoy and look at as a challenge,'' he said. After all, he said, there were still 336 days left in his term, and he was planning to make the most of them.

HEADLINE: Full Transcript of President Obama's Remarks on Immigration Reform

 BODY:
The following is the complete transcript of President Obama's remarks on immigration on Tuesday in Las Vegas. (Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.)
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.
Well, it is good to be back in Las Vegas. (Cheers, applause.) And it is good to be among so many good friends. Let -- let me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us. (Cheers, applause.) Go, Dragons! Let me especially thank your outstanding principal, Lisa Primas. (Cheers, applause.)
There are all kinds of notable guests here, but I just want to mention a few. First of all, our outstanding secretary of Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano is here. (Cheers, applause.) Our wonderful secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar. (Cheers, applause.) Former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. (Cheers, applause.) Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus. (Cheers, applause.) Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman. (Cheers, applause.) 
But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue we're going to talk about today is, Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale, Arizona -- (cheers, applause) -- Kasim Reed from Atlanta, Georgia -- (cheers, applause) -- Greg Stanton from Phoenix, Arizona (cheers, applause) -- and Ashley Swearengin from Fresno, California.
(Cheers, applause.)
And all of you are here -- (cheers) -- as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country, and we are just so grateful. Some outstanding business leaders are here as well. And of course we got wonderful students here. (Sustained cheers, applause.) So I could not be prouder of our students.
Now, those of you who have a seat, feel free to take a seat. I don't mind. (Laughter.)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, (Obama ?)!
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I love you back! (Cheers.)
Now, last week -- last week I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesn't require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have. But it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose. It requires us to act.
And I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others. Some debates will be more contentious. That's to be expected.
But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling, where a broad consensus is emerging and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America.
I'm here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform -- (cheers, applause) -- (inaudible). Now's the time. Now's the time. (Cheers, applause.) Now's the time. (Chanting.) Now's the time.
I'm here because -- I'm here because most Americans agree that it's time to fix a system that's been broken for way too long.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Right!
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I'm here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity. Now's the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country's future.
Think about it. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants. That's who we are, in our bones. The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, that's always been one of our greatest strengths. It keeps our workforce young, it keeps our country on the cutting edge, and it's helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.
After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo. They created entire new industries that in turn created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens.
In recent years 1 in 4 high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants. One in 4 new small-business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada, folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans.
But we all know that today we have an immigration system that's out of date and badly broken; a system that's holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class.
Right now we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America, 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows. Yes, they broke the rules. They crossed the border illegally. Maybe they overstayed their visas. Those are the facts. Nobody disputes them.
But these 11 million men and women are now here. Many of them have been here for years. And the overwhelming majority of these individuals aren't looking for any trouble. They're contributing members of the community. They're looking out for their families. They're looking out for their neighbors. They're woven into the fabric of our lives.
Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living. Often they do that in the shadow economy, a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay. And when that happens, it's not just bad for them, it's bad for the entire economy, because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing, that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- they're the ones who suffer.
They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules. And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened too.
So if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it in the middle class, we've got to fix the system. We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules. We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable, businesses for who they hire and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law. That's common sense, and that's why we need comprehensive immigration reform.
And -- (cheers, applause) -- now, there's another economic reason why we need reform. It's not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy; it's also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so and the effect that has on our economy. Right now there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities. They're earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science. But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there's a good chance they'll have to leave our country.
Now, think about that. Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Right now in one of those classrooms, there's a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea, their Intel or Instagram, into a big business.
We're giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we're going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else. That's not how you grow new industries in America. That's how you give new industries to our competitors. That's why we need comprehensive immigration reform.
Now -- (cheers, applause) -- now, during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system. First, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants. We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history. And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000. (Applause.)
Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities. And today, deportations of criminals -- (applause) -- is at its highest level ever.
And third, we took up the cause of the dreamers, the young people who were brought to this country as children -- (cheers, applause) -- young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here. We said that if you're able to meet some basic criteria, like pursuing an education, then we'll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong.
But because this change isn't permanent, we need Congress to act, and not just on the DREAM Act.
We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now. That's what we need. (Cheers, applause.)
Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together. (Cheers, applause.) Members of both parties in both chambers are actively working on a solution. Yesterday a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I've proposed and campaigned on for the last few years. So at this moment it looks like there's a genuine desire to get this done soon. And that's very encouraging.
But this time action must follow. We can't allow -- (applause) -- immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate. We've been debating this a very long time. So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done.
As a consequence, to help move this process along, today I'm laying out my ideas for immigration reform. And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas that I'm proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush. You don't get that matchup very often. (Laughter.) So -- so we know where the consensus should be.
Now of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details. And every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process. But it's important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place. And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes! (Cheers, applause.)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: So -- so the principles are pretty straightforward. There are a lot of details behind it. We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so everybody will know exactly what we're talking about. But the principles are pretty straightforward.
First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement. That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders.
It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers. To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who's here legally, who's not. So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone's employment status. And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties.
Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally. Now, we all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship. But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship. (Cheers, applause.)
We've got to -- we've got to lay out a path, a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally, that's only fair. (Cheers, applause.) All right? So that means it won't be a quick process, but it will be a fair process and it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to green card and, eventually, to citizenship. (Cheers, applause.)
And the third principle is we've got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time. (Cheers, applause.) For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldn't have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America. (Cheers, applause.) You shouldn't have to wait years.
If you're a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here because if you succeed you'll create American businesses and American jobs, You'll help us grow our economy, you'll help us strengthen our middle class.
So that's what comprehensive immigration reform looks like -- smarter enforcement, a pathway to earn citizenship, improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world.
It's pretty straightforward.
The question now is simple. Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us? I believe that we do. (Applause.) I believe that we do. I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp. But I promise you this. The closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.
Immigration's always been an issue that inflames passions. That's not surprising. You know, there are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home, who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the Untied States of America. That's a big deal. When we talk about that in the abstract, it's easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of us versus them. And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of us used to be them. (Cheers, applause.) We forget that.
And it's really important for us to remember our history. You know, unless you're one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else. (Cheers, applause.) Somebody brought you.
You know, Ken Salazar -- he's of, you know, Mexican-American descent, but he -- he points out that his family's been living where -- where he lives for 400 years.
(Cheers.) So he didn't -- he didn't immigrate anywhere. (Laughter.)
The Irish, who left behind a land of famine; the Germans, who fled persecution; the Scandinavians, who arrived eager to pioneer out west; the Polish; the Russians; the Italians; the Chinese; the Japanese; the West Indians; the huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other -- (cheers, applause) -- you know, all those folks, before they were us, they were them. (Laughter.)
And when each new wave of immigrants arrived, they faced resistance from those who were already here. They faced hardship. They faced racism. They faced ridicule. But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build the nation. They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies, but they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember but whose actions helped make us who we are, who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick. (Cheers, applause.)
They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story.
And that's still true today. Just ask Alan Aleman. Alan's here this afternoon. Where's Alan? He -- he -- he's around here. There he is right here. (Cheers, applause.) Now, Alan was born in Mexico. (Cheers, applause.) He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child. Growing up, Alan went to an American school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, felt American in every way. And he was, except for one -- on paper. In high school, Alan watched his friends come of age, driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall. He knew he couldn't do those things. But it didn't matter that much; what mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential.
Last year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows, even if it's just for two years at a time, he was one of the first to sign up. And a few months ago he was one -- one of the first people in Nevada to get approved. (Cheers, applause.) In that moment Alan said, I felt the fear vanish. I felt accepted.
So today Alan's in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada. (Cheers, applause.) Alan's studying to become a doctor. (Cheers, applause.) He hopes to join the Air Force. (Cheers, applause.) He's working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family. And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America. (Applause.)
So -- so in the coming weeks, as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart, remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams. Remember that this is not just a debate about policy. It's about people. It's about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story.
And throughout our history, that's only made our nation stronger. And it's how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last, an American century, welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more, who's willing to work hard to do it, and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)

HEADLINE: No Pay? Little Sacrifice For Many in Congress

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In principle, it sounds self-sacrificing, even noble: Congress swears off collecting its paychecks until it passes a budget.
But behind the ''no budget, no pay'' proposal, which the House passed last week when it voted to temporarily extend the debt limit, is also a basic reality: many of those who support the concept are so wealthy that their Congressional paychecks represent little more than a rounding error.
Take Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who led the charge on the measure in the House. He has a net worth between $3.8 million and $9.7 million, according to an analysis of his most recent financial disclosure by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
That is not exactly a fortune befitting a Rockefeller or a Kennedy, but it is more than enough to cushion any discomfort he might feel from missing a few paydays. Many of the other lawmakers who have championed ''no budget, no pay,'' both Republicans and Democrats, are similarly wealthy.
Congress, for all its democratic trappings, has long been richer than a typical collection of 535 Americans. But the gap between the financial standing of members and the population as a whole appears to have grown in recent decades, analysts of financial disclosure forms say.
As many ordinary Americans have struggled to get by in recent years, members of Congress were largely insulated from the economic downturn, based on their net worth. The median net worth of American households is $66,740, while for the 535 members of Congress it is about $966,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Congressional lawmakers earn at least $174,000 a year.
The Democratic co-sponsor of the ''no budget, no pay'' bill in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, is worth between $3.6 million and $11.7 million, according to the center's tallies. The other Senate co-sponsor, Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, is worth less but is still doing just fine, with a net worth of between $2.8 million and $3.4 million. The Senate may pass the measure as early as Wednesday.
When the debt limit extension passed the House last week, the chamber's three wealthiest members voted yes: Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas (net worth estimated at $500 million, from Clear Channel Communications, founded by his wife's family); Darrell Issa, Republican of California ($480 million, from Viper car alarms); and Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado ($215 million, from the greeting card Web site Blue Mountain).
Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, also pushed for the provision. His estimated net worth is as high as $52 million, and he returns 15 percent of his Congressional paycheck each year.
''One thing I've never called for is an outright reduction in salary, because I do appreciate that members come from different walks of life,'' Mr. Rigell said. But as imperfect a solution as withholding pay might be, he said the concept was sound. ''I am convinced that is a big enough lever to influence the institution,'' he said, ''and it needs it.''
Since 1974, Congress has been required to pass a nonbinding annual budget. But the Senate has failed to pass a budget in the past three years, in part because Democratic leaders did not want to subject embattled members to tough spending votes.
As moneyed as Congress is these days, some members would feel the pinch if they stopped receiving their paychecks. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has a reported net worth of no higher than $300,000, making him one of the few nonmillionaires to support the bill. That also makes him the fifth-poorest member of the Senate, according to the figures from the Center for Responsive Politics.
In the House, more than a few members have an estimated net worth that is a negative figure, meaning their financial liabilities are greater than their assets.
Disagreements about the provision's effectiveness aside, some have raised questions about whether it is constitutional.
The debt limit extension bill says that if either chamber of Congress fails to approve a budget resolution for the next fiscal year by April 15, members' paychecks are to be held in an escrow account until a measure passes -- or, if that never happens, until the end of the 113th Congress in early 2015.
Opponents have argued that this may run afoul of the 27th Amendment, which says lawmakers cannot vary their compensation in a single Congress.
''It's clearly unconstitutional, and we shouldn't do unconstitutional things,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who noted almost as a point of pride that he was one of the House's poorest members.
But Mr. Nadler said he had other issues with the plan as well, including that he felt it was coercive and could force members to vote for legislation they thought was flawed.
And he said he was concerned about the precedent it would set. ''If you want only millionaires to be in Congress,'' he said, ''this is a good idea.''

HEADLINE: Perry Changes Tack on Rainy Day Fund

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- For years, Gov. Rick Perry has urged Texas lawmakers to resist the temptation to tap the billions of dollars in a state emergency account known as the Rainy Day Fund.
Generated largely by taxes on oil and gas production, the fund has been a frequent source of political turbulence, as Democrats have sought to use it for public education and other services while Republicans have resisted, arguing that it was meant to cover emergencies and not recurring expenses. In January 2001, in his first State of the State speech at the Capitol here, Mr. Perry told legislators that the fund was an insurance policy against an economic downturn, adding that ''we should keep our hands off of it while our economic picture remains uncertain.''
Twelve years later, in his seventh biennial State of the State address, Mr. Perry returned to the Capitol on Tuesday with a very different message, telling lawmakers that the time had come to draw $3.7 billion from the fund for a one-time investment in water and transportation infrastructure. The fund has a balance of about $8.1 billion but continues to grow. 
''We need to maintain a strong Rainy Day Fund,'' Mr. Perry told the lawmakers and political figures assembled in the House chamber. ''While we cannot -- and we will not -- raid that fund to meet ongoing expenses, we also shouldn't accumulate billions more than is necessary.''
Mr. Perry's call to use the Rainy Day money has yet again turned the fund into a lightning rod for partisan politics. Several Republican lawmakers and leaders had already proposed using the fund for water and transportation, while Democrats and education advocates said the governor and other conservatives were favoring such projects over crucial services that they said had been decimated by Republican cutbacks.
The governor and other Republicans do not view their shift on the fund as backpedaling. They said a record-breaking drought had created a sense of urgency to find a way to finance the state's 50-year water plan, which calls for spending $53 billion on reservoirs and other projects. And they said that vastly different circumstances were at play. In the last legislative session, in 2011, Democrats wanted to tap the fund to offset cuts to public education as the state was facing a budget shortfall. Now, the state has a budget surplus as Republicans seek to make the one-time water investment.
''The Rainy Day Fund was created to ensure we had a sufficient amount in reserve in case of disaster and to maintain Texas' strong credit rating,'' Mr. Perry said. ''And due to our economic success, this fund will soon have $12 billion in it, significantly more than the amount we need to meet those obligations.''
In Texas, financing public education, in particular, is more politically charged than paying for new roads and reservoirs. Democrats have argued that the state -- bolstered by the Rainy Day Fund and a surplus of $8.8 billion -- has ample resources to restore some or all of the $5.4 billion in cuts made to public education in the 2011 session. Republicans, who control the Legislature, have vowed not to undo the cuts.
''What I heard was a lot about investing in infrastructure, roads, water, but not nearly enough about investing in our people,'' said State Representative Gene Wu, a Democrat from Houston. ''Our teachers are still some of the lowest-paid teachers anywhere in this great nation, and we're asking more of them. We're asking them to work harder, asking them to be more accountable, but we're not paying them any more.''
Mr. Perry's speech was a kind of testament to his vision of Texas exceptionalism. The governor said the state remained a national destination for employers and job seekers, pointing to the nearly 1.4 million private-sector jobs that have been created in the state over the past 10 years. ''Texas is not merely strong, but exceptional,'' he said.
Such talk struck some as more bombast than reality. State Representative Naomi R. Gonzalez, a Democrat from El Paso, said she was not sure what parallel universe Mr. Perry was living in, adding that her constituents' concerns about how to make ends meet went unmentioned by the governor.
Mr. Perry used the speech to promote the initiatives he wants the Legislature to support, including tax relief of at least $1.8 billion. His remarks were interrupted as activists with the Texas Organizing Project, a group that advocates for low-income people, stood and shouted for an expansion of Medicaid while he was discussing the tax plan. On the chamber floor, it was nearly impossible to hear them -- Republican lawmakers rose from their seats and applauded, drowning out the protesters as they were rushed out by state troopers.
''I didn't know there would be that much excitement about tax relief,'' Mr. Perry said.

HEADLINE: Tools of Modern Gunmaking: Plastic and a 3-D Printer

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
A man in Wisconsin viewed it as a technical challenge. Another, in New Hampshire, was looking to save some money. And in Texas, a third wanted to make a political point.
The three may have had different motivations but their results were the same: each built a working gun that included a part made in plastic with a 3-D printer.
What they did was legal and, except for the technology and material used, not much different from what do-it-yourself gunsmiths have been doing for decades. But in the wake of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., and the intensified debate over gun control, their efforts, which began last summer, have stoked concerns that the inexpensive and increasingly popular printers and other digital fabrication tools might make access to weapons even easier.
''We now have 3-D printers that can manufacture firearms components in the basement,'' said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. ''It's just a matter of time before a 3-D printer will produce a weapon capable of firing bullets.'' 
A 3-D printer builds an object layer by layer in three dimensions, usually in plastic. To effectively outlaw weapons made with them, Mr. Israel wants to extend an existing law, set to expire this year, that makes weapons that are undetectable by security scanners -- like a printed all-plastic gun -- illegal.
But there are also major technical obstacles to creating an entire gun on a 3-D printer, not the least of which is that a plastic gun would probably melt or explode upon firing a single bullet, making it about as likely to kill the gunman as the target.
In the meantime, Michael Guslick in Milwaukee, Chapman Baetzel in Dover, N.H., and Cody Wilson in Austin, Tex., did something much simpler and, for now, more effective. They printed the part of an AR-15 assault rifle called the lower receiver, the central piece that other parts are attached to. Then, using standard metal components, including the chamber and barrel -- the parts that must be strong enough to withstand the intense pressure of a bullet firing -- they assembled working guns.
In all, the three men, who have written about their efforts on the Web, have fired hundreds of rounds, although the plastic receivers eventually deform, crack or otherwise fail from heat and shock. But Mr. Wilson, for one, is working on a fourth-generation design that he says should be more durable.
A lower receiver is the only part of an AR-15 that, when bought, requires the filing of federal paperwork. But it is legal to make an AR-15 -- and many other guns -- for personal use as long as there is no intent to sell them. And if the lower receiver is homemade, no paperwork is required.
Amateur gunsmiths have made lower receivers for years, in metal, although the process requires a certain level of machining expertise. Inexpensive 3-D printers have grown in popularity -- their rise has been compared with that of personal computers in the 1980s -- in part because they are easy to use. It is not even necessary to know how to create the design files that instruct the device to print bit after bit of plastic to build the object, as there are files for tens of thousands of objects available on the Internet, created by other users and freely shared.
Still, some tinkering is usually required. Mr. Guslick, who works in information technology and describes himself as a hobbyist gunsmith, printed his receiver on a machine he bought online through Craigslist. He used a file and abrasive paper to make the piece fit properly, but over all the project was not much of a technical challenge. ''Anybody could do this,'' he said.
Mr. Baetzel, who made his receiver on a 3-D printer he built from a kit, said the part worked fine until he cracked it when bumping the gun while putting it in his car. He has since printed a replacement along with a modified grip and stock which, he said, has made the gun sturdier.
For Mr. Baetzel, who works as a software tester, the motivation for printing gun parts was economic. ''Shooting is an expensive sport,'' he said. He figured he could save perhaps $40 by making the receiver rather than buying one.
Only Mr. Wilson, a law student who prints his receivers on friends' machines, had overtly political motives, wanting to demonstrate what he called the absurdity of gun-control laws. He took his efforts even further, printing high-capacity magazines like those that would be banned under recommendations proposed by President Obama and successfully testing them this month on a firing range south of Austin. He has posted the drawing files at his Web site, defcad.org, so that others can print the magazine.
''It's unbannable,'' he said. ''The Internet has it now.''
Mr. Wilson also has a project to develop a fully printable one-shot weapon, although he has not made much progress. He is seeking a firearms manufacturer's license, which he would need to even make prototypes of a complete weapon.
He gets advice and technical help from a network of about 15 collaborators around the world, and has posted other printer files at his site, including Mr. Guslick's file for a lower receiver.
Mr. Baetzel posted his files on his own blog, Ambulatory Armament Depot, after a printer file-sharing site, Thingiverse, forced him to remove them in December. A spokeswoman for MakerBot, a 3-D printer manufacturer that sponsors Thingiverse, pointed out that the site's terms of service prohibit content that ''contributes to the creation of weapons.''
Mr. Guslick, who is currently machining a few metal lower receivers, said 3-D printers were far from the best tool for gun-making, an opinion shared by Neil Gershenfeld, a professor at M.I.T. and director of the school's Center for Bits and Atoms.
''A well-equipped machine shop for a long time has been able to make gun parts,'' Mr. Gershenfeld said. ''Three-D printers make not very good ones.''
The types of computer-controlled tools found in a machine shop -- primarily laser cutters and milling machines -- are expensive. But smaller and cheaper versions are now available to dedicated hobbyists, though they do not yet have quite the mass appeal of 3-D printers.
Yet the printers have other drawbacks besides the use of plastic. They are slow, often taking hours to build an object, and the results, while impressive to the eye, can be too crude for extremely close-fitting parts.
And as Mr. Guslick pointed out, anyone who is desperate for a weapon ''has the ability to assemble a zip gun from parts bought in a hardware store for $15.''
The National Rifle Association did not respond to messages requesting the group's position on 3-D manufacturing. But for gun-control advocates, the real worry regarding 3-D printers and other machines is what the future might bring in the way of technological advances.
''Down the road it's going to be a big concern,'' said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ''We don't know how that's going to come about and don't know what technology.''
Mr. Baetzel, for one, said he did not worry about what other people might do with the technology. ''I follow the laws,'' he said. ''I personally think everyone else should follow them.''
He said he did not post his designs hoping that someone would use them illegally. ''It was more, 'Look at this cool thing I did.' ''

HEADLINE: Steel Makers, Reporting Losses, Top Forecasts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United States Steel and AK Steel beat expectations when they reported losses on Tuesday and said they expected results to improve in the current quarter, as the global economy recovers and the cost of raw materials like coal and iron ore remains low. 
At U.S. Steel, the net loss was $50 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with a loss of $211 million, or $1.46 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 6.9 percent, to $4.49 billion.
Excluding items, the loss was 41 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 75 cents a share on revenue of $4.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.
AK Steel's net loss widened to $230.4 million, or $1.89 a share, compared with $193.9 million, or $1.76 a share, in the period a year earlier. But the results beat analysts' estimates. Revenue fell 6 percent, to $1.42 billion.
Global steel demand is expected to rise 3.2 percent this year, compared with projected growth of 2.1 percent in 2012, the World Steel Association said in its most recent forecast in October.
China, the world's biggest steel producer and consumer, will account for most of the increase in 2013, the association said.
''Steel buyers in North America continued to exhibit caution early in the year, but recent increases in our daily order entry rates suggest increased spot market demand as the quarter progresses,'' John P. Surma, the chief executive of U.S. Steel, said in a statement.
AK Steel's raw material and energy costs are expected to decline by $150 million in 2013, its chief executive, James L. Wainscott, said in a conference call with analysts.
Shares of U.S. Steel fell 52 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.20, while AK Steel fell 8 cents, or 2 percent, to $4.03.

HEADLINE: To Open Eyes, W-2s List Cost Of Providing A Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As workers open their W-2 forms this month, many will see a new box with information on the total cost of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. To some, it will be a surprise, perhaps even a shock.
Workers often have little idea how much they and their employers are paying for coverage. In many cases, economists say, workers give up cash compensation to get and keep health benefits. 
The disclosures, required by the 2010 health care law, are meant to make workers more cost-conscious. Health benefits are still tax-free. But labor unions and employer groups say it could be easier to tax them in the future, now that employers must report their value to the government.
The new information appears in Box 12 of the standard W-2 form, with a two-letter code, DD. The box shows the ''cost of employer-sponsored health coverage.'' And that amount is not taxable, the Internal Revenue Service says on the back of the form.
Jay J. Makled, a union steward for the United Automobile Workers at the Ford plant in Dearborn, Mich., described his reaction after seeing that his health coverage cost nearly $16,000 last year: ''It's quite expensive. I was surprised to see how much the company was paying for that benefit.''
Hourly employees represented by the union there said they generally did not pay any of the premium.
The number on the W-2 form is supposed to reflect the part of the cost paid by the employer and the part paid by the employee.
Prof. Nicole Huberfeld, an expert on health law at the University of Kentucky, who received her W-2 form on Monday, said, ''Most people who get health insurance from their employers have no idea how much it costs.''
''People are often shocked when they see the cost, $12,000 to $16,000 a year,'' Ms. Huberfeld said. ''Many Americans believe this is something they get free. But employers pay lower wages because they provide insurance.''
In 2012, according to an annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance averaged $5,615 a year for single coverage and $15,745 for family coverage. Over five years, the costs have increased 25 percent for individual coverage and 30 percent for family coverage.
''Health coverage is a big piece of people's income and a large part of the social welfare budget,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, a tax economist at the Urban Institute. ''But the benefits are not taxable, and most of the spending is hidden, so we don't consider the trade-offs. If we want to get control of health care costs, people have to be aware of them.''
That is the goal of the disclosure requirement, which was proposed by a bipartisan group of senators: two Republicans, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, and two Democrats, Max Baucus of Montana and Ron Wyden of Oregon.
Congress acted after Peter R. Orszag, then the director of the Congressional Budget Office, told lawmakers: ''The economic evidence is overwhelming, the theory is overwhelming, that when your firm pays for your health insurance, you actually pay through reduced take-home pay. The firm is not giving that to you for free.''
The tax-free treatment of employer-provided health benefits is the largest tax break in the tax code, costing the government roughly $180 billion a year in lost revenue, or 80 percent more than the home mortgage interest deduction, according to the administration.
Katie W. Mahoney, the executive director of health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, ''It's useful for employees to know the value of coverage their employers provide.'' But she said some employers worried that reporting the benefit on the W-2 form could lead to taxing the benefit.
''That's not the intent of the current requirement,'' Ms. Mahoney said. ''But once the information is collected by the government, it's very easy for another administration to have a different intent.''
An employee of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. whose health coverage was listed as costing more than $20,000 said: ''That knocks my socks off. When I saw the number, my eyes popped out. I appreciate my employer all the more.''
The employee said he had been told not to discuss the cost publicly because the union did not want to suggest that some employees had ''Cadillac coverage.''
An employer that fails to comply with the reporting requirement could be subject to penalties of $200 per W-2 form, up to a maximum of $3 million, tax lawyers said.
Employers are exempt from the reporting obligation if they are required to file fewer than 250 W-2 forms, the I.R.S. said. That could change, but the agency said employers would be given at least six months' notice.

HEADLINE: Federal 9/11 Health Fund Pays Out Its First 15 Awards

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A federal fund set up to compensate people sickened by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack made its first awards on Tuesday, to 15 first responders.
The recipients' names were not released, but 14 are firefighters and one is a correction officer who responded to the disaster early on, mainly on the first day, said Sheila Birnbaum, the special master of the $2.8 billion victim compensation fund.
Most of them had respiratory illnesses and none of them had cancer, she said. Their awards, which are tax-free, ranged from $10,000 to $1.5 million. But they are receiving only 10 percent at first because of uncertainty about how many people will ultimately apply for the benefits, which are available to first responders, volunteers, workers and residents who were in Lower Manhattan in the months after the attack. Ms. Birnbaum could not provide the total dollar amount awarded in this round. 
The fund expires in October 2016. With thousands of people potentially eligible, it could in theory, according to an actuarial calculation, have to pay $8.5 billion, far more than it can afford.
''If our estimates have been too conservative and there's money we can afford, we'll give you another check,'' Ms. Birnbaum said.
Richard Alles, a deputy fire chief and legislative chairman of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, said his members were pleased to see the money finally being disbursed. ''It's a tremendous relief for many people who are sick and dying from 9/11-related illnesses,'' he said.
In late 2010, Congress approved the $2.8 billion compensation fund, along with a $1.5 billion fund for health monitoring and treatment. Dr. James Melius, chairman of the steering committee for the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, said he hoped the reality of the awards would encourage others to fill out their paperwork.
Ms. Birnbaum said $10,000 would be the lowest amount awarded. The highest awards, she said, represented lost income for firefighters who were relatively young and mostly or completely disabled. The awards are compensation for lost wages, out-of-pocket expenses for doctors, medications and other health costs, and pain and suffering, which is based on the extent of someone's disability. Other sources of compensation, like pensions, disability money and court settlements, are deducted from the amount before it is paid.
Ms. Birnbaum said she had not awarded money for cancer yet because she had not received any completed applications from people with cancer, and not because of any medical judgment. Fifty kinds of cancer were added to the list of eligible sicknesses last year despite a lack of evidence tying Sept. 11 to cancer.
''Each claim is looked at individually,'' Ms. Birnbaum said. ''The type of illness is not important. What is important is your economic loss.''
Ms. Birnbaum said one reason for the small number of payments was the glacial pace at which the paperwork was being filled out. More than 16,000 people have registered for the victim compensation fund, but only 2,500 have gone the next step and submitted eligibility forms, showing that they were present at the disaster sites: the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, Shanksville, Pa., or the landfill and routes where debris was taken. Of those, only 190 have submitted compensation forms, and many lack documentation, Ms. Birnbaum said.
She said her staff had been meeting with lawyers to advise them on how to get better affidavits from witnesses for people who did not have other ways to document that they had been at the disaster sites. ''These affidavits are so bare,'' she said, ''that nobody could say that these showed anything.''

HEADLINE: Amid Labor Uncertainty, Bloomberg Outlines Budget for Final Time

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MARC SANTORA; Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, proposing a New York budget for the 12th and last time, called on Tuesday for agencies across the city to cut costs as he seeks to keep spending flat despite the prospective loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in state education aid because of a labor dispute.
Mr. Bloomberg offered no major new initiatives, but said the city would spend billions of dollars to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy. All of that money, he said, would be supplied by the federal government. 
The mayor proposed closing 20 firehouses, reducing thousands of city-financed child-care slots, and cutting thousands of teacher positions -- all suggestions he had made in past years, but had dropped after resistance from the City Council.
Over all, Mr. Bloomberg proposed a $70.1 billion budget for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. That is $1.6 billion more than the one approved by the Council for the current fiscal year. But because of emergency city spending connected to the hurricane, the actual figure in the current fiscal year will be $70.4 billion -- meaning that Mr. Bloomberg is proposing a slightly leaner budget.
Much of the increase stems from costs that the city says it cannot control, like those of pensions, health care, Medicaid and debt service. But Mr. Bloomberg said an improving national economy, the recovery on Wall Street and the city's increasingly diversified economy would cushion the blow.
''We've done a lot,'' he said. ''You can always do more, but you can only fight so many battles at a time. We've gone through Sandy, we've gone through Irene, we've gone through a mortgage crisis, and yet with all of those things, the city's budget is still in balance.''
But looming large over the mayor's budget was the uncertainty over an increasingly bitter dispute between the administration and the teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, concerning a teacher evaluation system.
On Monday, Mr. Bloomberg warned of imminent fiscal pain during testimony in Albany, where he urged the State Legislature to intervene so that the city did not lose hundreds of millions of state dollars because it missed a deadline this month to finish negotiating the evaluation system.
And while he noted on Tuesday that the $13.9 billion budget for education he proposed was $8 billion more than when he took office, he also said that the loss of education money would have an impact on schools across the city.
To make up for the lost money, the city would keep 700 fewer teachers on the payroll this school year, with staff reductions coming mainly through attrition, ''as well as the reduction of funds for extracurricular activities and after-school programming,'' according to a budget summary. An additional 1,100 teaching positions would be at risk in the 2014 fiscal year.
After the mayor made his presentation, many city officials -- including several hoping to succeed Mr. Bloomberg as mayor -- expressed exasperation or anger over the education stalemate.
Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who has been a strong ally of Mr. Bloomberg, said she had ''serious concerns'' and that a failure to reach a deal would be ''potentially devastating.'' She also said that she was ''concerned'' about the mayor's proposal, which he has made before, to close 20 firehouses, and make deep cuts to after-school programs.
John C. Liu, the comptroller and a frequent critic of the mayor, said that the mayor wanted to ''scapegoat'' teachers and that ''his reliance on one-shots and a 'my way or the highway' negotiation strategy'' could mean that children ''will pay the price.''
And Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, who, like Ms. Quinn and Mr. Liu, is running for mayor, suggested that Mr. Bloomberg needed to demonstrate more leadership because ''it's the role of the mayor to bring people to the table.''
There were also a few uncertainties in Mr. Bloomberg's budget. He is counting on $600 million from a plan to sell 2,000 new yellow-taxi medallions that remains tied up in court.
His spending plan also assumes that there will be no raises in labor contracts that expired after 2010 -- something that might be difficult for his successor to swallow, especially if unions help a Democrat win the election.
''The next mayor's going to have some very, very serious problems -- very,'' said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, referring to the expired contracts. ''That is a very serious problem looming, and nobody seems to have an answer for it. The mayor is correct to say, 'Look, there's no money,' but I don't know that the next mayor is going to feel that that is a sufficient answer. I think it's something we're going to have to talk about in the course of the campaign.''
When asked by reporters whether he would leave the city on sounder fiscal footing, as he promised when he took office in 2002 and inherited a $4.8 billion deficit in a $42.3 billion budget, he said, ''I think so.''
Later, when asked to reflect on how he felt presenting his final preliminary budget proposal, Mr. Bloomberg sounded wistful and hardly ready to move on.
''I would be hard pressed to come up with anything that I have had to do in the last 11 years and almost one month that I did not enjoy and look at as a challenge,'' he said. After all, he said, there were still 336 days left in his term, and he was planning to make the most of them.

HEADLINE: Amid Labor Uncertainty, Bloomberg Outlines Budget for Final Time

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MARC SANTORA; Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, proposing a New York budget for the 12th and last time, called on Tuesday for agencies across the city to cut costs as he seeks to keep spending flat despite the prospective loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in state education aid because of a labor dispute.
Mr. Bloomberg offered no major new initiatives, but said the city would spend billions of dollars to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy. All of that money, he said, would be supplied by the federal government. 
The mayor proposed closing 20 firehouses, reducing thousands of city-financed child-care slots, and cutting thousands of teacher positions -- all suggestions he had made in past years, but had dropped after resistance from the City Council.
Over all, Mr. Bloomberg proposed a $70.1 billion budget for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. That is $1.6 billion more than the one approved by the Council for the current fiscal year. But because of emergency city spending connected to the hurricane, the actual figure in the current fiscal year will be $70.4 billion -- meaning that Mr. Bloomberg is proposing a slightly leaner budget.
Much of the increase stems from costs that the city says it cannot control, like those of pensions, health care, Medicaid and debt service. But Mr. Bloomberg said an improving national economy, the recovery on Wall Street and the city's increasingly diversified economy would cushion the blow.
''We've done a lot,'' he said. ''You can always do more, but you can only fight so many battles at a time. We've gone through Sandy, we've gone through Irene, we've gone through a mortgage crisis, and yet with all of those things, the city's budget is still in balance.''
But looming large over the mayor's budget was the uncertainty over an increasingly bitter dispute between the administration and the teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, concerning a teacher evaluation system.
On Monday, Mr. Bloomberg warned of imminent fiscal pain during testimony in Albany, where he urged the State Legislature to intervene so that the city did not lose hundreds of millions of state dollars because it missed a deadline this month to finish negotiating the evaluation system.
And while he noted on Tuesday that the $13.9 billion budget for education he proposed was $8 billion more than when he took office, he also said that the loss of education money would have an impact on schools across the city.
To make up for the lost money, the city would keep 700 fewer teachers on the payroll this school year, with staff reductions coming mainly through attrition, ''as well as the reduction of funds for extracurricular activities and after-school programming,'' according to a budget summary. An additional 1,100 teaching positions would be at risk in the 2014 fiscal year.
After the mayor made his presentation, many city officials -- including several hoping to succeed Mr. Bloomberg as mayor -- expressed exasperation or anger over the education stalemate.
Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who has been a strong ally of Mr. Bloomberg, said she had ''serious concerns'' and that a failure to reach a deal would be ''potentially devastating.'' She also said that she was ''concerned'' about the mayor's proposal, which he has made before, to close 20 firehouses, and make deep cuts to after-school programs.
John C. Liu, the comptroller and a frequent critic of the mayor, said that the mayor wanted to ''scapegoat'' teachers and that ''his reliance on one-shots and a 'my way or the highway' negotiation strategy'' could mean that children ''will pay the price.''
And Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, who, like Ms. Quinn and Mr. Liu, is running for mayor, suggested that Mr. Bloomberg needed to demonstrate more leadership because ''it's the role of the mayor to bring people to the table.''
There were also a few uncertainties in Mr. Bloomberg's budget. He is counting on $600 million from a plan to sell 2,000 new yellow-taxi medallions that remains tied up in court.
His spending plan also assumes that there will be no raises in labor contracts that expired after 2010 -- something that might be difficult for his successor to swallow, especially if unions help a Democrat win the election.
''The next mayor's going to have some very, very serious problems -- very,'' said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, referring to the expired contracts. ''That is a very serious problem looming, and nobody seems to have an answer for it. The mayor is correct to say, 'Look, there's no money,' but I don't know that the next mayor is going to feel that that is a sufficient answer. I think it's something we're going to have to talk about in the course of the campaign.''
When asked by reporters whether he would leave the city on sounder fiscal footing, as he promised when he took office in 2002 and inherited a $4.8 billion deficit in a $42.3 billion budget, he said, ''I think so.''
Later, when asked to reflect on how he felt presenting his final preliminary budget proposal, Mr. Bloomberg sounded wistful and hardly ready to move on.
''I would be hard pressed to come up with anything that I have had to do in the last 11 years and almost one month that I did not enjoy and look at as a challenge,'' he said. After all, he said, there were still 336 days left in his term, and he was planning to make the most of them.

HEADLINE: Head of Israel's Central Bank Plans to Step Down in June

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
JERUSALEM (AP) -- The governor of Israel's central bank, widely credited with steering the nation's economy safely through years of world financial turmoil, said on Tuesday that he would step aside this year. 
The governor, Stanley Fischer, told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would step down on June 30, the Bank of Israel said in a brief statement. It gave no explanation for the departure and said Mr. Fischer would hold a news conference on Wednesday to formally announce the decision.
Mr. Fischer, an internationally prominent economist, was deputy director of the International Monetary Fund and held top posts at the World Bank and Citigroup before taking over Israel's central bank in 2005. He is departing two years before the end of his second five-year term.
His monetary policies and Israel's tight control of its banks are viewed as being responsible for the nation's stability despite the global economic crisis during his tenure. Israel's economy continues to grow, and unemployment is about 6.5 percent, relatively low in world terms.
In a statement, Mr. Netanyahu praised Mr. Fischer and thanked him for his service.
''Professor Stanley Fischer played a major role in the economic growth of the state of Israel and in the achievements of the Israeli economy,'' he said. ''His experience, his wisdom and his international connections opened a door to the economies of the world and assisted the Israeli economy in reaching many achievements during a period of global economic crisis.''
Mr. Fischer, 69, was born in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia. He was educated at the London School of Economics and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He served as the thesis adviser to Ben S. Bernanke, now the Federal Reserve chairman, at M.I.T. in the 1970s.

HEADLINE: Catsimatidis Announces Republican Run for Mayor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
John A. Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery chain, stood on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday and announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for mayor of New York City.
Then he started talking about his suit.
''I think my wife paid $100 for this jacket,'' Mr. Catsimatidis, who bills himself a ''common billionaire,'' said as he gripped the lapel of a plus-size Jos. A. Bank blazer. ''I'm not wearing a $5,000 suit.'' He warned his daughter, standing nearby, that he would not be buying her an $80 million apartment. Later, he added, ''I feel the people's pain.'' 
''There were times in the '80s,'' Mr. Catsimatidis, a 64-year-old Upper East Sider, said, ''when I was afraid to walk from Fifth Avenue to Madison Avenue.''
It was an unconventional announcement from an unconventional candidate, a corporate dealmaker with no political experience, no natural constituency and little support among the city's chattering class.
But Mr. Catsimatidis, who appeared to be enjoying himself immensely during Tuesday's event, does have an estimated $3 billion fortune -- more than enough to mount a formidable advertising operation and, at the very least, be a thorn in the side of a crowded Republican field of candidates who are little known to the public.
An immigrant from Greece who made much of his fortune in the oil business, Mr. Catsimatidis (pronounced Cah-tsee-mah-TEE-dees) said he wanted to give back to a city that had served him well. ''I'm a visionary; I'm not a maintenance person,'' he declared, going on to say he understood the challenges facing small businesses, partly because his grocery trucks often incur thousands of dollars' worth of ticket fees.
His labor negotiation strategy involves a locked hotel room and frequent deliveries of pizzas. ''By 4 in the morning, everybody becomes a little more reasonable,'' he said. ''After you eat the third pie of pizza, you get more reasonable.''
On paper, Mr. Catsimatidis resembles another wealthy, long-shot mayoral candidate, Michael R. Bloomberg, whose 2001 bid was initially dismissed as a joke. And while Mr. Catsimatidis lacks some of Mr. Bloomberg's C.E.O. polish, he has a history of rubbing shoulders with top political players, including several years as a top fund-raiser for Bill and Hillary Clinton. Last year, he supported Mitt Romney, flying friends on his private plane to Republican events around the country.
In 2009, Mr. Catsimatidis spent $300,000 exploring a mayoral bid, but opted out after Mr. Bloomberg decided to run again.
On Tuesday, he stood flanked by his family, including a son-in-law who is a grandson of Richard M. Nixon, and two of the city's five Republican county chairmen, who have offered their support.
A Catsimatidis campaign, he said, would emphasize growing the city's economy -- partly by reviving the World's Fair, which he adored as a young boy -- and by maintaining public safety. ''We're not giving the streets back to the criminals,'' Mr. Catsimatidis said, noting later that his cuff links were a gift from Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner.
Some civic leaders remain skeptical that Mr. Catsimatidis will pursue a full-throated candidacy. He dismissed those concerns, saying ''I'm in it to win it,'' although he backed off an earlier pledge to devote $20 million of his own money to the cause. ''Whatever you decide to spend on a campaign, you go in increments,'' he explained.
On one pecuniary matter, however, Mr. Catsimatidis was quite clear.
''I am going to work cheaper than Mayor Bloomberg,'' he said, referring to the mayor's decision to take a $1 salary. ''I was a grocer. I work for 99 cents.''

HEADLINE: A New Target for Google Maps: The Streets of North Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER; Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and Claire Cain Miller from San Francisco. Shreeya Sinha contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea may be the world's most shrouded country, but on Tuesday Google Maps lifted the veil just a little, uploading a map of the police state complete with street names in the capital.
The new map, built with the help of what Google called ''a community of citizen cartographers,'' provides people who normally visit the site for driving directions with a peek at places they previously may only have read about, probably in news articles about the North's nuclear program or its devastating food shortages. The map of Pyongyang, the capital, shows all sorts of landmarks -- the tower that celebrates the country's self-reliance doctrine of Juche and Kim Il-sung Square, where military parades are held -- as well as hotels, schools and hospitals. 
Users can zoom in and post comments and photos; the map also includes what the site suggests are four gulags, marked as gray splotches. The map is still empty in most areas of the country, but is much more detailed than the one that was on the site until Tuesday, which was mostly blank.
In a sign of just how hermetic the country is, Google said North Korea was the last country in the world to get a relatively detailed map.
While North Korea experts point out that other more sophisticated maps exist and that Google Earth provides a satellite image that includes major cities and sites, some suggest that the easily accessible Google Maps will draw more casual viewers.
Even Curtis Melvin, who has created what many consider the most definitive public online map (on a Johns Hopkins University site), said Google Maps had ''provided the umph to get more eyes focused on the issue. North Korea is a serious policy, humanitarian and security challenge, and the more information we have, the better.'' The posting of the Google map -- and the company's call for still more mapping information on the North from users -- focused new attention on the North when the country is locked in a tense standoff with the United States and its allies over tightened sanctions and has threatened a third nuclear test.
Google's initiative also came three weeks after its executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, visited Pyongyang in a highly publicized yet controversial trip organized by Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico. Mr. Schmidt, who likes to describe the Web as the enemy of despots, said he had urged North Korean officials he met in Pyongyang to let more North Koreans use the Internet.
Google said Tuesday that the posting of the map project was unrelated to Mr. Schmidt's visit, which the company says was a personal trip.
''In the case of Google Maps for North Korea, there was little public information, and the crowdsourcing is from people from North Korea who are elsewhere,'' Mr. Schmidt said in an e-mail. ''It sheds a bit more light on what is happening in this remote country.''
There was no immediate North Korean reaction to Google's announcement on Tuesday.
Citing privacy concerns, Google would not say how many contributors there were to the new map or who they were, but it said some had used publicly available satellite imagery.
The ''citizen cartographers'' were able to contribute using Map Maker, a crowdsourcing tool in the style of Wikipedia that allows users to edit or add to Google Maps. The company said the North Korea contributions had been coming in for several years, but Google held back the changes until it had enough to build a credible map and had time to vet the information as best it could, given how closed the North is.
Mr. Melvin, who created the map on the Johns Hopkins site, said he collected data from a variety of sources, including atlases published in North Korea, publicly accessible satellite images and dozens of interviews with defectors, tourists and nonprofit workers who have visited the country.
Google Maps is unlikely to provide important new information to policy makers who already have satellite maps from years of surveillance, nor will it get much of a following in the North itself, where the secretive leaders allow Internet access to only a small portion of the elite, who are closely watched.
But the crowdsourcing project provides a tool for Internet users anywhere in the world to help identify at least some features in the isolated country that the government in Pyongyang does not want the world to know. (The government cherishes secrecy to such an extent that its propagandists liked to boast: ''When our enemies try to peek into our republic, they only see a fog.'')
Experts expect some of the more than 24,000 North Korean defectors living in South Korea, one of the world's most wired countries, to contribute to the map in the future. But their contributions are likely to be limited: most of them come from the northern part of the country, near the border with China, which they cross to escape. Given the tight control on people's movements in North Korea, most have little knowledge of anything other than their hometowns and the areas nearby.
Already, critics of the North's authoritarian government and the backward economic policies that keep its people starving were posting sardonic comments by clicking on the ''review'' link often reserved for rating mapped businesses, restaurants and tourist sites.
One reviewer wrote, regarding bronze statues in Pyongyang of Mr. Kim, the country's founder, and his son: ''Wow, the Korean people must really have loved it under Kim Il Sung, to think they raised this gigantic statue voluntarily on their spare time while they was gloriously lacking food and metal for basic agricultural equipment.''

HEADLINE: Taxes To Tackle Climate Change

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
To understand the complicated politics of climate change in the United States, you may want to talk to Pamela Johnson, president of the National Corn Growers Association's Corn Board.
She is concerned about the weather. The drought that parched the lower 48 states cut the harvest at her northern Iowa farm by about 40 bushels an acre. For the first time in memory, she says, she had to rely on the federally subsidized crop insurance program to stay afloat.
And yet Ms. Johnson's main concern, and that of most other growers in the association, is not about how to deal with a changing climate -- how to slow the pace of warming and how to adapt to a warmer world with more erratic weather.
Rather, growers worry that political support for crop insurance might flag after a year in which taxpayers paid billions in subsidies to farmers while virtually everybody else faced deep budget cuts. 
''We are Americans before we are farmers,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''We know we have budget problems.'' Still, she added: ''For our farmers, crop insurance is the main concern. It helps keep us in business.''
The erratic weather across the country in the last couple of years seems to be softening Americans' skepticism about global warming. Most New Yorkers say they believe big storms like Sandy and Irene were the result of a warming climate. Whether climate change is directly responsible or not, the odd weather patterns have underscored the risk that it poses to all of us.
What's yet to be seen is whether this growing awareness of the risks will translate into sufficient political support to address climate change, especially after we figure out the costs we will have to bear to do so.
In his inaugural address, President Obama wove Hurricane Sandy and last year's drought into a stirring plea to address climate change. ''The failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,'' the president said.
But even as he put global warming at the top of his agenda, he avoided dwelling on how much it would cost to address. And nowhere in his speech did he allude to the most powerful tool to address the problem: a tax on the use of energy.
Dealing with global warming will be expensive. The price tag last year for the drought was about $35 billion, according to the reinsurer Aon Benfield. Hurricane Sandy cost a further $65 billion. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that last year ranked as the second-costliest in terms of natural disasters since 1980 -- lagging only 2005 when Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans.
And yet this is nothing compared with what the future will bring.
''The impact to date has been pretty small,'' said William Nordhaus of Yale, one of the leading economists studying the impact of climate change.
Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, another expert on the costs of climate change, said: ''What we are seeing is on the back of warming of only 0.8 degrees centigrade'' since the second half of the 19th century. ''What we risk is 4, 5, 6 degrees even by the end of this century.''
For all the damage wrought by Sandy and Katrina, weather disasters in recent years have cost us probably less than a tenth of 1 percent of our economic product. Yet, according to Professor Nordhaus, ''Damages will rise more sharply than the temperature curve.''
The president's speech notwithstanding, the cost of dealing with these looming disasters is not to be found in the budgets discussed by the White House and Congressional Republicans, which would shrink much of the government to its smallest share of the economy since the early 1960s.
Neither is the cost of steering the economy away from the fossil fuels that are to blame for a warming atmosphere. A report from the World Economic Forum estimated that would cost $700 billion a year in public and private investment.
The reluctance is not because we have no idea how to finance these efforts. We do. Top economists agree a tax on fuels and the carbon they spew into the atmosphere would be the cheapest way to combat climate change. Most advanced countries rely on some variant of this tax. The question is whether the prospect of more droughts and more powerful hurricanes will push Americans to embrace it, too.
Among the 34 industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, these taxes average about $68.4 per metric ton of carbon dioxide. The United States, by contrast, has a gas tax to pay for highway improvement, and that's about it. Total federal taxes on energy amount to $6.30 per ton.
Some states add excise taxes -- California has a gas tax equivalent to about $46.50 per ton of carbon dioxide and a $2.33-per-ton tax on jet kerosene. But, according to a review by the O.E.C.D., the federal government is unique in imposing no taxes on other energy use, from residential heating to power generation.
A tax on energy could single-handedly take on climate change. For starters, it would encourage people and businesses to burn less, reducing emissions at a stroke. One study found that a carbon tax of $15 per ton would reduce greenhouse emissions by 14 percent as people sought to save energy by driving less, insulating their homes and switching to renewable fuels, among other things.
What's more, it would raise lots of money. Estimates reviewed in a report by the Tax Policy Center ranged from 0.6 percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- for a tax of $20 per ton of carbon dioxide -- to 1.6 percent of G.D.P. for a tax of $41 per ton. Consider this: 1.6 percent of G.D.P. is $240 billion a year. And $41 per ton amounts to an extra 35 cents a gallon of gas.
By way of comparison, the Swiss economy does fairly well even while shouldering an effective carbon tax rate of more than $140 per ton.
Some of the money raised through more taxes on energy could be spent steeling communities to cope with more intense hurricanes and moving others out of harm's way. It could even help ease the fiscal squeeze that so consumes our elected officials.
There are drawbacks. A carbon tax would fall more heavily on the poor -- the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the poorest fifth of Americans spend 21.4 percent of their income on gas and utilities while the richest 20 percent spend only 6.8 percent. But economists at the budget office have pointed out that there are several ways to compensate lower-income Americans.
For all the merits of an energy tax, the United States seems a long way from embracing one. It was only three years ago that the corn growers and the rest of the farm lobby allied with energy producers and other corporations to derail President Obama's first shot at climate change legislation, which would have set a limit on carbon emissions and required businesses to buy permits to emit.
As things stand, drought is unlikely to change their minds. Farmers are still covered by crop insurance, and they have powerful allies in Congress who will fight to keep the subsidies in place. They may see little reason to support legislation that would make energy or fertilizer more expensive.
''Farmers would be deeply affected by an energy tax,'' Ms. Johnson said.
As things stand for them, it is probably cheaper to deal with the occasional drought.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Debut, BlackBerry Maker Holds Its Breath

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Research in Motion's introduction on Wednesday of a new BlackBerry phone will be the most important event in the company's history since 1996, when its founders showed investors a small block of wood and promised that a wireless e-mail device shaped like that would change business forever.
Now with just 4.6 percent of the global market for smartphones in 2012, according to IDC, RIM long ago exchanged dominance for survival mode. On Wednesday, the company will introduce a new line of smartphones called the BlackBerry 10 and an operating system of the same name that Thorsten Heins, the president and chief executive of RIM, says will restore the company to glory. 
But Frank Mersch, who became one of RIM's earliest investors after seeing the block of wood, is far less excited by what he sees this time around.
''You're in a very, very competitive market and you're not the leader,'' Mr. Mersch, now the chairman and a vice president at Front Street Capital in Toronto, said of RIM. ''You have to ask: 'At the end of the day are we really going to win?' I personally think the jury's out on that.''
The main elements of the new phones and their operating system are already well known. Mr. Heins and other executives at RIM have been demonstrating the units for months to a variety of audiences. App developers received prototype versions as far back as last spring.
While analysts and app developers may be divided about the future of RIM, there is a consensus that BlackBerry 10, which arrives more than year behind schedule, was worth the wait.
Initially RIM will release two variations of the BlackBerry 10, one a touch-screen model that resembles many other phones now on the market. The other model is a hybrid with a keyboard similar to those now found on current BlackBerrys as well as a small touch screen.
The real revolution, though, may be in the software that manages a person's business and personal information. It is clearly designed with an eye toward retaining and, more important, luring back, corporate users.
Corporate and government information technology managers will be able to segregate business-related apps and data on BlackBerry 10 handsets from users' personal material through a system known as BlackBerry Balance. It will enable an I.T. manager to, among other things, remotely wipe corporate data from fired employees' phones while leaving the newly jobless workers' personal photos, e-mails, music and apps untouched. The system can also block users from forwarding or copying information from the work side of the phone.
Messages generated by e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, instant messaging and LinkedIn accounts are automatically consolidated into a single in-box that RIM calls BlackBerry Hub.
Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research, called the new phones ''beautiful'' and described the operating system as ''a giant leap forward'' from RIM's current operating system. Ray Sharma, who followed RIM's glory years as a financial analyst but who now runs XMG Studio, a mobile games developer in Toronto, has been similarly impressed.
But both men are among many analysts who question the ability of BlackBerry 10, whatever its merits, to revive RIM's fallen fortunes.
''If it's good, it will help inspire the upgrade cycle,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''But it has to be great in order to inspire touch-screen users to come back. If it's good, not great, I will be concerned.''
Mr. Golvin was more blunt. ''They'll need to prove themselves in the face of a simultaneous onslaught of marketing from Microsoft, not to mention the continued push from Apple plus Google and its Android partners,'' he wrote. ''This is a gargantuan challenge for a company of RIM's size.''
In the year since he took over from the founders, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, Mr. Heins has certainly remade RIM. He cut 5,000 jobs in a program to reduce operating costs by about $1 billion a year. Along the way, he also replaced RIM's senior management and straightened out its balance sheet. While unprofitable, RIM remains debt-free and holds $2.9 billion in cash.
With BlackBerry 10, RIM not only started over with its operating system, it also rebuilt the company through acquisitions. Its core operating system comes from QNX Software Systems, the design of the user interface is largely the work of the Astonishing Tribe in Sweden while other main components, like the touch-screen technology, came from smaller companies that are now part of RIM.
Integrating all of those acquisitions, analysts and former RIM employees say, added to the delays that plagued BlackBerry 10.
Now that the new phones are finally here, Mr. Heins is counting on RIM's remaining base of 79 million users globally to eagerly upgrade. But where those customers reside may be as important in their numbers in determining the success of that plan.
In the United States, which leads the world in setting smartphone trends, about 11 million BlackBerry users switched to other phones between 2009 and the middle of last year, according to an analysis by Horace Dediu on Asymco, a wireless industry blog he founded.
Until the final months of 2012, RIM continued to increase its subscriber base through sales of low-cost handsets to less developed countries like Nigeria and Indonesia. Although BlackBerry 10 will be made available worldwide, the initial phones will be too expensive for a majority of BlackBerry fans in those regions.
RIM may also have confused its loyalists, particularly in North America and Europe, in the run-up to the BlackBerry 10 debut. Many of those users stuck with BlackBerrys because of their physical keyboards. But public demonstrations for BlackBerry 10 were centered on the touch-screen-only version and its virtual keyboard.
While some corporations have remained loyal to BlackBerry, RIM not only has to sell them on the new handsets, it also must persuade them to upgrade server software to accommodate the new operating system, a costly and time-consuming process. Companies whose employees continue to use older BlackBerrys will have to run two separate BlackBerry servers.
Mr. Heins's pitch to those corporations is that the BlackBerry 10 server software will also allow them to manage and control data on employees' Android phones and iPhones. But any corporation or organization that allows those phones to connect with its systems long ago installed mobile device management software from other companies, including Good Technology and SAP. RIM is likely to find that the competition in device management software is as severe as it is in the handset business.

HEADLINE: A Warning to Wall St. About Misleading Clients

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The charges against Jesse Litvak, a former securities trader at Jefferies &#038; Company, serve as a warning to Wall Street that misleading customers - including sophisticated ones - can result in criminal action, even for a broker who does not owe a fiduciary duty to clients. 

 BODY:
A former trader of residential mortgage-backed securities at Jefferies & Company, Jesse Litvak, was indicted on charges of lying to investors about the prices and commissions of securities sold as part of a government program to prop up the mortgage bond market. 
The charges serve as a warning to Wall Street that misleading customers - including sophisticated ones - can result in criminal action, even for a broker who did not owe a fiduciary duty to clients. 
The Justice Department charged Mr. Litvak with 11 counts of securities fraud in connection with so-called R.M.B.S. transactions that were part of the financial bailout under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed parallel civil charges accusing him of fraud.
Among Mr. Litvak's customers were investment advisers retained by the Treasury Department as part of the Public-Private Investment Program, in which the government put up money to buy residential mortgage-backed securities issued before the financial crisis to try to unfreeze the market. Firms involved in the transactions include AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and Wellington Management, all leading Wall Street investment advisers that manage billions of dollars of assets.
With government funding at stake, prosecutors added charges under two other federal statutes not usually seen in this type of case. Some of the transactions involved investment vehicles financed through TARP, so Mr. Litvak was charged with violating the statute that makes it a crime to defraud the United States. 
He was also charged with four counts of making false statements to the Treasury Department. Although Mr. Litvak never dealt directly with that department, it had contracted with the investment advisers to act on its behalf in the residential mortgage investments.
The accusations outline a rather simple act: Mr. Litvak is charged with telling clients that the cost of the residential mortgage investments was higher or lower than what Jefferies paid for them, depending on which side of the transaction the firm was on. In other trades, he took securities from the firm's inventory and sold them at an undisclosed markup, although he indicated Jefferies was only matching firms for the transaction.
Mr. Litvak communicated with clients by text messages and chat sessions, and his communications contain questionable comments like those often seen in other cases. In one instance, he claimed to have tried to get a better price from his boss but that "i thought i could work him over ... but he is kind of being a weenie." 
"The kind of false claims made by Litvak were unfit for a used-car lot, let alone a marketplace for mortgage-backed securities," said George S. Canellos, deputy director of enforcement at the S.E.C.
But Mr. Litvak was dealing with investment advisers managing millions of dollars of securities. So could they have been duped, as authorities claim? 
Unlike stocks that trade on an open market, transactions involving these securities were much more opaque. As described in the S.E.C. complaint, the market for residential mortgage-backed securities is "generally illiquid and discovering a market price for them is difficult. Participants trading in the M.B.S. market must rely on informal sources, including their broker, for this information."
Thus, according to prosecutors, Mr. Litvak's statements about how much Jefferies paid for the securities and its profits were material to the investment advisers.
What makes this case different is that Mr. Litvak did not owe a fiduciary duty to the investment advisers he dealt with. While those firms owe a duty to put their clients' interests first, a broker like Jefferies is only required to make suitable investment recommendations when acting as a market maker in a security. 
This was the explanation offered by Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, when he was testified before a Senate subcommittee in 2010 about the firm's sale of a synthetic derivative obligation that was the basis for an S.E.C. civil fraud suit. In response to an accusation that Goldman had improperly bet against the security it sold to a client, Mr. Blankfein responded, "In the context of market-making, that's not a conflict."
Mr. Litvak's lawyer said his client "did not cheat anyone out of a dime. In fact, most of these trades turned out to be hugely profitable." He also pointed out that the clients were all sophisticated investors, perhaps implying they should not have relied on Mr. Litvak's word alone about the prices of the securities.
The defense can argue that the fact the market is opaque, with prices based on informal sources. And the decision whether to buy or sell a security is based on the total cost, so whether it included a higher commission or price spread than the customer was led to believe might not have been material to the transaction.
But fraud does not require that the victim be gullible or lose money on the transaction. The indictment claims that outright falsehoods were made in connection with the transactions, not just the shady practices of the used-car dealer who proclaims that the vehicle was only driven to church on Sunday. 
Proving a fraud charge is much easier if it can be shown that the defendant made deliberate misstatements, even if the person was only acting as a broker who did not have a duty to disclose all relevant information to the client.
The charges against Mr. Litvak should put Wall Street on notice that the government will try to police markets that require trust among the participants in the absence of transparent price information. The defense of caveat emptor, or let the buyer beware, will not necessarily protect against criminal charges for fraud.

HEADLINE: Improvement Seen in Prepaid Cards for Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Many states have reduced fees charged on prepaid debit cards used to pay unemployment benefits. 

 BODY:
Many states have made progress in reducing fees that can eat away at unemployment benefits delivered on prepaid debit cards, a report from the National Consumer Law Center finds.
But five states still do not offer jobless workers the option of having their benefits deposited directly into a bank account, which the center says violates federal law.
Changes since the center's first report on the issue in 2011 have saved unemployed workers millions of dollars in fees over all, the center says. Eighteen states have reduced card fees for A.T.M. withdrawals and purchases, and just three cards get a "thumbs down" from the center in the new report, down from 16 in the initial analysis. 
But there is still room for improvement, since many cards still carry fees that out-of-work Americans can ill afford, said Lauren Saunders, managing lawyer at the center and an author of the report. Some states make it hard to find out just what fees are charged, and under what circumstances.
"There are still too many fees," she said, citing instances in which workers must pay to check their balances and contact customer service, even if they do not speak with a live representative. Well-designed prepaid cards are safer, cheaper and more convenient than paper checks, she said, but direct deposit to a bank account of the recipient's choosing is still the best option.
Practices and fees vary because jobless benefits are distributed at the state level, and each state negotiates terms with card companies.
Roughly 5.7 million people were receiving unemployment assistance as of Jan. 5, according to federal data. (The unemployment rate stood at 7.8 percent at the end of 2012, with 12.2 million people out of work.)
The report found the ease of signing up for direct deposit of unemployment benefits varies. Some states encourage workers to sign up for direct deposit as the first choice, while others automatically enroll them for prepaid cards and make them take extra steps to unenroll from the cards and enroll in direct deposit. While prepaid cards, in general, are often used by people who lack conventional bank accounts, unemployed workers previously received a paycheck, so many are likely to have a bank account available, Ms. Saunders said.
Minnesota had the highest direct deposit rate, at 82 percent, while Arizona had the lowest, at 16 percent.
California, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland and Nevada do not offer the option of direct deposit, even though federal law requires them to do so, the report says. In California, Kansas and Maryland, workers can set up automatic transfers from a card to a bank account, but fewer than a quarter do so - perhaps because it results in a delay of one to four days in getting their money.
U.S. Bank, the only bank that charged overdraft fees in the previous survey, has eliminated them. Pennsylvania made changes to its card program that have saved unemployed workers more than $5 million.
As a result of the changes, Pennsylvania's card, issued by JPMorgan Chase, joined top-ranked cards in California and New Jersey, both issued by Bank of America. The three cards earned "two thumbs up" from the center because they offer benefits like free in-network A.T.M. withdrawals and lack "junk" charges, like inactivity fees.
The three states receiving a "thumbs down" for their cards were Alaska, Indiana and Iowa.
Do you receive unemployment benefits on a prepaid card? What has been your experience? Do you feel the fees are excessive?

HEADLINE: Leading the Way Out of Debt

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: New York City's network of Financial Empowerment Centers, which help poor clients take control of their finances, is a model for the rest of the nation. 

 BODY:
Adalberto Jaimes offers his clients personalized financial planning. Like private bankers and wealth managers, he helps people set their financial priorities and goals. He picks up the phone to negotiate deals and helps them take care of the paperwork.
Instead of working in a sleek Midtown bank, however, Jaimes' office is a cubicle in the back of the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation in Washington Heights, where people can get services ranging from legal representation in eviction cases to asthma management. Jaimes, a native of Colombia, helps clients facing arrears in their rent, mountains of credit card debt, and credit scores that prevent them from renting apartments or getting jobs. 
His services are free to clients. Jaimes is employed by Neighborhood Trust, a nonprofit that provides financial advice to low-income New Yorkers. Neighborhood Trust is the largest operator of New York City's Financial Empowerment Centers, which were established in June, 2008. Jonathan Mintz, the commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, said the F.E.C.'s were established to "take a look at the whole picture. How do you walk out of here not just literally with reduced debt, which is great, of course, but with your arms around your finances?"

Currently there are more than 30 F.E.C.'s lodged in neighborhood organizations around the city, offering counseling in multiple languages. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the mayor's personal charity, is now providing grants to Living Cities' Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund to replicate and customize the model in Philadelphia, Nashville, Denver, San Antonio and Lansing, Mich., - places that won out over 45 others for these grants. The first centers will open in March.
If the rich need personalized financial advice and hands-on-help, poor people need it more. When there is no cushion, one small mistake can be catastrophic - if you rely on a car to get to work, for example, missing a car payment can result in the loss of a job.
Personalized advice, moreover, adds more value for the poor. Wealthy people could manage their own money if they chose to spend the time, and tend to have the clout and confidence to negotiate favorable terms. But most poor people have no idea about their options. They may not be aware that they can get financial aid for college or tax credits for child care. "I didn't know what was on my credit card statement," said Ruben Felix, a tailor who has been Jaimes' client since September, 2011. "Only the due date."
"As consumers, people have rights - but they don't know about them," said Iran Lisser, an F.E.C. counselor who works at Staten Island Legal Services in St. George and El Centro del Inmigrante in Port Richmond. Lisser's clients living on Social Security, veterans' and other federal benefits are relieved to find out that creditors cannot legally freeze or garnish that income. While many clients come in asking her to get them a lower interest rate on a credit card, they usually do not know that they could also reduce the fees companies pile on, and the amount of debt itself. "Anything is negotiable," she said. "Anything. It's all about negotiating."
Jaimes and Lisser, who was born in Honduras, said that clients are often people who were financially responsible until losing a job or suffering an illness. Some have compounded their problems by resorting to commercial debt settlement companies, which charge an upfront fee and then tell clients to play chicken by not talking to or paying creditors. "One or two percent of the time it's effective," said Mintz. "But overwhelmingly, creditors sue them, seize their accounts and destroy their credit rating."
Jaimes said that most of his clients come to their first meeting with a stack of collection letters - unopened. "Can I open these envelopes for you? We have to deal with them,"' Jaimes tells them. At the first meeting, he tries to get a complete picture of income, debts and expenses, and draws up a budget, suggesting where to cut costs. "Going out, clothing, taxis. People take a lot of taxis - I don't know why. People spend a lot of money on lunch. I show them what I do - I bring my lunch," he said, reaching down next to his desk and pulling out a bag. "Maybe this month they will bring lunch to work two times, next month three times, then four. That's how you start a new behavior - and the goal is to change behavior."
Lisser begins by addressing clients' stress, step by step: "You will feel relieved after you settle the first one," she says. She leads them through opening the debt notices, calling the collections agencies and beginning negotiations. When the client takes over making the calls, she will coach by scribbling notes.
James Blow, a Staten Island firefighter, and his wife, India, came to see Lisser about 18 months ago because they needed to save. They were falling behind on their utility bills and in arrears on their mortgage. The couple had been rejected for a Mortgage Assistance Program loan - a zero interest loan from the Center for New York City Neighborhoods. One requirement was to demonstrate financial responsibility, and they had no savings.
Lisser began by asking them to write down everything they bought for a month. "These were eye-opening exercises," said James. They realized they could cut spending on clothing for their two children and on groceries - India loves to cook. They stopped going to Starbucks. Lisser pointed out that by paying the monthly minimum on their credit cards they were piling up fees. She showed them how to call the companies and to pay off the bills and close the accounts.
The Blows separated James's paycheck into three different bank accounts: money for bills, savings and household expenses now sit in three different pots. "It separates it in my mind and helps us to see this is what we have to work with," India said. They have so far saved $10,000 - and got their MAP loan.
Results not typical, as the ads warn. Most F.E.C. victories are more modest. F.E.C. counselors have so far worked with about 20,000 clients, most in multiple visits. The median income of their clients is $13,200, and the median debt they walk in with is $10,162. Return clients (those who come in more than once) enrolled in a debt plan reduced their debt by an average of $730. And the average return client enrolled in a savings plan increased savings by $531. 
These numbers, of course, chart the program's impact on successful clients - F.E.C.'s don't have a real study of their effectiveness that takes into account clients who don't improve. But there is evidence from similar programs of the value of personalized, hands-on counseling.
One interesting study comes from an unusual source: the tax prep firm H&R Block. The study had tax preparers fill out a FAFSA college financial aid form for interested clients - the information is largely the same required for tax forms. The preparers also calculated how much aid the student could get, and provided figures for tuition costs at nearby colleges. Triple the number of people applied for financial aid as in the control group that got the same personalized information but was handed a FAFSA form to fill out at home. Those who had the expert do the form were also more likely to go to college and stay in college: 29 percent more likely to attend for two consecutive years. The information-only group fared the same as a third group that was merely given some general brochures about the importance of college.
Information, even custom information, did not create more college students. But having an expert fill out the form did.
Other studies have shown the utility of hands-on help. A group of behavioral economists tested (pdf, p 138) this at workshops in Chicago designed to help low-income people dependent on check-cashers to open bank accounts. Among people given a referral letter to a bank and instructions on how to open an account, 90 percent had thought they would follow through - but only 50 percent did. But when a bank representative attended the workshop and helped people fill out the forms, uptake rose.
The power of hands-on help reveals how seemingly trivial factors can have a big impact: denial, plain old forgetting, fear of forms. "People say, 'we simplified - it's a three-page form,'" said Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard behavioral economist. "But a three-page form is complicated. Procrastination follows from complexity."
Coaching helps with all of these. It can also build confidence among people who are routinely trampled by financial institutions. For a startling illustration of the importance of confidence, look at this small study done in a soup kitchen in Trenton, N.J. The idea was to increase the rate at which people filed taxes (and got the large rebates they were entitled to under the Earned Income Tax Credit.) Soup kitchen patrons were asked to spend a few minutes either describing an experience that had made them feel successful and proud, or describing what they ate in a typical day. On the way out of the kitchen, each participant was offered a brochure about the EITC. Of those who talked about their eating habits, 36 percent took a brochure. But 79 percent of those who talked about a successful experience took one.
Ideally, the F.E.C. coach can help clients set up systems that keep them on track: automatic savings, automatic bill payment, automatic reminders by text. "Distress is an economic state but also a psychological state," said Mullainathan. "The remedies have to address both."
The F.E.C. counselors can't help everyone - Jaimes said he has some fixed-income clients who simply can't pay anything, and all he can do is write cease-and-desist letters to collection agencies. But both Jaimes and Lisser said that they also have many clients who become, well, financially empowered. Over the course of five meetings, Jaimes helped Felix, who had started getting into trouble after a divorce, pay down his $17,185 in debt. He also raised his credit rating from zero to 673. Felix now has no debt, a savings account and a 401(k), and he's looking to buy a house. Recently his daughter came to him with a $500 credit card debt. Felix used what he had learned from Jaimes. "I called the company, asked to speak to the supervisor, and I negotiated," he said. She ended up paying $200.
"Don't damage your credit rating," he told her. "A credit card is not a toy."

HEADLINE: The Health-Care Law and Retirement Savings

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The way in which pension contributions are treated for tax purposes could affect eligibility for premium assistance under the Affordable Care Act, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Because of its definition of affordability, beginning next year the Affordable Care Act may affect retirement savings.
Employer contributions to employee pension plans are exempt from payroll and personal income taxes at the time that they are made, because the employer contributions are not officially considered part of the employee's wages or salary (employer health insurance contributions are treated much the same way). The contributions are taxed when withdrawn (typically when the worker has retired), at a rate determined by the retiree's personal income tax situation.
Employees are sometimes advised to save for retirement in this way in part because the interest, dividends and capital gains accrue without repeated taxation. In addition, people sometimes expect their tax brackets to be lower when retired than they are when they are working.
These well-understood tax benefits of pension plans will change a year from now if the act is implemented as planned. Under the act, wages and salaries of people receiving health insurance in the law's new "insurance exchanges" will be subject to an additional implicit tax, because wages and salaries will determine how much a person has to pay for health insurance.
While much about the Affordable Care Act is still being digested by economists, they have long recognized that high marginal tax rates lead to fringe benefit creation. And the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the act will raise marginal tax rates.

Were an employer to reduce wages and salaries (or fail to increase them) and compensate employees by introducing an employer-matching pension plan, the employee is likely to benefit by receiving additional government assistance with his health-insurance costs. The pension contributions will add to the worker's income during retirement, except that the income of elderly people does not determine health-insurance eligibility to the same degree, because the elderly participate in Medicare, most of which is not means-tested.
Take, for example, a person whose four-member household would earn $95,000 a year if his employer were not making contributions to a pension plan or did not offer one. He would be ineligible for any premium assistance under the Affordable Care Act because his family income would be considered to be about 400 percent of the poverty line.
If instead the employer made a $4,000 contribution to a pension plan and reduced the employee's salary so that household income was $91,000, the employee would save the personal income and payroll tax on the $4,000 and would become eligible for about $2,600 worth of health-insurance premium assistance under the act. (The employer would come out ahead here, too, by reducing its payroll tax obligations).
Even though the Affordable Care Act is known as a health-insurance law, in effect it could be paying for a large portion of employer contributions to pension plans. This has the potential of changing retirement savings and the relative living standards of older and working-age people.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
In pushing for Congress to act swiftly to overhaul the nation's immigration rules, President Obama has offered some proposals that expose potential conflicts in the current debate. Mark Landler writes that Mr. Obama's speech on Tuesday and a framework offered Monday by a bipartisan group of eight senators were opening steps in a complicated effort to move forward on an issue that the president and both parties agree needs to be addressed.
 

        
Julia Preston writes that Mr. Obama's proposals for an immigration overhaul offered lawmakers "carrots and sticks," but also left vague many potentially divisive issues. The speech he gave on Tuesday positioned him to be "involved in the debate as it unfolds in coming months in Congress, while also staying distant enough to be able to force the action in the direction of policies he favors, if he finds it necessary.".

        
Jennifer Steinhauer explainsthe changed political, demographic and economic dynamics pressuring Congress as lawmakers gear up to refight policy battles on immigration and gun violence. The rising political influence of Hispanics, a reduced flow of undocumented immigrants into the country and increased border security have improved prospects for immigration reform, but tighter gun controls appear less likely because lawmakers in gun-friendly districts are positioning themselves for the 2014 elections.

        
As Senator John Kerry prepares to take on his next role as secretary of state, Michael R. Gordon writes, it is unclear how he will approach the range of difficult issues that he will inherit. Mr. Kerry, who will be sworn in after Hillary Rodham Clinton steps down on Friday, will be charged with handling the diplomatic response to conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians, bloody battles in Egypt and Syria, and deteriorated relations with Russia.

        
Lawmakers' push to withhold their own paychecks until Congress passes a budget might seem noble until one considers how wealthy members of Congress are. Jeremy W. Peters points out that lawmakers' net worth is more than 14 times that of the average American household, cushioning all but the poorest members from the pinch of a few missed paychecks. There are also questions about whether such a proposal runs afoul of a constitutional amendment regulating lawmakers' pay.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Economic reports due on Wednesday include one on the fourth-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 a.m.

        
The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a long-awaited hearing on gun violence at 10 a.m.

        
At 1:45 p.m., Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will hold a final town-hall-style meeting with Department of State personnel.

        
Federal Reserve policymakers will conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2:15 p.m.

        
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who will become secretary of state, will give his farewell speech on the chamber floor at 2:30 p.m.

HEADLINE: Reid's Tone May Hint at Senate's Path on Guns and Immigration

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Harry Reid of Nevada has hinted that he is more eager to move legislation on an overhaul of the immigration system than on broad gun control measures. 

 BODY:
Sometimes in politics, tone is everything.
When President Obamapledged on Tuesday to pursue broad changes in the nation's immigration system, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, was effusive in his praise for the effort.
"In Nevada, I have seen firsthand how the hardships imposed by our broken immigration system have hurt families and strained our economy," Mr. Reid said in a statement that implicitly acknowledged how important Hispanic voters are to Mr. Reid's political future.
"I am personally committed to resolving this issue," Mr. Reid vowed. "With the president's leadership and members of both parties working together in the Senate, the momentum toward a solution is real, and I will work tirelessly to make reform a reality in the Senate." 
Mr. Reid's help is crucial to the president's hopes for passing legislation that offers a pathway to citizenship for nearly 11 million illegal immigrants. White House officials and immigration activists are pushing for an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Senate in the hopes of putting pressure on Republicans in the House to follow suit.
The legislative battle is likely to be fierce. But with Mr. Reid's eager assistance, the president might just achieve it.
Compare that situation with the situation faced by gun control advocates. Mr. Obama promised this month to pursue aggressive new measures to limit gun violence in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. Advocates plan to start the fight in the Senate, where - like immigration - they hope they can secure passage of key legislation before moving on to even tougher fights in the House.
But Mr. Reid's reaction to the president's gun control plans was anything but eager.
"I am committed to ensuring that the Senate will consider legislation that addresses gun violence and other aspects of violence in our society early this year," Mr. Reid said - essentially promising no more than a simple hearing. He added: "All options should be on the table moving forward."
Mr. Reid is no fan of gun control, in part because he comes from a western state with a gun-loving culture. In his long Senate career, Mr. Reid has not been a strong supporter of new restrictions on gun ownership, and his tone has not changed much recently.
Gun control advocates have noted with some hope that Mr. Reid has made some mildly supportive statements in the last several weeks, including one from the Senate floor that "we need to accept the reality that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens." On Tuesday, he went a little further.
"I'm going to do everything within my power to bring legislation dealing with guns, with violence generally, to the floor," Mr. Reid said.
But he did not say whether proposals to ban types of assault weapons and their high-capacity ammunition magazines would be among the legislation he would allow for votes on the Senate floor. Those measures are among the most derided by the National Rifle Association and gun owners.
In the end, the majority leader may push both of Mr. Obama's priorities with gusto, concluding that his interests are better served by helping the president succeed on the two biggest agenda items of his second term.
But the betting among those who watch Mr. Reid closely is that he will do only as much as he has to on guns, reserving the bulk of his political capital for the fight he really wants to have: passage of legislation to revamp the nation's immigration system.
On guns, Mr. Reid says he is "committed" to a hearing. On immigration, he says he is "personally committed" to the cause and will work "tirelessly" to make passage a reality.
Tone matters.

HEADLINE: Economic Nudge for an Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: With the scale of the immigration problem stabilizing for the moment, or even shrinking, there is more room for political compromise than the last time Congress tried, and failed, to confront the issue. 

 BODY:
The newfound urgency among Republicans to improve their standing among Hispanic voters is not the only reason that an immigration policy overhaul may have a better chance this year than in 2007, when Congress last tried to confront the issue and failed.
By some key measures, the problems underlying illegal immigration - the economic and demographic pressures that have drawn Mexicans north for decades in search of jobs and a better life, and the challenges for the United States of securing its borders - have diminished over the past six years. 
The Mexican economy, while still riddled with inefficiency and inequality, is nonetheless humming along, providing many more job opportunities for Mexican workers. And in Mexico, the source of about 6 in 10 illegal immigrants in the United States, the birthrate has plummeted over the last few decades, shrinking the pool of potential emigrants.
"We are at a moment when the underlying drivers of what has been persistent, growing illegal immigration for 40 years have shifted," said Doris Meissner, a commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a research group. "There are some fundamental new realities." 
At the same time, one of the most contentious elements in previous battles over the issue - border security - has also become less of a partisan flash point. Even among border-state Republicans, there is optimism that the billions of dollars spent in recent years on fences, additional agents, surveillance drones and other measures is having a real effect. 
"Yes, there's been improvement in border security, and, yes, it helps a lot," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is a leader of the bipartisan group seeking compromise legislation, said when asked whether the politics of getting a deal this time around would be easier because of stepped-up enforcement.
There is still debate about whether the changes are permanent or would be reversed in the event of another sharp economic downturn in Mexico or across Latin America - or a strong rebound in economic growth and demand for labor in the United States.
But for now the population of illegal immigrants in the United States shows little sign of growth. It fell to 11.1 million in 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, from a peak of 12 million in 2007, the Pew Hispanic Center said in a report on Tuesday. By one new estimate, the number of people who managed to cross the Mexican border illegally into the United States fell to 85,000 in 2011, down from 600,000 five years earlier.
With the scale of the problem stabilizing for the moment, or even shrinking, some experts say, there is more room for political compromise than the last time around.
"The immigration debate in recent years, as it has played out in the last two presidential campaigns, has not kept pace with the facts on the ground," said Paul Taylor, the director of the Pew Hispanic Center. "I do sense that the nature of the debate is changing and catching up with the reality."
Mexico's population growth has fallen to an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first decade of this century from 3.2 percent in the 1960s, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The number of people under 15 years old is declining in Mexico, and the number of people ages 15 to 29 will start doing so in the coming years, an important shift given that most illegal immigrants arrive in the United States before age 30.
Children are staying in school longer, an indication of an intention not to emigrate in search of low-skill employment, and the development of a middle class has further depleted the numbers of Mexicans compelled to seek a livelihood in the United States.
The statistics at the border are also striking evidence of a diminished flow of people seeking to cross into the United States illegally. Reflecting in part the deterrent effect of tighter border patrols, as well as the economic and demographic shifts, the number of apprehensions along the border has fallen sharply. Those people who have gotten through are being caught and deported at record-high rates.
Some analysts say the drop in apprehensions reflects not so much greater control of the border as a recognition by potential immigrants that the chances of finding a job in the United States have fallen over the past few years. And in any case the decline does not alter the most compelling fact of the debate to both sides, which is that there are 11 million undocumented people already living in the United States whose status must be addressed in any comprehensive legislation.
But even though the economic and demographic changes have remained largely in the background of the debate, analysts say they could offer more reassurance to conservatives in particular that giving legal status to those immigrants would not simply produce another wave of them.
Still, some skepticism about changes to immigration policy remains. Mexico continues to suffer from social instability, and the prolonged weakness in the American labor market makes it harder to draw long-term conclusions about the relative attraction of coming to the United States. Many Republicans continue to view Mexico warily, seeing in the government's difficulties in controlling the violence and general lawlessness created by drug cartels a dangerous instability that could create deeper cross-border troubles.
"Mexico is on fire and about to blow up," said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a supporter of the bipartisan package, expressing concern about whether the positive trends in illegal immigration were permanent.

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson Proposes Creation of a New Lender

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: At a three-day conference, the Rev. Jesse Jackson discussed a proposal to use pension money to make loans in low-income communities. 

 BODY:
There's been no shortage of ideas for how to jump-start economic growth in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But a new one comes with a high-profile backer: the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
At a three-day conference in New York that began on Wednesday, Mr. Jackson discussed a proposal for increasing the availability of capital by using pension money to make loans in low-income communities. The idea -- which is for now just an idea -- is getting a prominent debut at the 16th annual Wall Street Project Economic Summit, hosted by Mr. Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition and the Citizenship Education Fund.
"We've got to think outside the present fiscal-cliff-debt-ceiling box," Mr. Jackson said in an interview on Wednesday. "We must have some plan for reconstruction."
The conference features some big names, with a keynote speech from President Bill Clinton. The comptroller of New York City, John C. Liu, who oversees the city's pension funds, is speaking on Thursday.
Mr. Jackson, who regularly speaks out about banks' abuses in minority communities, envisions the creation of a lender similar to development banks in other countries. With political gridlock in Washington, and with banks limiting access to capital, a separate solution is needed, Mr. Jackson said, comparing the idea to the Marshall Plan.
Using pension money would simultaneously achieve another of Mr. Jackson's goals: encouraging pensions to focus on socially responsible investments.
"New York would be a great place to do this," Mr. Jackson said. "You've got Harlem and Wall Street on the same island."
There is precedent in the city for getting creative with pension funds. Mr. Jackson recalled the fiscal crisis in 1975, when the investment banker Felix G. Rohatyn engineered a rescue. That plan involved pension funds backing the city's debt.
Fundamentally, Mr. Jackson's proposal is about leveling the playing field.
"We bailed out the banks," Mr. Jackson said. "We didn't bail out the victims of the recession."

HEADLINE: The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Is life on the bottom and in the middle better than it seems? 

 BODY:
A concept promulgated by the right- the notion of the hidden prosperity of the poor - underpins the conservative take on the ongoing debate over rising inequality.
The political right uses this concept to undermine the argument made by liberals that the increasingly unequal distribution of income poses a danger to the social fabric as well as to the American economy.
President Obama forcefully articulated the case from the left in an address on Dec. 6, 2011 at Osawatomie High School in Kansas:
This kind of gaping inequality gives lie to the promise that's at the very heart of America: that this is a place where you can make it if you try. We tell people - we tell our kids - that in this country, even if you're born with nothing, work hard and you can get into the middle class. We tell them that your children will have a chance to do even better than you do. That's why immigrants from around the world historically have flocked to our shores. 
The conservative counterargument - that life for the poor and the middle class is better than it seems - goes like this: Even with stagnant or modestly growing incomes, the poor and middle class benefit from the fact that a stable or declining share of income is now required for basic necessities, leaving more money for discretionary spending. According to this theory, consumption inequality - the disparity between the amount of money spent on goods and services by the rich, the middle class and the poor - remains relatively unchanged, even while income inequality worsens.
In its definition of consumption, the Bureau of Labor Statistics includes "expenditures for food, housing, transportation, apparel, medical care, entertainment, and miscellaneous items." In an e-mail to The Times, Mark Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint, goes further to make the conservative case:
For the consumer products, goods, and services primarily produced/provided by the private sector in competitive markets: air travel, foreign travel, food and beverages, restaurant meals, housing, clothing, footwear, household appliances and utensils, furniture, electronics (TVs, iPods, DVDs, BlueRay, Tivo, home theater systems), cameras, GPS, computers, cars and trucks, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, sporting goods, household tools and equipment, cell phones and cell phone service, LASIK surgery, cosmetic surgery, musical instruments, jewelry and watches, luggage, toys, books, information (Wikipedia, Internet, etc.), Cable TV, Internet service, car wash, oil changes, etc. those products and services keep getting cheaper and cheaper, and better and better, and with greater variety, relative to: a) the general price level, and b) average income, and in other words, keep getting more and more affordable over time to the average person. And the average consumer benefits the most, and is most satisfied, with those products/services provided by the market.
Perry and Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University, elaborated on this theme in a Jan. 23 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, "The Myth of a Stagnant Middle Class." The two economists contend that the "favorite progressive trope" of middle and lower class stagnation "is spectacularly wrong" - that American families today have substantially more discretionary income than ever before because the cost of basic necessities has been steadily falling as a proportion of income:
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, spending by households on many of modern life's "basics" - food at home, automobiles, clothing and footwear, household furnishings and equipment, and housing and utilities - fell from 53% of disposable income in 1950 to 44% in 1970 to 32% today.
Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, and Aparna Mathur, an A.E.I. colleague, declared in an earlier Wall Street Journal op-ed that warnings by Democratic politicians of rising inequality
echo a standard left-wing critique of capitalism: Economic growth does not serve all classes of society. In the mid-19th century, socialists of various stripes asserted that capitalists grow richer while exploiting workers, who grow poorer. Today we hear that the gains from economic growth accrue to the highest-income earners while the standard of living of the poor and middle America stagnates and the gap between the richest and the poorest grows ever wider. That portrait of the country is wrong.
Instead, Hassett and Mathur argue that liberals are asking the wrong question. They point out that according to data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey compiled for the Bureau of Labor Statistics
if you sort households according to their pretax income, in 2010 the bottom fifth accounted for 8.7% of overall consumption, the middle fifth for 17.1%, and the top fifth for about 38.6%. Go back 10 years to 2000 - before two recessions, the Bush tax cuts, and continuing expansions of globalization and computerization - and the numbers are similar. The bottom fifth accounted for 8.9% of consumption, the middle fifth for 17.3%, and the top fifth for 37.3%.
The consumption theory is powerfully attractive to the right for a number of reasons. It undermines the legitimacy of government action to ameliorate rising income inequality. And it is based in part on the premise that existing welfare programs - food stamps, Medicaid, temporary cash assistance - are doing their job.
These conservative analyses have drawn heated criticism. My colleague Paul Krugman was harsh in his assessment of Boudreaux-Perry - "The BR piece is, in short, a complete non sequitur" - and scathing in his view of Hassett's qualifications: "the co-author of 'Dow 36,000' doesn't exactly have a reputation to destroy."
In fact, other respected economists have been raising serious questions for some time about the consumption thesis and the so-called hidden prosperity of the poor.
In February 2011, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper, "Has Consumption Inequality Mirrored Income Inequality?" by Mark A. Aguiar, of Princeton, and Mark Bils of the University of Rochester. The authors concluded that "consumption inequality has closely tracked income inequality over the period 1980 - 2007." In other words, the growing gap between what rich and poor spend parallels the growing gap in the money they take in.
Similarly, in "The Evolution of Income, Consumption, and Leisure Inequality in the US, 1980-2010," Orazio Attanasio of University College London, Erik Hurst of the University of Chicago and Luigi Pistaferri of Stanford declared that their analysis of the data shows that "the increase in income inequality was matched by an increase in consumption inequality of comparable magnitude."
The polarized conflict over the measurement of inequality goes to the heart of a much larger debate in terms of public policy - a debate that has raged for almost a century. Boudreaux puts the conservative case with verve:
Even if we were to grant that both income and consumption inequality has risen over the past few decades, that fact alone says nothing about the absolute economic well-being of middle-income and poor Americans. While we believe that consumption inequality has in fact declined, our larger, more central, and most important point is that middle-class Americans are today far better off economically than they were 30 or 40 years ago, regardless of how their well-being today compares to that of rich Americans.
In contrast, David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in an e-mail to The Times:
My concern is not about inequality at a point in time per se but about the effect of rising inequality on disequalizing the life chances of kids born into affluent versus non-affluent households. There's a real danger that the U.S. - which is not an economically mobile society by western standards - is going to become more dynastic. Already the gradient between household income and college attendance has steepened substantially between cohorts born in the early 1960s and those born in the early 1980s. Since educational attainment is the key predictor of lifetime earnings, this suggests that the link between circumstances at birth and lifetime incomes will be magnified in the current generation relative to the earlier one.
Autor goes on to concede the positive incentives that inequality can generate, but stresses that, in excess, inequality becomes dangerously destructive:
If the U.S. has a civic religion, it is our belief that society should be meritocratic - everyone should have a fair chance at success based on their smarts and their hard work. As the inequality of household resources becomes more skewed, the likelihood that kids starting at the bottom get a decent shot at the top gets more remote. Of course, there are and will be exceptionally successful people from every possible background. But if you walk the campuses of most top colleges in the U.S., you will discover that the vast majority are from upper income households. You don't have to take a moral stance on inequality per se to be deeply worried that this may ultimately inhibit the American ideals that bind us together. Inequality within reason is a good thing; it creates incentives so that people work hard to reap rewards. But if more inequality today reduces the equality of opportunity for the next generation by skewing the playing field and disequalizing opportunities faced by kids from low v. high income households, that's a tradeoff that many people would not want to make.
Politically, with the victory of Barack Obama over Mitt Romney, Autor's argument has trumped Boudreaux's. Joseph Stiglitz, a professor of economics at Columbia and former chief economist of the World Bank (who is also the moderator of a new series of Times opinion pieces on inequality called The Great Divide), makes the case that rising levels of disparity are wreaking havoc.
In a Project Syndicate column on Jan. 7, Stiglitz wrote that growing inequality
is one of the reasons for the economic slowdown, and is partly a consequence of the global economy's deep, ongoing structural changes. An economic and political system that does not deliver for most citizens is one that is not sustainable in the long run. Eventually, faith in democracy and the market economy will erode, and the legitimacy of existing institutions and arrangements will be called into question.
So where does this leave us on the question of the hidden prosperity of the poor? And why should we care?
You've heard the case from the right. What says the left?
Here are three charts from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. When you look at the level of poverty in the United States compare with other developed countries, it is not pretty:
When you focus on child poverty, you go from bad to worse:
And how much of an investment does the United States government make in reducing poverty, compared with other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries?
Jared Bernstein, who served as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden during the Obama administration's first term, has gone head-on at conservative claims regarding consumption inequality and reached striking conclusions. Below is a set of graphs produced by Bernstein "for research purposes" that were published in 2010 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Key consumer costs, Bernstein found, have far outpaced the rate of income growth:
In effect, those at the bottom took a double hit as their incomes shrank and prices rose:
The September 2012 report on income and poverty released by the United States Census provides the left with additional ammunition. It found that household income in 2011 fell 1.5 percent, to its lowest level in 16 years, $50,054. Most arresting, the gap between the incomes of rich and poor expanded further than it had at any time in the past 40 years.
Redistributive conflict is the essence of politics, and ultimately the data debate - in effect, the debate over who should get what - will be resolved politically. All signals point to a fierce running battle over the coming years as the shape and direction of government tax and spending policies are decided. This is a fight that only shared economic growth can defuse. President Obama was wary of engaging this debate directly during his first term. Now, decisively re-elected, he appears to be girding for action. Republicans are defensive and ill-prepared. But as the abrupt emergence of anti-Obama, anti-Democratic sentiment in 2009 and 2010 demonstrated, the balance of partisan power remains highly volatile.
Meanwhile, beneath the political battleground, the presence in the United States of 42.6 million people officially living in poverty - no matter that they have access to a trickle of consumer goods - must be recognized as a powder keg.

HEADLINE: End of the Road for Chesapeake's C.E.O.

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Chesapeake Energy's co-founder is retiring as chief executive. | Customers of MF Global may be made nearly whole, a prospect that once seemed impossible. | Lanny Breuer to announce his departure as head of the Justice Department's criminal division. | The legal dispute over the sale of Dragon Systems to Lernout &#038; Hauspie offers lessons for those working with investment bankers. 

 BODY:
After months of criticism of his compensation plan, Aubrey K. McClendon is retiring as chief executive of Chesapeake Energy on April 1, the company announced on Tuesday. A larger-than-life figure, Mr. McClendon co-founded Chesapeake and built the company through a series of deals that shaped the natural gas industry. "It's an end of an era," said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer.
 Mr. McClendon's departure comes after months of scrutiny and upheaval. Under pressure from shareholders, the company replaced more than half of its directors after news reports said the chief executive had gotten personal loans using stakes in company-owned wells as collateral. The company said the board's review of Mr. McClendon's financial dealings "to date has not revealed improper conduct."
 Investors welcomed the news of Mr. McClendon's departure, sending shares up more than 10 percent after hours. On Tuesday, Carl C. Icahn, one of the shareholders who had pushed for a revamped board, was generous in his praise. "Aubrey has every right to be proud of the company he has built, the world-class team of people at Chesapeake and the collection of assets he has assembled, which in my opinion are the best portfolio of energy assets in the country," he said. 
Still, Chesapeake faces challenges. The company has struggled as the natural gas boom has faded, losing more than two-thirds of its value over the last few years, Clifford Krauss and Michael J. de la Merced write in DealBook.
MF GLOBAL CUSTOMERS' HAPPY RESULTS | Under a proposal that will be reviewed by a bankruptcy court on Thursday, customers of the failed brokerage firm MF Global would receive 93 percent of their missing money. "And the trustee who has submitted the proposal, James W. Giddens, has quietly identified a way that, if sent to the judge and approved, could plug the remaining shortfall for customers in the United States, according to people involved in the case," DealBook's Ben Protess reports. "The broad push to make MF Global customers nearly whole, a goal now surprisingly within reach, is a remarkable turnaround from the firm's 2011 bankruptcy filing when such a recovery seemed impossible."
Investigators continue to collect evidence on the firm's demise. Federal authorities interviewed Jon S. Corzine, a former New Jersey governor who ran MF Global when it collapsed, over two days in September, according to people close to the case, "a sign that the government saw him more as a witness than a suspect," Mr. Protess writes. "Investigators continue to examine one of his statements from the September session, the people close to the case said. The statement involved Mr. Corzine's recollection about a phone call he had with JPMorgan Chase, which received a suspicious $175 million transfer from MF Global on its last day of business."
Mr. Corzine, for his part, is beginning to put the saga behind him. In addition to working on a charitable effort in Central America, Mr. Corzine "was close to cooperating with Richard Ben Cramer, an author and a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, on a biography. Mr. Corzine's lawyers were in the final stages of negotiating with Mr. Cramer this month when the author died from complications of lung cancer."
TOP FEDERAL PROSECUTOR TO DEPART | Lanny A. Breuer, who went after financial wrongdoing as head of the Justice Department's criminal division, is to announce on Wednesday that he is stepping down after nearly four years, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. Mr. Breuer's departure is effective March 1, and it is expected that he will return to private practice. "While he has come under fire for a dearth of prosecutions on Wall Street in response to the crisis, Mr. Breuer also oversaw an aggressive crackdown on money laundering and interest-rate manipulation at some of the world's biggest banks. In two weeks last month, he joined a nearly $2 billion case against HSBC for money laundering and a $1.5 billion settlement with UBS for rate-rigging. Next week, he is expected to take a similar rate-rigging action against the Royal Bank of Scotland." In an interview, Mr. Breuer said his work at the agency had been "the highlight of my professional career."
ON THE AGENDA | Research in Motion is to introduce the new BlackBerry at 10 a.m. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee issues a statement at 2:15 p.m., at the conclusion of a two-day meeting. Facebook and ConocoPhillips report earnings after the market closes. An estimate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter is to be released at 8:30 a.m. Greg Rayburn, chief executive of Hostess Brands, is on Bloomberg TV at 8 a.m. Thorsten Heins, chief executive of Research in Motion, is on CNBC at 2 p.m.
DRAWING LESSONS FROM A DEAL GONE WRONG | The legal dispute over the $580 million sale of Dragon Systems to Lernout & Hauspie may offer some lessons for entrepreneurs and others working with investment bankers. The fight between Dragon's founders and Goldman Sachs, which was resolved last week in Goldman's favor, centered on whether the investment bank had been negligent with its advice in the all-stock deal, which soured when Lernout's accounting was exposed as a fraud and the company collapsed. "The biggest lesson may be to know your advisers," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. The role of an investment bank "can be quite narrow," and it is up to accountants to catch possible fraud. The founders of Dragon "appear to think that their advisers should have saved them from themselves and that they could negotiate a better deal than Goldman Sachs. That was a mistake."

HEADLINE: With BlackBerry's New Name, an Abridged History of Corporate Rebranding

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: No longer called Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker will now go simply by BlackBerry. Some past corporate name changes have worked out, while others have not. 

 BODY:
As the new BlackBerry line was introduced on Wednesday, a corporate name was sent to the dustbin.
No longer called Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker will now go simply by BlackBerry. The new name reflects the company's efforts to reinvent itself and unify its brand, said Thorsten Heins, the company's chief executive, at an event on Wednesday where he unveiled the new product line. The ticker symbol on Nasdaq will change to BBRY from RIMM. 
"Our customers use a BlackBerry, our employees work for BlackBerry, and our shareholders are owners of BlackBerry," Mr. Heins said.
 The BlackBerry name, more widely known than Research in Motion, was chosen by Lexicon Branding. That firm, based in California, also came up with Procter & Gamble's Swiffer and Febreze brands and the name of Apple's PowerBook.
BlackBerry, the corporation, on Wednesday joined a list of companies that have decided to rebrand themselves for one reason or another. 
Some work out. Some don't.
2011: Qwikster | Netflix had decided to spin off its old-fashioned DVD service and call it Qwikster, explaining that the name "refers to quick delivery." After an outcry from subscribers, the company reversed course, dropping the plan. 
2010: Ally Financial | GMAC Financial Services, a lender that once was owned by General Motors, changed its name to Ally Financial. The original brand had been tarnished during the financial crisis when GMAC needed a bailout. Ally is still largely owned by the government. 
2009: Hostess Brands | After emerging from bankruptcy, the Interstate Bakeries Corporation changed its name to Hostess Brands, shedding a generic-sounding name in favor of one that was more recognizable among lovers of Twinkies and other treats. The company filed for bankruptcy again, and is now going through liquidation and selling off its well-known brands.
2007: Apple | In the same year it introduced the iPhone, Apple Computer changed its name to simply Apple, reflecting its expansion into handheld devices. The iPhone now accounts for more than half of Apple's revenue.
2003: Altria | Philip Morris, the cigarette and food giant, changed its name to the Altria Group. The move was seen as an effort by the company to distance itself from the negative image that had grown around its well-known cigarette brand.
2001: Accenture | Andersen Consulting, after splitting from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, changed its name to Accenture. The name, derived from "accent" and "future," was dreamed up by an employee in Norway, who said at the time that the word conveyed "bold growth, operational excellence and a great place to work." Shortly thereafter, Arthur Andersen collapsed amid an accounting scandal.

HEADLINE: Spring Sequester

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins edge toward the fiscal cliff so you don't have to. 

 BODY:
 Gail Collins: David, I've been asking people this all week: Which fiscal cliff do you want to jump off? We can't possibly avoid them all.
 David Brooks: Wait a second, you've been asking people that all week? Have you noticed large numbers rushing in the opposite direction? Do you have any other symptoms? The voice of Grover Cleveland singing "Poker Face" from somewhere deep in your head?
 Gail: I admit I had to pick my audience carefully. Although now that you've brought it up, the idea of a Grover Cleveland-Lady Gaga duet is sort of enthralling. Grover, too, had his tabloid-headline moments. 
But about the fiscal cliffs. The Democrats should be eyeing a government shutdown, since it really boomeranged on the Republicans when they tried it in 1995. If we had a repeat, do you think Paul Ryan could play Newt Gingrich? I wouldn't want to go through all that misery just to ruin the career of poor John Boehner. 
 David: If I were a Democrat I'd be eyeing a government shutdown too. My sense, having done a focus group of myself and generalizing wildly from my own experience, is that people are exhausted with these budget fights. It's pretty clear nothing significant is going to come from them. I say we just admit we're going to have no big fiscal reform this year, and we should move on to immigration or something that might actually pan out.
 Gail: I could buy into that - maybe with a little gun control on the side? But I doubt you could get most Republicans to settle.
Cliff-wise, they seem to be looking at the sequester - huge cuts in spending that are scheduled to automatically kick in March 1 unless Congress stops them. Paul Ryan can't wait! Although even for budget hawks, it seems like a terrible approach. The sequester takes the same percentage from each little subcategory of the budget. So the agencies can't target their most useless programs. I don't see why Ryan is so enthralled.
 David: Ted Cruz from Texas also recently gave a speech in favor of sequestration. Baffling. Though to be fair, when Congress normally cuts agency budgets, the department heads don't aim the cuts at their worst programs, they aim the cuts at their most popular programs so they will be restored.
 Gail: Whenever you and I talk about the budget and deficits, we always seem to wind up arguing about entitlements. As you know, I agree with the president that the big problem isn't Medicare and Medicaid, but the overall cost of health care in this country. Which we could start to fix if the Republicans didn't always react by yelling "death panels."
 David: I don't think it's either-or. Entitlements are a subset of the larger health care problem. The country will go into decline if health care costs eat up 25 percent of G.D.P., and government spending will be swallowed by insurance if the costs continue to increase.
Just to be a little bit rosier though, I'm beginning to have smart people tell me that the recent slowdown in costs is not just because of the bad economic times, it's also caused by the fact that technological innovation is beginning to increase efficiencies rather than just drive up costs. This won't solve the problem (the growing supply of old people will still be a big issue), but maybe health care inflation is moderating.
 Gail: I like that thought. Do you feel the same way about health care for military retirees? That bill has gone up so fast it terrifies even me - from less than $20 billion to $53 billion over the past 10 years. The program is much more generous than Medicare.
 David: Here, too, potential progress. I keep running into people who are designing medical devices that are cheap and portable. I ran into someone last weekend who has an ingenious blood lab the size of a laptop. So far innovation hasn't dragged down costs because the incentives are so screwed up. But maybe that will change.
I'd feel a lot better about things, by the way, if I knew who is in charge of implementing Obamacare. Many of the really talented people who wrote the bill are moving on.
 Gail: If this sequester thing could involve big fixes instead of nasty nibbles, I'd propose this: Military retirees should just get Medicare like the rest of the country. That would save a ton of money.
Of course we'd still have a huge problem with the cost of caring for disabled veterans, but I don't have a budget-cutting answer for that one. You're talking about people whose lives were altered forever because they were wounded fighting for our country.
 David: I guess I agree. But have you seen how much veterans' benefits have increased over the past few decades? That's the mother of all sacred cows.
 Gail: Any ideas for cuts that don't involve entitlements? I've always been fascinated by how hard it is, politically, to get rid of specific programs, even if they're pretty clearly a part of the proverbial fat in the budget. The Washington Post did a story the other day about the Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation, which runs a contest for middle school students who have ideas about community improvement. The winners go to Disney World. It certainly isn't hurting anybody but it's duplicative, inefficient and costs the government about $450,000 a year. Every year there's a bipartisan effort to get rid of it, but Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi always saves it. There are a lot of stories like that.
 David: Every four years candidates vow to simplify the morass of job training programs, and every four years the morass remains. It's hard to streamline an organization, and nobody in government ever has an incentive to do it, the way a C.E.O. does.
 Gail: Well, axing the Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation isn't going to keep us away from any cliffs. I've been wondering what happens once we go over one. Is there a protocol? A menu? How should one dress for cliff-bottom dwelling?
 David: Here's a way to make money off of other people's misery. Short house prices in Northern Virginia. Starting with sequestration and then continuing over the next several years, the Defense Department is going to be hammered. All the big defense contractors in Northern Virginia are going to be hit. It's already happening. I don't know if you were thinking of buying a McMansion in McLean or not, but I'd hold off for five years.
And whatever you do, don't walk around the local supermarket asking people about the fiscal cliff.

HEADLINE: Growth Halted In 4th Quarter Despite the Fed

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
The federal government helped bring the economic recovery to a virtual halt late last year as cuts in military spending and other factors overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's expanded campaign to stimulate growth.
Disappointing data released Wednesday underscore how tighter fiscal policy may continue to weigh on growth in the future as government spending, which increased steadily in recent decades and expanded hugely during the recession, plays a diminished role in the United States economy.
Significant federal spending cuts are scheduled to take effect March 1, and most Americans are also now paying higher payroll taxes with the expiration of a temporary cut in early January. 
The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last three months of 2012, the worst quarter since the economy crawled out of the last recession, hampered by the lower military spending, fewer exports and smaller business stockpiles, preliminary government figures indicated on Wednesday. The Fed, in a separate appraisal, said economic activity ''paused in recent months.''
Still, economists said the seemingly bleak gross domestic product report was not a sign that another recession was looming. The preliminary data showed relatively strong spending by consumers and businesses, even as military spending posted its sharpest quarterly drop in 40 years.
Forecasters expect that growth this year will rebound to a still-anemic 1.5 percent, a little lower than the pace it has managed over the last three years.
''This is the tip of the iceberg on fiscal austerity from Washington,'' said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''It was exaggerated this quarter by the unusually large drop in defense spending, but that and higher taxes will start hurting'' in the coming months.
The drop in American exports stemmed in part from a decline in economic growth in Europe, where governments have also been cutting spending in a bid to balance budgets. The parallel contractions are likely to provide fodder for economists who argue that austerity efforts have gone too far in many developed economies.
The surprisingly weak numbers could also force politicians to limit the cuts that are scheduled to take effect if Congress fails to produce a budget bargain in the coming weeks and strengthen the argument that deficit reduction is a lesser concern than job creation.
''Our economy is facing a major headwind, and that's Republicans in Congress,'' said the White House spokesman Jay Carney.
Republicans said the White House was not advancing concrete plans for creating new jobs and stimulating the economy.
''The bad GDP news makes it even more unbelievable that Obama has been ignoring job growth in his 2nd term agenda,'' Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, posted on Twitter.
The Fed said Wednesday that it would continue its efforts to revive growth by holding short-term interest rates near zero and increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion a month. Those policies aim to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
''The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline,'' the Fed said in a statement.
Unemployment has not declined since the Fed started its latest round of purchases in September. The rate was 7.8 percent in December, the same as three months earlier. The government will report the rate for January on Friday.
Although economists expected output to decline substantially from the 3.1 percent annual growth rate recorded in the third quarter, the negative G.D.P. number still caught Wall Street off-guard. It was the weakest economic report since the second quarter of 2009, although revisions in February and March could alter the figure.
''I'm a little surprised,'' said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan.
Like some other observers, Mr. Feroli said there were hints the economy was performing slightly better than the headline number suggested.
The 22.2 percent drop in military spending, along with the drop in inventories and exports, outweighed more positive indicators in the private sector, he said. For example, residential investment jumped 15.3 percent, a sign that the housing sector continued to recover. Similarly, investment in equipment and software by businesses rose 12.4 percent, an indicator that companies were still spending.
For the entire year, the economy grew by 2.2 percent, a slight improvement from the 1.8 percent annual rate in 2011.
Despite the unexpected contraction, investors reacted mildly to the news, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falling less than half a percent.
If it were not for the drop in total government spending, the economy would have expanded at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight.
Alan Krueger, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in a blog post that ''a likely explanation'' for the plunge in military spending was concern among contractors about the automatic spending cuts, which were set to take effect on Jan. 1 but were rescheduled for March 1. The decline in federal spending follows an earlier drop in state and local spending, which fell by 3.4 percent in 2011 and 1.3 percent in 2012.
The compromise between President Obama and Congress earlier this month allowed a temporary cut in Social Security taxes to expire, which is also expected to crimp growth in the first quarter. The change will cost a worker earning $50,000 a year an extra $1,000 annually.
A consumer confidence survey released Tuesday by the Conference Board showed a sharp downturn in January, which economists attributed in part to financial anxiety arising from the reduction in take-home pay.
In the long term, government's share of economic output ''is a question of values and choices and what size you think the government should be,'' Mr. Gault said. But in the short term, he said, steep cutbacks make for risky economic policy.
''We're being more austere than we need to be,'' he said. ''The economy isn't growing that fast and you don't want to be taking away stimulus now.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler's Earnings Soar, Raising Fiat's With Them

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Chrysler, the smallest of the American automakers, on Wednesday reported a big increase in 2012 earnings that helped its Italian parent company, Fiat, become profitable for the year as well.
Chrysler said that its net income soared to $1.67 billion last year -- about nine times as much as the $183 million it earned in 2011.
The exponential increase underscored the company's comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009, when it was taken over by Fiat. 
In the fourth quarter alone, Chrysler said it earned $378 million, a 68 percent increase from $225 million in the same period in 2011. Revenue in the quarter was $17.2 billion, a 13 percent gain from $15.1 billion a year earlier.
''Chrysler concluded a very successful 2012 with a robust fourth-quarter performance,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto research site TrueCar.com. ''The company was the only domestic automaker to gain market share last year.''
Chrysler also benefited from having little exposure to the deepening economic crisis in Europe, where vehicle sales have fallen to the lowest levels in nearly 20 years.
The European problems, however, took a heavy toll on results at Fiat, which also reported earnings on Wednesday.
Without Chrysler, Fiat said it would have lost 1.04 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2012. But instead, Chrysler's results helped Fiat earn a profit of 1.41 billion euros for the year, about a 15 percent decrease from the 1.65 billion euros the Italian automaker earned in 2011, which included Chrysler after the middle of the year.
In the fourth quarter, Fiat reported a profit of 388 million euros. Without Chrysler's contributions, it would have lost 241 million euros.
Analysts said Chrysler's strong performance in the surging United States market should compensate for Fiat's troubles for some time to come.
''With Europe in the mess it is in, it's going to be a tough slog for Fiat,'' said Mike Wall, an analyst with the market-research firm IHS Automotive. ''They need all the help Chrysler can give them.''
Fiat currently owns a 58.5 percent stake in Chrysler, and has been consolidating the American company's performance into its own results since June 2011.
Chrysler has been growing steadily as it introduced new vehicles and revamped older models. Its revenue for 2012 was $65.8 billion, a 19.6 percent improvement from $55 billion the previous year.
For the year, its global vehicle sales increased to 2.2 million, an 18 percent increase from 1.9 million the previous year, and its market share in the United States improved to 11.2 percent, up from 10.5 percent a year earlier.
Sergio Marchionne, who serves as chief executive of both Chrysler and Fiat, said the turnaround at Chrysler was gaining momentum thanks to solid sales of core products like the Ram pickup and the Jeep Grand Cherokee S.U.V.
''We pause for a moment to enjoy our accomplishments,'' Mr. Marchionne said, ''but we will not stop.''
Mr. Marchionne forecast continued improvement for Chrysler this year. He said the company expected to earn net income of $2.2 billion in 2013, on revenue of $72 billion or higher.
He also outlined plans on Wednesday to bring more Fiat and Alfa Romeo models to the United States, even as Chrysler delays the introduction of some of its own new products.
The Alfa Romeo brand, which left the American market almost 20 years ago, will return with a sports car later this year. It is the first of several new Alfas destined for the United States over the next three years.
Fiat will also add several new products for the American market, building on its first offering, the tiny Fiat 500 microcar.
Mr. Marchionne said that a few Chrysler car models, mostly derived from Fiat platforms, would be delayed as a result.
''The product plan is a living document,'' he said, referring to changes in Chrysler's vehicle timetable. ''And we continue to rework that document.''
Mr. Marchionne also said plans were fluid regarding an initial public offering of Chrysler stock. A health care trust for retired members of the United Automobile Workers union is seeking an I.P.O. to cash out its 41.5 percent ownership stake in Chrysler.
Chrysler's large profits in 2012 will directly benefit its current hourly work force. About 31,000 union members will receive average profit-sharing checks of $2,250, the company said.

HEADLINE: Beijing Takes Steps To Fight Pollution As Problem Worsens

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Shi Da contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Beijing government put in place emergency measures on Wednesday to try to combat thick smog that has encased the city, which the Communist Party has hailed as a showcase capital, in brown and gray soot. The measures include temporarily shutting down more than 100 factories and ordering one-third of government vehicles off the streets, according to official news reports.
The effort came on the second straight day of air that was rated ''hazardous'' by the standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. That rating, in which the air quality index surpasses 300, means people should not venture outdoors at all. This month, Beijing has faced the most polluted air days on recent record. The surge in pollution, which is happening across northern China, has angered residents and led the state news media to report more openly on air quality problems. 
Officials have also begun acknowledging the severity of the problem. Xinhua, the state news agency, reported that Wang Anshun, the newly appointed mayor of Beijing, said Monday that the government had come up with a preliminary plan to curb the pollution.
''I hope we can have blue skies, clean water, less traffic and a more balanced education system,'' Mr. Wang said at a session of the municipal legislature, in a broad reference to quality-of-life issues.
Mr. Wang also told lawmakers that ''the current environmental problems are worrisome.'' He said the number of vehicles in Beijing should be allowed to increase, but slowly. The Xinhua report said there were about 5.18 million vehicles in Beijing, compared with 3.13 million in early 2008.
Mr. Wang told the legislature on Jan. 22 that the Beijing government was aiming to cut the density of major air pollutants by 2 percent this year. To that end, officials are ordering 180,000 older vehicles off the roads, promoting the use of ''clean energy'' for government vehicles and heating systems, and growing trees over 250 square miles of land in the next five years, Xinhua reported.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao also addressed the pollution issue at seminars on economic development in the past week, Xinhua said. It reported that Mr. Wen said efforts should be made to ''optimize industrial structure, promote energy saving and emission reduction, and advance ecological progress.''
In the past three decades, China has adopted a growth-at-any-cost attitude to build its economy, and the resulting environmental damage is now widespread and severe. Analysts say it will take years to clean up the air in northern China, even if serious measures are taken now.
Beijing sits in the middle of an industrial belt of coal-burning factories, and there is little incentive for officials or executives to slow down work there. Traditionally, officials' performance ratings have been closely tied to economic growth and the maintenance of stability. In recent years, some policy makers have urged that a measure of environmentalism be taken into account.
The United States Energy Information Administration released a report on Tuesday that said China now accounts for 47 percent of global coal consumption, almost equal to all other countries in the world combined. Coal consumption in China grew by more than 9 percent in 2011, or 325 million tons, which equaled 87 percent of the total global rise in coal use.
The report said the heavy demand for coal was because of an increase of more than 200 percent in electricity generation since 2000. China's demand for coal grew an average of 9 percent a year from 2000 to 2010. If China were excluded from measurements of global growth during that time, the average annual growth would have been only 1 percent, the report said.
On Tuesday morning, the air quality index, as measured by a device atop the United States Embassy in central Beijing, reached 517, which was so high that the rating was labeled ''beyond index'' on an embassy Twitter account, @BeijingAir. (Once before, the account had labeled a rating of more than 500 ''crazy bad,'' but embassy officials quickly deleted that tweet.) Index readings on a Web site run by the Beijing government had similar numbers.
The indexes are based primarily on measurements of a potentially deadly particulate matter called PM 2.5. In mid-January, some monitoring devices set up by the government in the Beijing municipality, which includes more than 20 million people, recorded PM 2.5 concentrations of nearly 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, which was on par with some severely polluted days in industrial London during the mid-20th century.
Beijing announced in early 2012 that it would report PM 2.5 levels, in response to an outcry from residents demanding the information. A total of 74 Chinese cities are supposed to release that data this year. Among the prominent voices calling for greater disclosure is Pan Shiyi, a real estate tycoon.
This week, Mr. Pan has asked the 14 million followers of his microblog whether China should adopt a ''clean air act'' that would be much stronger than current laws. As of Wednesday afternoon, 99 percent of the more than 42,000 replies had voted in favor of the act.
''In order to control air pollution, we need everyone to participate,'' Mr. Pan wrote. ''The most important thing is legislation.''
Mr. Pan did not give details on what the legislation would say. He said that as a member of the Beijing municipal people's congress, he would bring up the idea of an act to other legislators and officials. In China, though, legislatures have little power; senior party officials make important policy.
Zhang Xin, Mr. Pan's wife and business partner, said on her microblog that after thousands of people died as a result of air pollution in Britain in the 1950s, the government vigorously tackled its air quality problems with strict laws.

HEADLINE: Officials Back Deep Cuts in Atlantic Cod Harvest to Save Industry

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Fishery management officials meeting here on Wednesday voted to impose drastic new cuts to the commercial harvest of cod along the Atlantic coast, arguing that the only way to save the centuries-old cod fishing industry was to sharply limit it.
In the 1600s, the lowly cod was so abundant in the cold North Atlantic waters that, along with boatbuilding and timbering, it provided the foundation of the New England economy. In the 1700s, a ''sacred cod'' was bestowed on the State House in Massachusetts, where it hangs to this day as a symbol of the importance of cod fishing to the region.
But over recent decades, the once bountiful cod has been so depleted that government officials now say that it stands on the verge of extinction.
At a grim daylong session here, a deeply divided New England Fishery Management Council voted to recommend reductions of 77 percent from last year's catch for each of the next three years for cod in the Gulf of Maine. 
It also recommended cuts of 61 percent from last year for one year only to the cod catch on Georges Bank, a vast area off Cape Cod, which was named for the fish. The council's recommendations are subject to approval by the federal government, which is expected to put them in place by May 1.
''We are headed, slowly, seeming inexorably, to oblivion,'' said John Bullard, the regional administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a member of the council, as he explained his support for the catch limits. ''I do not deny the costs that are going to be paid by fishermen, families, communities. They are real. They will hurt.''
The problem, he said, is not government inflexibility, as fishermen have suggested, but the lack of fish. ''It's midnight and getting darker when it comes to how many cod there are,'' he said. ''There isn't enough cod for people to make a decent living.''
But opponents said the limits would not help save the industry.
''Right now what we've got is a plan that guarantees the fishermen's extinction and does nothing to ameliorate it,'' David Goethel, a New Hampshire-based fisherman and biologist, said as he cast his vote against the plan.
Fishermen were furious with the result.
''I'm leaving here in a coffin,'' said Carlos Rafael, who owns a commercial fishing business in New Bedford, Mass. ''With all these cuts, I won't be able to keep half of my fleet working. I'll have to cut down from 20 groundfish boats to maybe 5or 6.''
Before the vote, fishermen had crowded into the meeting room, many pleading that the limits not be set so low.
''We have done everything that has been asked of us,'' said Paul Vitale, who fishes commercially in Gloucester, Mass. ''I don't want to go anywhere else for work, as demented as that sounds.''
The plan reduces the catch of cod in the Gulf of Maine down to 1,550 metric tons a year for the next three years; the limit was 8,000 metric tons a decade ago. The catch in Georges Bank would drop to 2,002 metric tons, down from 12,000 from a decade ago.
''They're huge, there's no other way to describe it,'' said Tom Nies, a fishery analyst for the council.
At its last peak in 2001, Mr. Nies said, the industry made about $100 million. It made about $80 million last year. The new limits could cut the size of the industry for this year to about $55 million, for a loss of $25 million.
But fishermen said the true impact of the cuts would go much deeper.
''It's 80 percent of a really small number to begin with,'' Mr. Goethe said. He said the actual loss to the industry would be more like $60 million. ''When you get down to cuts that small, there's simply no place to go,'' he said.
Frank Mirarchi, a fisherman from Scituate, Mass., who primarily pursues groundfish, said that the proposed limits would deprive him of his living and that the cuts would ripple up and down the coast.
''This whole economy in this region is a really small microbusiness economy,'' Mr. Mirarchi said. ''The fuel guy, the ice guy, the guy that drives the fish truck from the landing port to the processing center, fish cutters -- a job here, a job there,'' he said. ''It's not like closing a big factory. It's little jobs on nondescript piers that just kind of disappear and nobody notices.''
The limits come after years of what many scientists, managers and fishermen alike have said was mismanagement based on inconsistent or overly optimistic estimates of where fish stocks were, and how they could be rebuilt.
''I think the reality is that our understanding of where the stock is has changed,'' Mr. Nies said. ''We last assessed these stocks back in 2008 and we thought they were growing quite well, and so the quotas were going up. And then when we assessed them this year, we find out that they in fact have not grown as we expected.''
The United States has watched the near total collapse of cod stocks in Canada. The demise of the fish populations was hastened by the widespread use of big trawlers equipped with radar and sonar systems that enhanced the ability to catch the fish. They expanded the area and depths that could be fished and sped up the process, diminishing the ability of the remaining fish stocks to replenish themselves.
The big trawlers also swept up other fish that had little commercial value but played important predator-prey roles in maintaining the ecological balance of the species. Today the cod stock in the Gulf of Maine is at 18 percent of what scientists deem to be a healthy population; in Georges Bank, it is 7 percent.
While previous quota reductions have hurt fishermen, environmental advocates and even fishermen have said that, despite high groundfish prices, they are not landing their full quotas.
''We're looking at landings that are the worst on record,'' said Tom Dempsey, a fisherman and council member who voted for the cuts. ''The problem with Georges Bank codfish is that it is a resource that is on the verge of collapse. It scares the hell out of a whole lot of people who build their business on Georges Bank codfish.''
According to NOAA's Northeast Regional Office, fishermen have caught less than 30 percent of the 2012 allotment of Georges Bank cod to date and only slightly more than half of the allowable catch for the Gulf of Maine.
But some fishermen and environmentalists said that overfishing was not the only reason for the paucity of cod, with some putting part of the blame on climate change.
''We're seeing a distinct ecosystem change,'' Mr. Mirarchi said. ''The water's warmer. We're seeing species that normally never come into the north lingering into the fall. Something else is going on besides just fishing.''

HEADLINE: Where Waters Receded, Scars Remain

BYLINE: By JERÉ LONGMAN

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Back in town for the Super Bowl, Marshall Faulk paid a visit Tuesday to his alma mater, George Washington Carver High School. It was a place both familiar and foreign, a rearranged tableau that he found encouraging and discouraging and, for a second, a bit disorienting.
He is the school's greatest athlete, a Hall of Fame running back, a man who made his living with an acute inner gyroscope. But Faulk needed a moment to recall the exact location of the football field before the playing surface and the school and this area of the Ninth Ward were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
''Here,'' he said in the parking lot, getting his bearings, realizing that he was standing in the place where two decades earlier he had run for so many yards and played so many positions that he often left the field only at halftime and after the final whistle. 
Seven and a half years after the storm, the original Carver High has been razed in an isolated, battered neighborhood that will probably draw few visitors during Super Bowl week except those gawking on disaster tours. Carver's students still attend class in temporary buildings. Bungalows, Faulk calls them graciously. Trailers is the term used by the principal. The basketball team has no gym. Until the Rams secured a court at a nearby elementary school, they began this season practicing outdoors.
When the football team reached the state playoffs in November, someone donated a single generator-powered light to provide meager illumination during late-afternoon workouts. It was only enough to avoid being smothered by a blanket of darkness, but Carver persevered and advanced to the quarterfinals.
A plaque honoring Faulk's 2011 induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame will go on prominent display at Carver when a new school is built. For now, it remains hidden away, secured in a crate.
''These trailers are not very safe,'' said Isaac Pollack, Carver's first-year principal. ''The way security is on the weekends, it's not worth the risk.''
A new $52 million Carver High is planned, but bids recently came in significantly over budget and were rejected by school district officials. Plans are being redrawn. Meanwhile, officials still hope to break ground soon on a separate project, using $1.4 million in donations to build a football and track stadium that would feature artificial turf, lighting and up to 2,000 seats. The field would be made available to other schools and would allow the track team to quit training along campus breezeways and on the potholed Louisa Street that runs in front of Carver.
''It's a matter of cutting through red tape and hanging on,'' said Brian Bordainick, a former athletic director at Carver who has marshaled the stadium project since 2008. ''I hope this creates a new normal for a generation of kids who grow up thinking, 'This is my community; this is what I expect to play on.' ''
Yet aspiration and reality have not always coincided in the recovery from Katrina. The halting pace left Faulk with self-described feelings of ambivalence upon his return to Carver. ''When I go back, I still get a little upset at having it be like that,'' said Faulk, who will turn 40 next month and is an analyst for the NFL Network. ''Those memories, playing here. You can't get those back. Does that anger me? Yes. It gets the emotions going.''
But he also reminded himself that if Carver is not yet rebuilt, at least it remains open. Many schools in the area are closed. Even before Katrina, Faulk noted, it was challenging to convince kids in the impoverished neighborhood to come to school and stay in school and believe that an education would get them anywhere. The parents and alumni who fought to keep Carver open, he said, understood that busing students to other parts of the city would only add another layer of risk and discouragement.
''It creates more of an epidemic that we're trying to get rid of in our country,'' Faulk said. Through the years, he has assisted his alma mater with donations for uniforms, playoff travel expenses and renovations to the stadium in City Park, where Carver plays its home games. He is also helping to rebuild a park where he played youth football. Faulk's presence on campus, where he once worked early mornings in the boiler room and took cold showers to wash off the grit before classes began, brings confirmation of ''what can be accomplished with hard work and perseverance,'' said Walter Harris, the current athletic director at Carver.
An Altered Landscape
Everything has changed in the neighborhood since Katrina. It is not the home Faulk knew. Even before the storm, the place where he grew up as the youngest of six boys, the notorious Desire Housing Project, was torn down. It was a place so threatening that, during Faulk's freshman season at San Diego State in 1991, his high school coach, Wayne Reese, told The New York Times: ''I was worried he and the other kids would get a stray bullet. We tell them, 'Go home, stay there, don't come out.' For one hour, after practice, they would each call me and check in. We never wanted darkness to catch them.''
Mixed income housing, known as The Estates, now stands in the Desire neighborhood, colorful duplexes that at least ''look much better,'' Faulk said as he drove through the area. But it has long been a troubled location. All 425 units in The Estates had water and other storm damage from Hurricane Isaac last August, and residents have complained of shoddy construction and chronic problems with leaks from rainfall, according to reports by thelensnola.org, an independent, nonprofit news site.
''It's just the anger,'' Faulk said. ''People are upset. They want assistance. They want help.''
Just across the Industrial Canal from Carver and the Desire neighborhood, the inundated Lower Ninth Ward became Katrina's indelible symbol of failed levees and breached recovery. But 15 other neighborhoods ''were equally poor and heavily flooded,'' said Allison Plyer, the director and chief demographer of the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center. ''The Desire area is very similar.''
The area surrounding Carver is a jarring incongruity of rejuvenation and abandonment. The high school had about 1,300 students before Katrina and now has 375. A playground is refurbished here, a cluster of homes resettled there. But many houses remain empty, punch-drunk with gaping holes. Just behind the school, three deserted cottages in Easter egg colors still bear search-and-rescue hieroglyphics, the familiar, spray-painted markings written as if in a mortal checkbook. Some have taken to calling the markings Katrina swastikas.
The gym at Press Park where Faulk played youth basketball is vacant, discarded, tagged with graffiti, a dumping ground for tires and discarded auto parts. ''Could be a dead body in there,'' Faulk said. ''I ain't lying.''
He pointed out the water mark above the windows on a wrecked home, but there was no locating the house near Carver where Faulk had lived with a friend in his later high school years. ''I could have shown you but it's gone,'' Faulk said, his hand sweeping in a gesture of rising, pummeling water.
The Savemore Supermarket near Carver is barren, its interior as open as a doll's house. Many in the area lack transportation and must walk a long distance, or take a taxi, to buy groceries, said Shanda Gentry, the principal at nearby Mays Preparatory School, which is scheduled to close because of poor test scores. The route of the elementary school's Mardi Gras parade next week was altered, Gentry said, because ''we're in the middle of nowhere.''
When Katrina struck early on Aug. 29, 2005, Faulk was in Detroit with the St. Louis Rams, preparing for a preseason game. He remembers nothing about the game, only the television tuned to CNN for days, the despair that his hometown seemed like a third-world country and the dread of not knowing for 48 hours or so that his mother and a brother had safely evacuated to Houston.
''It's like, really, my city?'' Faulk said. ''You don't think it can happen. It was tough to look at, tough to understand. Why weren't the politicians doing anything?''
He could not help feeling a twinge of resentment toward what seemed a more urgent government response to Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast. He understands that failures from Katrina led to a greater understanding about disaster response, ''but it doesn't make it any better.'' The recovery from Sandy will continue to be used as a measuring stick in New Orleans, Faulk said. ''If that surpasses what's gone on here,'' he said, ''they're going to have some issues.''
He wrestles with this conundrum: Do 'they' care and if 'they' do, who are 'they?' At the same time, Faulk became a great athlete in part because he sidestepped doubt, always believing that the next touchdown, the next game, would bring a winning result. He is convinced that hosting the Super Bowl is good for New Orleans, validating the sense that it is recovering and remains a major league city.
Faulk is hopeful that economic recovery in the French Quarter and the Central Business District will someday spread like the water once did, reaching broken, invisible places like the Carver High area and the Lower Ninth Ward. But he also acknowledges that his life in San Diego is comfortable and distant from his childhood struggles. Those who are still here must live daily with frustrations from Katrina while he does not.
It is one thing for him to say that recovery needs more time and patience. He also understands that it can be difficult sharing someone else's vision of forbearance when you are still waiting to rebuild or living with limited access to health care and fresh food.
''You feel sorry for the people that's living in it because to them, encouraged, discouraged, it doesn't matter,'' Faulk said. ''They just want something done. They want a return to normalcy. They want their lives back.''
Waiting for the Recovery
On the St. Claude Avenue Bridge, Faulk drove over the Industrial Canal into the Lower Ninth Ward. This neighborhood, too, bears the jolting contradiction of renewal and desertion.
In 2000, just over 14,000 residents lived here; as of the 2010 census there were 2,842 inhabitants, according to figures tracked by the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center. The number of households has decreased from 5,363 to 1,624. Homeownership was higher than the city average before the storm, but the houses were often passed from generation to generation with no legal documentation, which has presented a nightmarish stumbling block to rebuilding. Futuristic houses resembling sci-fi toasters, built by Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation, are juxtaposed with homes exposing their skeletal innards and empty slabs.
''You've probably never seen stuff growing on top of the roof,'' Faulk said as he drove past a house with a tree poking through an attic.
Once there were six schools in the Lower Ninth Ward. Now there is only the Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School, which has 800 students in prekindergarten through 12th grade. In the faculty lounge, school officials ticked off a list of services absent from the area: no drugstore, no medical clinic, no barbershop, no grocery store, no fast-food restaurant. The palm trees planted along Claiborne Avenue bring suspicion of temporary Super Bowl sprucing up, not long-term rehabilitation.
''We're the last community to come back,'' Doris Hicks, the chief executive and principal of King Charter, said Monday. She posed the question of why and answered it herself. ''All you have to do is stop and think: the residents are black.'' She added: ''Who cares about our situation? I'm not sure the city cares.''
Tracie Washington, the school's general counsel, called the Lower Ninth Ward ''the sympathy and money bait'' used to entice recovery spending in New Orleans. While no area of the city was more devastated than this one, Washington said: ''The money's not here. That should be a cautionary tale for the recovery from Sandy.''
It is hoped that ground will be broken on a separate King High School in March, Hicks said. Meanwhile, the basketball team practices outdoors this winter because the current school has no gym. James Mack, the athletic director and basketball coach, serves as a kind of human thermometer. If he has to put his hands in his pockets, it is too cold to work out.
''You can't practice basketball if you can't catch it,'' Mack said.
After more than two hours touring his boyhood neighborhoods, Faulk returned on Tuesday to his hotel in downtown New Orleans. On Sunday, he will attend the championship game at the Superdome, where he once hawked popcorn. His producers at the NFL Network asked whether he had any photographs from those days, but they were lost during Katrina in his mother's flooded home.
Such reminiscing brought ''a mixed bag of emotions,'' Faulk said. ''You feel discouraged with some things, then you feel encouraged by some things. I'm a glass-is-half-full kind of guy. I see that the city is vibrant, bouncing back. A great light is being shined on the city with the Super Bowl being here. I think it's just a matter of time when those things are going to reach places like the Lower Ninth Ward. I don't want to say that's the only area that's affected. On the outskirts of the city, a lot of areas need improvement. I know there's people living in those areas who feel like it ain't happening soon enough. I think, just give it more time. We continue to have Super Bowls here, get the Final Four back, things like we saw today, you'll start to see more improvement.''
Earlier, sitting in the modest bleachers at Carver's practice field, Faulk tempered the grim surroundings with his favorite high school story. He was a freshman in 1987 and his brother, Joe, was a senior. As older brothers do, Joe ignored Marshall, would not let him even sit at the same table for lunch. Then, during the homecoming game, Faulk entered as a split end. He made a long catch and run down the sideline. His brother, who was not a player, became animated and trailed along the boundary in elation.
''I can see my brother acknowledging I was his brother for the first time,'' Faulk said, laughing. ''I got so excited, I got caught at the 1.''

HEADLINE: Fed Holds Steady on Strategy; Cites 'Pause' in Growth

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, noting that economic growth had ''paused'' in recent months, said Wednesday that it would continue its efforts to stimulate the economy for as long as it deemed necessary.
The Fed attributed the pause in growth to the impact of Hurricane Sandy and other ''transitory factors,'' and it said that there were some signs of increased strength in areas including consumer spending and housing.
It affirmed the stimulus program it announced in December, saying that it would hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent and expand its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion each month. 
''The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline,'' the central bank said in a statement released after the conclusion of a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.
The decision was supported by 11 of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was the only dissenter, citing concerns about economic stability and inflation.
The Fed announcement came hours after the government reported that economic growth was unexpectedly weak in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department said that the economy contracted by 0.1 percent, the first decline since 2009.
For the year, the economy grew by 2.2 percent -- a decent pace in normal times, but not fast enough to help the millions of Americans still unable to find work.
The central bank is trying to increase economic activity by holding down interest rates and reducing the availability of safe assets like Treasury bonds, pushing investors to take larger risks and reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
Officials have pointed to increased sales of cars and homes as evidence that the policy is working, but they also have sought to temper expectations, warning in particular that monetary policy cannot offset reductions in government spending.
Indeed, the unemployment rate has not declined since the Fed launched its latest round of purchases in September. The rate was 7.8 percent in December, the same as four months before. The government will report the rate for January on Friday.
Fed officials also are wrestling with the potential costs of further expanding the central bank's vast investment portfolio.
Some critics warn that the Fed's efforts will loosen its control over inflation, but those warnings so far have come to nothing. Inflation has actually fallen below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as healthy, leading some officials to argue the economy could use a little more inflation.
Fed officials say that they are more concerned that asset purchases will destabilize financial markets, by removing safe assets from circulation, increasing the volatility of prices, or encouraging too much speculation.
In December, the Fed said that it would purchase Treasuries at an initial pace of $45 billion a month, adding to the commitment it made in November to buy $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.
Mr. Bernanke underscored at a news conference following the announcement that the Fed might adjust the volume of purchases.
''The committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived benefits and costs of the program,'' Mr. Bernanke said then.
At the time, some analysts saw evidence that the Fed already was contemplating the possibility that it was doing too much. That impression was reinforced by an account of the meeting released a few weeks later that said some officials wanted to reduce the pace of purchases by the summer.
But it would be relatively easy for the Fed to do less. The more worrying possibility is that the economy might need additional help, forcing the Fed to consider whether it is able to do more -- and whether it should.

HEADLINE: Keep the Fishing Ban in New England

BYLINE: By CALLUM ROBERTS. 
Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York, is the author of ''The Ocean of Life: The Fate of Man and the Sea.''

 BODY:
YORK, England
THE fate of New England's fishing industry could be determined soon as federal regulators decide whether to open up thousands of square miles of ocean that were closed to commercial fishing so cod, haddock and other species could recover from decades of over-exploitation. The government should hold firm and keep those areas closed.
Twenty years ago, New England's fishing industry -- whose annual catch is now second in value behind only Alaska's -- was on its knees. A region that had once supported some of the most productive fisheries in the world had succumbed to the might of a modern fleet bristling with new technology. 
Cape Cod was named in the 17th century for the near-miraculous shoals of enormous cod that seethed around it. Generations of sailors marveled at cod so plentiful they could catch fish as fast as they could bait and haul in lines yet never seem to dent the teeming numbers.
The early 20th century saw hook and line give way to draggers that cut ever larger swaths across the seabed as they scooped fish into their nets. The passing years sharpened this lethal edge. Boats grew bigger and engines more powerful, dragging larger and stronger nets. Although fish numbers began to decline, the boats still found plenty to catch by using echo finders, later enhanced by computers and satellite positioning. That is, until there were so few fish left that even with the best technology, it became nearly impossible for fishermen to make a decent living.
Where were the regulators through all of this? Always one step behind and perennially ineffective. Federal law delegated to the New England Fishery Management Council authority to manage the fishery from 3 miles to 200 miles off the coast, but the council didn't see its job as speaking up for fish. This body was dominated by fishing interests, so when faced with a choice of fishing now or cutting back the catch to assure the fishery's future, the council's decisions often favored the short term. With such decisions, collapse of the fishery was inevitable. When it happened in the late 1980s, it was brutal and swift. By the early 1990s, all agreed that something had to be done. The council reinvented its approach to fishery management.
Nobody should underestimate the challenges the council had to overcome when it began working with scientists to form a management plan to rebuild stocks of fish like cod, haddock, flounder and halibut and to recover the prosperity and pride of New England's fishing communities. The cost of recovery was bitter medicine, involving reducing fishing by half. In a first for United States waters, regulators closed an approximately 8,000-square-mile network of areas to draggers and scallop dredgers in the mid-1990s. It paid off.
Scallop stocks were the first to rebound, soaring as the animals matured and multiplied in the millions across the closed areas, sending their offspring on ocean currents into surrounding fishing grounds. Today, scallops help New Bedford, Mass., bring in more revenue than any fishing port in the nation. Cod have stubbornly resisted recovery, for reasons not well understood, but other fish, like haddock, flourished as the habitats within closed areas recovered from a century of damage by trawl and dredge. As was the case with scallops, these larger, healthier populations helped to replenish the fishery.
But the seas are subject to upswings and downturns, the result of shifting environmental conditions. After more than 15 years of protection, New England today faces a decline in the fortunes of its fish stocks and fisheries. When times are tough and recession bites, it can be hard to resist the temptation to cash in your reserves.
This is exactly what many in the commercial fishing industry are calling for in New England, demanding that closed areas be reopened. Sadly, the fishery council voted Dec. 20 to recommend ending protection for more than half of the area originally closed, a total of about 5,000 square miles. Now officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must decide whether or not to allow such a shortsighted measure to take effect.
The pressure to do so will be intense. Yesterday, the fishery council voted to recommend that NOAA substantially reduce quotas for Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank cod to allow the stocks to recover. Fisherman say these reductions will destroy their industry. But opening up the protected zones would be disastrous. They have been the linchpin of fishery recovery. It has taken years of fishing restraint for nature to rebuild stocks and repair habitats. Such gains, while slowly won, could be wiped out in less than a season's fishing and return the region to the destitution of the early 1990s. Such a rash move would also establish a bad model for fishery managers around the country.
The present downswing represents a tough test for New Englanders' resolve. They must resist the temptation to squander their resources in a splurge that would empty the sea and impoverish the industry once again.
