HEADLINE: WISCONSIN SENATE CUTS BARGAINING BY PUBLIC SECTOR

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The bitter political standoff in Wisconsin over Gov. Scott Walker's bid to sharply curtail collective bargaining for public-sector workers ended abruptly Wednesday night as Republican colleagues in the State Senate successfully maneuvered to adopt a bill doing just that.
After a three-week stalemate, Republican senators pushed the measure through in less than half an hour even as the Senate's Democrats remained many miles away, trying to block the vote. Democrats in the State Assembly complained bitterly, and protesters, who had spent many days at the Capitol, continued their chants and jeers.
The Republicans control the Senate but had been blocked from voting on the issue after Senate Democrats left the state last month to prevent a quorum. But the Republicans used a procedural maneuver Wednesday to force the collective bargaining measure through: they removed elements of Governor Walker's bill that were technically related to appropriating funds, thus lifting a requirement that 20 senators be present for a vote. In the end, the Senate's 19 Republicans approved the measure, 18 to 1, without any debate on the floor or a single Democrat in the room. 
The remaining bill, which increases health care and pension costs and cuts collective bargaining rights for public workers in the state, still needs approval from the State Assembly on Thursday morning, but that chamber approved the measure once before, and many in Wisconsin's Capitol now consider approval a foregone conclusion.
Mr. Walker, a Republican whose efforts to diminish collective bargaining rights have placed him firmly in the national spotlight during his less than three months in office, applauded the Senate's move on Wednesday night, and said it brought the state a step closer to balancing its budget. ''The action today will help ensure Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs,'' Mr. Walker said, in a statement released minutes after the unexpected vote.
Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the move as an attack on working families, a violation of open meetings requirements (most of them did not know there was to be a vote until not long before), and a virtual firebomb in state that already found itself politically polarized and consumed with recall efforts, large scale protests and fury from public workers.
''In 30 minutes, 18 state senators undid 50 years of civil rights in Wisconsin,'' said Mark Miller, the leader of the Senate Democrats who fled to Illinois on Feb. 17 to block just such a vote from occurring. ''Their disrespect for the people of Wisconsin and their rights is an outrage that will never be forgotten.''
The 14 Democrats -- many of whom watched a live stream of the vote on the Web from their undisclosed locations in Illinois -- said they did not intend to return to Wisconsin on Thursday; some said that they suspected the Republicans might yet have additional voting maneuvers planned, and that they needed to assess all that had occurred.
''Tonight, 18 Senate Republicans conspired to take government away from the people,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Tomorrow we will join the people of Wisconsin in taking back their government.''
The Democrats complained angrily that the manner of the move directly contradicted what the Republicans had contended all along: that collective bargaining rights had to be cut not for philosophical reasons but merely for financial ones, to fix the state's budget gap.
''To pass this the way they did -- without 20 senators -- is to say that it has no fiscal effect,'' said Timothy Cullen, another of the Democratic senators. ''It's admitting that this is simply to destroy public unions.''
The bill makes significant changes to most public-sector union rules, limiting collective bargaining to matters of wages and limiting raises to changes in the Consumer Price Index unless the public approves higher raises in a referendum. It requires most unions to hold votes annually to determine whether most workers still wish to be members. And it ends the state's collection of union dues from paychecks.
Wisconsin's battle has been the leading edge of a wider fight over public workers and collective bargaining across the country. Similar, if somewhat less dramatic, fights have played out in statehouses in places like Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Indiana, and more are expected.
In Wisconsin, Republicans and Democrats had been at an impasse over Mr. Walker's bill for weeks. Because the bill was initially deemed a fiscal bill, it required 20 members -- thus at least one of the Democrats' 14 members -- to be in the room.
On both sides, as the Democrats camped out in Illinois, there had been negotiations, angry news conferences, breakdowns in negotiations, and talk of more negotiations. Senate Republicans had voted to fine each of the missing Democrats $100 a day. The Senate Democrats had talked almost every day, sometimes disagreeing over whether it was time to give up and go home or to keep demanding that the Republicans lessen the cuts to collective bargaining rights.
As the impasse dragged on, senators from both parties found themselves the focus of recall efforts -- efforts that all involved now said were certain to grow still more intense. Late Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators crammed into the Capitol as news of the vote trickled out. And Mike Tate, the leader of the state's Democratic Party, pledged to put ''total focus'' on ''recalling the eligible Republican senators who voted for this heinous bill,'' adding, ''and we also begin counting the days remaining before Scott Walker is himself eligible for recall.''
Even as recently as Sunday evening, a possible deal seemed in sight. In private e-mail exchanges with the Democrats, Mr. Walker's representatives appeared willing to agree to some limited changes.
But by Wednesday afternoon, after talks had clearly broken apart, Republican senators met privately for hours, and eventually called a conference committee meeting of the leaders in the Senate and Assembly for 6 p.m. Peter Barca, a Democratic leader in the Assembly, protested vehemently as Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate Republicans' leader, called the meeting to order, announced that a new bill -- without specific mentions of appropriations -- was being considered, and called for a vote.
''This is a violation of open meetings laws!'' Mr. Barca cried out repeatedly, demanding to hear a summary of the bill and what had changed. Mr. Fitzgerald swiftly moved to the Senate chamber, calling his Republicans to order, and called for another vote in a matter of minutes.
''Enough is enough,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said, in a statement he issued minutes later. ''The people of Wisconsin elected us to do a job. They elected us to stand up to the broken status quo, stop the constant expansion of government, balance the budget, create jobs and improve the economy. The longer the Democrats keep up this childish stunt, the longer the majority can't act on our agenda.''

HEADLINE: Give Peaceful Resistance a Chance

BYLINE: By ERICA CHENOWETH. 
Erica Chenoweth, an assistant professor of government at Wesleyan University, is the co-author of the forthcoming ''Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict.''

 BODY:
Middletown, Conn.
THE rebellion in Libya stands out among the recent unrest in the Middle East for its widespread violence: unlike the protesters in Tunisia or Egypt, those in Libya quickly gave up pursuing nonviolent change and became an armed rebellion.
And while the fighting in Libya is far from over, it's not too early to ask a critical question: which is more effective as a force for change, violent or nonviolent resistance? Unfortunately for the Libyan rebels, research shows that nonviolent resistance is much more likely to produce results, while violent resistance runs a greater risk of backfiring. 
Consider the Philippines. Although insurgencies attempted to overthrow Ferdinand Marcos during the 1970s and 1980s, they failed to attract broad support. When the regime did fall in 1986, it was at the hands of the People Power movement, a nonviolent pro-democracy campaign that boasted more than two million followers, including laborers, youth activists and Catholic clergy.
Indeed, a study I recently conducted with Maria J. Stephan, now a strategic planner at the State Department, compared the outcomes of hundreds of violent insurgencies with those of major nonviolent resistance campaigns from 1900 to 2006; we found that over 50 percent of the nonviolent movements succeeded, compared with about 25 percent of the violent insurgencies.
Why? For one thing, people don't have to give up their jobs, leave their families or agree to kill anyone to participate in a nonviolent campaign. That means such movements tend to draw a wider range of participants, which gives them more access to members of the regime, including security forces and economic elites, who often sympathize with or are even relatives of protesters.
What's more, oppressive regimes need the loyalty of their personnel to carry out their orders. Violent resistance tends to reinforce that loyalty, while civil resistance undermines it. When security forces refuse orders to, say, fire on peaceful protesters, regimes must accommodate the opposition or give up power -- precisely what happened in Egypt.
This is why the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, took such great pains to use armed thugs to try to provoke the Egyptian demonstrators into using violence, after which he could have rallied the military behind him.
But where Mr. Mubarak failed, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi succeeded: what began as peaceful movement became, after a few days of brutal crackdown by his corps of foreign militiamen, an armed but disorganized rebel fighting force. A widely supported popular revolution has been reduced to a smaller group of armed rebels attempting to overthrow a brutal dictator. These rebels are at a major disadvantage, and are unlikely to succeed without direct foreign intervention.
If the other uprisings across the Middle East remain nonviolent, however, we should be optimistic about the prospects for democracy there. That's because, with a few exceptions -- most notably Iran -- nonviolent revolutions tend to lead to democracy.
Although the change is not immediate, our data show that from 1900 to 2006, 35 percent to 40 percent of authoritarian regimes that faced major nonviolent uprisings had become democracies five years after the campaign ended, even if the campaigns failed to cause immediate regime change. For the nonviolent campaigns that succeeded, the figure increases to well over 50 percent.
The good guys don't always win, but their chances increase greatly when they play their cards well. Nonviolent resistance is about finding and exploiting points of leverage in one's own society. Every dictatorship has vulnerabilities, and every society can find them.

HEADLINE: New York City Fared Better In Recession Than Thought

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The recession that ended in 2009 caused less damage in New York City than economists previously thought, according to revised jobs data released on Wednesday by the State Labor Department.
The city lost fewer jobs during the downturn and started regaining them sooner and faster than previous tallies indicated, said James Brown, principal economist for the department. The annual revisions of the state and city employment statistics for the previous 18 months bolstered the view that the city's economy bucked recent trends by escaping the recession in better shape than the rest of the nation, he said.
''We definitely recovered faster than the national economy did after going in later, which is really not a normal performance for New York City,'' Mr. Brown said. 
The report, which included the first look at the local and statewide job markets for 2011, said the city's unemployment rate rose in January to 8.9 percent, from 8.8 percent in December. That was still lower than the national rate for January, which was 9 percent. (In February, the national unemployment rate declined to 8.9 percent.)
The city lost jobs in January, as it usually does, but fewer than in recent years, Mr. Brown said. He said the loss of 80,100 jobs in the city that month amounted to only three-fourths of the average loss for the last 10 Januarys.
The Labor Department does not adjust the city's monthly data for the usual seasonal trends of hiring and layoffs, but Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with a real estate investment firm in Manhattan, does. According to Ms. Denham's calculations, the revised numbers show that the city lost a total of 141,300 jobs after the recession hit in April 2008. That was a much less severe effect than the previous estimate of 179,000 jobs lost.
Since the recovery began, the city has regained 50,700 jobs, leaving it about 90,000 jobs short of the prerecession employment peak. That net loss means the city is missing about 1 of every 42 jobs it had before the recession, while the national loss since then represents 1 of every 18 jobs.
The biggest gains in the city since the start of 2010 have been in restaurants, bars, employment agencies, education and health care, Ms. Denham said. The biggest losses have come in local, state and federal government, and construction, she said.
Wall Street has bounced back fast, adding 8,200 jobs since the start of last year, including 2,000 jobs in January 2011, she said. But the city's securities industry is still 20,000 jobs, or about 10 percent, shy of its peak in early 2008.
''This recent pattern of steady growth is reassuring that the industry is truly recovering,'' Ms. Denham said.
Statewide, the unemployment rate edged up to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent in December. The state added 95,100 jobs from the start of the economic recovery in December 2009 through December 2010, after losing 335,300 jobs during the recession.
In a separate report released on Wednesday, the office of the city comptroller, John C. Liu, said that New York City's public employees were older and better educated but paid less than counterparts in the private sector.
The study, conducted by the comptroller's chief economist, Frank Braconi, found that the pay gap between the public and private sectors was reversed for less-educated workers. City employees who did not attend college earn about 13 percent more than private-sector workers with similar educations, Mr. Braconi said. But city workers with graduate or professional degrees are paid about 16 percent less than private-sector peers, he said.
Nearly half -- 49 percent -- of city employees have a four-year college degree, compared with just 41 percent of workers in the private sector, according to the study. But the city workers earn slightly less than $55,000 a year, on average, while the private-sector employees make an average of more than $66,000 a year.
The value of health insurance plans, pensions and other benefits are often assumed to make up for the pay gap, but Mr. Braconi found that was not generally true for the city's 306,000 employees. Over all, he said, the cost of contributing to its employees' retirement is ''roughly equivalent'' to a corporation's cost for contributing to a standard defined-contribution retirement plan.

HEADLINE: In Galleon Trial, Arguing Greed Vs. a Picture of Diligent Research

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
''Greed and corruption - that's what this case is all about,'' a federal prosecutor said on Wednesday at the trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire hedge fund manager accused of being at the center of a huge insider trading ring.
Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer countered that ''the government has it wrong,'' portraying his client as one who made his fortune through ''shoe-leather research, diligence and hard work'' and who ''conducted the best research in the business.''
Before a packed courtroom in Lower Manhattan, the two opposing lawyers - Jonathan Streeter, an assistant United States attorney, and John Dowd, Mr. Rajaratnam's lead lawyer - previewed the evidence that the jury is expected to hear over the course of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks.
During the nearly three hours of opening statements, the 53-year-old Mr. Rajaratnam sat stoically at the center of the defense table, flanked by a team of six lawyers. If convicted on 14 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, he faces up to 20 years in prison. 
Much of the government's case is based on more than 2,400 secretly recorded telephone conversations that Mr. Rajaratnam had, many of them with cooperating witnesses who have already pleaded guilty to insider trading.
''He knew tomorrow's business news today and traded on it,'' Mr. Streeter said. ''One crucial thing he didn't know. He didn't know the F.B.I. was listening.''
The prosecutor highlighted for the jury four of Mr. Rajaratnam's associates and their alleged insider trading schemes with Mr. Rajaratnam: Anil Kumar, a former partner at McKinsey & Company and a business school classmate; Rajiv Goel, a former Intel executive and also a business school classmate; Adam Smith, a Galleon portfolio manager; and Rajat K. Gupta, a former board member of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble. Three of them have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government.
Among the more dramatic moments in the opening statements came when Mr. Streeter laid out Mr. Gupta's role in the case. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commissionaccused Mr. Gupta of sharing confidential information about Goldman and P.& G. with Mr. Rajaratnam. The S.E.C. allegations did not include any specific details of conversations between the two men.
On Wednesday, Mr. Streeter focused on Mr. Gupta's alleged tip to Mr. Rajaratnam that the Goldman board had just approved a $5 billion investment from Warren E. Buffett in the middle of the financial crisis. Minutes later, Mr. Rajaratnam bought a large amount of Goldman stock, the government says.
Mr. Streeter said the government planned to play a recording of a conversation between Mr. Rajaratnam and a Galleon colleague that took place the next day during which Mr. Rajaratnam explained that ''something good is going to happen for Goldman.'' (The defense disclosed that the colleague was David Lau, who worked in Singapore.)
Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer disputed that any of these conversations or relationships amounted to a criminal conspiracy. He made it clear that the mosaic theory of investing - collecting detailed, disparate information about a company to form a ''mosaic'' - would be a key theme of Mr. Rajaratnam's defense.
''He assembled a mosaic of information and did his own calculations,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''The evidence will show that Raj did not cheat.''
The government acknowledged that much of Galleon's trading was backed by sound security analysis. ''People did legitimate stock research, but they cheated, too,'' Mr. Streeter said. ''And that cheating is called insider trading.''
Mr. Dowd sought to minimize the significance of the trades that form the basis of the government's insider trading charges.
The trades in question accounted for just 1 percent of all trading at Galleon, which bought and sold stocks ''at a dizzying pace'' that amounted to billions of dollars annually, Mr. Dowd said. What's more, he argued, the controversial trades did nothing to increase his returns.
''If that doesn't make any sense, it's because it doesn't make any sense,'' he said.
The two lawyers' styles and strategies during opening statements were markedly different. Mr. Streeter, the prosecutor, zeroed in on just a few instances of alleged insider trading by Mr. Rajaratnam. Though there are more than 100 potential witnesses and more than 50 companies whose names could come up at trial, Mr. Streeter, who spoke for an hour, mentioned only a handful, focusing on what the government likely considers the strongest evidence of insider trading.
Mr. Dowd used the government's uncluttered approach against it. ''Unlike Mr. Streeter, I'm going to tell you about the entire case,'' he said.
He did not disappoint. The defense lawyer's opening statement was hyper-detailed, naming dozens of companies in a presentation that clocked in at one hour and 40 minutes.
While Mr. Streeter used no visual aids, Mr. Dowd posted more than 30 pages of memos on an overhead display in the courtroom. Each focused on a company in which Mr. Rajaratnam is accused of trading on illegal tips. Mr. Dowd took the jury through each trade, arguing that the evidence would show no evidence of insider trading - either the news passed to Mr. Rajaratnam was already public or it was bad information that caused Mr. Rajaratnam to lose money.
The government countered that it did not have to prove that Mr. Rajaratnam profited on his trades. ''Insider trading is insider trading even if it doesn't work every time,'' Mr. Streeter said.
Mr. Dowd criticized the government for barely mentioning, or not mentioning at all, cooperating witnesses like Danielle Chiesi and Roomy Khan, both of whom have pleaded guilty to insider trading crimes. He described Ms. Chiesi as a drama queen who never had any inside information and Ms. Khan as a liar who was ''playing the government like a violin'' in order to get a reduced prison sentence.
Mr. Streeter appealed to the jury of ordinary New Yorkers by suggesting that Mr. Rajaratnam had an unfair edge over investors on Main Street.
''Secret information that other people don't have is a very valuable thing in the stock market,'' Mr. Streeter said, noting that the New York Stock Exchange was just a few blocks from the courthouse ''where ordinary investors can buy and sell stocks.''
Five men and seven women have been seated on the jury. Among them are two employees of the Department of Education and two from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. One jury member works at an office job at Verizon; another for Apple, as a graphic designer.
Underscoring the case's importance, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, sat in the back of the spectators' gallery with Richard Zabel, head of the office's criminal unit. The prosecutors' family members were also present, including Mr. Streeter's wife and the mothers of the two other prosecutors in the case.
Mr. Rajaratnam's family was not in the courtroom.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Revolts Raise Europe's Fear On Migration

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO and SUZANNE DALEY; Rachel Donadio reported from Lampedusa, and Suzanne Daley from New York.

 BODY:
LAMPEDUSA, Italy -- Until a few weeks ago, the immigrant transfer center on this tiny Mediterranean island -- a kind of Italian Ellis Island -- was empty. An extensive European campaign against migration from Africa was considered so effective that the authorities basically shut it down.
But since the Tunisian government collapsed in January, spurring unrest across North Africa, Lampedusa has been bustling. The Italian police tow in boats full of desperate immigrants -- about 6,000 refugees in the past two months. Young men in hooded jackets smoke cigarettes and await transfer to the mainland -- a prospect that is striking fear in many European hearts.
The turmoil in Libya and elsewhere in the region has toppled or undermined North African dictators who negotiated a web of benefits from Europe, including aid and diplomatic standing, in return for stopping immigrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean.
Without the assistance of those leaders, many in Europe worry that they will face new waves of illegal immigration not only from the liberated areas in the north, but from much of sub-Saharan Africa as well. 
The immigrants would arrive at a time when much of Europe -- struggling with high unemployment and lethargic economies -- is already awash with anti-immigrant sentiment, and many countries say they are simply incapable of absorbing poor migrants.
''In Italy, there is really a panic,'' said Anna Triandafyllidou, a migration expert with the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy. ''Everything is up in the air, and no one knows what to do.''
Unable to build the kind of border fence that the United States has erected to keep Mexicans at home, countries like Spain and Italy have spent years forging close relationships with North African leaders, persuading them to prevent migrants from trying to sail the rough seas of the Mediterranean. In return, Morocco, Tunisia and particularly Libya sometimes used brutal tactics to keep immigrants from ever getting near European shores, human rights activists say.
Italy's agreement with Libya, signed in 2008, was considered especially effective. Italy pledged $5 billion over 20 years in exchange for Libya's blocking would-be immigrants from leaving. Almost overnight immigrants stopped arriving in Lampedusa.
According to the Italian Interior Ministry, in 2008, more than 36,000 immigrants came ashore in Italy -- not only from North Africa, but from the Horn of Africa, Niger and Nigeria. After the treaty, that number dropped to 9,500 in 2009 and slowed to a relative trickle in Lampedusa.
Now, detained migrants once again outnumber the island's local population of 6,000, according to the ministry. At 3 a.m. on Wednesday, an Italian police boat arrived with 55 tired and shivering immigrants who had been pulled from a rickety boat. Many were wrapped in thermal blankets. One was taken away on a stretcher.
At one point, there were so many immigrants here that the authorities allowed them to wander the island freely rather than keep them locked up. Inside the center on Wednesday, hundreds of young men, almost all from Tunisia, were eager to tell visitors their message: ''We want work.''
''I got a high school degree, I worked fixing cars, but there's no work,'' said Mander Grebis, 25, in halting French, as he stood in a group of young men huddled in front of the center's one vending machine. He and the others said they wanted to stay in Italy or to go to France to find jobs.
Italy's arrangement with Libya was hardly the only one. Spain, too, has over the years enlisted the help of Morocco and other African countries in dealing with immigrants. Experts say it has offered countries equipment for patrolling shorelines and economic aid of all sorts -- so that immigrants have fewer reasons to leave and African governments have more reason to help.
Spain offered Senegal money to help repatriate immigrants who were often returned to the Dakar airport but did not have the money or the incentive to return to their villages. At times, the European Union pays for such projects, too.
But human rights advocates say some of these arrangements have abetted the harsh treatment of immigrants, particularly in Libya. In a report published in 2009, Human Rights Watch said that migrants who eventually made it to Malta and Italy described being beaten and robbed of valuables and their documents while in detention in Libya.
The report also said that electric shock batons were used to force migrants off the boats in Libya. And some said they were handed back to traffickers who held them for ransom.
''These agreements,'' said Bill Frelick, the author of the report, ''are with partner states that often don't have the same standards as Europe. They often treat migrants in humiliating and denigrating ways.''
In an interview, Senator Lamberto Dini, a former Italian prime minister who helped negotiate Italy's treaty with Libya, said such reports had ''not been proven.''
There have also been disturbing episodes in Morocco. In 2005, 11,000 sub-Saharan Africans who had been stranded in Morocco after a renewal of the Spanish-Moroccan partnership stormed the border fence around the Spanish enclave of Melilla, on the African coast. Some made it across, but several were shot dead. Some of the immigrants who were eventually turned over to the Moroccan police were then dumped into the Sahara.
But the agreements have been effective. In the past year, control of the African coastline was so tight that immigrants were turning to a wholly different route, showing up on the land border between Greece and Turkey. In recent weeks, Italian officials have warned of a ''biblical exodus'' in which as many as 300,000 could arrive, though many experts say that number is intended more as a way to stir up passions domestically than as a reflection of any clear reality.
Experts say any number is conjecture given the fluidity of the situation in North Africa and the difficulties involved in distinguishing the number of workers trying to return home from the refugees trying to flee.
In Lampedusa, the immigrants stay for two days before being sent to mainland Italy for more processing to determine if they are seeking political asylum or are instead ''economic immigrants'' seeking work.
Over the years, aided by sometimes alarmist press coverage of immigrants arriving on boats, Lampedusa has taken hold in the Italian and European popular imagination as the image of out-of-control immigration. In a sign of how crucial Lampedusa has become to that image, especially for some right-wing parties, Marine Le Pen, president of France's far-right National Front, plans to visit the island on Monday.
Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesman for the Italian Red Cross on Lampedusa, said the organization was setting up a field hospital on the dock here to give emergency aid to immigrants after long, rough crossings.
''It's better to be prepared,'' Mr. Della Longa said, ''if -- and I underline if -- the thousands of immigrants that people are talking about arrive.''

HEADLINE: A Patch of Rusty Paradise That Might Be Paved

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
It's a safe bet that the Willets Point section of Queens, setting and subject of the new documentary ''Foreign Parts,'' does not figure in many New York tourist itineraries, though it has starred in a movie before, Ramin Bahrani's ''Chop Shop.'' This battered stretch of junkyards and auto repair shops may thrive (or fester, depending on your point of view) in the shadow of Citi Field, but it seems a universe away from that gleaming corporate food court where the Mets occasionally win a baseball game. 
The city's Economic Development Corporation touts Willets Point as ''New York City's next great neighborhood'' and has an ambitious project for its transformation, a plan that has met with resistance from many who work there. Like Citi Field itself the redevelopment controversy hovers in the background of ''Foreign Parts,'' which was directed by Verena Paravel and J. P. Sniadecki in an unobtrusive, ethnographic style. Ms. Paravel occasionally appears on screen, and many of the people who appear on camera are comfortable talking to it, which means that the filmmakers are not concerned with rigorous obedience to the conventions of cinema verite. But they are more interested in observation than in interpretation, and in preserving above all a visual and aural record of the texture of life in a place that might well be destined for oblivion.
Without sentimentalizing the neighborhood or its people -- and in spite of having only a single legal resident, Willets Point feels, in this film, very much like a neighborhood -- Ms. Paravel and Mr. Sniadecki cast an appreciative eye on its beauty. It is not just the compositional artistry of the camera work or the clarity of the high-definition video images that reveal this quality. The persistent puddles (Willets sits in a flood plain) and the body shop signs evoke a venerable, rough, workaday New York, the polyglot poetry of which can be heard in Spanish, Hebrew and English dialogue that is frequently drowned out by the noise of tools and automobile engines.
The cars that dominate the Willets Point landscape have an aesthetic nobility of their own. The dismantling of a minivan early in the film resembles the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial animal, much as the removal of a steering column later looks like a grisly act of surgery. An alien anthropologist studying ''Foreign Parts'' might note that in this area the car has a totemic, sacred function while also serving as a source of livelihood and, in a few cases, a home.
Embedded in this compact movie are stories of drug addiction and poverty, hard work and jail time. Like the cars, these tales are encountered in fragments. People talk but don't say too much, and as curious and thorough as Ms. Paravel and Mr. Sniadecki are -- ''Foreign Parts'' is the result of many months of patient filming -- they are too polite to pry. But their tact adds to the richness of their film, which discovers a busy, complicated world within the space of few unlovely city blocks.
Foreign Parts
Opens on Thursday in Manhattan.
Produced, directed and edited by Verena Paravel and J. P. Sniadecki; directors of photography, Ms. Paravel and Mr. Sniadecki. At the Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, Museum of Modern Art. Running time: 1 hour 21 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: The Promise And Costs Of Charters

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HIGHLAND PARK, N.J.
In a perfect world of unlimited resources, it's possible, though hardly certain, that this small, diverse, generally liberal borough on the banks of the Raritan River might want to become a host to the nation's first Hebrew-language public high school.
But in the imperfect world of public education today, the idea of diverting diminishing resources from existing schools for the proposed Tikun Olam Charter High School would seem to be dead on arrival if local school officials got to choose or local residents got to vote on it. 
In fact, local officials don't get to choose and local residents don't get to vote, so you can find a compelling microcosm of the issues beneath the glossy promise of charter schools in the increasingly testy politics of public choice in one New Jersey community.
Officials were skeptical three years ago when Sharon Akman, a real estate agent who has sent four children to Jewish day schools, proposed the local schools start teaching Hebrew. That is an idea increasingly being promoted nationally, with both strong proponents and financial backing, along with many skeptics, including critics who view such schools as quasi-religious and some religious Jews who view them as a threat to Jewish day schools.
Whatever the larger issues, at a time of brutal budget realities, Ms. Akman's proposal was turned down. Undeterred, she put together a proposal for a charter school, a decision to be made in Trenton, not Highland Park. It has been turned down twice, but she is preparing to file a third proposal due at the end of this month. She said a similar proposal in Englewood and Teaneck was turned down three times before being approved in January as the state's second Hebrew-immersion charter.
She said that the charter serving Highland Park, Edison and New Brunswick would be about language, not religion, and that it would provide a distinctive education model that would help students in gaining college admissions.
''It's getting harder and harder to get into college, so it's essential these kids have something identifying them in some kind of unique way,'' she said. ''Coming from a Hebrew-language school that stresses community service is going to give them an edge.''
Ms. Akman said she would have sent her children to public schools if a similar option existed.
Given Gov. Chris Christie's often-stated desire for more charters, sooner rather than later, school officials and many parents are concerned. The Highland Park school board president, Wendy Saiff, said the expansion of charters came at the expense of existing schools.
DISTRICTS must pay for students who attend local charters. Four local students who had attended private schools now attend the Hatikvah International Academy, an elementary school that opened last year in East Brunswick, at a cost of about $60,000 to Highland Park. The district has been told by the state to expect to pay $300,000 next year for students at Hatikvah and another charter, money lost to existing programs with no cost savings.
''It would divert funds out of the public schools for the interests of a small group of people,'' Ms. Saiff said. ''It could be a group that wants Mandarin, or Swahili or a cooking program. You could think of a thousand programs that might serve a small group, but it's preposterous to think that's serving the public good, and economically it's just not sustainable.''
One possible compromise is another new wrinkle -- becoming a choice district that could offer its own Hebrew program in existing schools. So at an agitated school board meeting Monday night, parents angrily debated the merits of financing a Hebrew program they do not want to ward off a Hebrew charter they really do not want.
You can pick your ironies. Charters are supposed to provide alternatives to failing schools, but Highland Park's are considered among the best in the state. And New Jersey's schools, for all the well-documented failings in places like Newark, score near the top of national rankings, so new charters are being asked to fix what's broken and what's not. The process being championed by conservatives like Mr. Christie, whose children attend private schools, is taking decisions from local districts and giving them to the state.
Charters may offer new promise, particularly in failing urban schools, but when it comes to paying for them, it's the old story.
We all want more, not less. We just don't want to pay for it.

HEADLINE: Recovery in Airbus Jet Sales Helps EADS Return to Profit

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- A strong recovery in new jet sales at its Airbus unit lifted European Aeronautic Defense and Space to a profit last year. A steady flow of deliveries of commercial planes and military hardware also helped the company bolster its war chest for potential acquisitions to more than $16.5 billion, the company said Wednesday. 
EADS swung to a profit of 553 million euros ($768 million) in 2010 after reporting a loss of 763 million euros in 2009. Earnings were 68 euro cents a share.
Revenue rose 7 percent, to 45.8 billion euros. Airbus sales represented nearly 30 billion euros of that total, up from 28 billion euros in 2009.
The company, the largest European military contractor -- which last week lost out to its American rival, Boeing, for a $35 billion contract to build aerial refueling tankers for the United States Air Force -- said improved profitability would enable it to resume dividend payments for 2010 of 22 euro cents a share. EADS suspended its dividend in 2009 amid a steep decline in aircraft demand linked to the global economic crisis.
''It is our clear ambition to gradually improve profitability in the midterm,'' the EADS chief financial officer, Hans Peter Ring, said in a statement. ''Profitability improvement is the key indicator for a better dividend distribution in the future.''
Airbus delivered 510 aircraft in 2010 and received net orders for 574 new planes. New orders across the group jumped 81 percent in value to 83.1 billion euros.
A sharp improvement in cash inflows tied to deliveries helped build the group's net cash position to a record 11.9 billion euros from 9.8 billion euros at the end of 2009. EADS said it considered its growing cash pile as ''a key asset to foster future growth.''
EADS has so far been coy about its plans for acquisitions, though company executives have signaled an eagerness to expand in the United States. They have also expressed an interest in moving into areas like aerospace services and security as military budgets shrink in its home markets in Europe.
In the absence of a Air Force tanker contract, EADS executives have said the company will seek a North American expansion through medium-size acquisitions.
EADS still hopes to build its North American business to $10 billion in annual revenue by 2020, up from $1.4 billion now.
Assuming an average exchange rate of $1.35 per euro, EADS said it expected earnings per share and revenue in 2011 to exceed the levels of last year. EADS prices its military and commercial aircraft in dollars.
It also forecast that operating profit, which swung to 1.3 billion euros last year from a loss of 322 million euros in 2009, was likely to be on par with last year, the company said, before rising ''significantly'' in 2012 as sales volumes increase and costs linked to production problems with its A380 superjumbo jet diminish.
EADS said it expected Airbus to book 520 to 530 new plane orders this year, slightly below last year's levels.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Rose in January

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses at the wholesale level added to their stockpiles in January and their sales rose by the largest amount in 14 months. 
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that wholesale inventories rose 1.1 percent in January. It was the 12th gain in 13 months.
Sales at the wholesale level rose for the seventh straight month. The 3.4 percent increase in January was the largest gain since November 2009.
Greater sales should encourage businesses to keep restocking their shelves and drive factory production in the months ahead.
The rise in inventories in January left stockpiles at $436.9 billion. That was 13.1 percent higher than the low reached in September 2009, when companies were slashing stockpiles to control costs during the recession.
The restocking of warehouses has helped to lift production and employment at American factories. Economists predict that trend will continue in 2011.
Manufacturers have benefited from rising demand for products in the United States and overseas. The falling dollar against many major currencies has also driven export demand. A weaker dollar makes United States goods cheaper on foreign markets.
The January sales increase was led by a 7.8 percent surge in demand for autos and auto parts.
The rise in inventories also reflected strength in autos. Those inventories increased 2.1 percent.

HEADLINE: All Things Bright and Clever

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
CHICAGO
THE International Home and Housewares Show at the McCormick Place convention center this week boasted ''13 miles of aisles,'' and if you were to walk them, perhaps as a visitor from another planet, you might have the following impressions.
These Earth people love coffee and little brightly colored, high-tech coffee makers, but perhaps they all live alone, for they seem obsessed with something called ''single-serve units.''
They are very environmentally concerned: everywhere it is green this, recycle that. They are determined to cut back on waste, no matter how many new products they have to buy to do that.
Their place of worship seems to be the kitchen, where even spatulas stand upright and honored, and their primary source of sustenance, after coffee, is cupcakes. 
They are obsessed with clean homes and spend their leisure time gazing into the moving parts of their vacuum cleaners, which are designed for this purpose with transparent casings.
As confident as these Earth people seem -- particularly after their fourth serving of coffee -- they secretly crave direction, for an imposing booth labeled ''Pantone'' decrees ''2011 Color of the Year Pantone 18-2120 Honeysuckle,'' their rendering a hot, tropical pink.
And for reasons that are not immediately obvious, they revere certain individuals: The appearance of a person called Susan Sarandon, on behalf of a product called SodaStream, caused great excitement.
But we are jumping all over, perhaps because of all that coffee, so here is an overview of what seems to be happening in the homes on Planet Earth.
STILL, A WEHRMACHT GRAY MIGHT HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE
Pantone, it turns out, is a company that codifies color to help designers communicate the precise shade they want. It also forecasts color trends up to two years ahead.
''When we announce a color of the year, it is not to say honeysuckle needs to be everywhere, but that it is the feel of the country, the mood, the environment, the economy,'' said Giovanni Marra, director of corporate marketing, who was wearing a shirt that was not honeysuckle, but a soft purple. ''We're seeing it in apparel, accessories, home products.''
How would he characterize honeysuckle, in terms of mood?
''Bold, refreshing, rejuvenating,'' Mr. Marra said. ''We felt, after the last couple of years, when it was very difficult economically, it would be good for people to look at a color that could renew and refresh.''
Is this color only for the United States, or is it global?
''It's a global color,'' he said.
But surely what's going on in the Middle East isn't very pink?
''No, this is true. They are definitely challenging times in the Middle East right now.''
Out on the floor, there was a lot of pink, although how much of the credit for that could be given to Pantone was impossible to determine. As one cookware manufacturer pointed out, pink also has a breast-cancer-awareness association. There were plenty of bright neon colors as well, a trend that Pantone also predicted.
Dualit, whose two-slice toasters sell for about $260, was introducing toasters in ''chili pink,'' ''citrus yellow,'' ''lime green'' and ''azure blue.'' And DeLonghi was introducing the kMix Collection, coffee and espresso makers, blenders and toasters in orange, yellow, magenta and green.
The bright blasts of color were also evident in those single-serve coffee makers, which were everywhere.
''It's gone from a fad to a phenomenon,'' said Chris Stevens, vice president of corporate relations at Keurig.
The most ambitious single-shot display was that of Nespresso -- a tricked-out white space with a light show and a soundtrack with a disco beat -- which was introducing the Pixie, an espresso machine that will sell for about $250.
''Basically, it's a compact machine that allows you to make the same barista-made espresso faster,'' said Franz Niedermair, vice president for marketing. ''It has the smaller footprint and it's a little bit hipper, cooler for the younger audience. You've got the colors -- the lime, the red, the silver and the indigo blue.''
What's that song?
''We got it from Lausanne headquarters.''
The Tassimo Bosch T20, another single-serve coffee maker, was introduced last year in black and white, and sells for about $130. The company is now offering colored inserts -- strawberry red, lime green, mint blue and hazelnut brown -- for about $20 each.
''If you bought it this year, and you are sick of your white kitchen, you can jazz it up with inserts,'' said Heather Gordon, a Tassimo spokeswoman. ''Or you could do red for the holidays. Or brown.''
MY ACOLYTES WILL HAVE IT MEDIUM-RARE
Andrew Weil, M.D., a lifestyle guru and leader in the field of integrative medicine, is doing a new line of cookware for Dansk. It includes the bi-level Electronic Food Steamer, for $215, and the five-quart Electronic Slow Cooker, for $286. The Slow Cooker is programmed with 40 recipes from Dr. Weil's books, said Jim Mylonas, the vice president and general manager of Gorham, a subsidiary of Lenox, the company that owns Dansk.
At the show, however, the steamer appeared to be cooking meat. Isn't Dr. Weil a vegetarian?
''He is,'' Mr. Mylonas said. ''But not everybody is. The Electronic Slow Cooker works with the rest of the 90 percent of the country who still eat meat.''
FIRE GOOD, FOSSIL FUELS BAD
Another interesting development was the move toward fireplaces fueled by bioethanol. The Danish company Stelton showed one called Fuego that was sculptural and modern, an open glass dome over an iron base, for about $200.
It's ''mouth-blown glass, so it won't break,'' said Nils Lindblad, the company's North American director. ''You can have it on the porch or on dark winter evenings when you are looking over the mountains in Colorado.''
But not on the coffee table in a New York City apartment?
''No,'' Mr. Lindblad said. ''We don't want to deal with all the liability. We say it is for outdoor use.''
Brasa, of New Orleans, was showing a line of alcohol-fueled fireplaces designed for floor and tabletop use. Some sat on ceramic bases, others were shielded by glass, and prices ranged from $185 to $725. The best seller, said Brasa's founder, Scott Begg, is the Avani, an open portable table fire that sells for $415.
Is it recommended for people with toddlers or cats?
''Depends on how fluffy the cat's tail is,'' Mr. Begg said. ''People who have young children or cats with fluffy tails gravitate to models with more glass.''
Across the hall, for those still addicted to wood-burning stoves, was the Bad Ash Fireplace Vacuum Cleaner, made by the Austin Baccus Company, which retails for about $170.
We hate to be the ones to break it to you, we told the company's national sales manager, Chad Crockett, but this wood-burning stuff appears to be out.
He did not seem concerned.
''I would answer, with the rising cost of energy, I think you are going to see more pellet and wood fireplaces than gas inserts,'' Mr. Crockett said. ''I was just recently at a fireplace show. The number of wood-burning stoves outweighed the gas by four to one.''
FOR BEST SUPPORTING ROLE IN A TRADE SHOW
''She's taking questions between 12:45 and 12:55,'' a trade show spokesman told reporters who had gathered to see Susan Sarandon outside the exhibit of SodaStream, the home soda maker. ''It can only be about environmental stuff. Nothing about her personal life and her recent marriage breakup and her new 29-year-old boyfriend.''
In fact, as even a visitor from another planet would know, the person whom the 64-year-old actress is rumored to have been seeing is over 30, and Ms. Sarandon has denied that he is her boyfriend. And faced with a 6-foot-tall display of crushed cans and bottles, it is clear that what goes on between two little humans, even those with a 30-year-age difference, doesn't amount to a hill of beans.
''This case contains the beverage packages used by an average Chicago family in 5 years,'' a sign over the display read. ''That equals 8,732 bottles and 1,925 cans totaling 10,657 packages. 71% of these will go to landfill. A single replaceable SodaStream bottle can replace all of that. And more.''
When Ms. Sarandon spoke, she was the embodiment of cool mom, relaxed and down-to-earth in glasses, jeans and sneakers, with a casual mop of red hair.
''You all may be wondering what I am doing here,'' she began. ''I was wondering at first, but I am concerned about the environment and a lot of garbage that comes out of my house. We recycle, but I see the canisters fill up, and when I heard about this, it seemed like such a fun, sexy way to address the can and bottle situation.''
(Pepsi and Coca-Cola executives take note: It is no longer a can, it is a situation.)
Ms. Sarandon said she was shocked to learn that only 25 percent of cans and bottles are recyclable and talked about alternatives. (In other words, SodaStream.) Then she took a question about her favorite soda flavor.
''I'm kind of partial to the root beer,'' she said. ''But I'm trying to figure out the citrusy ones, because I own a bar now. I'm trying to make the fizzy ones, add vodka.''
Finally, she talked about her plans to franchise the bar and whether it might be coming to Chicago. Small wonder she is revered at trade shows.
SHPLOT! SHAKA VROOM VROOM SWOOSH
Exciting as her presence was, Ms. Sarandon did not provide the only showbiz razzle-dazzle. Evolution Robotics was putting five robotic floor cleaners through their moves, dancing hard and strong to ''Boom Boom Pow'' by the Black Eyed Peas.
Sure, the Mint Automatic Floor Cleaner has about as much visual interest as a thick white book, but it was still impressive to see five of them rhythmically circling one another.
The floor cleaner sells for about $200 and comes with a cloth for dusting and mopping. Kirsten Culp, the director of operations for the company, outfitted one little cleaner with a Swiffer disposable and gave it the task of cleaning up a coffee spill, which it did very efficiently, figuring out, by virtue of its navigation system, how to efficiently cover its square of flooring.
If it's just a coffee spill, wouldn't it be faster to swoop down with a paper towel?
''Yeah,'' Ms. Culp said. ''But it cleans for up to two hours on a single charge, so this thing could mop a kitchen floor. That's how I usually use it.''
HEY, THERE'S OUR OLD SWATCH!
The Ergorapido Green, the new environmentally sensitive vacuum cleaner from Electrolux, is a black number touched with lime green that sells for about $130 and will be in the stores this June. Its selling point is that it is 70 percent ''post-consumer recycled plastic,'' but no doubt sensing that it would be up against such scene-stealers as the dancing robo-vacs, Electrolux created a display of three vacuum cleaners with casings made from ocean debris.
''The display is called Vac from the Sea,'' said Cecilia Nord, vice president for sustainability for Electrolux Floor Care and Small Appliances.
''The one from Hawaii has lots of small things,'' she added, referring to the vacuum that appeared to be covered with small pieces of colored glass. ''It's not glass, it's plastic. That's the issue.''
She pointed to another, done in thin plastic strips. ''That one is from the French Atlantic coast, and the far right is a collection of marine gear, fishing nets from all over the world.''
They all looked great, but a new line, we assume, is out of the question.
HOW CLEVER THESE EARTHLINGS ARE
Our spacecraft, decked out in honeysuckle upholstery, is about to depart. But there are a few more things the visitor must point out: the Hot-Pot BBQ, a combination barbecue and herb garden that looks like a terra-cotta pot but is actually made of stainless steel ($124 at black-blum.com). Urban Butik's Bird Feeder, a 5-inch-diameter clear plastic orb that attaches to a window with a suction cup, so that even someone living in a high-rise can get up close and personal with the birds (about $20 at urban-butik.com). The Elevate Carousel Gift Set by JosephJoseph, a set of brightly colored kitchen tools on a rotating carousel ($50 at unicahome.com). No Doggie Bowl, a press-on toilet bowl tattoo in the style of a traffic sign, with the image of a dog drinking from a toilet bowl and a slash drawn across it (about $10 at toilet-tattoos.com). And the Barbecue Solaire, a solar-powered barbecue with a carrying case from the French manufacturer ID Cook (starting at $500 at idcook.com).
Solar-powered! Like the company's literature says, that means over four billion years of free and environmentally friendly energy.
No coffee for us, thank you. We've had enough.

HEADLINE: Lobby Battle Over Loans For Lawsuits

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Companies that advance money to plaintiffs involved in personal injury lawsuits are campaigning in state capitals for legislation making clear that their growing industry is not subject to usury limits on interest rates or other state laws that protect borrowers.
Instead, the lawsuit lending companies want to adopt a separate and less rigorous set of protections. Since February, they have persuaded legislators in at least five states, including New York, to introduce bills based on the industry's own proposals. 
The campaign is drawing strong opposition from chambers of commerce, insurance companies and others who worry that lawsuit loans encourage litigation by emboldening plaintiffs. These critics also argue that the bills would strip protections from borrowers.
''They are coming in under the guise of accepting regulation when in fact what they are trying to do is to legalize lawsuit lending and to explicitly exempt themselves for consumer lending requirements,'' said Lisa A. Rickard, president of the Institute for Legal Reform, an arm of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
These clashes reflect both the uncertain legal status of lawsuit lending and the growing debate over its social value: Should third-party investment in lawsuits be encouraged, tightly restricted or banned altogether?
Lending to plaintiffs is part of a broader trend in recent decades in which banks, hedge funds and private investors have been pumping money into other people's lawsuits. About a dozen large companies, and many smaller ones, lend plaintiffs about $100 million a year, generally a few thousand dollars at a time, to cover housing, medical care and other expenses. The loans are repaid from winnings, with costs that can exceed 100 percent a year. People who lose their cases owe nothing.
In making their case, the companies argue that they should not be subject to existing consumer protections because the transactions are investments, not loans. They say they must charge high prices to compensate for the risk that plaintiffs will lose.
''Our approach is much more sensible and consumer friendly than curtailing the industry,'' said Gary Chodes, chief executive of Oasis Legal Finance in Illinois, one of the largest lawsuit lenders and a driving force behind the legislative campaign.
The legal status of lawsuit lending has been hotly contested in recent years. Authorities in some states, including Colorado and Maryland, have ruled that the companies must comply with lending laws, which severely restrict the kind of interest rates that can be charged. Authorities in other states, including New York, have ruled that the companies are not subject to those laws, accepting the industry's argument that the transactions are conditional investments.
In 2008, the industry began an effort orchestrated through its trade group, the American Legal Finance Association, to settle the issue through legislation. Ohio, Maine and Nebraska have since passed laws establishing customized regulations for lawsuit lenders. Efforts in other states, including Illinois, fell short.
This year, the industry is greatly expanding the number of battlegrounds.
Since February, the industry's allies have filed bills in New York and in at least four other states: Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana and Maryland. Legislators in Tennessee and Maryland have also introduced similar bills, but with somewhat stronger consumer protections. Mr. Chodes said that Oasis is focusing on Arkansas, Illinois and Nevada.
''We are seeking regulation in these states because, unlike the insurance industry, we want strong consumer protections in place,'' he said.
The State Senate in Indiana handed the industry its first victory of the year on February 17. The sponsor, Senator Randy Head, said that Oasis brought the issue to his attention and helped shape the legislation that he introduced.
''Most of what they proposed is contained in the bill,'' he said.
Indiana has not tried to regulate lawsuit lending under existing consumer protection laws, and Mr. Head said the bill would establish relevant protections, for example barring lenders from any involvement in cases beyond providing money. It also makes clear, however, that lawsuit loans are not subject to the state's 36 percent cap on interest rates.
A similar bill passed the House in Kentucky one day later. But it has become bogged down in the Senate after opponents, including the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, ''raised a red flag'' with Republican leaders, said Dave Adkisson, the chamber's chief executive.
''It's being raised as a consumer protection issue,'' he said, ''but in reality they want an exemption to the laws that govern other loans.''
Lenders have been forced to give ground in some states. Oasis has not made loans in Maryland since 2009, when it paid a fine of $105,000 after state regulators threatened to sue the company for violating state usury laws. It did not concede wrongdoing.
Seeking a way back into the state, the industry now is supporting a bill that would impose some restrictions on pricing for the first time. The bill, pending before the House in Maryland, would allow charges of up to 80 percent of the loan amount in the first year and up to 200 percent of the loan amount in total.
Oasis now charges customers up to 250 percent of the loan amount, but Mr. Chodes said the company was willing to accept ''appropriate limitations.''
The industry is also scrambling to respond to a bill in Arkansas that would ban lawsuit lending completely, and to a bill in Rhode Island that makes clear that lawsuit lending is subject to the same state regulations as other kinds of lending.
The sponsor of the Rhode Island measure, Senator Michael McCaffrey, said that he only recently learned about the industry from a constituent, a lawyer, who was shocked by the price a client was charged for a loan. Mr. McCaffrey said he was surprised to learn that such loans were not clearly subject to consumer protections.
Mr. McCaffrey said that he had been contacted by Oasis since filing the bill, but that he was not convinced by the company's argument that it needed to charge high rates.
''Consumers obviously need to be protected as best they can be,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Coffee Source In Colombia Suffers Setbacks

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
TIMBIO, Colombia -- Like most of the small landowners in Colombia's lush mountainous Cauca region, Luis Garzon, 80, and his family have thrived for decades by supplying shade-grown, rainforest-friendly Arabica coffee for top foreign brands like Nespresso and Green Mountain. A sign in the center of a nearby town proclaims, ''The coffee of Cauca is No. 1!''
But in the last few years, coffee yields have plummeted here and in many of Latin America's other premier coffee regions as a result of rising temperatures and more intense and unpredictable rains, phenomena that many scientists link partly to global warming.
Coffee plants require the right mix of temperature, rainfall and spells of dryness for beans to ripen properly and maintain their taste. Coffee pests thrive in the warmer, wetter weather. 
Bean production at the Garzons' farm is therefore down 70 percent from five years ago, leaving the family little money for clothing for toddlers and ''thinking twice'' about sending older children to college, said Mr. Garzon's 44-year-old son, Albeiro, interviewed in a yellow stucco house decorated with coffee posters and madonnas.
The shortage of high-end Arabica coffee beans is also being felt in New York supermarkets and Paris cafes, as customers blink at escalating prices. Purveyors fear that the Arabica coffee supply from Colombia may never rebound -- that the world might, in effect, hit ''peak coffee.''
In 2006, Colombia produced more than 12 million 132-pound bags of coffee, and set a goal of 17 million for 2014. Last year the yield was nine million bags.
Brands like Maxwell, Yuban and Folgers have increased the retail prices of many grinds by 25 percent or more since the middle of last year in light of tight supply and higher wholesale prices.
Profits of high-end coffee chains like Starbucks and Green Mountain have been eroded. Coffee futures of Arabica, the high-end bean that comes predominantly from Latin America, have risen more than 85 percent since last June, to $2.95 a pound, partly over concerns about supply, extreme weather and future quality, said George Kopp, an analyst at the International Futures Group in Chicago.
Yet as stockpiles of some of the best coffee beans shrink, global demand is soaring as the rising middle classes of emerging economies like Brazil, India and China develop the coffee habit.
''Coffee production is under threat from global warming, and the outlook for Arabica in particular is not good,'' said Peter Baker, a coffee specialist with CABI, a research group in Britain that focuses on agriculture and the environment, noting that climate changes, including heavy rains and droughts, have harmed crops across many parts of Central and South America.
A top coffee scientist, he has rattled trade forums by warning, Cassandra-like, of the possibility of ''peak coffee,'' meaning that, like oil supplies, coffee supplies might be headed for an inexorable decline unless growers make more concerted efforts to expand production globally.
The Specialty Coffee Association of America warned this year, ''It is not too far-fetched to begin questioning the very existence of specialty coffee.''
Arabica and Robusta coffee account for virtually all consumption. With its more delicate taste and lower caffeine content, Arabica is more popular and more expensive, though generally more finicky in its weather needs. Robusta production dominates in Asia and Africa.
Colombia is the No. 2 Arabica exporter after Brazil, where production is centered on larger, more mechanized farms and continues to grow.
The Colombian Coffee Growers Federation says high fertilizer prices have also dented yields. But it agrees with a 2009 report from the International Coffee Organization that concluded, ''Climatic variability is the main factor responsible for changes in coffee yields all over the world.''
Average temperatures in Colombia's coffee regions have risen nearly one degree in 30 years, and in some mountain areas the increase has been double that, says Cenicafe, the national coffee research center. Rain in this area was more than 25 percent above average in the last few years.
At the new, higher temperatures, the plants' buds abort or their fruit ripens too quickly for optimum quality. Heat also brings pests like coffee rust, a devastating fungus that could not survive the previously cool mountain weather. The heavy rains damage the fragile Arabica blossoms, and the two-week dry spells that prompt the plant to flower and produce beans occur less often, farmers say. Arabica beans take about seven months to mature.
''Half a degree can make a big difference for coffee -- it is adapted to a very specific zone,'' said Nestor Riano, a specialist in agroclimatology for Cenicafe. ''If temperature rises even a bit, the growth is affected, and the plagues and diseases rise.''
While climate scientists agree that the increase in temperature is a clear signal of global warming and high ocean temperatures are generally associated with more frequent storms, scientists are uncertain whether the peculiar weather patterns in the area are directly related to warming, said Stephen E. Zebiak, director general of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University.
''It is hard to know whether this severe weather represents natural fluctuations or is a climate change signal, though from a risk management sense, there is good reason to consider how to cope with these extreme events,'' Dr. Zebiak said.
In the hope of restoring coffee output, researchers at Cenicafe's labs are toiling on a mission that seems as pressing a priority for Colombia as curing cancer is for medical researchers.
Agronomists are teaching the farmers how to control the pests that arrived with the change in the weather. Climatologists are working to provide better local weather predictions. Geneticists are breeding plants that are more resistant to diseases or that can withstand torrential rains or a hotter environment.
The Coffee Growers Federation has advised farmers to switch to a newer, hardier strain of Arabica that has been developed by plant breeders at Cenicafe over the last two decades.
While the federation says it tastes the same as traditional variants, farmers have resisted because they can ill afford to forgo the income of a yearly crop as they wait for new plants to mature. They have also been wary that a switch could affect flavor.
Taste, quality and supply are delicate issues for an industry whose aficionados are notoriously picky. Coffee companies are ''working with farmers across the region to address the impact of changing weather patterns that are a direct result of climate change,'' said Lisa Magnino, a spokeswoman for Starbucks,
Starbucks has already bought enough coffee to last until 2012, she added. Luis Fernando Samper, a spokesman for Colombian Coffee Growers Federation, said that the beans that do make it to breakfast tables in the United States will yield coffee that is as good as ever. The problem is for Colombian farmers, who are producing far fewer beans over all and ''more defective beans'' that do not meet export standards.
For decades, said Luis Garzon, who started growing coffee at 7, it was dry from June 1 to Sept. 8 in Timbio. Several years ago, the perplexing weather arrived. ''It can start raining at 6 a.m. and go on for 24 hours,'' he said.
First, yields declined. Then last year, the coffee rust fungus arrived at the Garzon farm, killing entire fields. ''We learned our lesson,'' he said, stroking the mottled yellowed leaves of some damaged plants. Now, the family is planting the new, hardier Arabica variant, called castillo. The coffee federation hopes that such innovation will allow growers to keep expensive Arabica coffee on American tables.
Meanwhile, it is creating a ''product origin'' certification program for Colombian coffees, similar to the one that protects Italy's Parmesan cheese. That way importers will not be tempted to substitute beans from Brazil or Indonesia.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Sky, And Pollution, Too

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
PINEDALE, Wyo. -- Strong sun, not too much wind, a good thick snow pack: sounds like a perfect late winter's day in a remote rural Western valley rimmed by snaggle-topped mountains.
But that has also been the stage set for the worst ozone pollution event here in three years -- in one of the places people might least expect. The nearest metropolis, Salt Lake City, is 180 miles away, and the usual smog suspects -- cars, trucks, factories, indeed people in general -- are few and far between in a county of only 8,800 residents.
State environmental officials declared another ozone alert here on Wednesday, the second in less than a week, anticipating that air pollution would settle in starting Thursday. 
''It's like a pot, with all the mountain ranges around it, and the inversion is like a lid,'' said Keith Guille, a spokesman for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, describing the conditions for cooking pollutants and creating the atmospheric inversion that locks them in place.
The upper Green River basin in southwest Wyoming has polluted-air days for a combination of reasons: its geography, in a valley at 7,000 feet; its typical winter weather that produces sun on highly reflective snow; and its economy, heavily based on natural gas drilling, which scientists say produces smog's underlying chemical base.
''If poor air quality is what I have to live with, then that's a choice I make,'' said Dawn Mitchell, 43, a day care teacher who said she thought ozone or other pollutants here were not a particularly big deal, weighed against the benefits of an empty Western playground in one's backyard. ''I can't imagine living anywhere else,'' she said.
How the factors come together to create, in this region, a problem more commonly associated with car-choked big cities -- and how much each factor is to blame for the sometimes unsavory air -- is where the human element jumps into the fray.
Some people here in Pinedale, the valley's largest community -- about 1,400 people, according to the welcome sign on the edge of town -- say that winds blowing bad air up from places like Salt Lake are a bigger factor than the drill rigs that dot the nearby high plateaus.
Others say population growth caused by the gas boom is a contributing factor -- more people making pollution with trucks and snowmobiles. Still others say energy production is the lifeblood that has made this place survive and thrive when many other Western towns are moldering, so love it or leave it.
''It's our livelihood,'' said Jennifer Woolf, who can see a gas well about 300 yards from her house.
At the Pinedale Medical Clinic, a big new building of wood beams and tile, built with energy taxes, the director, Dr. James H. Quirk Jr., is not sure whether or how health and drill rigs intersect. The population is too small for a valid scientific study, he said, so it comes down to the personal and the anecdotal. ''I got the flu last week,'' Dr. Quirk said. ''And when I was out feeding my horses, throwing hay, I was doubled over coughing'' and wondering, ''do I feel this miserable because of just the flu?''
Energy companies say they have taken steps to reduce emissions that can contribute to ozone formation. Encana Oil and Gas, for example, which operates 1,200 wells south of Pinedale, has converted its rigs from diesel to natural gas and consolidated production facilities to reduce evaporation, said a company spokesman, Doug Hock.
But the industry's overall well count, Mr. Hock said, has continued to rise even as those changes were put into place over the last four or five years.
Some people have called for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to answer questions about how gas drilling might be contributing to air pollution. But the agency recently removed the topic from those it is considering for a national study of hydrofracking, a relatively new high-volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing method used in gas drilling in Wyoming and elsewhere.
Some residents said they thought ozone alerts and talk of pollution were part of an environmentalist plot to take down the oil and gas industry.
''It's the Greenpeace people who don't like it,'' said Teren Donley, 25, whose husband is a supervisor for a pump truck in the gas fields south of town.
Others said they had lived elsewhere and seen smog -- real smog, California style -- the kind that makes Pinedale's worst day look pristine.
''Pasadena in the 1950s,'' said Rod Rozier, 89, a retired pilot, talking about his standard of air pollution. Mr. Rozier moved here about three years ago to be near family and was bowling in a Wii league at the Rendezvous Point Senior Center. The center, as a plaque at the entrance proclaims, was built with the help of a natural gas company, the Questar Corporation.
But in large or small ways, residents say they adjust to bad air days as they come.
''Last year we had some bad spells and my eyes hurt, like I had a sunburn,'' said Vivian Watts, a waitress at Stockman's Restaurant, a wood- and antler-lined place on Pinedale's main drag. ''This time, I've stayed inside.''

HEADLINE: Second Session: Psychiatry, Talk and Drug Therapy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As ''Talk Doesn't Pay, So Psychiatry Turns Instead to Drug Therapy'' (''Doctors Inc.'' series, front page, March 6) noted, decades of research have shown that psychotherapy, now eschewed for financial reasons by many practicing psychiatrists, is often as effective as psychotropic drugs -- if not more so, as in the treatment for depression.
There is something inherently wrong with a health care system that allows a practitioner to earn more for three 15-minute prescription-writing sessions than for a 45-minute therapy session that teaches patients lifelong coping skills and has no adverse physical side effects. 
What is of great concern with the current treatment situation, driven in large measure by the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries, is the diminished quality of care provided to patients. While many of the new psychotropic drugs have proved effective, taking a pill is not always the answer to a mental health problem.
I was heartened to read that Dr. Donald Levin recommends that his patients see a psychologist for psychotherapy, in addition to receiving medications from him. But I must take issue with the article's statement that psychologists ''can often afford to charge less'' than psychiatrists because they did not go to medical school.
To earn a doctorate in health service psychology, one must complete five to seven years of graduate academic and clinical work, including a yearlong supervised internship -- a rigorous regimen on a par with medical school.
More important, psychotherapy is often the treatment of choice, and it is a travesty that the current health care system promotes medication over psychotherapy regardless of what is in the best interest of the patient.
Norman B. Anderson Chief Executive American Psychological Association Washington, March 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Kudos for telling like it is. Patients who consult psychiatrists often receive little more than a diagnostic label and a prescription, not because it is optimal care but because economic pressures are turning psychiatry practices into assembly lines. At least Dr. Donald Levin knows this and encourages his patients to get psychotherapy from someone else.
What the article does not say is that the same economic pressures are also transforming psychology practices into assembly lines. Once, psychologists worked to understand their patients deeply and to help them better understand themselves. This kind of therapy -- known as psychodynamic therapy -- offers meaningful and lasting help.
Nevertheless, fewer and fewer psychologists are trained to provide this kind of in-depth therapy or even understand how or why it is helpful. Instead, they are being trained to provide the brief, one-size-fits-all treatments that health insurers want to pay for.
Jonathan Shedler Denver, March 6, 2011
The writer is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
To the Editor:
Your article points to horrible developments in psychiatry. But readers need to know that many psychiatrists and mental health professionals do not give in to insurance companies. We provide the best care available despite economic pressures because for many people exploring their situation in depth is essential.
Psychoanalysts are highly trained talk therapists. We charge appropriate fees, but most of us see some patients at lower rates when necessary. Most analytic institutes operate reduced-fee clinics staffed by advanced trainees.
The insurance companies' fight against optimal care, in the mistaken belief that pushing pills saves money, must be addressed. In the meantime, patients need to know that there are able mental health professionals, many trained as psychoanalysts, available to provide the care they need.

HEADLINE: An Anniversary To Bear in Mind

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and LISA LEE

 BODY:
The rally in stocks is now two years old. The M.S.C.I. global index has nearly doubled since March 9, 2009, the postfinancial crisis nadir. Credit markets are thriving, and economic activity has returned. Yet the government actors behind the rebound look spent. Financial markets are on their own for future shocks.
A call to arms from the world's governments pulled the financial system back from the brink two years ago. Guaranteeing bank debt, slashing interest rates, buying more than $1 trillion of assets and stress testing large banks were among the moves that restored stability and revived markets. President Obama may have seen all the activity coming: On March 3, 2009, he called stocks ''a potentially good deal.'' 
Even the derivatives index used to hedge subprime mortgage loans is up 25 percent, according to Barclays Capital. With oil up more than 120 percent in two years and gold 55 percent higher, commodities look frothy. The International Monetary Fund on Monday noted ''overheating'' in emerging markets.
Meanwhile, there remain plenty of potential flashpoints. Turmoil in the Middle East, which has increased the price of oil, is the most immediate. Sovereign debt stresses in Europe remain worrying. And rising inflation combined with an increase in interest rates is another situation that could torpedo market sentiment.
For investors from banks to hedge funds, however, the safe options that may protect them against these risks just don't make enough money. Short-term interest rates, for instance, are mostly still low, especially the Federal Reserve's zero to 0.25 percent. They prefer, as before the crisis, to shoulder risk in return for more yield.
But this time there's no real government safety net. Huge budget deficits in the developed world leave little ammunition for governments. Politics won't allow further large-scale intervention, especially in the United States.
True, central banks like the Fed have shown themselves prepared to print money, even though doing more of that would run the risk of further undermining confidence.
The government-fueled bull run is fresh in investors' minds. But they might do well not to forget the dark days two years ago.
A Dog of a Deal
Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, has showed its arch-rival a solution to its problems by selling its pharmacy benefits management arm to better focus on retailing.
Walgreens' top competitor, CVS, has taken the opposite tack since it paid $26 billion for Caremark. That dog of a deal, which has dragged down performance and led to an antitrust inquiry, looks increasingly in need of unwinding.
True, Walgreens' pharmacy benefits management business was never a big part of the company. The unit, which is selling for $525 million in cash to Catalyst Health Solutions, contributes less than 2 percent to Walgreens' bottom line. Still, with the middleman gone, Walgreens' managers will be better concentrated on the firm's core business.
Contrast that with CVS-Caremark. The company runs a retail operation similar in scale to Walgreens along with a giant pharmacy benefits management company. Since the two merged, the Caremark business has lost some big contracts and downgraded its earnings forecasts. It has also spent precious management time explaining to the Federal Trade Commission why the combination doesn't hurt consumers.
Investors have noticed. The shares have underperformed and trade at a discount to other drugstore chains and pure-play pharmacy benefits firms Medco Health and Express Scripts. To the market, the group is neither fish nor fowl.
The solution is to let them swim their separate ways again.
CVS-Caremark claimed $700 million of synergies from merging. But even if these vanished, their net present value would still amount to less than the potential upside from splitting.
Moreover, the looming presence of the antitrust inquiry would vanish. Here's a case where the market might nicely do regulators' dirty work.

HEADLINE: Shares Decline as Violence In Libya Weighs on Markets

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Wednesday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lower a third time in four days amid concern about escalating violence in Libya.
Caterpillar and DuPont dropped at least 1 percent, pacing losses in industrial shares. Texas Instruments slumped 3.1 percent after it narrowed its earnings forecast. Finisar tumbled 39 percent, leading other network equipment makers lower, as its profit estimate missed analysts' projections. I.B.M. rose 2.2 percent as Deutsche Bank lifted its share price estimate for the company.
The S.& P. 500 fell 1.80 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,320.02. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 12,213.09. The Nasdaq composite index declined 14.05 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,751.72. 
Oil slid 0.6 percent, to settle at $104.38 a barrel in New York as a surge in supplies at a hub in the United States overshadowed concern about violence in Libya.
The S.& P. 500 has fallen 1.7 percent from this year's high on Feb. 18.
Libya's Ras Lanuf refinery, the country's largest crude-processing plant, was shut as fighting continued between government forces and rebels, an official with the Libyan Emirates Oil Refining Company said. Oil tanks at the nearby Es Sider marine terminal were damaged by bombings on Wednesday, according to Al Jazeera television.
Stocks of industries that are most dependent on economic growth, including commodity producers, technology and industrial companies, led the declines in the S.& P. 500.
Caterpillar, the maker of construction equipment, lost 1.7 percent, to $102.36. DuPont, the chemical maker, slid 1 percent, to $53.71.
Texas Instruments, the chip maker, fell 3.1 percent, to $34.74. The company narrowed its first-quarter profit estimate to 56 cents to 60 cents a share from 54 cents to 62 cents. The average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey was 59 cents.
Finisar tumbled 39 percent, to $24.61, for its biggest decline since going public in 1999. The company, which makes fiber optic transmission gear, said it would not earn more than 35 cents a share excluding some items in the fourth quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of 48 cents.
Other makers of networking equipment also slumped. JDS Uniphase fell 17 percent, the biggest drop in the S.& P. 500, to $21.14. Ciena slumped 5.3 percent, to $24.33.
I.B.M. rose 2.2 percent, to $165.86, the biggest increase in the Dow, and touched an all-time high of $167.72. Deutsche Bank raised its share-price estimate for the computer-services provider to $200 from $175. There is ''ample flexibility'' for I.B.M. to beat its forecast of generating at least $20 a share by 2015 given its revenue growth, productivity gains and share buybacks, Chris Whitmore, a Deutsche Bank analyst, wrote in a note to clients.
Retailers advanced as American Eagle Outfitters reported fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations of 44 cents, beating the average analyst estimate by 1 cent. The company climbed 5.1 percent, to $15.56.
J. C. Penney rallied 4.8 percent, to $36.94, the biggest increase in the S.& P. Macy's rose 3 percent, to $24.08.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 21/32, to 101 9/32, and the yield fell to 3.499 percent from 3.55 percent late Tuesday.
Wholesale Inventories Rise
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses at the wholesale level added to their stockpiles in January and their sales rose by the largest amount in 14 months.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that wholesale inventories rose 1.1 percent in January. It was the 12th gain in 13 months.
Sales at the wholesale level rose for the seventh straight month. The 3.4 percent increase in January was the largest gain since November 2009.
The rise in inventories in January left stockpiles at $436.9 billion. That was 13.1 percent higher than the low reached in September 2009, when companies were slashing stockpiles to control costs during the recession.
The January sales increase was led by a 7.8 percent surge in demand for autos and auto parts.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile in Washington

 BODY:
The Senate on Wednesday voted down the House budget bill, with its string of $61 billion in mostly political cuts through Sept. 30. That formally puts an end to the House's grandstand play. But the Senate also rejected its Democratic leaders' own plan to cut $6.5 billion. The government's financing is due to run out in eight days. To prevent a shutdown, the two chambers will probably have to agree to yet another short-term financing bill. 
That would be politically and fiscally irresponsible. But the House Republicans will be happy to agree, as long as Democrats agree to a vigorish of $2 billion a week in cuts to vital government programs.
Unless the White House and Democratic lawmakers start pushing back a lot harder -- and do a better job of explaining the disastrous effects on the economy and everyday life -- the Republicans will win the argument. If it keeps going on this way, they will get the $61 billion they demanded.
The White House again threatened on Wednesday to veto the House bill, and said it supported the Democratic bill that did not even draw a simple majority. It has been hosting what appear to be unproductive talks among legislative leaders; Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., who is nominally in charge of the talks, is now visiting Eastern Europe and tried to mediate by telephone.
President Obama has yet to take a firm public stand and make clear his bargaining limits and priorities. Understandably, he does not want the government to shut down and is hoping that quiet negotiations will produce better results than loud declarations of principle. But there is no sign that the House freshmen have an interest in compromise, or that Representative John Boehner, the House speaker, has any control of his caucus.
A brief shutdown, painful as it would be, would be far less damaging than a sudden withdrawal of tens of billions in government spending from the economy, which would lead to widespread layoffs.
Mr. Obama could well follow the example of Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, who on Wednesday called for a ''re-set'' of the negotiating process. The only way to have a meaningful discussion of the budget, he said in a speech, is to consider all of its parts at once over the long term, not for a few weeks or months at a time. That includes all the issues the Republicans wouldn't deal with in their bill: cuts to the entitlement programs and to the Pentagon budget and ways to raise revenues at the same time.
The Republicans, as Mr. Schumer noted, aren't really interested in lowering the deficit. If they were, they would never have insisted on $800 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy without paying for them, or on repealing the health care law, which saves $230 billion over a decade.
They are only interested in slashing government, no matter the cost to the country. It is time for the president -- and responsible Congressional leaders of both parties -- to reject their tactics and their goal.

HEADLINE: Amid Battle to Cut Spending, Republicans Turn Spotlight to Jobs

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Under fire for focusing heavily on cutting spending rather than stimulating job creation, House Republicans are taking new steps to emphasize their efforts to spur hiring, including a jobs forum with business leaders to be held in the Capitol next week.
''We have been about cutting and growing since Day 1,'' Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, said. ''This is the growth end.'' 
After a session this week with committee chairmen, Mr. Cantor and two key lawmakers -- Representatives Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Fred Upton, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee -- ticked off tax changes and efforts to curb regulation that they said Republicans would pursue to restore jobs.
Republicans have also invited executives of both small and large businesses to come to the Capitol and to participate via teleconference next Wednesday in a session on how Congress can improve the hiring climate. Mr. Cantor said the idea was to solicit suggestions on removing what Republicans see as governmental barriers to job creation and taking aggressive steps to bolster the business sector.
''We are not interested in giving any speeches but really want to see what the impediments are here, what we can do,'' Mr. Cantor said in an interview. ''We are not interested in beating our chests. We are trying to get results.''
Republicans are clearly sensitive to mounting accusations from Democrats and others that the new House majority has devoted most of its energy so far to cutting spending -- and potentially putting thousands of government jobs at risk. Democrats have sought to turn the ''where are the jobs'' mantra on the same Republicans who deployed it so aggressively against them in last year's elections.
''Ten Weeks, Zero Jobs Bills by G.O.P.,'' declared a memo issued Tuesday night by the office of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. Instead of working on jobs legislation this week, the memo said, Republicans are spending their time trying to undo programs intended to help struggling mortgage holders and opening a high-profile committee investigation into what some say is the radicalization of American Muslims.
Democrats have also received some support from economists who say the Republican plans to slash spending by $61 billion in the current year could threaten the nation's economic recovery. They say Republicans have abandoned their pledge to get Americans back to work.
''The one thing that the Republicans have not talked about is the one thing the American people care about more than anything else, and that is jobs,'' Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said this week.
Republicans say such assaults are partisan sniping. They argue that the drive to cut spending and attack the deficit can bring some sense of stability to the economy and build confidence among business operators that it is safe to expand payrolls because the government is working to improve its fiscal situation. And they have marshaled their own economists to back up that view.
Still, they have faced skepticism about the strength of the link between government spending cuts and job growth, and they are trying to bring more attention to their push to directly foster job creation to avoid being identified solely as a budget-cutting monolith. It also puts them in line to take some credit if the national employment picture improves.
Mr. Camp said Republicans were strongly encouraging the Obama administration to move forward with free trade pacts that could lead to 250,000 new hires. He noted that half of the eight hearings held by his panel this year were devoted to simplifying and overhauling the tax code to stimulate economic growth. He said he had been in touch with Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, about moving forward with tax law changes.
''Fundamental tax reform is key,'' Mr. Camp said. ''It is a critical issue for us to work on.''
Mr. Upton said the chief job-creating focus of his panel had been to identify and move to block regulatory efforts by the Obama administration, and specifically the Environmental Protection Agency, that he said would strangle the economy.
''The last thing that we need to do,'' he said, ''is impose new regulations on industry across the board, across the country. Because it is going to cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, many billions of dollars.''
Among those invited to take part in the jobs forum are executives from a machine tool company, a specialty coffee-roasting company, a coal producer, a cement company, the banking industry and a high-tech firm. Mr. Cantor said they were the type of job-creating businesses Republicans were trying to assist.
''We are trying to get solutions that make sense and that can get bipartisan support,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Crisis Is Over, But Where's The Fix?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
When the financial system began to crumble more than three years ago, the world rushed to rescue it. Country after country went deeply into debt to keep banks afloat and prevent a deep recession from turning into something worse.
It worked. This week was the second anniversary of the nadir of the crisis. Most stock markets around the world are at least 75 percent higher than they were then. Financial stocks, which led the markets down, have also led them up.
At the time, rescuing seemed more important than reforming. The world economy was breaking down because of a lack of financing. Trade flows collapsed, and companies and individuals stopped spending. It seemed clear that halting the slide was critical.
But the world has changed since then. The economic recovery in most developed countries is stuttering at best, and governments are struggling with their own finances. It is time for remorse and second-guessing. 
A surprising citadel of that second-guessing is at the International Monetary Fund, where researchers this week concluded that the rescues ''only treated the symptoms of the global financial meltdown.''
The researchers, Stijn Claessens and Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, warned that ''a rare opportunity is being thrown away to tackle the underlying causes. Without restructuring financial institutions' balance sheets and their operations, as well as their assets -- loans to over-indebted households and enterprises -- the economic recovery will suffer, and the seeds will be sown for the next crisis.''
There have been reforms, of course. The Dodd-Frank law in the United States is now being put into effect, albeit by regulators that the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives seems determined to starve of resources to do the job. Banking regulators around the globe have agreed that much more capital is needed by banks, but stricter requirements are coming very slowly out of fear that abrupt changes will reduce bank lending when it is needed the most.
More capital is clearly needed, but it may not be nearly enough. ''If we ask them for more capital, and they are too big to fail, they can take even more risk'' after they raise additional capital, Y. Venugopal Reddy, a former governor of India's central bank, argued at an economic conference sponsored by the I.M.F. this week. He added that he was worried about institutions that were ''too powerful to regulate.''
One of the questions economists were asked to address at the conference was, Does the financial system have social value?
A few years ago, that question would not have been asked at the International Monetary Fund. If it had been, the responses would have been as unanimous as might be expected if a gathering at the Vatican were to consider whether religion was a good thing.
Now, there is no such unanimity. It is clear that there are functions of the financial system that must be performed, among them the allocation of capital and the setting of prices. But there is at least a suspicion that a significant part of modern finance has no real value for anyone except the participants.
Adair Turner, the chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority, spoke with wonderment of the huge volume of stock trades now made by computers using algorithms to rapidly trade in and out. Some traders, he said, were using what they called ''predatory algorithms,'' whose sole purpose is to exploit a weakness in some other trader's algorithm and get it to make an unprofitable trade.
''It is quite difficult to work out the social benefit of that,'' he said.
And of course, there is also the fact that the financial system did not accomplish what it was supposed to do. ''At the core of these functions is the ability to find and set the right price, including the extent to which it reflects risk,'' Antonio Borges, an I.M.F. official and former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, told the conference. ''This is not really a question of financial sophistication, of complex products or greedy bankers. It is a question of getting the prices wrong.''
He added, ''It is unbelievable how wrong they were.''
There is general agreement that many of the assumptions economists and others made before the crisis -- about the rationality of markets, about their ability to measure risks and about the proper role of monetary policy -- were largely wrong, or at best oversimplified. But there is far less unanimity about what to do about it. International cooperation was impressive in dealing with the immediate crisis. Now it is splintering, and banks are threatening to move operations to areas they deem friendlier to them.
In retrospect, it is clear that the bailouts came with too little pain for those responsible. Bondholders who financed banks that failed largely escaped pain. That was true even in Ireland, where the bailout would have led to a default of government debt had Europe not stepped in. It is still not clear how Ireland will pay its national debt, but the bank bondholders did fine.
At the time, of course, there were fears that forcing bondholders to suffer would lead to the collapse of banks that could have survived. Those fears seemed reasonable to me then, and still do. But little progress has been made in setting up mechanisms to assure that any future crisis can be dealt with in a different way. There is talk of restructuring bank balance sheets to assure that debt is automatically converted to equity just when equity seems to be worth little, but that is unlikely to happen unless regulators force it, and it is far from clear what price investors would demand.
Moreover, as Mr. Turner noted, it is important to somehow assure that those who would suffer from such a conversion are not themselves so leveraged that a crisis would be intensified. Something like that seems to have played a role in Europe's decision to avert a Greek national default. Most of the Greek debt was owned by European banks, and it was doubtful that they could afford to take the losses.
Perhaps the most important error made early in the crisis was a decision by Henry Paulson, then the United States Treasury secretary, to put pressure on big banks to accept bailouts whether they needed them or not. The idea was to avoid making acceptance of such money a scarlet letter that would in itself alarm depositors and investors. It seemed to make sense.
But it also meant that it was not clear which managers had led their banks over -- or at least close to -- a cliff. There was an unmet need to establish the principle that, in Mr. Reddy's words, ''When the profits are good, you take your bonus. When something goes wrong, you go out and somebody else comes in.''
The principle is particularly important because regulatory failures may be inevitable. If multimillion-dollar bank bosses do not see a crisis looming before it is too late, can we be sure regulators who work for far less will be more prescient? Markets clearly did a horrid job of allocating capital, but there is no particular reason to think governments would do better.
Even if regulators somehow did design a perfect regulatory system, it would not last, simply because clever bankers would eventually find ways around it, just as people find ways to evade taxes, forcing tax law writers to constantly make changes.
''Every decade or so,'' said Paul Romer, a senior fellow at the Institute for Economic Policy Research at Stanford and now a visiting professor at New York University, ''any finite system of financial regulation will lead to systemic financial crisis.''
If he is right, it is all the more important that ways be found to assure that the costs of the next financial crisis -- in failed institutions and lost economic growth, not to mention government borrowing -- will be far lower. It is hard to conclude much progress has been made in accomplishing that goal.

HEADLINE: Dumbing Deficits Down

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Like anyone who writes regularly about what passes for economic and fiscal debate in American politics, I've developed a strong tolerance for nonsense. After all, if I got upset every time powerful people were illogical and/or dishonest, I'd spend every waking hour in a state of raging despair.
Yet there are still moments when I find myself saying, ''They can't really be that stupid,'' or maybe, ''They can't really think the rest of us are that stupid.'' And I had one of those moments reading about a recent conference on national health policy, which featured a bipartisan dialogue among Congressional staffers. 
According to a column in Kaiser Health News, Republican staffers jeered at any and all proposals to use Medicare and Medicaid funds better. Spending money on prevention was no more than a ''slush fund.'' Research on innovation was ''an oxymoron.'' And there was no reason to pay for ''so-called effectiveness research.''
To put this in context, you have to realize two things about the fiscal state of America. First, the nation is not, in fact, ''broke.'' The federal government is having no trouble raising money, and the price of that money -- the interest rate on federal borrowing -- is very low by historical standards. So there's no need to scramble to slash spending now now now; we can and should be willing to spend now if it will produce savings in the long run.
Second, while the government does have a long-run fiscal problem, that problem is overwhelmingly driven by rising health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office expects Social Security outlays as a percentage of G.D.P. to rise 30 percent over the next quarter-century, as the population ages, but it expects a near doubling of the share of G.D.P. spent on Medicare and Medicaid.
So if you're serious about deficits, you shouldn't be pinching pennies now; you should be looking for ways to rein in health spending over the long term. And that means taking exactly the steps that had those G.O.P. staffers sneering.
Think of it this way: Congress could, with a stroke of a pen, cut Social Security benefits in half. But it couldn't do the same with health spending: Medicare can't suddenly start paying to replace only half a heart valve or mandate that bypass operations stop halfway through.
Limiting health costs, therefore, requires a smarter approach. We need to work harder on prevention, which can be much cheaper than a cure. We need to find innovative ways of managing health care. And, above all, we need to know what works and what doesn't so that Medicare and Medicaid can say no to expensive procedures with little or no medical benefit. ''So-called comparative effectiveness research'' is central to any rational attempt to deal with America's fiscal problems.
But today's Republicans just aren't into rationality. They claim to care deeply about deficits -- but they've spent the past two years putting cynical, demagogic attacks on any attempt to actually deal with long-run deficits at the heart of their campaign strategy.
Here's a recent example. In his new book, Mike Huckabee -- the current leader in polls asking Republicans whom they want to nominate in 2012 -- attacks the Obama stimulus because it included funds for, yes, comparative effectiveness research: ''The stimulus didn't just waste your money; it planted the seeds from which the poisonous tree of death panels will grow.'' Will others in the G.O.P. stand up and say that Mr. Huckabee is wrong, that Medicare needs to know which medical procedures actually work? Don't hold your breath.
Of course, Republicans aren't the only cynics. As the national debate over fiscal policy descends ever deeper into penny-pinching, future-killing absurdity, one voice is curiously muted -- that of President Obama.
The president and his aides know that the G.O.P. approach to the budget is wrongheaded and destructive. But they've stopped making the case for an alternative approach; instead, they've positioned themselves as know-nothings lite, accepting the notion that spending must be slashed immediately -- just not as much as Republicans want.
Mr. Obama's political advisers clearly believe that this strategy of protective camouflage offers the president his best chance at re-election -- and they may be right. But that doesn't change the fact that the White House is aiding and abetting the dumbing down of our deficit debate.
And this dumbing down bodes ill for the nation's future. Health care is only one of the large and difficult problems America needs to deal with, ranging from infrastructure to climate change, all of which demand that we engage in a lot of hard thinking. Yet what we have instead is a political culture in which one side sneers at knowledge and exalts ignorance, while the other side hunkers down and pretends to halfway agree.

HEADLINE: Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?

BYLINE: By HOWARD MANSFIELD. 
Howard Mansfield is the author of ''Turn and Jump: How Time and Place Fell Apart.''

 BODY:
Hancock, N.H.
NOT long ago, clocks were thought to be dangerous. Folklore had it that two of them ticking in the same room could bring ''sure death.'' It's easy to see how this belief arose. The clocks were almost certain to disagree, and in the space between two chimings of one hour, uncertainty crept in; the machines' authority was undermined. We don't like to be reminded that clock time is a convenient fiction.
Daylight saving time, which begins on Sunday, is unsettling in the same way. Winding the clock forward in March and back in November is like biannually changing the measure of an inch. 
This tinkering with clocks is our inheritance from a people obsessed with time. Clocks spread rapidly in early America. They were expensive imports, but popular among the Puritans, who despised idleness. Massachusetts passed a law in 1663 making the wasting of time a crime: ''No person, householder or other shall spend his time idly or unprofitably, under pain of such punishment as the court shall think meet to inflict.'' A century later, the Boston-born Benjamin Franklin (''time is money'') proposed a version of daylight saving time as a joke to stop slothful Parisians from sleeping in. But it was an English Puritan, Ralph Thoresby, who invented an early alarm clock.
By the mid-19th century, Americans were producing their own clocks. Workshops in Connecticut produced cheap models with wooden gears. Peddlers sold them from coast to frontier. The ''Yankee clock peddlers'' managed to ''stick up a clock in every cabin in the western country,'' reported George William Featherstonhaugh, an English geographer who visited the States. ''Wherever we have been, in Kentucky, in Indiana, in Illinois, in Missouri, and here in every dell of Arkansas, and in cabins where there was not a chair to sit on, there was sure to be a Connecticut clock.''
But all these clocks were like many Americans themselves: individual, conforming to their own notions. There were hundreds of local times, each city setting its city hall or courthouse clock to match its own solar noon. When it was 12 p.m. in Chicago, it was 11:50 a.m. in St. Louis and 12:18 p.m. in Detroit. But that wasn't a problem because local time was all that mattered.
That changed when the railroads began to unify the country. The railroads ran by their own time, which vexed travelers trying to make connections. Many stations had two clocks, one for railroad time and one for local time.
To eliminate the confusion, railroads took it upon themselves in 1883 to divide the country into four time zones, with one standard time within each zone. To resist could mean economic isolation, so at noon on Nov. 18, 1883, Chicagoans had to move their clocks back 9 minutes and 32 seconds. It's as if the railroads had commanded the sun to stand still, The Chicago Tribune wrote. Louisville was set back almost 18 minutes, and The Louisville Courier-Journal called the change a ''compulsory lie.'' In a letter to the editor, a reader demanded to know ''if anyone has the authority and right to change the city time without the consent of the people?'' In an 1884 referendum, three-quarters of voters in Bangor, Me., opposed the 25-minute change to ''Philadelphia time.''
One sees the same annoyance with the ''compulsory lie'' of daylight saving time. When it was being debated in 1916, The Literary Digest saw it as a trick to make ''people get up earlier by telling them it is later than it really is.'' The Saturday Evening Post asked, in jest, ''why not 'save summer' by having June begin at the end of February?'' And an Arkansas congressman lampooned the time reformers by proposing that we change our thermometers: move the freezing point up 13 degrees and a lot of folks could be tricked into burning less fuel to heat their houses.
We adopted daylight saving time (during World War I), rejected it (after the war), adopted it again (during World War II), and then left it up to the states and localities until 1966, when Congress once more decided it was a national concern. And as much as we complain and point out that it doesn't make anyone more productive or save any energy, it persists. Almost every state has eight months of it each year and only four months of so-called standard time. As a result, today we rose with the dawn and next week we'll be eating breakfast in darkness.
The change is disconcerting. But more unsettling still is the mystery we'd rather not face: If clock time isn't real, what is time, anyway? We don't understand time, and we definitely don't want to admit that our allotment is limited. We just want to get on with our day.

HEADLINE: The Burden Of Pensions On States

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
For public workers in Wisconsin, there's more bad news.
Having lost the battle on collective bargaining, they may soon be asked to make more financial sacrifices.
The state's workers offered to start picking up part of the cost of their pensions and health insurance early in their showdown this year with Gov. Scott Walker. That change will provide immediate relief for struggling towns, school districts and state agencies, and help them balance their budgets.
But new pension cost estimates, ordered before Governor Walker was elected, are coming as soon as next week. They are expected to show that the current contribution levels to the state pension system are too meager. More money, from employers and employees in some combination, will be needed, and perhaps much more in coming years.
Other states will also probably find that Wisconsin's idea of simply dividing pension contributions between labor and management is an illusory solution to their long-term financial woes. That's because several studies have shown that promises to workers are far more costly than routinely calculated by Wisconsin and most states. 
And the problem seems unlikely to be solved by putting curbs on the collective bargaining power of state workers. Despite the arguments of some Republican governors and popular perception, the places with the most unionized work forces are not necessarily the ones with the most generous pensions, according to a new study.
Coming up with bigger contributions to pension funds will require states to make difficult choices about the size of their work forces, their commitment to public services and the viability of their employee benefits, which are often said to be irreversible and protected by state constitutions.
''The amount they have to be contributing could potentially be two to three times as much as they're contributing now,'' said Joshua Rauh, an associate professor of finance at Northwestern University, who has been challenging the way most cities and states measure their pension promises. ''If you don't want to count on the stock market to pay for all this, this is what you're going to have to contribute.''
Mr. Rauh and a number of other analysts say the states' biggest problem has been a failure to understand how much benefits will really cost. Instead of the states' models, these analysts have come up with alternatives that more closely approximate those used by insurance companies.
Unlike recalcitrant states like New Jersey and Illinois, Wisconsin has been setting aside money every year for its fund. It has also been thinking of lowering its reliance on stocks, to reduce its exposure to bear markets.
The issue is whether it has been setting aside anywhere near enough, given the magnitude of its promises to workers.
The idea that public pensions may cost more than expected angers many union officials. They say economists like Mr. Rauh are trying to frighten workers, or build resentment among taxpayers so that public pension funds will be scrapped and replaced with something less generous.
''We think there's an agenda,'' said Steve Kreisberg, research director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ''These numbers have become intensely politicized, and they're being distorted in a way that does real harm to real people.''
A spokesman for Wisconsin's governor said Mr. Walker had not factored any possible increase in pension contributions into his budget proposal or talks with the unions. ''That was never discussed,'' said the spokesman, Cullen Werwie.
An analysis being prepared for the state agency that operates Wisconsin's pension system -- and which is to be presented to the agency's board on Wednesday -- is expected to show that it has been relying on too high a figure for investment gains. If the system's trustees accept those findings, overall cash contributions will have to rise.
The actuary preparing the analysis is not tipping his hand, but any increase at this point is likely to be small. The state estimates that 12 percent of all public workers' pay will need to be set aside annually for the pension fund. Lowering investment expectations sharply, to 7 percent a year from the current 7.8 percent, could push the contribution rate up to perhaps 16 percent, meaning an additional $2,000 to $3,000 a year apiece for workers nearing retirement.
Based on the 12 percent figure, workers agreed earlier this year to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay to the pension fund, leaving their employers to pay the remaining 6.2 percent. Workers also agreed to cover a portion of their health costs. How to pay for health benefits for retirees is still being discussed.
Workers in Wisconsin point out that their payments in retirement are hardly a king's ransom. Their average annual benefit is about $26,500, and they believe they have been wrongly portrayed as greedy chiselers who game the system and walk away with six-figure pensions.
But it can be a huge burden for states and municipalities to provide even a modest, $26,000-a-year pension to hundreds of thousands of people, at least in today's economic environment, and especially if those people are able to retire well before 65 and collect that money for many years.
''When interest rates are low, these plans are really expensive to run,'' said Gordon Latter, an actuary at Voyageur Asset Management whose clients include both corporate and public pension funds.
Despite the furor in Wisconsin, collective bargaining does not appear to be the main factor driving pension costs higher.
Sylvester J. Schieber, an economist and independent consultant, recently compared public pensions in each of the 50 states, ranking them from richest to poorest. Instead of looking at dollar values, like Wisconsin's $26,500 a year, Mr. Schieber looked at what part of the average worker's paycheck his pension was designed to replace in retirement. The method eliminates regional disparities and certain other problems with benefit-cost data.
Mr. Kreisberg of the public workers union said he considered the approach fair.
Mr. Schieber said he expected to find that the most generous states were the ones with collective bargaining for public workers, but he found no correlation whatsoever. ''I was surprised at the result,'' he said. ''I had expected that the unions would be a significant force.''
Wisconsin turned out to have the eighth-richest pensions of any state, replacing on average 57 percent of a worker's pay in retirement. But the most generous state by far is Colorado -- even though it has granted collective bargaining to only a fourth of its public work force. In Wisconsin, roughly half are covered, according to Unionstats.com, a database that uses Census data to track union membership.
Colorado offers pensions that replace 90 percent of salary, with generous annual compounding that more than keeps up with the current rate of inflation. (The state has tried to reduce this compounding; retirees have sued.) Colorado's pensions are unusually rich because its public workers are not permitted to participate in Social Security -- the state pension is the only one they get.
The second-richest state is New York, which replaces 77 percent of a worker's income, even though New York's public work force earns Social Security benefits as well. A New Yorker's public pension benefit, combined with Social Security, replaces more than 100 percent of his pay, Mr. Schieber found.
That might appear to be the fruits of collective bargaining, since New York State grants that right to more of its public work force than any other state. But the third most generous state is Georgia, replacing 68 percent of a retiree's former paycheck on average. And Georgia is a right-to-work state with one of the lowest rates of collective bargaining in America, just 14 percent of its public work force.
Nonunion Georgia's public pensions are, in fact, three times as generous as those of labor-friendly Vermont, where more than half the public work force has collective bargaining. Vermont replaces just 20 percent of a retiree's previous pay, the lowest of any state.
Mr. Schieber said he was at a loss to explain these findings. He had expected rich pensions would go hand in hand with collective bargaining.
But his research, to be published in the Journal of Pension Economics and Finance, does shed light on how a seemingly modest $26,000-a-year pension can be considered unaffordably rich. One reason is low interest rates; another is that public employees can often start claiming their pensions in their 50s. Wisconsin's pension plan allows people to retire at 57 with a full pension, as long as they have 30 years of service. Police officers and firefighters can retire at 53, with 25 years of service.
In the private sector, pensions like that ''have just kind of dropped off the radar screen,'' Mr. Schieber said. At the dwindling number of companies that still grant full pensions below age 65, people seldom take them, for fear of giving up their health insurance before they qualify for Medicare. Labor statistics show a marked increase in the number of 60- to 65-year-olds still working.
Public employees have so far dodged that bullet. They can still generally retire several years younger, which means their states or municipalities must pay their benefits over a longer period. That adds up. It also means the money for their benefits has fewer years to compound, so more must be set aside years in advance.
''By the time the typical private-sector worker has retired, the teachers, the highway patrolmen and these folks have already gotten $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 in pensions,'' Mr. Schieber said. ''Plus, they're getting a pretty rich retiree health benefit. That's why these benefits are so expensive. ''

HEADLINE: MOMENTUM SHIFT AS LIBYAN REBELS FLEE AN OIL TOWN

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID; Reporting was contributed by Kareem Fahim from Benghazi, David D. Kirkpatrick from Tripoli, Alan Cowell from Paris and Steven Lee Myers from Washington.

 BODY:
RAS LANUF, Libya -- The momentum shifted decisively Thursday in an uprising that has shaken Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's four decades of rule, as rebels fled from this strategic refinery town under a sustained land, air and sea assault by government forces.
The fighting was a stark illustration of the asymmetry of the conflict, pitting protesters turned rebels against a military with far superior arms and organization and a willingness to prosecute a vicious counterattack against its own people.
Usually ebullient rebels acknowledged withdrawing Thursday, even as the fledgling opposition leadership in Benghazi scored diplomatic gains with France's recognition of it as the legitimate government and senior American officials' promise to talk with its leaders.
''We are coming,'' Colonel Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, told reporters in Tripoli. 
Western nations took new steps to isolate the Qaddafi government, but the measures stopped well short of any sort of military intervention and seemed unlikely to be able to reverse the momentum.
The cautious response underscored what is at stake in a race against time in the most chaotic and unpredictable of the uprisings to shake the Arab world -- whether the opposition can secure more international recognition and a no-flight zone to blunt Colonel Qaddafi's offensive before rebel lines crumble in the coastal oil towns west of Benghazi.
''It's tough these days,'' said Mohammed al-Houni, a 25-year-old fighter at the front. ''There is no comparison between our weapons and theirs. They're trained, they're organized. They got their training in Russia and I don't know where. We're not an army, we're the people and even if we had weapons, we wouldn't even know how to use them.''
Only days ago, rebels were boldly promising to march on Surt, Colonel Qaddafi's hometown, then on to Tripoli, where opposition leaders predicted its residents would rise up. But the week has witnessed a series of setbacks, with a punishing government assault on Zawiyah, near the capital, and a reversal of fortunes in towns near Ras Lanuf, whose refinery makes it a strategic economic prize in a country blessed with vast oil reserves.
There was a growing sense among the opposition, echoed by leaders in opposition-held Benghazi and rebels on the front, that they could not single-handedly defeat Colonel Qaddafi's forces.
''We can't prevail unless there's a no-fly zone,'' said Anis Mabrouk, a 35-year-old fighter. ''Give us the cover and we'll go all the way to Tripoli and kill him.''
That seemed unlikely, though. Even without warplanes, Colonel Qaddafi's government could still marshal far superior tanks, armor and artillery, along with the finances and organization to prosecute a counteroffensive. Given the disarray, some rebels took pride in their success in holding the lines at Ras Lanuf as long as they had. Soviet-made warplanes struck Brega, more than 100 miles from the front line on the road that resupplies the rebels, as well as several spots on the way to Ras Lanuf.
At noon, a rocket slammed into an unfinished mosque there, sending clouds of dust over dozens of worshipers and incensing fighters who condemned it as a sacrilege.
''God is greater than the bombs!'' people recalled shouting after the rocket detonated. ''God is greater than Muammar el-Qaddafi. God is greater than any criminal!''
From the minaret, the mosque's loudspeaker, unsilenced by the attack, blared the words of the cleric. ''When you side with God,'' he intoned, ''he will support you.''
At the same time, a bomb detonated just yards from the hospital, unleashing scenes of chaos. Fighters shot randomly -- and ineffectually -- into clear skies, sirens howled and two ambulances speeding from the hospital crashed into each other. Doctors and staff evacuated the hospital, leaving behind the body of a civilian who they said was shot in the head by snipers loyal to Colonel Qaddafi's forces firing from the beach.
''We only die once,'' Hweidi Trabulsi shouted, trying to rally his fellow fighters, dressed in a mishmash of berets, camouflage and track suits. But his pleas fell on deaf ears, as rebels scrambled to fall back to a makeshift checkpoint at the edge of town.
Scores of trucks fled down the coastal road, barreling past the largely deserted refinery and fighters praying on pieces of cardboard that read, ''Fresh vegetables.'' Shell casings fell off a pickup bed, as the vehicle lurched ahead. Passing it was a truck with a gun mounted in back, vainly camouflaged with a few branches of a eucalyptus tree.
''Everyone is targeted,'' said Salem Langhi, an orthopedic surgeon helping with the evacuation. ''We have no idea what they're bombing. Chaotic? Yes, this is chaos.''
In Benghazi, Abdel-Hafidh Ghoga, the deputy leader of the Libyan National Council, a kind of government in waiting, said reports of Ras Lanuf's fall were not accurate. An opposition spokesman, Essam Gheriani, said even if the reports were true, ''It's not a permanent setback.'' He contended that the attack on the city was joined by Libyan Navy ships and commercial vessels carrying artillery. The reality of Ras Lanuf's fate was more ambiguous. Even though rebels pulled back from the city, it did not appear that government forces had actually entered.
As each day passes, anger among the rebels grows at what they have described as inaction on the part of the international community and in particular, the United States.
''Obama and Qaddafi are the same!'' one fighter, Mohamed Mgaref, shouted at a medical clinic about an hour from the front, as ambulances ferried some of the four dead and dozens wounded in the fighting. More scenes of chaos unfolded there. ''Clear the way!'' volunteers shouted as ambulances swerved into the clinic's driveway. At each rumor of an airstrike, people fled for cover. ''Spread out,'' one man shouted at them.
In a rare piece of encouraging news for the opposition, France on Thursday became the first country to recognize the opposition leadership and said it would soon exchange ambassadors with the movement in Benghazi. The move put France ahead of the United States and other European powers seeking ways to support the opposition.
France's stance was viewed as a savvy gesture to show commitment to the uprisings and wave of protests in the Middle East and North Africa after President Nicolas Sarkozy admitted Paris was slow to recognize the strength of the movements in Egypt and Tunisia. It might also position France favorably in future oil deals if the opposition movement somehow manages to expel Colonel Qaddafi and take control of the country.
Libyan officials denounced the move as ''illegal and illegitimate.''
''All the options will be considered in our response,'' Khalid Kaim, the deputy foreign minister, said in a news conference in Tripoli after the decision was announced, including Libya's withdrawing recognition for France.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that at least seven journalists in Libya were unaccounted for. The most recent to vanish was Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, a correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, whose disappearance was reported Thursday.
Mr. Abdul-Ahad was last known to be on the outskirts of Zawiyah, near Tripoli, scene of some of the heaviest fighting between rebels and Colonel Qaddafi's forces.

HEADLINE: It's Not Over in Wisconsin

 BODY:
Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin have reversed half-a-century's middle-class progress in the state by erasing collective-bargaining rights for public employees. Union members, caught off guard and infuriated by the Senate vote on Wednesday and the Assembly vote on Thursday, immediately talked of legal challenges and general strikes, but the outcome was probably inevitable given the Republican success in the 2010 elections. Now union members have to make sure they do not stay away from the polls again when their rights are at stake. 
The vote, pushed by Gov. Scott Walker, would have happened weeks ago if Democratic state senators had not fled to Illinois to deprive the Senate of the supermajority it needs to pass bills that are considered fiscal matters. Republicans then moved the bargaining rights from a larger budget bill to a separate bill that they could pass by proclaiming that the rights were not a fiscal issue.
And, in doing so, they reluctantly exposed the real truth behind the maneuver: stripping the unions of their rights was never about the budget, especially once the unions had agreed to significant concessions on pensions and health care. It was always about politics. Governor Walker had hoped to hide behind a cooked-up budget crisis, but the fleeing Democrats at least succeeded in pulling away that facade.
Undermining public unions -- and the support they give to Democrats -- has been a long-sought goal of the Republican Party and many of its corporate backers. Koch Industries, one of the party's biggest supporters, spent $1.2 million last year to help elect Mr. Walker and other Republican governors who want to eliminate or reduce bargaining rights. On Wednesday, the State Senate's Republican leader, Scott Fitzgerald, told Fox News that if unions lose the battle for their rights, they would have less money to help President Obama win re-election.
Some union benefits are exorbitant, but no politician was forced to hand them out. Lawmakers are free to end this practice and should, but ending the basic rights of unions is a very different matter. It could have serious consequences for the Wisconsin Republicans who voted to do so. Recall efforts against Mr. Walker and several Republican senators are already under way. Polls in The Times and The Wall Street Journal have consistently shown large national majorities against these kinds of union-busting moves.
More broadly, the overreach by Mr. Walker and Republicans elsewhere has finally revealed their true agenda to blue-collar voters who either voted for them last year or who stayed home. These voters are not going to benefit from a crippled union movement; they live next door to the teachers and nurses and D.M.V. clerks who are about to lose what little clout they had in the state capital. Many have suffered during the recession and have watched in pain as private-sector unions have been battered to the point of ineffectiveness.
They understand the power play that took place this week. The place to exercise some power of their own is at the voting booth.

HEADLINE: Let There Be More Efficient Light

BYLINE: By ROGER A. PIELKE Jr.


HIGHLIGHT: Roger A. Pielke Jr. is a professor at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado-Boulder.

 BODY:
Boulder, Colo.
LAST week Michele Bachmann, a Republican representative from Minnesota, introduced a bill to roll back efficiency standards for light bulbs, which include a phasing out of incandescent bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient bulbs. The ''government has no business telling an individual what kind of light bulb to buy,'' she declared.
Opponents of the new standards, to be in place by 2014, draw on the odd-couple coalition of Tea Party Republicans and organized labor. They have positioned themselves as defenders of American tradition in the face of big government: another Republican representative, Joe Barton of Texas, waxed lyrically with two colleagues about ''the incandescent bulb that has been turning back the night ever since Thomas Edison ended the era of a world lit only by fire in 1879.'' 
But this opposition ignores another, more important bit of American history: the critical role that government-mandated standards have played in scientific and industrial innovation.
Republicans are right, of course, to praise inventors like Edison for their pioneering advancements at the close of the 19th century. But inventions alone weren't enough to guarantee progress.
Indeed, at the time the lack of standards for everything from weights and measures to electricity -- even the gallon, for example, had eight definitions -- threatened to overwhelm industry and consumers with a confusing array of incompatible choices.
This wasn't the case everywhere. Germany's standards agency, established in 1887, was busy setting rules for everything from the content of dyes to the process for making porcelain; other European countries soon followed suit. Higher-quality products, in turn, helped the growth in Germany's trade exceed that of the United States in the 1890s.
America finally got its act together in 1894, when Congress standardized the meaning of what are today common scientific measures, including the ohm, the volt, the watt and the henry, in line with international metrics. And, in 1901, the United States became the last major economic power to establish an agency to set technological standards.
The result was a boom in product innovation in all aspects of life during the 20th century. Today we can go to our hardware store and choose from hundreds of light bulbs that all conform to government-mandated quality and performance standards.
Technological standards not only promote innovation -- they also can help protect one country's industries from falling behind those of other countries. Today China, India and other rapidly growing nations are adopting standards that speed the deployment of new technologies. Without similar requirements to manufacture more technologically advanced products, American companies risk seeing the overseas markets for their products shrink while innovative goods from other countries flood the domestic market.
To prevent that from happening, America needs not only to continue developing standards, but also to devise a strategy to apply them consistently and quickly.
The best approach would be to borrow from Japan, whose Top Runner program sets energy-efficiency standards by identifying technological leaders in a particular industry -- say, washing machines -- and mandating that the rest of the industry keep up. As technologies improve, the standards change as well, enabling a virtuous cycle of improvement.
At the same time, the government should work with businesses to devise multidimensional standards, so that consumers don't balk at products because they sacrifice, say, brightness and cost for energy efficiency.
This is not to say that innovation doesn't bring disruption, and American policymakers can't ignore the jobs that are lost when government standards sweep older technologies into the dustbin of history.
An effective way forward on light bulbs, then, would be to apply standards only to those manufacturers that produce or import in large volume. Meanwhile, smaller, legacy light-bulb producers could remain, cushioning the blow to workers and meeting consumer demand.
Technologies and the standards that guide their deployment have revolutionized American society. They've been so successful, in fact, that the role of government has become invisible -- so much so that even members of Congress should be excused for believing the government has no business mandating your choice of light bulbs.

HEADLINE: Uneasy Lies The Fedora In a Cap World

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Will the slights and the innuendo never end?
Most minorities have someone to speak up for them when the aspersions start flying. But members of one particular group have endured indignities for years, largely in silence.
We're talking about people who wear real hats, not caps that are stuffed unceremoniously into coat pockets. Among the most put-upon are men who favor fedoras. Their numbers are said to be growing. Yet they have trouble shaking a stereotype that their preference in hats, of itself, suggests something ominous.
Hat-ism as an acceptable form of bigotry was discussed in this space years ago. It is revived now because of a new movie, ''The Adjustment Bureau.'' In it, mysterious men wearing fedoras of ''Mad Men'' vintage seem intent on tormenting Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. 
Posters for the film have been splashed across subway stations for several weeks. One shows a man with his head down. His face is shaded and barely visible. Mostly what you see is his broad-brimmed fedora. ''Your world has been adjusted,'' the tag line says menacingly. The hat is offered as proof that evil lurks.
''It isn't the first time,'' sighed Orlando Palacios. Mr. Palacios sells hats under the venerable name Worth & Worth, in a showroom above West 57th Street. ''There's always that placement of the fedora with the mob,'' he said. ''The good guy rarely wears a hat -- unless he's Dick Tracy, right?''
Right. Though we'll always have Humphrey Bogart and Indiana Jones, hat-ism keeps rearing its ugly head.
The labor leader Dennis Rivera, who says he owns five or six Borsalinos, once found himself reviled as an old-time boss, with his fedora cited as evidence of his sinister streak. A few years ago, The Washington Post tore into Jack Abramoff, the scandal-tainted lobbyist, for his black fedora. ''Dressed like a crime boss,'' The Post sniffed. ''He could not have appeared more guilty, more menacing and more unsympathetic.''
None of this sits well with Mr. Palacios. ''It's giving the hat a bad name,'' he said.
Like many a kicked-around minority, fedora wearers must put up with insults even as their numbers expand. Hats enjoyed a revival at recent men's wear shows in Paris, Milan and New York.
Linda Pagan, owner of the Hat Shop on Thompson Street, said purchases by men had steadily increased for the past four years. ''The demographic is guys in their 20s and 30s,'' Ms. Pagan said. ''They start out with the stingy-brimmed fedora.'' That would be the standard hipster look, often a hat that is more trilby than fedora. But broader brims are gaining ground.
''Now,'' Ms. Pagan said, ''we have guys branching into homburgs.'' In imitation of the homburg-wearing, Oscar-winning Colin Firth in ''The King's Speech''?
Ms. Pagan doubted it, but didn't rule out the possibility. ''It can't hurt,'' she said.
Some men seem to have finally realized that it is time to lay down the baseball cap -- in Mr. Palacios's words, ''to switch to a hat and grow up.''
Ms. Pagan said the trend was ''reinforced by the recession, because accessories do well in a recession.'' It is usually a lot cheaper to give yourself a new look with a hat than with a suit or an overcoat.
''In the mid-to-late-'90s, guys shaved their heads if they were losing their hair,'' Ms. Pagan said. ''They got bored, so they did the goatee thing. Then they did earrings, and they did tattoos. Then somebody about five, six, seven years ago realized, 'If I wear a hat, I make no commitment, long-term, to my statement.' ''
Those men can take it from a veteran wearer of fedoras that the world is still stacked against them. Few restaurants have proper storage space. Try climbing into a low-slung cab without having your lid knocked off. On an airplane, there is always someone with a humongous bag who is crushing your poor hat in the overhead bin.
And then there are negative stereotypes like those movie posters.
Which brings to mind Bernard L. Madoff. Did you see the photos of him as he was hauled into court? Or of State Senator Carl Kruger, one of two lawmakers who are the latest New York politicians charged with corruption?
On Thursday, Mr. Kruger turned himself in to the federal authorities. It remains to be determined if he is a crook. But if stereotypes are your thing, let it be noted that, like Mr. Madoff, he was most definitely bareheaded.

HEADLINE: Clean-Coal Debate Focuses on Gasification Plant

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
A bill now on Gov. Pat Quinn's desk to build a plant on the far Southeast Side that would supply Chicago customers with substitute natural gas made from Illinois coal has turned up the heat on the ''clean coal'' debate.
Proponents are billing the proposed plant, to be built by Chicago Clean Energy, as a key ingredient in the Midwest's energy future. They say it would be a model for storing carbon emissions in the ground and provide hundreds of jobs.
Opponents -- dozens of whom protested in front of the State of Illinois Building this week -- say the plant is a bad idea environmentally and economically. They have packed two recent town-hall-style meetings to object.
The emotions and rhetoric prompted by the bill in Illinois, which has an abundant supply of coal, are emblematic of the debate about technological innovation, job creation and environmental benefits at a time when the economy is weak and the benefits of so-called clean-coal technology are unproven. The proposed Chicago gasification plant and others like it will not directly replace coal as an energy source, since the proposed plant would create gas for heating and cooking -- competing with natural gas -- rather than for electricity. 
At issue is a bill passed by the state legislature in January that would require Peoples Gas and other utilities to buy gas for 30 years at a fixed rate from Chicago Clean Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the New York firm Leucadia National Corporation. Chicago Clean Energy would build the $3 billion plant, which would also use petroleum coke from oil refineries. A related bill would require utilities in Southern Illinois to buy gas from a coal-to-gas plant that would be built there.
An uncommon alliance of environmental groups, Peoples Gas and the consumer watchdog Citizens Utility Board is asking Mr. Quinn to veto the two energy bills. The environmental groups are focused on pollution issues, while the utilities and the citizens board are concerned chiefly about potential hidden costs and economic risks.
The bill intended to pave the way for the Chicago Clean Energy plant includes the company's promise that the plant would save customers at least $100 million over 30 years compared with the price of conventional natural gas. The estimate is based on December price forecasts from the Department of Energy. But only a year ago, Leucadia had used department figures to estimate $1.2 billion in savings.
Opponents have seized on the discrepancy, arguing that there is no assurance the projected savings will materialize, especially since natural gas is abundant nationwide and is currently cheap compared with other energy sources.
Hoyt Hudson, a consultant for Chicago Clean Energy who is the official spokesman for the project, said the proposed gasification plant in Chicago would produce far less emissions harmful to public health than the city's two coal-burning power plants and other local industries.
''Once we commercialize this gasification technology,'' Mr. Hudson said, ''we think it's really going to be a catalyst by which a lot of the Midwestern coal fleets could be turned into something that's 99 percent cleaner. Especially in the Midwest, coal will still be a big source of energy for the future, so I think we should use it this way.''
Opponents of the Southeast Side plant, to be built on Burley Avenue around 116th Street, between Lake Calumet and the I-90 expressway, say any additional pollution is too much in the industrial area, which is not in compliance with federal air quality standards.
''This is already such a heavily polluted area, we don't need one more source, especially when we don't even need this gas and it's just profit for a company,'' said Tom Shepherd, a leader of the Southeast Environmental Task Force.
Mr. Shepherd noted that residents were particularly concerned about dust blowing off piles of coal and coke.
The site, former home of a plant that made coke for local steel mills, is littered with rubble, crumbling structures and pieces of wind-blown coal from rail cars, as well as mounds of coal and coke at a nearby transfer facility.
State Representative Marlow H. Colvin, a Democrat who represents the area, supports the construction plan, saying the plant would largely eliminate existing contamination and create jobs.
Marty Irwin, director of the Indiana Center for Coal Technology Research at Purdue University, praised gasification as a clean technology, saying: ''This is the best way to extract the maximum amount of energy out of a pile of coal with the least amount of emissions. And in terms of the petroleum coke, you're actually doing something beneficial with the leftover of the oil-refining process instead of land-filling it somewhere.''
Peoples Gas officials said the utility was not opposed to making gas from coal or using Illinois's coal resources. But the company said it opposed the Chicago Clean Energy plant because it could make the utility vulnerable to lawsuits or pollution enforcement by government agencies.
Richard Dobson, supply manager for Peoples Gas, said the utility's pipeline network in Chicago might not be able to handle the influx of gas from the Leucadia plant safely. Peoples Gas would be blamed for any leak, or if nearby residents were subjected to strong odor from a chemical added to the gas to make it detectable, Mr. Dobson said.
Mr. Hudson said the plant would probably pipe gas outside the city limits to large interstate pipelines that connect with the Peoples Gas's system. That approach would help avoid odor and safety concerns, he said.
The pending legislation would require the company to put $150 million aside to compensate consumers if the project lost money and rates rose. The fund would have to be replenished by the sale of byproducts from gasification, like argon and pure sulfur.
Critics say even those safeguards will not work. The law has no enforcement mechanism if the company depleted the compensation fund and failed to save customers money.
Opponents also doubt Leucadia's contention that it would capture and sequester --store underground -- most of the plant's carbon dioxide emissions, the main culprit in global warming. There are no commercial-scale sequestration sites in the Midwest.
Mr. Hudson said the company had identified a potential sequestration site with the right geology about 90 miles south of Chicago. Alternatives, he said, include piping the carbon dioxide to a proposed site connected to the long-delayed FutureGen coal plant in central Illinois or converting the gas into liquid that could be used to help extract the last deposits from mostly depleted oil wells.
The legislation would require the Leucadia plant to capture at least 85 percent of its carbon emissions or face fines of up to $20 million a year.
Mr. Hudson noted that the bill required the state attorney general to take action against the plant if it failed to sequester carbon, ''so we can't just pay the fine and get out of it.''
If Mr. Quinn signs the measure into law, various environmental permits would still be needed before the plant could go forward.
Environmentalists look to history when they warn about the long-term consequences of turning coal into gas. From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, gas plants throughout Chicago and other cities baked coal to produce gas, creating toxic coal tar that remains buried in 28 sites citywide. It took five years and $50 million to clean up coal tar in Barrie Park in Oak Park, where residents said it had caused cancers. Peoples Gas is bound by agreements with the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois E.P.A. to study those sites and clean them up.
The technology for the proposed Southeast Side plant would not create coal tar, but opponents say the toxic legacy of the old gas plants should still give officials pause.
''Moving with a fair degree of lackadaisical happiness into an entirely new way of exploiting coal should be looked at in terms of the things we learned from previous practices,'' said Henry Henderson, Midwest director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''We can't go stepping into these new activities blithely assuming the benefits will emerge and problems will be taken care of.''

HEADLINE: Natural Gas, Scrutinized, Pushes for Growth

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
KENEDY -- At a packed meeting here one evening last week, natural gas industry boosters told long tables of ranchers and townspeople about anticipated jobs and economic opportunities. Outside, along lonely country roads near town, lights from drilling equipment glittered in the dark night.
Kenedy sits in the heart of the Eagle Ford Shale, one of the largest and most recently discovered oil and gas fields in the state. The first gas well was drilled just three years ago, and the yields of Eagle Ford are part of the reason production of natural gas in Texas -- the leading gas-drilling state -- is projected to keep rising. 
''Really, the future for the commodity has never been brighter,'' said David Blackmon, the chairman of the Texas state committee for America's Natural Gas Alliance, which organized the Kenedy meeting. Already Texas produces close to one-third of the natural gas in the country, and Mr. Blackmon's organization is eyeing ways to increase utilization of the fuel, in power generation and in fleet vehicles.
Yet the state's renewed commitment to gas comes at a time of sharply increased scrutiny for the gas industry. Gas burns more cleanly than coal, its chief rival in electricity generation. Gas prices have also been low in the past few years, which is good for the power and home-heating sectors and manufacturers like fertilizer plants that also use it.
But the recent surge in drilling, including the expansion of a method called hydraulic fracturing that involves shattering rock thousands of feet underground with a combination of water, sand and chemicals, has prompted lawsuits and complaints by some homeowners in Texas and in other parts of the country about contamination of aquifers, as well as concerns about the sheer volume of water needed to operate a well. The industry denies that hydraulic fracturing, by itself, can contaminate aquifers. But worries about air pollution from drilling operations have also stirred anger in the Barnett Shale around Fort Worth, the earliest of three major Texas shale formations to be drilled (the third formation is the Haynesville Shale, in eastern Texas stretching into Louisiana).
In Texas, these concerns have led lawmakers, particularly those from the Barnett Shale region, to file a number of bills to increase oversight of the industry, spanning issues from well emissions to the safety of gas pipelines.
With the state facing a $15 billion to $27 billion budget gap, gas industry executives are also wary of attempts to end a 22-year-old tax break for high-cost natural gas drilling, which includes hydraulic fracturing. Representative Lon Burnam, Democrat of Fort Worth, just introduced legislation to do so, which would bring in $2.3 billion for the state over the next two years. The tax break was intended to jump-start the industry, Mr. Burnam said, and ''we don't need it anymore.''
But Mr. Blackmon, of the natural gas group, said that it would drive some planned investment out of state, adding that the industry already pays billions in taxes on the state and local levels.
A century ago, in the early days of the Texas oil boom, natural gas was considered a waste product and flared or vented off. But after a giant gas field was found in the Panhandle in 1918, Texans began using the fuel to manufacture carbon black, which is used to make car tires. Eventually, Americans began using gas to heat their homes and, later, to fire power plants.
Texas natural gas production rose steadily until it peaked in 1972, the year before the oil embargo. Since 2005, the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing has caused Texas gas production to begin to climb again, though production is still well below 1972 levels.
Today, Texas uses most of its gas in state, according to Mr. Blackmon, who said that Texas consumes about 25 percent of the nation's gas. About one-third of Texas homes are heated with natural gas or propane, and the Texas grid gets 38 percent of its electricity from natural gas (more than the 23 percent national average). However, the share of gas has declined slightly in recent years largely because of rapid spread of wind farms in West and South Texas. Because gas plants are easier to turn off and on than coal and nuclear plants, wind has eaten into their share -- something Mr. Blackmon said he was concerned about.
Gas's share of Texas electricity production is becoming a political issue. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst recently said he would prefer that old coal plants be replaced with natural gas over the long run. However, energy experts say this would be expensive and difficult to achieve in a deregulated market, where power plants essentially control their own fate.
Meanwhile the drilling will continue, even though prices for natural gas are lingering at one-third of their highs of three years ago (the turmoil in the Middle East has so far had little impact on gas because it is domestically produced). But the controversies over drilling's impact on water and air pollution seem poised to intensify, as drillers reach new areas in the Eagle Ford Shale.
Jen Powis, the Sierra Club's senior representative in the Texas region, said, ''These big three shale plays are presenting a huge problem'' for local communities, in terms of air emissions and water damage. She added that Texas regulators have been too lax in cracking down on air and water pollution, and that Texas' problems are ''sort of going unnoticed,'' in contrast to the loudly aired pollution concerns in other drilling states like Pennsylvania.
One major Texas case in which the federal Environmental Protection Agency accused a driller, Range Resources, of contaminating two water wells in Parker County, remains embroiled in litigation. Texas Railroad Commission examiners, conducting their own investigation, recently recommended that the commission clear Range of harming the wells.
Attendees at last week's meeting in Kenedy emerged with varying views on gas.
''I think it's a clean fuel, and I'd rather see it than the coal,'' said Ed Wollny, a retired transportation-industry worker in Wilson County.
But Sharon Owens, who has a cattle ranch in Wilson County, said: ''I don't think people are thinking. Would you rather be able to drink water or would you rather have gas?''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Places Its Bet On a General in Egypt

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chief of staff of the Egyptian armed forces, Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, had just finished breakfast at the Ritz-Carlton in Pentagon City with two old American friends -- one a former head of Central Command, the other a top defense official -- when he got a call that the Egyptian Army was going into the streets of Cairo to manage the revolution.
Within hours on that late January day, General Enan was on a plane home -- after telling Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he would have to skip their dinner the following week.
Today General Enan, a favorite of the American military, is the second in command among the group of generals moving toward some form of democracy in Egypt. In meetings of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, he sits to the right of its leader, the 75-year-old defense minister, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, and is considered his potential successor. In the meantime, American officials say, General Enan, 63, has become a crucial link for the United States as it navigates the rocky course ahead with Cairo. 
If he is not yet the Pentagon's man in Egypt, many hope he will be.
''He's a sharp guy,'' said Adm. William J. Fallon, the retired head of the United States Central Command, who oversaw American military operations in the Middle East, including Egypt. ''He's thoughtful, astute and competent professionally. And I believe he will try to do the right thing.'' Admiral Fallon, along with Mary Beth Long, a former high-ranking Pentagon official, was among those at the January breakfast.
The central question about General Enan and the military rulers of Egypt is whether they will, in fact, ''do the right thing'' and move as they have promised toward the democratic election of a new president, scheduled for August.
General Enan and the military government have been in power since a youth movement toppled President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11, but their reforms have so far been mostly cosmetic. Protesters continue to demand change even as the military on Friday appointed a new prime minister acceptable to the demonstrators.
Pentagon officials remain in daily contact with the new military rulers, who are described as overwhelmed and alarmed that no potential candidate for president, including Amr Moussa, the departing secretary general of the Arab League, has the ability, at least in their view, to unite the country.
Some experts on the Egyptian military have suggested that General Enan could be a candidate, a proposal swiftly dismissed by Pentagon officials and the Egyptian military. ''The Supreme Council will not field a candidate from one of their own,'' an Egyptian military official said in a rare interview on Friday in Washington. The official requested anonymity under ground rules imposed by the Egyptian government.
No one disputes, though, that General Enan will play a central role in Egypt's future government, more likely from behind the scenes, where the country's powerful and traditionally secretive armed forces are still most comfortable. There, out of sight of most Egyptians, they run national security policy and operate lucrative businesses as part of a parallel ''Military Inc.'' economy that produces electronics, household appliances, clothing and food.
In contrast to Field Marshal Tantawi, a government loyalist whom junior military officers referred to as ''Mubarak's poodle'' -- and who is seen by the United States as mired in Military Inc. and resistant to economic reform -- General Enan is considered more of a traditional military man focused on Army operations and modernization. Like other Egyptian officers of his generation, he has studied in Russia, and has taken courses in France. He drinks occasionally, according to two Egyptians close to the military, and speaks some English and a little French.
He was born in Mansoura in the Nile Delta in northern Egypt and came up through the military's Air Defense branch, where he commanded battalions responsible for launching Egypt's missiles. Unlike a younger generation of Egyptian officers, he has not studied or trained in the United States, the Egyptian military official said.
At the Pentagon, General Enan is known as self-effacing, deferential, humorous and conservative. He also is said to have a fondness for American consumer goods.
During his trips to Washington, officials always scheduled a day of shopping for him and his wife, as they did for other Egyptian officers, at the Tysons Corner mall in suburban Virginia, where the Egyptians liked to buy electronics, jeans and other clothing. The couple has three children.
The trips, yearly exchanges between the Egyptian and American armed forces, alternated between Washington and Cairo and were meant as centerpieces of a close 30-year relationship between the countries' militaries.
The visits focused largely on the annual $1.3 billion in military aid that the United States gives Egypt and what type of American-made arms and equipment -- typically F-16 fighter jets and M1A1 Abrams tanks -- that the Egyptians wanted to buy with the money. (Since the 1978 Camp David accords, the United States has given Egypt $35 billion in military aid, making it the largest recipient of conventional American military and economic aid after Israel.)
General Enan led the delegations of some two dozen senior Egyptian military officers to Washington in odd-numbered years, and was here for the 2011 meetings when his trip was cut short by the crisis at home. United States military officers who were part of previous meetings describe them as a steady diet of formal lunches and dinners at Washington's best restaurants, with the Egyptians put up by the United States military at the Ritz-Carlton, near the Pentagon.
Despite the meetings' pleasant surroundings, tension often lurked below the surface because of what United States officers described as the Egyptians' unrealistic shopping list of the most technologically advanced American weapons, which the Pentagon intended to keep for itself.
''What I always tried to get them to do,'' said James Beatty, a retired Navy commander and the former Navy Sea Forces chief in Cairo, ''was tell me in the year 2020 what you want your military to look like, so we have a gradual, phased buy of using your money in an intelligent way instead of coming up every year with a new list.'' In the end, he said, ''they always felt like, 'You're having these meetings, you're telling us how important we are, but you're not giving us the stuff we want.' ''
On those same trips, General Enan was flown for visits to the Central Command headquarters in Tampa or to a Coast Guard base in Miami, or taken to meet with an emergency response team in Fairfax, Va.
These days, he remains in close contact with Pentagon officials by phone, including Admiral Mullen; the two spoke most recently on Thursday. A United States military official would not provide specifics about the call other than to say that General Enan and the military rulers had ''no illusions about the difficult job they face.''
On Friday, the Egyptian military official cautioned that much confusion remained in Cairo and that no assumptions should be made in Washington about General Enan. The official said that the previous armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Hamdy Wheba, did not become defense minister but was appointed head of the Arab Organization for Industrialization, the military's main commercial industry.
After the elections, the military official promised, ''we will go back to our bases and do our normal jobs.''

HEADLINE: Hotel Campaigns Promote Savings and Memories

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHEN Conrad N. Hilton -- the real one, not the character on ''Mad Men'' -- published his autobiography in 1958, he titled it ''Be My Guest.'' Years later, lodging chains bearing his and other names are still striving to figure out the best ways to reach potential customers.
On the positive side of the guest register, social media like Facebook and Twitter enable hotels, motels and resorts to forge closer ties with consumers. On the other side, economic uncertainties threaten to upset the extensive -- and costly -- plans of marketers for the important spring and summer travel seasons. 
''The consumer mindset is very value-focused,'' said Carla Raynor, the Memphis-based vice president for global marketing for two chains owned by Hilton Worldwide, Homewood Suites and Home2 Suites.
And as the price of oil increases, affecting what travelers pay for gasoline and airline tickets, ''where they'll likely look to save is in accommodations,'' she added.
That may actually be ''an advantage for us,'' Ms. Raynor said, because the Hilton properties like Homewood Suites, which specialize in extended stays, ''are already value-oriented.''
Hilton is introducing a campaign for Homewood Suites that plays up that benefit. The campaign, by DraftFCB in Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, asks, ''Why settle for a fishbowl when you can have more?''
The campaign, with a budget estimated at $10 million, describes how Homewood's ''roomy suites'' come with ''fully equipped kitchens'' and include ''full hot breakfast and evening dinner and drinks.''
Whether ''you're a business or leisure traveler, it's an opportunity to save money,'' said Jason VanDenBrook, vice president and account director at DraftFCB.
Another Hilton offering, Embassy Suites Hotels, introduced a campaign this week that also concentrates on value. With the theme ''More reasons to stay,'' it promotes amenities like ''more room, complimentary drinks'' and ''free breakfast.''
The Embassy Suites ads are created by the Atlanta office of BBDO North America, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
Another way lodging chains are trying to forge stronger bonds with would-be guests is to dial up the emotional aspects of marketing initiatives.
For instance, an effort from Renaissance Hotels, part of Marriott International, is intended to help guests get more from their stays by providing more useful information about distinctive local attractions like sights, restaurants, bars and stores.
''Travelers are seeking to bring back experiences and memories,'' said Dan Vinh, vice president for marketing at Renaissance in Bethesda, Md., which is recasting its concierges as ''navigators,'' a change that is underlined by a microsite, renaissancenavigator.com, in both online and mobile versions.
''Consider it the concierge program souped up,'' Mr. Vinh said, adding that it would provide ''huge value for our guests'' at a time when costs are still a concern for many travelers.
''And it's also available to anyone locally'' in the cities where the 148 Renaissance hotels are located, Mr. Vinh said, ''so even if you're not traveling, you can go to our site and see what we're recommending.''
The microsite was created by McGarryBowen in New York, part of Dentsu, the digital agency for Renaissance, using an infrastructure provided by Wcities in San Francisco. A related application for the iPad and iPhone was created by TourSpot in New York.
Renaissance plans to promote the navigators through a public relations campaign, by Alison Brod Public Relations in New York, and methods like including the Web address in e-mails sent to confirm reservations.
The idea of accumulating memories through travel is also at the core of a campaign for the Hilton HHonors loyalty program, which is to begin in the United States next week.
The theme of the campaign, described as the first for the HHonors brand, is ''A world of experiences worth sharing.'' The budget is estimated at more than $25 million.
''There's a huge sea of sameness in loyalty programs,'' said Paul Brown, president for global brands and commercial services at Hilton Worldwide in McLean, Va. ''If you talk to customers on features and functionality, it's hard to break through the clutter.''
The idea the campaign conveys is ''to reward yourself, your loved ones, your significant others, your friends, for all the business travel you've done in a year,'' Mr. Brown said, and ''for all the loyalty you show us, we'll show you some great experiences you can enjoy with them.''
The HHonors campaign is created by Publicis Worldwide in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe.
''The goal is to differentiate it from other reward, point-gathering programs,'' said Joe McCarthy, chief executive at Publicis New York, by ''making it more human.''
''For a lot of us business travelers, it's not that glamorous; we sacrifice,'' he added. ''So wouldn't it be nice if due to the requirements of business, you could get an experience with the people you care the most about, your wife and kids, your friends, your partner?''
That sentiment is expressed in print ads with text like this: ''Hilton HHonors transforms your points into memories you can't help but share.''
Peter Moore Smith, executive creative director at Publicis New York, used industry terms to describe how the campaign is about ''the burn'' -- the use of points that loyalty members accumulate -- rather than ''the earn,'' how the points can be accumulated.
When the agency pitched the HHonors assignment, Mr. Smith said, ''one of the first things we did was to go back to what Conrad Hilton wrote,'' including ''Be My Guest.''
''I spent a lot of time with that book,'' Mr. Smith said, adding: ''He was a bold person who had a vision. He took big risks, and they usually paid off for him -- or so he said in his book.''

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Curbs Public Unions, But Democrats Predict Backlash

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and A. G. SULZBERGER; Emma G. Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago, and Steven Greenhouse and Timothy Williams from New York.

 BODY:
MADISON, Wis. -- After nearly a month of angry demonstrations and procedural maneuvering in the State Capitol here, Gov. Scott Walker won his battle on Thursday to cut bargaining rights for most government workers in Wisconsin.
But his victory, after the State Assembly passed the bill, also carries risks for the state's Republicans who swept into power last November.
Democratic-leaning voters appeared energized by the battle over collective bargaining on a national stage. The fight has already spurred a list of potential recall elections for state lawmakers this spring. Protesters are planning more large demonstrations this weekend.
''From a policy perspective, this is terrible,'' said Mike Tate, the leader of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. 
''But from a political perspective, he could not have handed us a bigger gift,'' Mr. Tate said of the governor.
In the last 24 hours, he added, the state party had received $360,000 in contributions and volunteers have streamed into offices where signatures were being collected for recall bids.
The Republican-dominated Assembly voted mainly along party lines, 53 to 42 in favor of the bill, during a tense and bitter proceeding punctuated by shouts of ''No!'' from angry lawmakers, cries of ''Shame, shame!'' from protesters in the gallery, and chants from thousands outside the locked-down chamber.
The vote had been delayed after law enforcement completely closed the Capitol for a time, when protesters filled a section near the Assembly hall and refused to leave. Some demonstrators were carried out.
Some lawmakers were locked out, and the police ignored their pleas to let them in so they could vote. They resorted to climbing in through first-floor windows.
The tenor of the debate took an angrier edge this week because of the legislative brinkmanship that helped get the bill passed.
Republicans complained that Senate Democrats had brought state business to a halt for nearly three weeks by fleeing the state and preventing a quorum.
The Democrats fumed that the Republicans had ended the episode in less than a day, with the Democrats still out of town, by forcing a rewritten bill that needed no quorum through the Senate on Wednesday night and the Assembly on Thursday. Though the outcome of the vote was all but certain, each side made its case one more time in the final hours of debate.
On the floor of the Assembly, Jeff Fitzgerald, the Republican speaker, said the state's finances were on a ''crash course'' if collective bargaining remained the status quo. ''We ran on this,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''We were going to get the fiscal place in order. This is the first piece of the puzzle. We're broke.''
Democrats, who noted that public-sector union leaders had already agreed to pay more for their pensions and health care costs, argued that slashing collective bargaining rights was no budget-saving measure, but a way to break unions in a state with deep labor roots.
Peter Barca, the Democrats' Assembly leader, railed against the Republicans' tactics. ''Our democracy is out of control in Wisconsin,'' Mr. Barca said. ''And you all know it -- you can feel it.''
Political analysts said they would watch for the fallout of the Wisconsin vote, and whether it would affect similar battles now playing out over collective bargaining issues in statehouses elsewhere, including Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Indiana.
Republicans here, including Governor Walker, contend that Wisconsin residents were seeking change in the election last fall -- when the state made one of the starkest flips in the nation from blue to red -- and that this was just the sort of bold move they would ultimately embrace.
Mark Jefferson, the executive director of the state Republican Party, said he felt Democrats had been particularly loud in their protests to send a warning shot to the other states considering such measures.
But Democrats say the collective bargaining fight may lead to a political shakeup in the Capitol, where more than a dozen senators, Republicans and Democrats, are now the subjects of heated recall efforts. That in turn could shift political equations, since Wisconsin has long been a presidential battleground, for the 2012 election.
''The voters absolutely sent a message that they wanted fiscal conservatism,'' said Michael B. Wittenwyler, a lawyer who once served as a campaign strategist for Democrats like Russ Feingold, the senator who lost his seat last fall. ''Now they learned what that really means and I think they're saying, 'Hmmm, maybe that's not what we really want.' ''
Others, though, wondered whether the protests might fade.
''If things go back to normal and Wisconsin continues to improve economically, balances its budgets, bring jobs, there probably won't be a lot of pain for Republicans down the road,'' said Bill McCoshen, a lobbyist who used to be a campaign manager for Republicans like Tommy Thompson, the former governor, and is a supporter of Governor Walker. ''I think things will get back to normal for the average Wisconsin citizen, but it's going to take some time, though, before government employees get over this,'' he added.
For the moment, the wounds remained raw and personal in a Capitol where politics have long been more polite than intensely partisan.
A number of legislators told law enforcement authorities that they had received death threats, an Assembly spokesman said. And Democrats in the Assembly tried, briefly, to have Mr. Fitzgerald removed as speaker for what they said was his ''incredibly impaired'' judgment.
Democrats said they planned to seek legal recourse for what they viewed as violations of the state's open meetings rules. Republicans had announced a meeting to present their rewritten bill (the one that would not require a quorum) less than two hours before the meeting took place on Wednesday evening.
Democrats said 24 hours was required, except in cases of emergencies. But Republicans said that amount of time was not needed during special legislative sessions and that they needed to provide only enough time to, say, post a scheduled meeting on a legislative bulletin board.
At least some of the Senate Democrats -- who have been gone from Wisconsin since Feb. 17 and have become known to some here, admiringly, as the ''Wisconsin 14'' -- refused to even return to the state on Thursday.
Senators like Fred Risser, who was first elected to the Legislature in 1956, said he was concerned that the Republicans might have some other legislative trick in mind if the Democrats came back to the Capitol right away. ''Why would I trust them now?'' Mr. Risser asked.
Outside the Capitol Building itself, though, many teachers, state workers and others were taking stock of what the entire episode would now mean for their lives.
The bill, which Mr. Walker said he would sign soon, significantly alters most public-sector union rules, limiting bargaining to matters of wages and limiting raises to changes in the Consumer Price Index unless the public approves higher raises in a referendum.
It ends the state's collection of union dues from paychecks, and requires most unions to hold votes annually to determine whether most workers still wish to be members. Firefighters and law enforcement personnel will be exempt from those changes.
As the sun set, a crowd again gathered for yet another rally.
Peggy Coyne, a middle school teacher, predicted more big crowds, more rallies, more protest. ''We'll keep our presence known here,'' she said. ''I think they felt there would be a little fuss and we'd go away. But this continues to get bigger and bigger.''

HEADLINE: Hispanics Are Surging In Arizona

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- In Arizona, fervor against illegal immigration is so intense that politicians have pushed some of the nation's toughest laws and citizen activists have patrolled the border themselves. But census data released Thursday show another side of the population story: Arizonans are increasingly becoming Hispanic. 
Still, the increase in Hispanics, to just under 30 percent of the population last year from 25 percent in 2000, has been slower than some studies predicted. Tough economic times coupled with restrictions on illegal immigrant workers are probably responsible for driving many Hispanics away, analysts say.
''The Hispanic population has gone up, but it didn't go up as much as people thought,'' said Tom Rex, associate director of the Center for Competitiveness and Prosperity Research at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. ''Or maybe it did go up and then dropped when those who got here couldn't find jobs.''
Over all, Arizona's population has boomed to 6.4 million from 5.1 million over the last decade, at a rate second only to Nevada's, and much of the growth is a result of a 46 percent increase in the Hispanic population, said Bill Schooling, the state demographer.
Significant increases in Hispanics were reported across the state: in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where the bulk of the state's residents live, as well as in the border counties of Yuma, Pima and Santa Cruz and in remote northwestern Mohave County, bordering California and Nevada, where the Hispanic population grew 72 percent.
The most popular names in the state reflect the diversity: Isabella, Sophia, Emma and Olivia are the most popular girls' names in Arizona while Jacob, Anthony, Daniel, Alexander and Angel top the boy's list.
''Without a doubt, wherever you turn, there are Latin people,'' said Luis Lim, a political columnist for Prensa Hispana, the state's largest Spanish-language publication.
The popular image of Arizona as a state of white retirees has always been a caricature, experts say. ''We're not an old, white person's state,'' Mr. Rex said. ''Our age distribution is not all that different from the national average. It's quite a mixed state, despite the legislation that is passed here.''
There may be demographic reasons for the conservative politics as well. Despite the size of the Hispanic population, nearly 40 percent of it is under age 18 and an untold number of others are not legally able to vote, meaning the numbers do not translate into political clout.
On top of that, Latino community activists here suspect that there was probably a significant undercount of the state's Hispanic population, with many not participating to make a political point.
''They did not want to participate because they did not want the additional money that the state could get to be utilized by law enforcement and the persecution of people that are brown,'' said Salvador Reza, a community activist.

HEADLINE: As Web Flourishes, Gay Groups Watch Enrollments Dwindle

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
The lobby of San Francisco's stylish Parc 55 Hotel was packed with bears. Not beasts from the forest, but large, hirsute gay men in jeans and hoodies.
The men gathered for the International Bear Rendezvous last month, lounging on red Barcelona chairs and hugging near the elevators. Over the last 17 years, the event has attracted thousands of grizzly men and their admirers from around the world.
But this year's festivities marked a bittersweet finale -- the bear event is now extinct. 
''I'm sad,'' said Darwin Bebo, an event organizer for the past nine years, noting a lack of volunteers and a decline in registrations -- to 550 this year from nearly 1,000 in 2006. ''They're already talking online, so they don't need a club.''
Mr. Bebo blamed the Internet. As online social networks have surged in popularity with gay men and lesbians, many social groups have been in decline.
The tug of war between the virtual and physical worlds is happening in every strata of society, but in the gay community the shift has been especially poignant and with significant implications. Social groups helped start the gay civil rights movement, and in recent decades they have raised millions of dollars for causes like same-sex marriage and the battle against H.I.V./AIDS.
This has left some wondering, as social groups wane, who or what will pick up the rainbow flag.
The Men's Associated Exchange, a club of professional gay men, disbanded in 2009 after 21 years and a membership that had once reached about 1,000. A final statement on the group's Web site read, ''As the Internet grew and provided other avenues for socializing, it was time to give in to the new social networking that had become so popular.''
Last month another social group, the Academy of Friends, scaled back its annual Oscar Night fund-raiser, which had once attracted an upscale crowd of 2,500. This year's event was moved to a smaller venue with 1,500 attendees.
''It has been very challenging for us,'' said Jon Finck, an Academy of Friends board member. In the last 31 years the group has raised more than $8.5 million for H.I.V./AIDS charities, but the downsizing of Oscar Night meant less money for those groups. ''It has made those payments not as robust as we would like,'' Mr. Finck said.
The recession played a role (tickets for the Oscar event start at $250), but Alan Keith, the group's chairman, said that in recent years the group has also struggled to attract new participants, especially younger ones: The board of directors has dropped to 19 members from 29, with only 2 under 30 years old.
Mr. Keith said many gay and lesbian groups were currently reassessing, asking, ''What are the needs of our community?''
The roots of many gay and lesbian social groups date to when homosexuality was a crime and gatherings were illegal.
''Social groups and networks founded the G.L.B.T. community as early as the 1950s,'' said Paul Boneberg, executive director of the GLBT Historical Society. ''It represented an ability to find each other.''
''Their newsletters were the first gay publications,'' Mr. Boneberg added, citing groups like the Daughters of Bilitis, founded in San Francisco in 1955.
New technologies have usurped that role, sometimes serving remarkably narrow niches. The bear community, for example, has Scruff, an iPhone application that instantly locates others nearby, using GPS. There is also the new Web-based start-up Bearbook, which works like Facebook except that a membership fee allows bears to see each other, uh, bare.
''You see a lot of proving grounds disappear with the advent of the Internet,'' said Don Romesburg, assistant professor of women's and gender studies at Sonoma State University. In addition to social groups, Dr. Romesburg said, gay bars and neighborhoods across the nation have also diminished.
But Dr. Romesburg warned against judging the trend as generational, noting that as a gay man, ''people my age -- I'm 40 -- are opting out of these too.'' Additionally, he said, more welcoming attitudes toward gay men and lesbians had reduced the need for cliques.
But struggles involving same-sex marriage, discrimination and AIDS continue. The bears raised more than $600,000 over the years for those causes, and it is unclear what will replace their effort.
Mr. Boneberg said he thought such efforts would continue, just ''in a different way.''
''I don't see the transition as a weakening of the community,'' he said.After all, people might be meeting these days in the cloud, but they do eventually come back down to earth.

HEADLINE: Disappointing Economic Reports Push Shares Down Across Globe

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Worries about oil supply and downbeat economic reports from three continents sent stocks worldwide sharply lower on Thursday, providing a reminder of the fragile nature of the global recovery.
Shares were down almost 2 percent on Wall Street, after markets in Asia and Europe fell amid continued turmoil in oil-producing Arab countries.
Oil prices were down $1.68, to $102.70, well below their recent highs on Monday. But the markets remained volatile as The Associated Press reported that Saudi forces had opened fire on protesters. In addition, violence escalated in Libya, where rebel fighters fled Ras Lanuf, the strategic refinery town, under ferocious rocket attacks and airstrikes by forces loyal to the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. 
Though the Energy Information Administration reported this week that crude inventories in the United States rose 2.52 million barrels, traders seemed concerned about possible disruptions in supply.
In addition, traders were assessing the latest trade reports from China and the United States -- each country reported a deficit, although seasonal distortions could have influenced the figures. A downgrade of Spain's debt rating also weighed on investors. Moody'sreduced Spain's debt rating by one notch, to Aa2 from Aa1, with a negative outlook. Moody's cited worries about the cost of the banking sector's restructuring, the government's ability to achieve its goals for reduced borrowing and Spain's grim growth prospects.
Chad Cunningham, the chief investment officer of IronHorse Capital Management, said that the move had reintroduced the problems plaguing weaker European economies to a market recently distracted by the Mideast unrest.
''The Spanish downgrade was important,'' said Mr. Cunningham. ''That brought everybody's focus back'' to the situation in the euro zone.
An increase in jobless filings in the United States was a surprise as well. The Labor Department said that applications for jobless benefits rose last week by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 397,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose to 392,250.
While Mr. Cunningham and other analysts concede that one set of numbers is not a trend, it can be taken as a warning that steers the market into a correction.
''Technically the market has been in nosebleed territory,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''And the aforementioned news gave people an excuse to sell first and ask questions later.''
Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist of Key Private Bank, said the market was probably undergoing a correction in which the Spain downgrade acted as the ''final nail in the coffin'' after the economic data showed the potential for reduced growth.
''It has been a long time that we have corrected back, and the downgrade of Spanish debt is reminding investors that sovereign debt problems have not been solved,'' Mr. McCain said.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 228.48 points, or 1.87 percent, to 11,984.61. The Dow closed below 12,000 for the first time since Jan. 31, though it is still up 3.52 percent since the beginning of the year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 24.91 points, or 1.89 percent, to 1,295.11. The Nasdaq composite index fell 50.70 points, or 1.84 percent, to 2,701.02.
The FTSE in London settled 1.55 percent lower. The DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.96 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris declined 0.75 percent.
Investors fled to the safety of bonds. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 30/32, to 102 7/32, pushing the yield down to 3.36 percent, from 3.49 percent late Wednesday. The dollar strengthened against the euro.
''What we are seeing is a renewed rush to Treasuries and better dollar strength,'' said Alan Gayle, a senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management.
The news that AOL would cut staff contributed to the negative sentiment, he added. AOL announced that it would lay off about 900 people -- about 200 in the United States and 700 in India. AOL shares closed at $19, down 1.76 percent.
Technology, materials, industrial and financial shares were down 2 percent or more and energy shares dropped about 3.6 percent.
Meanwhile, China and the United States reported trade deficits in the latest data released on Thursday.
The United States trade deficit increased in January as imports of industrial and automobile goods expanded, and American exports to China shrank.
The Commerce Department said the trade gap was $46.3 billion in January, compared with a $40.3 billion gap in December, a figure that was revised down slightly. Economists had forecast a deficit of $41.5 billion.
Imports increased by $10.5 billion in the month, to $214.1 billion, reflecting a rise in industrial supplies and materials, automotive parts, vehicles and engines and capital goods.
At the same time, exports expanded in January by $4.4 billion, to $167.7 billion, mostly in the industrial and automotive sectors. Service exports also increased.
Trade with China again dominated the report as the $23.3 billion deficit with China continued to be the largest of any with the United States. The goods deficit with China increased as American exports to China fell by $2 billion, to $8.1 billion, and imports rose to $31.4 billion in January.
Steven Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said American exports could have been affected by seasonal factors, like winter weather, making it difficult for goods to reach ports.
''The unusual thing about the January number was that it was not an oil-driven increase,'' Mr. Blitz said. But as shipping bottlenecks start to move through, he said, ''we should see a nice pick-up in exports in February.''
China reported a $7.3 billion monthly trade deficit in February, its largest in seven years, after imports climbed sharply but exports lagged. Analysts said the figures Thursday had most likely been distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday, because many exporters had to ship in January.
Asian markets led the way lower on Thursday. The Nikkei 225 closed down 1.46 percent, to 10,434.38, while the Shanghai composite index fell 1.5 percent, to 2,957.14.

HEADLINE: Citi Signs Deal as U.S. Olympic Team Sponsor

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting

 BODY:
Citi said Thursday that it had signed a deal to sponsor the United States Olympic Committee.
The two-year agreement makes Citi the official bank of the 2012 United States Olympic team that will compete in London and the United States Paralympic teams. The sponsorship is worth $30 million, according to the Sports Business Daily, and includes NBC, which will broadcast the Olympics in 2012. 
The three-way sponsorship allows Citi to better integrate its marketing campaigns with the Olympic committee and NBC. The cooperation is notable because it suggests that NBC and the committee repaired their sometimes fractured relationship.
''Having a partner that's committed to advertising this early on will only help us promote the athletes,'' the U.S.O.C. spokesman Patrick Sandusky said.
Citi is the Olympic committee's first banking sponsor since Bank of America, whose deal expired in 2008. Financial services companies, and particularly banks like Citi that received government assistance during the recession, came under scrutiny from some members of Congress. Spending on sports by banks, brokerages and other financial companies fell as a result, hurting golf and tennis associations, and other sports leagues.
Since then, the federal government has recouped the $45 billion it lent Citi, and it generated an estimated $12 billion profit from the sale of its shares in the bank sold last year.
''Sponsoring the team is a great way to express our gratitude to the American people for their support, not just over the last three years, but our 200-year history,'' said Ed Skyler, executive vice president for global public affairs at Citi, a role that includes corporate sponsorships. ''Comebacks happen in business just like they do in sports.''
Citi can renew the deal, but not necessarily in this format.
ONLINE TICKET SALE FOR 2012 GAMES United States residents can buy tickets for the 2012 London Olympics through the United States Olympic Committee beginning Tuesday.
More than 58,000 tickets will be made available through an online process that runs through April 22. The committee said more than half the tickets offered during the initial phase would be priced at less than $150.
A second phase is scheduled to begin in June. (AP)

HEADLINE: College Today: More Fun, Less Rigor?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert delivered a wake-up call to parents, educators and students in his March 5 column, ''College the Easy Way.''
Too many college students waste opportunities denied others who can't afford to attend. A woman working her way through college recently told me that ''a lot of people there are coasting, uninterested and distracting others who want to learn and achieve.''
Too often college is seen as a social rather than a learning experience. Too many students leave with a degree but can't function effectively in the workplace, where analytical thought and written expression are critical. Too many courses are designed more for credits than scholarship. 
It appears that we've come a long way from John Masefield's tribute to English universities as ''a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see.''
Herb Linnen Washington, March 5, 2011
To the Editor:
As a college senior, I have seen firsthand the shift in student attitude that Bob Herbert describes, and I find it frustrating.
The college-age crowd today seems to glorify the ''smart slacker'' -- that person who is able to do only some of the work in a class and still get an A. But without the analytical, thinking and discourse abilities we acquire through the hard classes, how can my generation do well in the jobs we'll have when we graduate?
I certainly know this wasn't the attitude my grandfather had when he went to City College in the 1930s, for free.
Richard Wanerman Appleton, Wis., March 5, 2011
To the Editor:
College students are not suddenly different. The problem today is our treatment of young people and our expectations for their success.
Maybe if we stopped sapping all the joy out of learning, young people would want to read. If we stopped the parade of standardized testing, maybe there would be room for science fairs and extracurricular activities that would actually be interesting and inspiring.
There will always be parties and drinking and college students who try to get by doing the minimum of work, but there will never be an opportunity so ripe for changing the direction of our educators.
Susan McHale Greenwich, Conn., March 5, 2011
To the Editor:
The juxtaposition of ''On Climate, Who Needs the Facts?'' on the March 5 editorial page and Bob Herbert's column ''College the Easy Way'' on the Op-Ed page is telling.
On the one hand our leaders are denying climate change and cutting funding to mitigate what people a lot smarter than I am describe as the greatest environmental, political, economic and security threat facing our nation and planet.
On the other hand, lowering rigorous academic standards in colleges and universities has resulted in stagnant gains in students' ''critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing.''
Should we be surprised by the connection?
In 20-plus years in the academy, I have seen the proliferation of ''science-lite'' programs. Substituting these less demanding alternatives for rigorous science requirements produces a citizenry that cannot distinguish the pseudo-science of climate-change deniers and intelligent design theory from the real thing.

BIDEN CRITICIZES RUSSIA'S
Legal and Political Systems
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used a speech in Moscow to criticize Russia's legal and political systems, a move likely to irritate Russian leaders. The speech came in the face of criticism that a ''reset'' in relations between the two countries had muted the United States' voice on human rights violations. Page A4

HEADLINE: Germany Setting Steep Price To Solve Europe's Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels, Judy Dempsey from Berlin, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Faced with financial turmoil that has resisted every emergency fix the European Union has adopted, European leaders are considering a radical step: giving up some of their independence to set domestic economic policies and cutting back many of the wage and welfare benefits that have defined the region's politics for decades. In return, the European Union would provide funds to shore up the weakest member states, including Portugal, Greece and Spain.
The proposals, originally pressed by the newly assertive German chancellor, will be debated Friday in what is expected to be a contentious session of the leaders of the 17 countries that use the euro.
Germany is calling for several measures: raising retirement ages to reduce the burden on pension funds, ending the linking of wages to increases in the cost of living, committing to debt reduction and submitting to a level of budget scrutiny that was until recently considered anathema -- and is still viewed by many as a step too far. 
The meeting is made more urgent by a continuing financial crisis that, despite occasional lulls, has kept markets on edge for months. On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the Spanish government's debt, sending stock prices sharply down in Europe and contributing to a selloff in the United States as well. More analysts are suggesting that Portugal will need a bailout and that Greece's debt will need to be restructured, despite earlier rescue packages that were intended to make such steps unnecessary.
If the euro is to be saved and a solution found for the divisions in the euro zone, Germany must agree to act as the region's lender of last resort. And for that, Chancellor Angela Merkel, with political problems even within her own governing coalition, has a steep price. She has moved into a visible position of European leadership, trying to frame the debate in German terms and impose her will on her neighbors.
But a comprehensive deal will be difficult to reach. The proposals under debate now have already been watered down from a more robust program of integration and monitoring first put forward by Germany, and will be subject to further negotiation before a full European Union summit meeting on March 24-25, two days before an important German state election.
''There's a common understanding that we need to help Merkel get something that looks like a victory,'' said a senior European Union official, who, like other officials interviewed, was not authorized to comment by name. ''And for the markets, we need to end March with a comprehensive approach.''
For Mrs. Merkel, the answer is a permanent bailout fund for euro-zone governments in trouble now and in the future. The debts of the most indebted nations, like Greece and Ireland, will be covered, with room, if necessary, for Portugal and Spain.
But in return for this ''solidarity,'' the Germans say they want ''solidity'' on limiting benefits and accepting monitoring. Among the measures it is pressing is an agreement to raise retirement ages closer to Germany's, where access to government pensions begins at age 67, well above the European average. Germany would also like others to stop pegging wage increases automatically to inflation. That is a necessary step if wages are to shrink in absolute terms, which some economists argue is necessary if bitter medicine to inject some competitiveness into the economies of Europe's southern tier.
The Germans would also force private bondholders who bought the high-yielding debt of the most troubled euro-zone countries to bear part of the burden if countries defaulted or needed to restructure their debt -- and not be protected by taxpayers.
Since November, the Germans have been in nonstop talks with officials in Brussels and with the French, with whom they have an extraordinarily close relationship. They have been working on at least three levels for a comprehensive package.
The most important is a ''permanent regime'' -- the so-called European Stability Mechanism, which will replace the temporary bailout fund called the European Financial Stability Facility, set up during the Greek crisis last May. That fund ends in June 2013, and the Germans want a permanent fund of perhaps 500 billion euros ($695 billion) to show the markets that the euro zone is prepared for future problems.
But that fund must also show Germans that private investors will not be bailed out by taxpayers, that no country will assume the debts of another and that there will be collateral offered and penalties for bad behavior.
The governments are also in heated discussions about whether and how to strengthen and extend the existing temporary fund of 440 billion euros ($612 billion), intended to help Greece and Ireland, to allow it to lend the entire amount, which could then cover Portugal and Spain. But Berlin does not want the fund to be used to buy back Greek or Irish bonds.
The issue that has gotten the most attention is the German-French Pact for Competitiveness, a name chosen for German ears. The intention was to lay down specific commitments to coordinate euro-zone economies -- a common basis for corporate taxes for instance, or a common age for retirement -- intended to unify policies across the region while raising tax revenue and reducing spending. Wage indexation was to be banned and high deficits punished.
But when the pact was first broached at the European level last month, there was anger from other leaders, who had not been consulted. While the pact might help in the future, it would do nothing to solve the current problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Nor, critics argue, does it deal with a looming problem for Germany and the euro zone -- huge private debt and shaky banks, including some German state banks. Berlin has resisted serious stress tests of its banks.
Still, on Friday, euro-zone leaders are expected to approve a watered-down version of the pact, negotiated by the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, that eliminates fixed pension ages and wage indexation and gives states more latitude to reach objectives, with monitoring of compliance left unclear. The main fight is about whether to align corporate tax systems, and if so, how to do so.
But German officials contend that commitments remaining in the pact are important, that retirement ages and benefit systems should be adjusted to fiscal and demographic realities and that each country must find a way to make debt limits binding, as Berlin has done.
Mrs. Merkel is insisting that all three levels represent a package, and that there will be no increase even in the temporary bailout fund unless there is a deal on the pact.
A senior French official said: ''The Germans have moved far in the last months from their initial position, but they knew they had our support. The face-saving aspect is very important for Germany. A lot of countries are infuriated with Berlin but can't say so, because they need Germany, so in a way they're hostages and have to go along.''
But it will still be a difficult case for Mrs. Merkel to sell domestically. By the end of the month, another senior European Union official said, ''Merkel will have to swallow'' an increase in the temporary fund to allow it to lend fully; a non-German as head of the European Central Bank, probably an Italian, Mario Draghi; and a two-sentence change in the Lisbon Treaty that will not produce the binding criteria and penalties Berlin wanted to reinforce fiscal discipline.
The euro crisis will not be over, said Henrik Enderlein, a political economist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. ''The result will be a watered-down package that won't change a lot and won't end the crisis,'' he said.
Jean Pisani-Ferry, the director of Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic research institution, said the steps under discussion now were necessary, but were likely to prove insufficient. There still must be an intense effort to create competitiveness in the euro zone, to help the lagging nations of southern Europe liberalize their economies and labor markets, to bring down manufacturing costs and to produce growth.
''Even if we do all the right things, how fast will southern Europe catch up?'' Mr. Pisani-Ferry asked. ''Because it must. If not, these countries will find themselves in permanent unemployment and not growing, and then you will need real transfers to keep the euro zone together.''

HEADLINE: Trump Signs Deal to Develop Two Towers in Georgia, the Former Soviet State

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow.

 BODY:
For Georgia's president, it was a chance to show that his country, the former Soviet republic, is grand enough to attract the world's best-known real estate developer. And for that developer, Donald J. Trump, it was yet another opportunity to demonstrate that he is world class.
In a ceremony with caviar and wine at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday, Mr. Trump signed a deal to develop the two tallest towers in the republic of Georgia, the former Soviet state at the nexus of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. 
Giving his blessing to the deal was Mikheil Saakashvili, the flamboyant, English-speaking president of Georgia. Mr. Saakashvili is eager to attract foreign investment as he tries to yank his impoverished country from the Russian orbit and align it more closely with the United States.
Mr. Trump, the world's first virtual developer, will not actually build the towers. At this point in his career, he is more inclined to license use of the Trump name on someone else's building than develop a property himself -- although he still occasionally erects skyscrapers, like Trump World Tower in New York.
Mainly, the deal is another chance to extend the global reach of the Trump brand, whose brassy gold letters are already stamped on buildings on four continents, as well as a long-running television program, a Scottish golf course, vodka, chocolate, books and jewelry. (The signing ceremony was held at the bottom of the Trump Tower's four-level atrium, where the surrounding shops include Trump Grill, Trump Bar and a Trump t-shirt stand.)
Any actual construction, if it begins as scheduled in 2013, would be overseen by Giorgi Ramishvili, chairman of the Silk Road Group, one of the largest private investment companies in the south Caucasus region.
The deal, which the partners estimate at $300 million, calls for two projects. The Trump Tower Tbilisi would go up on Rose Revolution Square in Georgia's capital. The Trump Riviera would be part of a planned Silk Road complex that includes a casino, an exhibition hall and a marina, in the resort city of Batumi on the Black Sea, near Turkey.
The residential buildings will each contain 100 apartments and rise nearly 40 stories -- average by New York standards, but nearly twice the size of the republic's tallest structures.
The partnership was born of a two-year friendship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Saakashvili.
The Georgian president sought out Mr. Trump during a trip to New York after reading Mr. Trump's 2008 book ''Trump Never Gives Up.'' The men formed a friendship, and last year Mr. Trump sent an executive, Michael Cohen, to Georgia to consider working with Silk Road on several projects.
Mr. Saakashvili said in an interview that although Mr. Trump was sometimes criticized as being self-centered, he found him ''intellectually curious'' and knowledgeable about Georgia and its region. ''I think Donald Trump has amazing intuition,'' he said.
Mr. Saakashvili himself is known for a gregarious style. Elected president in 2004, he is a staunch American ally. At one point Georgia contributed the third-largest force to the mission in Iraq, after the United States and Great Britain. A street in the capital is named after George W. Bush.
After tamping down corruption in the police, Mr. Saakashvili built a new ministry of interior building, designed by the Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, with an all-glass facade to symbolize transparency. Now, all new police stations in Georgia are made of glass, too.
And he has lavished attention on the resort town of Batumi, where 35 hotels have gone up in the last four years. In 2007, to inaugurate a new amusement park in the town, Mr. Saakashvili and his young presidential staff rode the carnival rides themselves.
In Georgia, Mr. Trump will license his name, and his company will manage the two properties. He will also work with Silk Road to line up financing for the projects and market the towers. Mr. Trump said that so far he had no plans to put his own cash into the deal. ''We'll decide whether or not we want to invest,'' he said.
Mr. Saakashvili has been eager to draw celebrity foreign investors to show Georgia is again open for business, after the global recession and a war with Russia in 2008 dried up the foreign direct investment that had been propelling the economy.
Georgians remain poor. The average income, in a country of about 4.3 million people, was $2,455 in 2009.
Before the Russian war, Georgia had attracted about $2 billion a year in foreign investment. Mr. Saakashvili welcomed the inflow as an endorsement of his pro-Western reforms.
During the crisis, Georgia pivoted to work with Middle Eastern investors like the sovereign wealth fund of Ras al-Khaimah, one of the United Arab Emirates. That fund bought the Georgian port of Poti on the coast just north of the site of Mr. Trump's planned tower in Batumi.
Georgia has squeaked by with foreign aid donated after the war by the United States and European countries. But with the new deal, Mr. Saakashvili is sure to try to use the Trump imprimatur to encourage other American investors to put money in the tourism and transportation projects he sees as the future of his country's economy.
While Mr. Trump is the first large American developer to come to Georgia, some locals have worked with American partners or financing from United States banks, Irakli Matkava, a deputy minister of economy, said in a telephone interview.
Silk Road, which recently opened the Radisson Tbilisi hotel in the capital, expects to open another hotel, the Batumi Radisson this summer. Tourism is a relative new field for Silk Road, which is a major fuel trader and transporter, and also the largest Internet provider in Georgia. The company also has a contract to move American military equipment to Afghanistan from Iraq.
The Georgians seem to have had their eye on the Trump clan for some time. Two years ago, Giorgi Rtskhiladze, an assistant to the chairman of Silk Road, invited Mr. Trump's Czech-born ex-wife, Ivana Trump, to Georgia to consider investing there.
She visited Batumi and met with President Saakashvili during her stay. It was a tough decision, Mr. Rtskhiladze said, and although Mr. Trump has yet to visit the country, ''we went with the husband.''
Online Correction: March 10, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified Giorgi Rtskhiladze as an aide to the president of Georgia.

HEADLINE: House Panel Votes to Strip E.P.A. of Power to Regulate Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee voted on Thursday to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its power to regulate greenhouse gases, chipping away at a central pillar of the Obama administration's evolving climate and energy strategy.
The sharply partisan vote was preordained by the Republican takeover of the House. Republicans and their industry allies accuse the administration of levying taxes on traditional energy sources through costly environmental regulations, threatening the economic recovery and driving jobs overseas.
Many Republicans also argue that global warming is an unproven theory and that no action is needed to combat it, and they are backed by lobbies representing manufacturers; small businesses; agriculture; and the chemical, coal and oil industries; all of which have a big financial stake in hamstringing the E.P.A.
A parallel bill has been introduced in the Senate, although passage remains uncertain. President Obama has vowed to veto such legislation, which would undercut his administration's policy of encouraging clean energy innovation with billions of dollars in support and rules that make it more costly for industry to keep spewing carbon dioxide. 
Some coal state and oilpatch Democrats in both chambers also support the legislation, so it is not certain that the president's allies could prevent a veto override.
Yet the criticism from early allies who advocate aggressive action to address climate change is in some ways harsher. In their view, Mr. Obama failed to push hard enough for a strong climate change policy last year, when he enjoyed high public standing and large Democratic majorities in the Senate and House.
''We'll never know what this president could have achieved,'' said Joseph J. Romm, a former Department of Energy official who is one of the country's most influential writers on climate change, ''because he didn't try.''
Dr. Romm, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, which has close ties to the White House, contends that the president's approach has been too timid and has set back efforts to address climate change by at least a decade.
As he takes heat from both sides, Mr. Obama is moving cautiously. Gone are his calls for sweeping action on climate change by putting a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions or a price on carbon dioxide.
Today, the president rarely utters the words ''climate change'' or ''global warming,'' and instead talks about expanding production from nuclear power, domestic oil and natural gas, ''clean coal'' and new technologies.
The president acknowledges that the window for comprehensive action on climate change in the United States has closed for the foreseeable future as a result of Republican gains in the midterm elections.
He has said he now intends to pursue a clean energy policy in smaller pieces, through measures intended to increase production of renewable energy, encourage production of domestic energy resources and gradually impose rules that will make the burning of coal, oil and natural gas cleaner.
''The president sees investment in this all-of-the-above energy approach as very important as we head into a dialogue on rising gas prices and where we need to take the nation on energy,'' said Carol M. Browner, the White House coordinator on energy and climate change, who has announced that she is leaving the administration.
Ms. Browner acknowledged that the president talks less often now about global warming. ''But what's important is not the words he's uttering from one day to the next, but developing an energy policy that benefits consumers and makes the country more secure,'' she said.
She and other defenders of the administration note that in his first two years in office the president brokered a historic deal to reduce emissions from cars and light trucks, revved up energy efficiency efforts across the federal government and poured tens of billions of dollars into renewable energy programs and infrastructure.
Ms. Browner said that innovation and regulation were not contradictory policies, but complementary means to an end. Requiring greater efficiency and fewer emissions through regulation, she said, drives innovation and brings new technology to the market.
Energy and environmental issues have always carried heavy economic, ideological and regional baggage. Pursuing such a debate in a time of economic stress and rising energy prices is even more difficult, and prospects are dim for any major legislation in the next two years.
The administration's new strategy grew from the failure of legislation to address global warming through a market-based cap-and-trade system, an approach Mr. Obama had strongly endorsed in his campaign and in his first year in office.
A comprehensive bill passed the House in 2009 but died in the Senate the next year, a victim of united Republican opposition, uncertainty about the economy, bad blood from the health care debate and unease generated by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
The Obama White House ceded defeat on climate change midyear without a full-fledged battle.
''In the last Congress, the focus was on trying to do something on climate change, and after the cap-and-trade bill passed the House, there was some expectation we would follow in the Senate,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who leads the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ''It was clear to some of us early on that the votes weren't there to do that.''
Now, Mr. Bingaman said, the administration's challenge is to protect the regulatory authority it does have to act on greenhouse gases by stopping the Republican anti-E.P.A. steamroller. ''I think the votes are there to uphold a presidential veto, if it comes to that,'' Mr. Bingaman said. ''But I'm not certain.''
After the collapse of climate legislation and the Republican surge last November, Mr. Obama pivoted, declaring in his State of the Union address in January that he would try to move the country away from dependence on dirty fuels over the next 25 years through a shift to cleaner sources of energy.
It is an ambitious goal, but to date there are only piecemeal programs in place to achieve it, many of them in development at the Department of Energy. The president has not proposed legislation to make his vision a reality.
Steven Chu, the secretary of energy and a Nobel laureate in physics, said that achieving the president's goal of producing 80 percent of the nation's electricity through low-carbon sources by 2035 would require not only strongly supporting a variety of energy technologies, including nuclear power, but also eventually making it more expensive to burn fossil fuels.
''In actual fact, you need both in the end,'' he said in an interview. ''The world will have to, in some way in the future, put a price on carbon. And everybody will have to recognize that.''
To get to that point, Mr. Chu added, will require legislation and a major sales job.
''I need to convince Congress, the president needs to convince Congress,'' he said, ''how important this is.''

HEADLINE: Plain Speaking From Biden in Moscow Speech

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who two years ago introduced the idea of a thaw between the United States and Russia, used a speech at Moscow State University to criticize Russia's legal and political systems, a move likely to irritate the country's leaders.
Russians, he said, ''want to be able to choose their national and local leaders in competitive elections. They want to be able to assemble freely, and they want the media to be independent of the state. And they want to live in a country that fights corruption. 
''That's democracy,'' he said. ''I urge all you students here: Don't compromise on the basic elements of democracy. You need not make that Faustian bargain.''
The speech came in the face of criticism that what Mr. Biden dubbed a ''reset'' in relations between Russia and the United States has muted the United States' voice on human rights violations. Mr. Biden cataloged a series of high-profile cases that he said made investors wary of Russia, including the prosecution of the oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and the death in detention of Sergei L. Magnitsky.
''Some may say, 'How can you say these things out loud, Mr. Vice President, and expect to have a better relationship,' '' he said, prompting a small burst of applause. ''They're necessary to have a good relationship. We should not have to make choices. We will continue to object when we see that human rights are violated or democracy and the rule of law is undermined.''
After cooperating on American priorities, including some in Iran and Afghanistan, Russian leaders have been eager to shift to economic ties, like ventures with Western technology companies. Mr. Biden discussed two near-term payoffs in his visit: Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization and the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, trade restrictions that were imposed on the Soviet Union in 1974.
But neither of those steps is assured. Congressional Republicans may use a vote on Jackson-Vanik to raise questions about rights in Russia. Meanwhile, in order to join the W.T.O., Russia must secure the agreement of Georgia, which as a member, has veto power.
American officials ''were very proactive in encouraging'' Russia and Georgia to sit down for Swiss-mediated negotiations in Bern, but are playing no role in the talks, according to a senior administration official who spoke on ground rules of anonymity.
On Thursday, a senior Russian official suggested that Russia might lift its 2006 embargo on Georgian wine, but this is unlikely by itself to win Georgia's vote.
Sergei A. Markov, a deputy with the governing United Russia party, said the assumption in Moscow was that Washington could dictate Georgia's position.
''Everyone here is convinced that one call from Joe Biden to Mikheil Saakashvili would be enough,'' he said. ''We consider that Georgia's position 100 percent depends on the American White House.''
A larger challenge is setting an agenda that will give momentum to the reset, said Sergei A. Karaganov, a dean of the faculty of international relations at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. President Obama's strategy has quieted the anti-American voices in Russia's politics, he said, much as Mikhail Gorbachev stripped anti-Russian hawks of their enemy in the 1980s.
But early projects, like negotiation of the New Start treaty, have been largely symbolic, he said, staying clear of looming issues like energy policy and development of the Arctic. Meanwhile, he said, Russian leaders are wary that Mr. Obama may last only one term, and that there could be a sharp change in policy.
Mr. Biden is viewed warily in Moscow, in part dating from a 2009 interview he gave to The Wall Street Journal, in which he said Russia faced such economic and demographic decline that it was weak in negotiations with the West. Russia's state-controlled television paid scant attention to his visit.
Journalists in Russia had speculated about whether Mr. Biden would weigh in on the country's central political drama -- whether President Dmitri A. Medvedev will serve for a second term or be replaced by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, still widely viewed as the country's paramount leader.
Mr. Biden took pains to devote equal attention to Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Putin. But in his speech, he mentioned Mr. Medvedev seven times and repeatedly cited his words.
''Mr. Medvedev said last week -- and I quote him -- 'Freedom cannot be postponed,' '' he said. ''Joe Biden didn't say that. The president of Russia said that. And when Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Kudrin said that 'only fair elections can give the authorities the mandate of trust we need to help economic reforms' -- that's a Russian leader, not an American leader.''

HEADLINE: Clinton to Meet With Libyan Rebels

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that she would meet with Libyan rebel leaders in the United States and during travels next week to France, Tunisia and Egypt. 
Mrs. Clinton did not identify the Libyan rebel leaders she intended to meet.
American officials have reached out to members of the rebels' provisional council in eastern Libya, directly and through intermediaries, but Mrs. Clinton's meetings will be the administration's highest-level contacts with those who hope to replace the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
''We are standing with the Libyan people as they brave bombs and bullets to demand that Qaddafi must go -- now,'' Mrs. Clinton said in remarks to a House panel.
She spoke hours after France became the first country to recognize the Libyan opposition, calling itself the Libyan National Council, even as forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi pounded rebellious forces in Zawiyah and Ras Lanuf, cities the rebels seized after the uprising began.
On Thursday, President Nicolas Sarkozy met with two representatives of the new provisional council, Mahmoud Jibril and Ali al-Esawi.
Foreign ministers of the Group of Eight nations are meeting in Paris on Monday and Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton said that while she was in Tunisia and Egypt, she would press for democratic changes there. It will be her first trip to the Middle East since a wave of popular uprisings began reshaping the Arab world, complicating American diplomacy. The United States once counted on the stability of autocratic rulers to maintain regional security, though their continued rule often came at the expense of democratic and economic development.

HEADLINE: Leaning Away From Idealism

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HELENE COOPER; Elisabeth Bumiller and Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels, Steven Erlanger and Alan Cowell from Paris and Judy Dempsey from Berlin.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the Middle East crisis, as on other issues, there are two Barack Obamas: the transformative historical figure and the pragmatic American president. Three months after a Tunisian fruit vendor set himself aflame and ignited a political firestorm across the Arab world, the president is trumping the trailblazer.
With the spread of antigovernment protests from North Africa to the strategic, oil-rich Persian Gulf, President Obama has adopted a policy of restraint. He has concluded that his administration must shape its response country by country, aides say, recognizing a stark reality that American national security interests weigh as heavily as idealistic impulses. That explains why Mr. Obama has dialed down the vocal support he gave demonstrators in Cairo to a more modulated call for peaceful protest and respect for universal rights elsewhere. 
This emphasis on pragmatism over idealism has left Mr. Obama vulnerable to criticism that he is losing the battle for the hearts and minds of the Arab street protesters. Some say he is failing to bind the United States to the historic change under way in the Middle East the way that Ronald Reagan forever cemented himself in history books to the end of the cold war with his famous call to tear down the Berlin Wall.
''It's tempting, and it would be easy, to go out day after day with cathartic statements that make us feel good,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, who wrote Mr. Obama's soaring speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in 2009. ''But ultimately, what's most important is achieving outcomes that are consistent with our values, because if we don't, those statements will be long forgotten.''
On Thursday, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, deflected calls for more aggressive action in Libya, telling reporters what American officials have been saying privately for days: despite pleas from Libyan rebels for military assistance, the United States will not, at least for now, put its pilots in harm's way by enforcing a no-flight zone over the country.
Not only is intervention risky, officials said, but they also fear that in some cases, it could be counterproductive, provoking a backlash against the United States for meddling in what is a homegrown political movement.
A senior administration official acknowledged the irony of Mr. Obama's dilemma; he is, after all, the first black president, whose election was hailed on the Arab street, where many protesters identify their own struggles with the civil rights movement.
''There is a desire for Obama -- not the American president, but Obama -- to speak to their aspirations,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But, he added, ''his first job is to be the American president.''
So Mr. Obama has thrown his weight behind attempts by the royal family of Bahrain, the home of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, to survive, although protesters say their demands have not been met. He has said little about political grievances in Saudi Arabia, a major oil supplier, where there were reports on Thursday of a violent dispersal of Shiite protesters. And he has limited White House critiques of Yemen, where the government is helping the United States root out a terrorist threat, even after that government opened fire on demonstrators.
The more cautious approach contrasts sharply with Mr. Obama's response in North Africa, where he abandoned a 30-year alliance with Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and has demanded the resignation of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya. But Mr. Obama is balancing his idealistic instincts against his reluctance to use military action in Libya, where the United States does not have a vital strategic interest. Mr. Donilon noted that the administration needed to keep its focus on the broader region, where allies like Egypt loom large.
The time is coming, administration officials said, for Mr. Obama to make another major speech taking stock of the upheaval. But its central message is not yet set, and there is likely to be lively debate about questions like whether the president should admit American complicity in propping up undemocratic governments in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.
''I don't honestly think it would change much,'' said a second senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. ''It isn't going to change the perception of the United States one way or the other. What will continue to affect the perception of the United States is what we do now.''
The White House will send Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to Egypt and Tunisia next week, where officials said she would congratulate the protesters for sweeping out their leaders peacefully and offer aid to revive the nations' economies. She had planned to stop in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, but canceled, officials said, because King Abdullah is too ill to meet her.
This underscores one of the difficulties the United States faces in dealing with Saudi Arabia, a crucial ally that is run by an aging, infirm ruling family that has refused to open the political system. Instead, the king tried to mollify his people by doling out $36 billion worth of pay raises, unemployment checks and housing subsidies.
Bahrain poses a different problem. There, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa has pledged to enter a dialogue with the protestors, after having unleashed its security forces on them. Officials said Mr. Obama persuaded King Hamad to pull back his forces, which they said won the United States goodwill from the mostly Shiite demonstrators. But the talks have failed to get off the ground, and now some Shiites feel the Americans have sided against them.
''There is a sense among many Bahraini reformers that the U.S. is a bit too eager to praise progress toward dialogue and reform that has not yet happened, and that the premature praise is easing pressure on the government,'' said Tom Malinowski, the head of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch.
''Striking a very balanced, and in many ways, neutral approach is recognized by many people in the region as not being with them, or on their side,'' said J. Scott Mastic, the head of Middle East and North Africa for the International Republican Institute. ''It's very important that we be seen as supporting the demands of the people in the region.''
How Mr. Obama manages to do that while also balancing American interests is a question that officials acknowledge will plague this historic president for months to come. Mr. Obama has told people that it would be so much easier to be the president of China. As one official put it, ''No one is scrutinizing Hu Jintao's words in Tahrir Square.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Rose 15% in January on Higher Oil Prices

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A surge in oil prices helped push imports up at the fastest pace in 18 years in January, giving the country the largest trade deficit in six months.
The Commerce Department said Thursday that the January deficit increased 15.1 percent to $46.3 billion. Exports rose 2.7 percent to a high of $167.7 billion. But imports rose at a 5.2 percent pace, to $214.1 billion. That reflected a big jump in America's oil bill, underscoring concerns that surging oil prices could slow the recovery.
A widening trade deficit hurts the United States economy. When imports outpace exports, more jobs go to foreign workers than to American workers. 
The politically sensitive deficit with China rose 12.5 percent to $23.5 billion in January, the largest with any country. Last year, the deficit with China rose to a record $273.1 billion, increasing political pressure in this country to take a tougher line on what critics see as China's unfair trading practices, like manipulating its currency to gain trade advantages.
China, which typically runs huge trade surpluses with the rest of the world, reported a surprise deficit of $7.3 billion for February as surging prices for oil and other commodities pushed imports up 19.4 percent while its exports dropped 2.4 percent.
The export decline reflected the fact that Chinese businesses were idled for the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. Analysts said the rare trade deficit for China was likely to be temporary.
The overall American deficit in January would translate into an annual deficit of $556.1 billion. Last year's imbalance was $495.7 billion, which was 32.8 percent higher than in 2009 when a deep recession in this country had shrunk America's appetite for foreign goods.
Economists expect that this year's deficit will be essentially unchanged from 2010 as rising imports, reflecting a growing American economy, are matched by continued strong export sales. However, they caution that this forecast could turn out to be too optimistic if oil prices, which have surged on political turmoil in Libya and other countries in the region, keep climbing.
For January, America's oil bill jumped 9.5 percent to $34.9 billion, the highest level since October 2008, reflecting a $4.56 per barrel increase in the average price of imported crude oil, which rose to $84.34. In recent weeks, oil has been trading above $100 per barrel so oil imports will likely be even higher in the February and March trade reports.
President Obama has set a goal of doubling United States exports by 2015. The administration is taking a tougher stance in trade disputes with China, including applying more pressure to get China to allow its currency to rise in value against the dollar.
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama sought to highlight the importance of the American-China relationship by nominating the commerce secretary, Gary F. Locke, to be ambassador to China. Mr. Locke would be the first Chinese-American to serve in that post.
The rise in American exports pushed them to a record high, surpassing the old mark of $165.7 billion set in July 2008 before a financial crisis in the United States pushed the global economy into a deep recession. The export strength in January reflected strong sales of United States autos, industrial machinery, medical equipment and farm products including wheat.
America's deficit with Canada edged down 4.9 percent to $3.7 billion while the imbalance with the European Union dropped 15.3 percent to $5.6 billion. The deficit with Japan fell 15.6 percent to $5 billion.

HIGHLIGHT: In this edition of Reads and Reactions: a Gingrich run, the Oscars, more unions, more 2012 analyses and hoops. 

 BODY:
Reactions
Newt Gingrich took a few more baby steps toward running for president. According to most polling, however, he would enter the race with underwhelming support. Nate took a look at those numbers, while Andrew Sullivan at The Atlantic's Daily Dish provided a non-numericalrundown of Mr. Gingrich's disadvantages.
The Academy Awards came and went, and Nate's model predicted the correct winner for five of the six major categories. That's pretty decent, right? Maybe not; Dante Ramos at The Boston Globe accused Nate of ruining the entire Oscars extravaganza.
Nate's graphical view of the Republican presidential field continued to elicit responses around the Web. One particularly insightful take came from Rajiv Sethi, who questioned whether market prices (like those from Intrade) are actually representative of "a hypothetical average trader in any meaningful sense." (courtesy of Andrew Gelman at The Monkey Cage)
After Nate explored how important union voters are to the Democratic Party, The Washington Examiner's Christopher Murray delved into the history of that relationship, asking whether the battle over collective bargaining will cause some "Reagan Democrats" to drop the "Reagan."
And Jeff Alworth at BlueOregon.com thought the electoral boost that Nate found unions gave Democrats in presidential races would be larger for state-level races, especially gubernatorial elections. His reasoning: "... while Democrats are generally supportive of working people, the connection between a president and a school teacher is quite weak. Not so between a governor and a school teacher."
Nate has written two posts on Carmelo Anthony's move to the Knicks, one pre-trade, one post-trade. These and other attempts to quantify Mr. Anthony's impact on the new-look Knicks sparked an illuminating look at the state of advanced basketball metrics from Dave Johns at Slate.
And over at Basketball Prospectus, Dan Feldman compared an Amare Stoudamire/Anthony tandem to other pairs of "super scorers" in N.B.A. history.
Reads
Don't worry, be happy (but you might not live as long). Veronique Greenwood at The Atlantic says "decades of data" debunks the conventional wisdom that worrying is always bad for your health.
The Economist puts state-level employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics into some handy graphs.
At the National Journal, Charlie Cook uses a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll to look at how independents view government.
And Gallup had an interesting poll on Newt Gingrich's support among Fox News viewers.

HEADLINE: As N.F.L. Talks Fail, '11 Season Seems in Doubt

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The National Football League, which last year had revenues of more than $9 billion as America's most popular sport, was plunged into deep uncertainty Friday when negotiations between owners and players for a new contract broke off. At 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the owners locked out the players to create the game's first work stoppage since 1987 and imperil the 2011 regular season.
After a final day of negotiations, the players union formally dissolved itself, a process known as decertification. Such a move is highly unusual, but it allowed players to seek an injunction in federal court to prevent the league from implementing a lockout and to sue the N.F.L. on antitrust grounds.
Among the 10 named plaintiffs in the 52-page antitrust suit filed in United States District Court in Minneapolis are some of the game's most famous players, including quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees. Because the plaintiffs are listed alphabetically, the lawsuit will technically be referred to as Brady v. N.F.L. 
The bitter rupture was the culmination of months of largely fruitless negotiation, and it essentially froze much of the business of the league in place. Until the court takes up the request for an injunction -- union officials said they did not expect an initial decision for three or four weeks -- players cannot sign with teams, trades are barred, and there can be no contact between the league's coaches and its players.
If the injunction is granted, the owners would have to create rules to operate the league. Games would be played while antitrust litigation makes its way through the court system. If an injunction is not granted, then the league will lock out its players and come to a standstill.
Moments after the players filed paperwork to decertify the union -- their Web site disappeared Friday evening -- the owners effectively accused the players of bargaining in bad faith.
''I've been here for the better part of two weeks now, and essentially during that two-week period the union's position on the core economic issues has not changed one iota,'' said the Giants president John Mara, a nearly constant presence in the negotiation process. ''Their position has quite literally been 'take it or leave it,' and in effect they have been at the same position since last September.
''One thing that became painfully apparent to me during this period was that their objective was to go the litigation route,'' he said. ''I believe they think it gives them the best leverage. I never really got the feeling in the past weeks that they were serious about negotiating.''
The two sides spent 16 days with the federal mediator George Cohen, and last week they agreed to two extensions of the deadline for expiration of the collective bargaining agreement. This week had largely been spent haggling over how much financial disclosure the owners would accede to.
But on Friday, owners -- apparently hoping to avoid litigation -- dramatically dropped their demand for how much additional revenue they would receive off the top in addition to the $1 billion they already receive in cost credits for investment in things like stadiums and the NFL Network -- the core economic issue that is at the heart of this dispute. At the start of negotiations, owners wanted an additional $1 billion, but the two sides entered the day just $640 million apart, and owners offered to split the difference, meaning that they would have taken $320 million per year, a third of their original demand.
DeMaurice Smith, the head of the union, said that during negotiations, players had offered owners $550 million over four years -- $137.5 million per year -- without the demand for financial verification.
''The union and our association and our players offered the pay-cap proposal to slow down cap growth that would have provided owners with $550 million of investment revenue,'' Smith said. ''We did so at a time when we know that the economics of football are not only good, they're outstanding. Without one piece of financial information, the players of the National Football League proposed slowing down this cap and taking less money without a shred of financial information.
''For them to say that our path was always decertification, and that we did not engage in good-faith negotiations and that we did not budge flies in the face of reason, flies in the face of facts, and is simply untrue.''
Later, Smith addressed the inability of the parties to agree on financial disclosure. At the end, players walked out after telling owners they would extend the deadline again only if owners agreed to turn over 10 years of audited, full team financial statements. Owners had offered to allow a third-party auditor to verify five years of team financial statements, although the union would only be given profitability statements and statements indicating changes in profitability.
''The way two business partners should interact with each is one based on trust, and trust that is verified,'' Smith said. ''For the last 14 days, the N.F.L. has said 'trust us,' but when it came time to verify, they told us it was none of our business.''
There were other differences, too, that doomed a deal. The sides had not agreed on a rookie compensation system or on whether it would have an 18-game regular season.
For now, the two sides will wait for judges' rulings. If a judge grants the injunction to lift the lockout, the off-season will look much like it usually does -- there will be free agency and trades and perhaps even off-season workouts. Inevitably, the two sides will go back to the negotiating table, almost certainly with help from the mediator, even though the union is now acting as a trade association.
The antitrust lawsuit is leverage against owners to get them back to the negotiating table and to improve their offer to the players. While players are not seeking to remake the system as they did in 1987 when they sought free agency, antitrust suits involve treble damages, potentially devastating to the league if the decisions go against them.
On Friday night, Mara bemoaned the amount of time and money that is going to be spent in court, and said it was not a productive process at a time when the N.F.L. is so popular. Smith apologized to fans that it had come to this.
The N.F.L.'s lead negotiator, Jeff Pash, said, ''I can say to the fans as I've said before, the absence of an agreement is a shared failure and I think they should be disappointed, I think they should be unhappy and I understand that.''
Jim Quinn, an outside counsel to the union, had harsh words for Pash in remarks to reporters after the decertification.
''I hate to say this but he has not told the truth to our players or our fans,'' Quinn said.
The N.F.L. has embarked on a long, strange off-season, the kind of which it has not endured for more than two decades. It was a less popular sport then, and much less profitable. But its future will be shaped by what happens in courtrooms and around negotiating tables in the next few months.

HEADLINE: 'It Keeps the Neighborhood Irish'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The Butcher's Fancy is getting more customers for its Irish sausages and steak-and-kidney pie. The Irish Coffee Shop notices more orders for its slow-cooked Irish oatmeal, brown bread and rashers.
Newly immigrated athletes are beefing up the Gaelic football teams in nearby Riverdale. And Msgr. Edward Barry, pastor of St. Barnabas Church, notices a slightly more bountiful collection plate, thanks partly to new arrivals who, he says, are ''a little bit better'' about coming to Mass.
Irish immigrants are again settling in the Woodlawn section of the Bronx and the adjacent McLean Avenue neighborhood of Yonkers, giving a lift to an enclave that had been seeing its Irish flavor slip away, much like New York's other historically Irish strongholds of Inwood, Riverdale and Norwood. 
The trickle of newcomers is small and difficult to quantify. Yet the area feels more Irish -- the cardboard shamrocks and Gaelic sayings mounted in windows and on doors seeming to be only partly related to the celebration of St. Patrick's Day on Thursday.
''When you notice all the new arrivals on the street, you feel quite hopeful, and that resonates throughout the community and creates a sense of vibrancy,'' said Orla Kelleher, executive director of the Aisling Irish Community Center, a social service agency on McLean Avenue.
As the Irish did off and on for the last 150 years, they are escaping the economic miseries of Ireland in the hopes of finding something better in New York -- even if in a battered American economy it is not all that much better.
There are still fewer Irish residents in those neighborhoods than in the late 1990s, when almost half the people there were of Irish descent. Then a surge in Ireland's economy drew many back ''home.''
The American Community Survey taken from 2005 to 2009 found that of the approximately 18,500 residents in seven census tracts in Woodlawn and southeast Yonkers, 40.6 percent claimed Irish ancestry (with 1,850 born in Ireland), down from 45.6 percent in 2000.
''There's still a good lot of us here, but not as many as there used to be,'' said Martina Lavin, owner of Anna's Attic's, a McLean Avenue gift shop that sells Irish sweaters and jewelry.
Recently, though, the Irish economy has taken another turn for the worse, and business owners and other residents said they detected a resurgence of Irish lilts.
Siobhan Dennehy, executive director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, said there had been an increase this year of 5 to 10 percent in the number of immigrants the agency was helping.
''It keeps the neighborhood Irish because they come here to get their Irish products,'' said Oliver Charles, owner of the butcher shop, whose brogue hints at his own journey from County Leitrim in Ireland's north.
Those spurts are good news for neighborhoods that in the 1990s and for much of the last decade lost residents not only to suburbs like Pearl River and Mahopac in New York, but also to an Ireland whose economy, driven by technology and construction, was riding what the Irish called the Celtic Tiger. Then Ireland's housing bubble burst and a banking crisis erupted. With unemployment in Ireland reaching 13.7 percent last spring, many began to seek work abroad.
Niall O'Dowd, editor of the New York newspaper The Irish Voice, said a thousand people a week leave Ireland behind, with most heading to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, English-speaking lands where immigration laws make settling easier. But about 12 percent, Mr. O'Dowd said, come to the United States, many on 90-day visitor visas that they eventually overstay. Others take up an American citizenship acquired decades before and return to the Bronx-Yonkers neighborhood, he said.
Jackie Murray, a native of the Bronx, was taken by her parents to County Limerick when she was 4. But at 27 she is back in the Bronx, where she has two uncles, and is hoping to work as a registered nurse. Her husband is working as a carpenter, but after seven months she has been unable to get New York State officials to process the paperwork that corroborates her Irish nursing credentials, and so she is working as a waitress in New Jersey.
Ms. Murray said she was enjoying the cheer at Ned Devine's on McLean and the Rambling House on Woodlawn's commercial spine, Katonah Avenue. She frequently stops by the Butcher's Fancy to buy the bran for Irish soda bread.
''It's like living in my Irish village,'' she said. ''I come home and within three blocks there's a lot of people from my village living in the area.''
Still, she said, she is losing heart and is planning to move to Australia, where she has already been offered a nursing job.
Ms. Kelleher of the Aisling Irish Center said she noticed young Irish men and women, newly arrived, dragging their bags of laundry or looking a little lost on the sidewalks, without that ''confident settled look.'' Most of them, she said, end up cultivating contacts at local bars or at Gaelic football clubs and find work in a month or two as construction workers or nannies.
These immigrants include people like Damian O'Connor, 25, a carpenter with wheat-colored hair in dreadlocks. He came from Ireland five weeks ago and is living on Katonah Avenue, Woodlawn's main drag, and looking for construction work.
''I'll take anything, though I'd like to keep things above board,'' Mr. O'Connor said, with a smile.
Some merchants, like Ms. Lavin of Anna's Attic and John Lyons of McKeon's Bar and Restaurant, lament that American laws make it exceedingly difficult for immigrants without work visas to find a legal job. Yet, said Ms. Kelleher, who herself emigrated from County Kerry in 2004, Woodlawn is about as close to Ireland as you can find in America.
''Anything you can enjoy at home you can enjoy here,'' she said.
Except for the people they left behind.
''The only thing you don't have is family and friends,'' Ms. Kelleher said. ''That you have to live without.''

HEADLINE: Airline Fees: A Few Ideas

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog and on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com.
By now you have probably heard about the growingevidence that ''dumb money'' is entering the market. The dumb money is not my term, by the way; it's how Wall Street refers to individual investors who repeatedly sell stocks at a low price, only to turn around later and buy them for high prices.
If the mistake is so frequent that it actually has a name, why do we keep doing it, and what can we do to stop? 
When we make financial decisions we're faced with a choice: Do we act based on what we know or how we feel?
In an intellectual exercise, knowledge wins. But in the real world, we're hardwired to pursue the things that give us pleasure or provide security and run as fast as possible from the things that cause us pain. This genetic trait means that we're often driven by how we feel instead of what we know.
Here is an example. In December 2008, The Economist published one of its classic covers. I remember seeing this cover, and a year or so later being struck by how well the image captured how I had felt. In fact, when I saw it again in 2010 I had an emotional response that surprised me as I thought back to those feelings. The picture made me feel like everyone else did during that time. I was depressed, sad, hopeless and felt like I was a fool for not gathering what little gold I had left before it too fell into the dark, bottomless hole pictured on the cover.
But how I felt at the time was exactly the opposite of how I knew (in an intellectual sense, at least) I should act. Every investment decision should at least be informed by what we know, instead of driven solely by what we feel.
So if you're thinking about making a sudden change to your portfolio here are a few things to consider:
1) Stop long enough to ask yourself if your decision is based on how you feel or what you know. Is what you are about to do based on what is going on in the market or is it based on an investment plan you put in place when you were thinking clearly?
2) Don't just do something, stand there. When dealing with investments there is often this feeling that we should be doing something. A lack of action implies we're missing an opportunity or making a mistake. Growing a garden takes lots of hard work, but at some point you have to let the plants grow. If you have a plan, let it work.
3) If you're still convinced that you need to act, take a mandatory timeout. Write yourself a letter that explains what you intend to do and why. Pretend like you are trying to convince a wise friend that your proposed course of action makes sense. It might help to actually meet with someone you trust and talk it through. Putting it on paper can help you weigh knowledge versus emotion.
4) Please, ignore gut feelings when it comes to investing. I can't tell you how many times I have heard people use that as an excuse to do something dumb.
I know, I know. Believing that we can remove all emotion from our decision making just isn't realistic. But we can still take plenty of steps to make knowledge the foundation of our financial choices.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shares Move Ahead, Lifted by U.S. Signals Despite Quake in Japan

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks advanced on Friday, trimming the weekly loss in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, as gains in fuel, metal and industrial companies helped the market overcome a global slump after the worst earthquake on record in Japan. 
The S.& P. 500 gained 9.17 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,304.28, paring its weekly decline to 1.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,044.40. The Nasdaq gained 14.59 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,715.61.
Oil slid 1.5 percent as refineries were shut in Japan, where the earthquake cut demand.
''The good U.S. economic signals are winning over external shocks,'' said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Va. ''Companies are reporting strong earnings, M.& A. activity is moving forward, the economy is in decent shape. We had a recent selloff triggered by all sorts of external uncertainties. It may be time for investors to look at the internal strength.''
United States stocks fell in early trading, after a global equity slump followed the Japanese earthquake. Stock-index futures pared declines before the open of exchanges as a report from the Commerce Department showed that United States retail sales increased in February by the most in four months.
Gauges of raw materials and energy producers had the two biggest gains in the S.& P. 500 within 10 industries, adding at least 1.3 percent.
Steel Dynamics rose 3.9 percent to $18.55. The company forecast first-quarter earnings that could be as high as 42 cents a share, compared with the 38-cent average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
AK Steel Holding advanced 5.8 percent to $15.46. U.S. Steel gained 4.5 percent to $55.14.
Valero, the oil refiner, advanced 6.3 percent to $27.98 after agreeing to buy a refinery and 1,000 retail outlets for about $1.73 billion in cash, gaining its first European plant. Industrial companies had the third-biggest gain in the S.& P. 500 among 10 industries, rallying 1.2 percent.
Pall, a maker of industrial filters, gained 6.2 percent to $57.02. The company increased its full-year profit forecast.
Caterpillar climbed 1.7 percent to $100.02 after Morgan Stanley said it would outperform the industry over the next 30 days.
''The recent selloff created an opportunity to buy beaten-up companies,'' said Mark P. Bronzo, an investment manager at Security Global Investors in New York. ''We've got good earnings reports. Oil is down. There's not much to say about the Middle East crisis today. Over all, people do believe the global economy is getting better.''
Shares of Toyota Motor, which halted auto production at a plant in northern Japan after the earthquake, fell 2.1 percent and Sony, which suspended operations at six factories, declined 2.4 percent.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 12/32, to 101 27/32, and the yield rose to 3.40 percent from 3.36 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Online Rival Rolling Out New Weapon In Grocery War

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Fresh Direct started selling groceries online in New York City nine years ago, and in that time, one of its biggest national competitors, Peapod, has circled ever closer to Manhattan. But it has not crossed the river -- until now. Starting on Sunday, armed with a hefty budget for parking tickets, Peapod plans to roll its delivery trucks through big sections of Manhattan, and a new kind of food-delivery war will be on.
But winning over Manhattanites, analysts said, will be no easy chore for Peapod, which is affiliated with Stop & Shop supermarkets, a chain that has no physical presence in the borough. 
''There's no doubt New York is the biggest prize that exists with respect to this business,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ''I don't blame them for going after it, but I think it's going to be really hard for them.''
Manhattan residents have so many options for fresh-food deliveries and so many sources for groceries, including corner bodegas and Whole Foods markets, that it will be a challenge for Peapod to break through, especially after giving Fresh Direct such a long head start.
''It's going to be a pretty vicious fight,'' Ms. Mulpuru said.
That could be good news for New Yorkers who get their food from guys driving around in big trucks, and may see a price war. ''I think there will be a lot of aggressive offers to try out the Peapod service and aggressive offers from Fresh Direct to try to preserve their turf,'' she said.
The two companies have co-existed in Queens and parts of Westchester County and Long Island for years. But last fall, Peapod started delivering to customers in some Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.
Then, in November, Peapod tested out delivery in a few areas on the Upper East Side, said David McHugh, its vice president and general manager. He said the company had stayed away from Manhattan because of the difficulty of maneuvering through traffic, finding places to park trucks and, in some buildings, hauling groceries up several flights of stairs.
Mr. McHugh recalled a ride-along he did with a driver in November: ''There were not a lot of elevators. Our drivers are definitely going to have to walk up a lot of stairs. They're all in good shape.''
Mr. McHugh acknowledged that Peapod had budgeted twice as much money to pay parking tickets -- the scourge of grocery deliverers -- in Manhattan as it had for other cities it operates in, like Boston and Washington. But he would not say how much that was.
As Peg Merzbacher, Peapod's director of marketing, put it: ''You have to sell a lot of cans of peas to cover one parking ticket.'' She said the company would have two workers in each truck so that one could move it if a ticket agent arrived.
Peapod hopes to eventually have at least 20 trucks carrying groceries to Manhattan from a Stop & Shop store in Mount Vernon, N.Y., about 15 miles north of Midtown.
Peapod started out in Chicago as an independent company but was acquired by Ahold, a Dutch retailer that owns the Stop & Shop.
Peapod customers choose from a list of the store's most popular items, which are kept in an adjacent space that the company calls a ''wareroom.'' The delivery fee is $9.95 for a minimum order of $60, which drops to $6.95 for orders of $100 or more. Nationally, Peapod's average order is about 60 items that cost about $158. Peapod's delivery fees are higher than Fresh Direct's, which cost $5.99 in Manhattan, with a minimum order of $30, a Fresh Direct spokeswoman said.
Fresh Direct is not affiliated with a supermarket. It assembles orders at a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, and delivers them around the city and to Westchester, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. Fresh Direct says its typical order in Manhattan is about $120.
Jason Ackerman, the founder and chief executive of Fresh Direct, responded to Peapod's incursion by focusing not on his company's delivery service but on what he said was its higher-quality food. ''Fresh Direct has a very loyal customer base due to our highest-quality fresh-from-the-farm products, highest standards of customer service and high value,'' Mr. Ackerman said.
Polly Klein, 32, is one of those loyal customers, having received deliveries to her Midtown apartment at least twice a week for more than two years. But Ms. Klein, who sells floral arrangements, said on Friday that she planned to take Peapod up on an offer of $15 off her first order.
''I think their prices are kind of high, but you're also paying for convenience,'' Ms. Klein said of Fresh Direct. ''That's why I also want to try Peapod.'' Ms. Klein said she had just spent about $60 to have Fresh Direct deliver a few prepared meals, some pasta, broccoli, feta cheese and about 20 juice oranges. She said she might buy basic items, like the seltzer her husband guzzles, from Peapod if it proves to be cheaper.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise 1%, but Consumer Confidence Wanes as Gasoline Prices Escalate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Retail sales in February posted the largest gain in four months, but a slump in consumer confidence in early March on rising gasoline prices raised concerns that spending would decline.
Sales rose 1.0 percent, in an eighth consecutive month of gains, as shoppers stepped up purchases of autos, clothes and other goods even as they spent more for gasoline, the Commerce Department said on Friday.
But rising gasoline prices sent consumer confidence tumbling to a five-month low in early March, a separate report showed. 
''The last few weeks have been difficult for consumers. We are likely going to see weaker spending in March,'' said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa. ''High gas prices will impede the recovery, but won't derail it. It's a speed bump.''
While consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the nation's economic activity, was expected to moderate after growing at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, economists said rising gasoline prices could cause a much bigger pullback than had been anticipated.
Though the government revised the January retail sales gain up to 0.7 percent from 0.3 percent previously, most economists have trimmed forecasts for consumer spending and economic growth for the first quarter.
A JPMorgan economist, Michael Feroli, who said first-quarter consumer spending was tracking a 2 percent rate, cut his first-quarter growth estimate to 2.5 percent, from 3.5 percent, taking into account a surge in imports reported earlier this week and softer spending.
The economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2010.
Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has pushed crude oil prices above $100 a barrel, lifting gasoline prices 3.7 percent in February and straining consumer pocketbooks.
''In an economy that relies on oil, gas prices affect everybody,'' President Obama said at a White House news conference. ''For Americans already facing tough times it's an added burden,'' he said, adding that the administration stood ready to release emergency oil stockpiles if needed.
With prices at the pump continuing to rise, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment slipped to a reading of 68.2 this month, from 77.5 in February. The Energy Information Administration said this week that households would pay an average of $700 more for gasoline this year than in 2010.
Higher prices pushed receipts at gasoline stations up by 1.4 percent, but sales rose 0.9 percent even excluding gasoline, underscoring consumers' resilience.
Auto sales rose 2.3 percent, clothing sales gained 0.8 percent and receipts at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores increased 1.3 percent. Sales of building materials and garden equipment were up 0.6 percent.
So-called core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline and building materials, rose 0.6 percent. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's measure of economic growth.
''Should gas prices remain elevated for an extended period, as anticipated by many analysts, consumers are likely to have to trim other spending,'' said Jim Baird, a partner at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.
''Nonetheless, that impact may be mitigated to a degree by frugality fatigue and the general sense that the economy is improving.''

HEADLINE: Deciding Which Teachers to Lay Off

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Last In, Most Worried'' (news article, March 6) highlights young teachers whose jobs are at risk because of their lack of seniority. But there are good arguments to be made for seniority.
Teaching is a craft that develops over time, with five to seven years the typical maturation period. Half of new teachers will not stay in teaching through their fifth year, even if there are no layoffs. 
A first- or second-year teacher is not as accomplished as one with 10 or 15 years of experience, but is much less expensive. Using performance as a criterion for dismissal is a smokescreen used to divert attention away from the real agenda: saving money on salaries and benefits.
Veteran teachers can also be at risk of dismissal because they are not cronies of their principal, are ''union people'' or work in schools where student attendance and lack of parental involvement are major obstacles to student success.
To paraphrase Winston Churchill, ''last in, first out'' may be the worst system, except for all the others.
Stewart Singer Plainview, N.Y., March 6, 2011
The writer was a public school teacher for 40 years.
To the Editor:
Education is a social science and not a business. Let's develop a system to grade teachers on what they do with what they've got, but don't think that comparing class test scores year to year is the same as Macy's looking at ''same store sales'' this year versus a year ago.
Ask any teacher: students are individuals; class composition from the same neighborhood differs from year to year; and the surrounding social and economic environment changes in unpredictable ways.
Carter L. Colter Milford, Conn., March 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Seniority-based systems for promotion and dismissal have numerous virtues. Their application is simple, low-cost and transparent, with little potential for illegal discrimination. They reward employee loyalty and encourage work force stability and retention.
While I believe that performance-based systems are potentially superior, the critics of seniority systems should accept that it is difficult, time-consuming and very expensive to develop and implement valid measures of performance in many types of jobs, particularly teaching. A poorly designed system can be more costly, cumbersome and discriminatory without being more accurate in its ability to differentiate good teachers from bad.
Performance-based evaluation systems are common in the private sector. I would ask any employee who is clamoring for them to be applied immediately to teachers to answer a simple question: How fair and accurate do you think your annual performance appraisal was?
David J. Prottas Garden City, N.Y., March 6, 2011
The writer is an assistant professor at the Adelphi University School of Business.
To the Editor:
Re ''Critics Say Cuomo's Teacher Plan Falls Short on Seniority Rule for Layoffs'' (news article, March 3):
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is quoted as saying, ''The length of time that you have worked is irrelevant to whether or not you can do what our children need to be self-sufficient as they become adults, and to enjoy the great American dream.''
I would like to ask the mayor if he is willing to fire his staff and replace them with newly graduated college students; whether time, experience and practice haven't made him any better at his job; and whether that is the lesson he'd like our children to learn: Practice makes you ... no more perfect.

HEADLINE: Borrowing Again, But Less on Credit Cards

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris writes about finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
AMERICAN consumers are borrowing again, but many are still reluctant to run up credit card debts.
The Federal Reserve Board reported this week that the amount of outstanding nonrevolving consumer debt -- term loans to pay for things like cars, education or vacations -- rose $9.3 billion in January to a record $1.617 trillion. 
It was the first month in which the total of such loans surpassed the precredit-crisis peak of $1.609 trillion, in July 2008, two months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused a sharp tightening of lending standards.
But the amount of credit card debt outstanding in January fell by $4.2 billion, to $795.5 billion. That was the lowest figure in more than six years. There had been a slight rise in credit card debt outstanding in December, the first in more than two years, but that gain was offset.
As the accompanying charts show, there had never been a year-over-year decline in credit card balances before the current downturn. The pace of decline has slowed in recent months, but it is continuing.
Only part of the decline in credit card balances reflects consumer choice, and it is difficult to quantify how large a role that has played. Some of the decline can be attributed to banks writing off delinquent balances, but the rate of such write-offs has fallen in recent months.
In addition, banks canceled many cards and scaled back credit limits for others during the credit crisis, forcing many consumers to reduce credit card balances whether or not they wished to do so.
But that, too, is changing. In the final three months of last year, according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from credit bureau reports, the number of outstanding credit cards rose. It was the first such increase since 2007, but the increase in cards did not translate to an increase in outstanding balances.
The charts also contrast the trends in consumer credit during and after the current recession with the trends during the 1990-1 downturn. Each chart shows the change in outstanding loans from the peaks that came several months into the recession.
In the early 1990s, consumers cut back less, and all the decline was in nonrevolving credit. Outstanding credit card balances continued to rise throughout the downturn. In the current downturn, the fall in nonrevolving credit was not as steep as in credit card borrowing.
In the 2001 recession, consumer credit never stopped growing, although the rate of growth in credit card balances slowed.
Banks were telling the Federal Reserve for several quarters that they were becoming a little more generous in extending consumer credit, and the rise in nonrevolving loans appears to bear that out.

HEADLINE: Looking to Lead Canada, and for a Little Name Recognition

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA
MICHAEL IGNATIEFF may have written 17 books, gained some fame on British television as a serious thinker and led a human rights center at Harvard. But all that appeared to count for little when he laced up his skates and headed out on the 19th-century canal this city uses as a giant ice rink.
After spending most of his adult life outside of Canada, Mr. Ignatieff, 63, returned home six years ago with the ambitious goal of becoming prime minister. If current political speculation is correct, he will finally have a chance this spring to put his case before the Canadian people.
But as he skated through a bitter wind on the Rideau Canal with 10 children and a gaggle of adults for a photo opportunity, no one approached him or even waved. In a random sampling, few of the skaters that day even knew his name. 
Perhaps they did not recognize him in his hockey jersey and headband.
For all he has tried, Mr. Ignatieff has yet to connect closely with the average Canadian, and in the next few months, as he tries to lead the Liberal Party back to power, he will find out once and for all whether he ever will.
In an interview, Mr. Ignatieff (pronounced ig-NAT-ee-ef) openly acknowledged that his previous life -- which included leading BBC camera crews into Balkan war zones and helping shape America's debate over the invasion of Iraq as director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard, had not fully prepared him for the battle of electoral politics.
''It is, by a country mile, the most difficult thing I've ever tried to do,'' Mr. Ignatieff said last week in the grand paneled parliamentary office that comes with his title of Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition. ''I've done a lot of things. I'm proud of them. But this one is just at another level of sheer difficulty. It takes everything out of you.''
Even without an election call, the governing Conservative Party has already flooded ''Hockey Night In Canada'' and other popular shows with attack ads portraying Mr. Ignatieff as an interloper who is filled with patronizing contempt for his birthplace.
''I don't care what they say about me, that's not the issue,'' Mr. Ignatieff said. ''There came a moment at Harvard when I thought that I had to decide: do I want to be a spectator, or teacher, in someone else's country? I was frustrated by the fact that you could keep writing these articles and nothing would happen. It was time to come home and take responsibility. I don't want to get on my high horse about it but there was something there, existentially.''
ASSUMING authority is something of a theme in Mr. Ignatieff's family history. His father, George, who left Russia at the age of 6 and ultimately became a prominent diplomat in Canada, was the son of the last czar's education minister and a princess. His mother, Alison, came from a family whose members helped lay out the route for the transcontinental railway that stitched the country together and played leading roles in creating Canada's modern education system. Even for a country with a tightly connected elite, it is an unusually illustrious history. But Canada is also a country where politicians with even the vaguest hint of self-importance are more likely to be mocked on satirical television programs than revered, potentially making his family history a political liability. It is a problem, Mr. Ignatieff said, that he is willing to bear.
''The egalitarianism which makes us very vigilant about public officials is a very good thing,'' he said. ''It's not just idle social compassion. This is what makes this place go.''
Mr. Ignatieff said that Canada fared much better than the United States during the recession because its sense of egalitarianism has led to a stronger public education system, public health care, tighter regulation of business and a wider range of social programs. Those programs, he argues, have been steadily eroded by the Conservative government that came to power in 2006.
Like many of the ancestors in his mother's family who went abroad, Mr. Ignatieff concluded that he would never be fully a part of life in either of his adopted homes in London and Cambridge, Mass.
''I know quite a bit about expatriation,'' he said. ''You always hit a glass ceiling.''
In Britain, that realization came when he was told that he would not be given a television project because he was Canadian. In the United States, it was more a matter of gradual alienation. Mr. Ignatieff said he found the debates in the last decade about stem cell research, abortion and public health care almost baffling.
''What are they arguing about?'' he recalled thinking. ''I don't want to overstate this, as I love American politics. But you do come up that it's not your home.''
SELLING his social vision over that of Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister, has not been easy. He was appointed Liberal leader in late 2008, but soon discovered how hard it is for opposition leaders to set the agenda or even to attract news media attention. On a visibility scale, they rank somewhere between vice presidents and lieutenant governors.
During his four years at Harvard, Mr. Ignatieff was known for his hawkish policy positions. That culminated in an article for The New York Times Magazine in 2003 in which he supported the Iraq invasion. It was a position so out of line with Canadian thinking that even Mr. Harper, who otherwise enthusiastically embraces the use of Canada's military, backed away from it as the invasion soured.
In 2007, Mr. Ignatieff acknowledged that he was wrong in another article for the same magazine. But the episode may blunt his effectiveness in foreign affairs during any election campaign, even though he has a clear advantage in knowledge and experience over Mr. Harper. An economist by training, Mr. Harper rarely left Canada before taking office.
Neither man is a natural campaigner. But while Mr. Harper usually restricts himself to tightly controlled events and audiences, Mr. Ignatieff has been actively seeking hands to shake and questions to answer. He spent most of last summer traveling the country in a chartered bus, a dry-run campaign that he said he enjoyed.
''They want to poke you. They want to see what you're made of,'' Mr. Ignatieff said of voters. ''They're very demanding and extremely well informed. Sometimes it's a bit scary.''
When Mr. Ignatieff first returned to Canada, he was instantly, and perhaps predictably, compared with Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former Liberal prime minister whose charismatic leadership many Liberals still hope to recapture.
Both men were latecomers to elected politics, equally at ease speaking French or English, and both might be fairly described as public intellectuals. Not tweedy intellectuals but handsome, fit and more youthful in appearance than their ages would suggest.
But it is an analogy that soon falls flat. Mr. Trudeau, for the most part, remained in Canada and was active in political debates and causes long before seeking election. He was so well known by the time he became prime minister in 1968 that his ability to draw crowds was known as Trudeau-mania.
For Mr. Ignatieff, the first step will be simply to introduce himself to Canadian voters. While he was untying his skates at the end of the photo opportunity last month, a small crowd did gather and some excitement built -- Justin Trudeau, the 39-year-old son of the former prime minister and, for now at least, a Liberal member of Parliament from Montreal, had shown up.

HEADLINE: Give Up Familiar Light Bulb? Not Without Fight, Some Say

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American protests against the encroachment of government have been spurred by many causes -- tea, of course, and guns, frequently. The latest catalyst: light bulbs.
A 2007 bill, passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush, will make the familiar incandescent bulb subject to strict efficiency standards next year.
The effect will be to make current 100-watt bulbs obsolete -- and that has sent conservative lawmakers, libertarians, some environmental activists and owners of Easy-Bake Ovens into a frenzy of activity to get the law repealed or, at least, to stockpile the bulbs before they disappear from store shelves. 
''I do care about my carbon footprint, not to mention my light bill,'' said Dana Carpender, a cookbook author in Bloomington, Ind. ''But unless something dramatic happens to bring down the cost of alternatives, I will be stashing away a pile of incandescents.''
The law does not outlaw incandescent bulbs or dictate that consumers must use the spiral-shaped compact fluorescent lights that have become increasingly popular in recent years. Rather, it sets standards for the amount of light emitted per watt of power used. Current 100-watt bulbs must become 25 percent more efficient, and makers are designing new bulbs.
To Representative Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who has sponsored a bill to reverse the new guidelines, that nevertheless means Congress is dictating what types of light Americans can use in their homes.
''From the health insurance you're allowed to have, to the car you can drive, to the light bulbs you can buy, Washington is making too many decisions that are better left to you and your family,'' Mr. Barton said when he introduced his bill in January.
Opponents of the regulations say the fluorescent bulbs are too expensive, flicker annoyingly and are health hazards because they contain mercury.
While they are not unanimous on the issue, some environmental activists counter that by saying the mercury in a single fluorescent bulb is less than what some power plants throw into the atmosphere while generating the electricity it takes to light one incandescent bulb.
Makers of appliances and light bulbs, meanwhile, support the federal standards because they do not want to have to make scores of products to meet individual state regulations.
But to many Americans, the 100-watt bulb has become a cause celebre.
Tea Party campaigners have adopted it; Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who introduced a bill to repeal the light bulb law in 2008 and again this year, talked about the issue in her response to the president's State of the Union message in January. And this week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said not only did he resent the light bulb standards but he also blamed the government for poorly working toilets in his house because of the regulations on how much water they should use.
The light bulb regulations already have affected the American economy. Last fall, General Electric closed its last major United States plant producing the old-style incandescent bulbs, in Winchester, Va.
Nearly all compact fluorescent bulbs are made in Asia, although some United States manufacturers are retooling former factories to make other energy-efficient bulbs.
Several companies in the United States are working on light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs, and on energy-efficient halogen incandescent bulbs, which use a halogen element enclosed in a traditional glass bulb.
The Energy Department says the energy savings are significant. Kathleen Hogan, deputy assistant secretary for energy efficiency at the department, told a Senate committee this week that by meeting the new lighting standards, consumers could save nearly $6 billion in 2015.
A household that upgrades 15 current incandescent bulbs could save about $50 a year, Ms. Hogan said, even after accounting for the higher cost of the fluorescent bulbs, which average above $1 each, versus about 35 cents for incandescent.
Halogen incandescent bulbs now cost about $1.50 each, and LED bulbs, which have only begun to be introduced, can cost $20 or more each, though they can last 10 years or more. Three-way bulbs, appliance bulbs and a few other specialty products are excluded from the new standards.
All of which serves to convince some people that the government should not dictate light bulb standards.
Amy Ridenour, president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative group, said she already had about 100 old-style incandescent light bulbs stored in her basement in Laurel, Md., and she hoped to have several hundred by the time the new standards go into effect on Jan. 1.
Ms. Ridenour said that she opposed the government interference, but that her hoarding was primarily driven by concerns about the mercury in the compact fluorescent bulbs. Her middle child, a 10-year-old son, is autistic, Ms. Ridenour said. ''He's knocked over quite a few lamps,'' she said, and broken plenty of light bulbs in the process.
The Environmental Protection Agency issues detailed instructions on how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb because of the potential for spilling mercury. Each bulb contains about four milligrams of mercury, compared with 500 milligrams in old-style glass thermometers.
Nevertheless, the E.P.A. recommends recycling used fluorescent bulbs rather than disposing of them in household garbage.
Unknown, so far, is the economic impact of the retooling of the Easy-Bake Oven, the source of an unimaginable number of forced smiles summoned by parents after tasting a child's cookies and cakes. The oven, a member of the National Toy Hall of Fame, uses a 100-watt bulb as its heat source, so Hasbro must give it a makeover. This fall, it will introduce the new Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven, which will use a different, so far undisclosed, heating element.

HEADLINE: Where Age Is What You Say It Is

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The fake ID has gone digital, and spread to elementary school.
Across the nation, millions of young people are lying about their ages so they can create accounts on popular sites like Facebook and Myspace. These sites require users to be 13 or older, to avoid federal regulations that apply to sites with younger members. But to children, that rule is a minor obstacle that stands between them and what everybody else is doing.
Parents regularly go along with the age inflation, giving permission and helping children set up accounts. They often see it as a minor fib that is necessary to let their children participate in the digital world.
Plenty of people fudge the truth about their age, whether to buy beer or project a younger image to potential mates. But researchers and other critics say allowing children to break the rules sends the wrong message. And, they argue, it sets children loose in a digital world they may not be prepared for -- exposing them to the real-life threats of inappropriate content, contact from strangers and the growing incidents of bullying by computer. 
''Not only are kids lying about their age, but more often than not, parents teach them to lie about their age,'' said Danah Boyd, a social media researcher at Microsoft.
Ms. Boyd said this ran counter to the goal of getting parents more constructively involved in children's online activities, which was one aim of the legislation that spawned the age restrictions in the first place.
At the same time, the practice is hard to stop, say Web sites and federal officials. Sites try to catch under-age users -- ''We are not burying our head in the sand,'' said Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer at Facebook -- but verifying a young person's age over the Internet is a task that ranges from tricky to near impossible.
Cristina Flores, 44, a nurse in San Francisco, said she had decided to allow her 11-year-old son to get onto Facebook rather than deny it to him and risk that he would sign up behind her back. Besides, she said, she did not realize there were any age restrictions on the site.
''It's not like there's a legal age limit for being on the Internet,'' Ms. Flores said.
Her son Jake said he had told Facebook that he was 15: ''I just picked something random.''
In one of Jake's fifth-grade classes at Commodore Sloat Elementary school, 15 of the 30 students said they had Facebook accounts.
''And you should see all the third-graders who are on,'' said Aundrea Kaune, the class's teacher. Last year, she went onto Facebook and was shocked by how many students from the school were there.
''It's lying -- and about age,'' Ms. Kaune said. ''What happens when they want to drink beer?''
The risks for under-age members of social networks are not theoretical. Hemanshu Nigam, the former chief security officer of Myspace, who now runs an Internet safety consulting business, recounted a recent incident from his business. In New York State, he said, an 11-year-old boy accepted a friend request on Facebook from a girl in his class. But the girl's account was fake, and the person behind it began posting images of the boy on sex-oriented sites, along with nasty comments.
When the boy's images started showing up in Google searches, the school suspected that he had posted them and summoned his parents. Other children began picking on him.
''It can be a living nightmare for an 11-year-old who just wanted to hang out with his friends,'' Mr. Nigam said.
In 2006, 31 percent of 12-year-olds in the United States were using social networks, according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. That figure grew to 38 percent by mid-2009, when the survey was last conducted.
ComScore, a firm that measures Internet traffic, estimates that 3.6 million of Facebook's 153 million monthly visitors in this country are under 12. Some of those visitors may not have Facebook accounts and may simply be visiting public pages, comScore said. (It reached that figure by cross-referencing its own traffic analysis with household demographics.)
Internet companies have set up the rules against under-age users because they must comply with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, passed in 1998, which says Web sites that collect information from children younger than 13 must obtain parental consent.
Obtaining that consent is complex and expensive, so companies like Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, reject anyone who tries to sign up using an age below 13. Google, Facebook and Yahoo all declined to talk about how many children jump the barriers, but they say they try to enforce the rules.
Mr. Sullivan of Facebook said the company blocked new registrations or deleted the accounts of thousands of under-age users every day.
But some children's advocates say these companies are not publicly owning up to the scope of the problem.
''There is no question that Facebook has to be aware that they have a very large number of under-13 members on the site,'' said Larry Magid, a co-director of ConnectSafely, a nonprofit group that provides information to parents and children.
Mr. Magid and other researchers say the social networks fail to provide under-age users with tools that might protect them.
''Facebook has no resources to help the younger kids, and that's not good,'' he said.
Facebook does have measures to protect older teenagers from predators, but children who pretend to be older than 18 are bypassing even those safeguards, which place restrictions on how widely minors can share information and who can contact them on the site.
The Federal Trade Commission, which is charged with enforcing the child protection act, acknowledges the problem. But Mary K. Engle, associate director for advertising practices at the commission, said there was no good solution.
In 2008, state attorneys general concerned about child predators helped set up a task force to research online age verification. It concluded that creating a reliable system would be extremely difficult.
''I don't think anyone knows how to prevent a kid from lying about their age,'' Ms. Engle said.
Victoria Lai, 14, a ninth grader at Galileo Academy of Science and Technology in San Francisco, is a repeat offender.
''The first one was Yahoo, in second grade,'' said Victoria. ''I did it to play games.'' She followed up by faking her birth date to join Myspace, Facebook and YouTube. ''I always say I was born in 1986, not 1996, because it's just one number different. Easy to remember.''
In Victoria's fifth-period honors English class, all 32 students said they had faked their birth year to gain access to one site or another.
Victoria's father, Brian Lai, an airline mechanic, said young people ''have to have experience using the Internet. It's the future.'' He said Victoria told him she was going onto the sites, and he told her: ''It's not good to lie, but you can make an exception.''
Jerry Ng, Victoria's 14-year-old cousin, agreed. ''It's one thing to lie to a person,'' he said. ''But this is lying to a computer.''
Jerry and Victoria said they were using the sites responsibly: chatting with friends, checking out videos and playing games. And Victoria said her fib had caused only one real hiccup; she appears to be stuck with her incorrect age. After she turned 13, she tried unsuccessfully to turn her birth date back to her real one.
''It wouldn't let me,'' she said. ''So I guess I'll just leave it at that.''

BYLINE: By NGOZI OKONJO-IWEALA and DILIP RATHA. 
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is the managing director of the World Bank. Dilip Ratha is the manager of its Migration and Remittances Unit.

 BODY:
HERE'S a statistic you may not be aware of: about 50 percent of the world's uncultivated, arable land is in Africa. This abundance of potential farmland offers Africa the opportunity to feed itself and to help feed the rest of the globe. But consider another statistic: because of poor roads and a lack of storage, African farmers can lose up to 50 percent of their crop just trying to get it to market.
In other words, Africa needs not only greater investment in agriculture, but also in roads, ports and other facilities that are vital to moving the land's products to consumers. Fortunately, part of the solution could lie with the almost 23 million African migrants around the globe, who together have an annual savings of more than $30 billion. Tapping into this money with so-called diaspora bonds could help provide Africa with the equipment and services it needs for long-term growth and poverty reduction. 
These diaspora bonds would be in essence structured like any bonds on the market, but would be sold by governments, private companies and public-private partnerships to Africans living abroad. The bonds would be sold in small denominations, from $100 to $10,000, to individual investors or, in larger denominations, to institutional and foreign investors.
Preliminary estimates suggest that sub-Saharan African countries (excluding South Africa, which doesn't have significant emigration) could raise $5 billion to $10 billion a year through diaspora bonds. Countries like Ghana, Kenya and Zambia, which have fairly large numbers of migrants living abroad in high-income countries, would particularly profit from issuing diaspora bonds.
There are precedents for such moves. Greece announced this week that it was preparing to issue $3 billion worth of diaspora bonds in the United States. India and Israel have issued diaspora bonds in the past, raising over $35 billion, often in times of financial crises.
Why would diaspora bonds work so well? For one thing, the idea taps into emigrants' continuing patriotism and desire to give back to their home countries. And because diaspora populations often build strong webs of churches, community groups and newspapers, bond issuers would be able to tap into a ready-made marketing network.
Another advantage of diaspora bonds for African countries is that migrants make more stable investors in their home countries than people without local knowledge. They're less likely to pull out at the first sign of trouble. And they wouldn't demand the same high rate of interest as a foreign investor, who wants to compensate for the risk of investing in what would seem to them like a relatively unknown developing country.
Diaspora bonds could also be issued in the local currency, as migrants are likely to be less averse to the risk of currency devaluation. That's because members of the diaspora have more use for local currency than foreign investors; migrants can always use it when they go back home or for family-related expenses.
Take, for example, an African living in the United States who now earns an annual interest rate of less than 1 percent on small deposits; a diaspora bond with an interest rate of about 5 percent certainly might seem attractive. To make the bond even more appealing, the countries the migrants reside in could provide tax breaks on interest income. Donor or multilateral aid agencies could also offer credit enhancements in the form of partial guarantees, to mitigate default risks.
Even more money could flow into Africa if countries tapped into the billions of dollars that members of the diaspora send home each year by using those remittances as collateral to raise financing from international markets. This approach has allowed banks in several developing countries -- including Brazil, Egypt, El Salvador, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Turkey -- to raise more than $15 billion since 2000.
Here's how this works: When a migrant transfers foreign currency to a relative's creditworthy bank in his home country, the bank pays out the remittance from its holding of local currency. That transaction creates a foreign currency asset equivalent to the size of the remittance, which can be used as collateral for borrowing cheaply and over the long term in overseas capital markets.
Such borrowing has no effect on the flow of money from migrants to their beneficiaries. Yet development banks, national banks in developing countries and donor agencies can partner to harness enough remittances and create enough collateral to raise significant sums of money to invest in agriculture, roads, housing and other vital projects.
The people of Africa are scattered around the globe, but many still feel a powerful sense of belonging to the continent. Through diaspora bonds and remittances, they could create a better future for their homeland.

HEADLINE: Union Bill Is Law, but Debate Is Far From Over

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Monica Davey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MADISON, Wis. -- Gov. Scott Walker on Friday signed into law a bill that limits bargaining rights for most government workers, ending a rancorous legislative battle but doing little to stem a loud and continuing debate -- here and around the country -- over the future of unions.
Democrats and union leaders, emboldened by the huge outpouring of protesters who have rallied for weeks at the Capitol to oppose what they called a politically motivated effort to weaken unions, pledged to redouble their political, legal and legislative efforts to block measures that the governor had described as necessary to balance the budget. 
Recall petitions continued to circulate against legislators from both parties. A lawsuit was filed challenging the unusual legislative maneuvering that preceded the bill's passage. And Democratic leaders -- despite holding minorities in both chambers -- promised to revisit the legislation in the debate on the coming budget bill by introducing a series of amendments to undo provisions they consider damaging.
The new law was originally part of Mr. Walker's comprehensive ''budget repair bill,'' but was extracted as a separate piece of legislation late on Wednesday in order to secure passage. The original budget bill was blocked when 14 Senate Democrats decamped for Illinois, depriving the Senate of the quorum needed to pass fiscal legislation.
The bill on collective bargaining, however, could be voted on with fewer senators, in this case Republicans only, and it passed, 18 to 1. The Assembly, overwhelmingly Republican, passed it on Thursday.
The new law weakens unions representing public sector employees by limiting bargaining to wages, restricting raises to inflation, increasing the amount employees pay for health insurance and pensions, and giving union members the right not to pay dues. It also requires unions to hold annual votes to determine if workers still want to belong. The law exempts firefighters and law enforcement personnel.
After a ceremonial bill-signing during which chants of ''shame, shame'' could be heard from the protesters packing the Capitol's hallways, Mr. Walker praised Republicans for their efforts. He said the law would allow state and local government to better address budgetary challenges and noted that earlier in the day he canceled layoff notices for 1,500 state employees. The governor said the law would survive all challenges.
Though both Democratic and Republican leaders professed a desire to return to work, it was unclear if lawmakers would take a scheduled break, or when the rest of the budget repair bill would be brought to a vote. ''There are a lot of decisions that have to be made and a lot of talks that need to happen between the two sides,'' said Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader.
And there are still obstacles. The law does not take effect until it is published, and Secretary of State Doug La Follette, a Democrat, said he planned on waiting the full 10 days before doing so. ''As fast as this was pushed through, as controversial as it has been, I think it's only prudent,'' he said.
Officials from Dane County, which encompasses Madison, went to court seeking an emergency injunction to prevent the law from taking effect, alleging violations of open meeting laws and quorum requirements. The judge denied the motion and scheduled a hearing for Wednesday.
The Dane County district attorney is also investigating the open meetings allegations.
As the day wound down, preparations continued for what union officials said would be a huge rally on Saturday, featuring the return to the Capitol of the 14 Democratic state senators who spent more than three weeks hiding out in Illinois to deprive the Republican majority of a quorum.
''It's the beginning,'' said Robert Jauch, one of the senators, after returning to the state. ''Today becomes the first day in the effort to restore these rights.''

HEADLINE: Energy Policy Defended As Gasoline Prices Rise

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With rising gasoline prices fueling public pain, President Obama defended his energy policies on Friday against critics who claim he has pushed prices up by clamping down on domestic oil production.
The president sought to reassure the public that global oil supplies were adequate to weather the current political instability in the Middle East and ruled out an immediate release of oil from the nation's strategic petroleum stockpile.
Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference that domestic oil production in 2010 was the highest in seven years and that he was prepared to encourage new drilling on public lands and offshore. ''So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn't match up with reality,'' he said. 
In fact, Mr. Obama had little immediate comfort to offer the public, other than to explain that the administration was pursuing long-term policy to wean the nation from its dependence on imported oil.
Late Friday, the Interior Department said that it had approved a permit to allow resumption of drilling on one rig in the Gulf of Mexico, which had been halted by the moratorium imposed after the Deepwater Horizon accident last April. It was the second deepwater permit issued since the accident.
The House speaker, John A. Boehner, who has led Congressional Republicans in using the recent price increases to ratchet up political criticism of the president's energy policies, accused the administration of blocking new oil and gas production by slowing the granting of offshore permits and declaring some public lands off-limits to drilling.
''While the Obama administration claims to be committed to American energy production, the facts and its own actions say otherwise,'' Mr. Boehner said after the president spoke.
Mr. Obama's response to the oil price spike echoed what he said during the 2008 presidential campaign, when prices rose even higher than they are today: that the nation alternates between shock and trance on energy policy, depending on the price of a gallon of gasoline.
''We've been having this conversation for nearly four decades now,'' Mr. Obama said Friday. ''Every few years, gas prices go up; politicians pull out the same old political playbook, and then nothing changes. When prices go back down, we slip back into a trance. And then when prices go up, suddenly we're shocked. I think the American people are tired of that. I think they're tired of talk.''
Mr. Obama also tried to calm oil and financial markets that have been spooked in recent weeks by unrest in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East. He said that he was working with other oil-producing nations to ensure a steady supply of oil so that economic growth is not slowed by higher prices.
The president said he was prepared to open the spigot on the 727-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve if there were a sudden and more severe supply disruption than has occurred to date. But he declined to specify what price gas would have to hit before the government would tap the reserve.
He cited the 1970s oil embargo and the refinery shutdowns caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as appropriate thresholds for using the reserve.
''If we see significant disruptions or shifts in the market that are so disconcerting to people that we think a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release might be appropriate, then we'll take that step,'' he said. He added that a potential release is ''teed up,'' so that it would take only a few days to start the oil flowing if he decided to take that step.
As gas prices have climbed in recent weeks, Republicans in Congress and oil industry executives have grown increasingly vocal in their complaints about the drilling policy, saying that the Interior Department overreacted to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill by temporarily halting all new offshore drilling.
Oil production in the gulf is projected to decline this year and next, partly as a result of the moratorium.
But Mr. Obama said Friday that the department had granted 37 new permits for wells in shallow water and recently approved one new deepwater permit as companies have come into compliance with tougher new safety and environmental rules. Officials have said they are prepared to act quickly on a half-dozen other pending permit applications as soon as oil companies demonstrate they have the capability of responding to a major accident.
''We are encouraging offshore exploration and production,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We're just doing it responsibly. I don't think anybody has forgotten that we're only a few months removed from the worst oil spill in our history. So what we've done is to put in place common-sense standards like proving that companies can actually contain an underwater spill.''
The president also noted that oil companies have unused leases on millions of acres of public land.

HEADLINE: Democrats See Wisconsin Loss As Galvanizing

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE and MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
Even as the Republican governor of Wisconsin was signing a bill Friday that all but ended collective bargaining for state employees, Democrats nationally had put out advertisements and letters to use his own success against him.
In a push to raise money for their candidates, Democrats hope Wisconsin will be for them what the health care overhaul was for Republicans in last year's midterm elections: a galvanizing force for their base, and an example of overreaching that will win them crucial independent voters, not just in Wisconsin but also in Congressional races and the presidential election next year.
They point to polls showing that the same level of intensity that helped Republicans campaigning against health care is now behind Democrats on the issue of collective bargaining. Gov. Scott Walker's refusal to compromise with Democrats has given them a vivid way to demonstrate the point they tried unsuccessfully to make during the midterms: that Republicans are motivated by ideology, not just budget balancing.
''This is one of the uglier examples of the tyranny of a temporary majority, and I think it's going to backfire badly,'' said Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. 
''Democratic governors are facing some of the same budget challenges, and we're asking for some of the same concessions, but we're staying at the table and working with our work force and their union representatives,'' he said. ''The Republicans are taking advantage of the economic downturn to sharpen their ideological axes and settle old scores.''
Polls and the impassioned crowds who have jeered Mr. Walker and the Republican-led Legislature outside the Capitol in Madison, Wis., offer some evidence to lift Democrats' hopes.
But for all the trumpeting of how Mr. Walker's bill has awakened a sleeping giant of once-dispirited Democrats and union members, it will undeniably weaken labor, historically a key voting bloc for the party. And even some Democrats say that whatever the energy now, that will hurt the party long term.
Still, reactions among Republicans suggest that they, too, recognize that their party might suffer, given national polls showing that most Americans support collective bargaining rights. While fights over the cost of public workers and collective bargaining have emerged in a number of states, some Republican governors appear to be drawing careful distinctions between their own plans and Mr. Walker's.
''This is not Wisconsin,'' Rick Snyder, the newly elected Republican governor of Michigan, was quoted as telling a union group recently, even as protests were emerging in Lansing over a bill there that could allow emergency financial managers to overlook union contracts in the most financially distressed cities.
A Pew poll last week showed the number of people holding a very favorable view of unions had risen -- with a particularly sharp rise among liberal Democrats -- while the percentage of those holding negative views remained the same.
Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said other surveys had showed a gap of about two to one favoring the Democrats. ''That was the issue with health care reform,'' she said. ''It wasn't that we were losing 52-48, it was that twice as many people strongly disapproved as approved. It's the exact opposite now.''
Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, two Democratic groups, said they had jointly raised $200,000 in the 12 hours after the Wisconsin Senate approved Governor Walker's bill, and a total of $750,000 to run ads against Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature who are facing recall campaigns over the collective bargaining bill.
''On every front of the battle to take back the House -- fund-raising, volunteers, candidates -- what is happening in Madison is helping,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''People who we have talked about running now seem more energized by what's happening. They understand that this is part of an ongoing Republican attack on working families, and they want to fight back.''
Republicans counter that the energy will not last.
Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican majority leader in Wisconsin's Senate, said that by 2012, the fallout from this bill seemed more likely to him to harm Democrats' hopes for the state (which Mr. Obama easily won in 2008). ''I think once some of the union members wake up and say, 'I've got to wake up and write a check to the union every month?' union membership may quickly drop, and some of their power falls apart,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said.
Clearly, Wisconsin's move -- and the possibility that it spreads elsewhere -- holds real risks to the power of unions. The measure limits contract negotiations to matters of wages only, and even on that matter, raises would be limited to changes in the Consumer Price Index unless the public supports a higher raise in a referendum. Wisconsin will also end its practice of taking union dues out of most workers' paychecks, and Republicans have suggested those dues might now be something workers would rather keep for themselves, given that the bill increases their contributions to health care and pensions and shrinks unions' ability to negotiate.
As Wisconsin's situation boiled over on a national stage, other statehouses have been wrestling with similar measures, meant to solve budget gaps but also fraught with conflict for their potential effects on unions.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a Democrat, said that because of that, ''it temporarily energizes and potentially long-term destabilizes'' the party.
But the level of dissatisfaction that has greeted Mr. Walker's moves might also spread to other states. ''They object to what he's doing even though he's cutting taxes,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''Think about that -- it's extraordinary.''
An issue in Wisconsin or Iowa might seem unlikely to resonate in a Congressional race in California or Connecticut 18 months from now. But Democrats argue that the recall campaign against Republicans in Wisconsin would keep the issue alive.
And the emotions extend beyond Wisconsin, they say, to battles over Planned Parenthood, public broadcasting, and the Republicans' efforts to roll back environmental regulations.
''Nothing fights like a wounded cornered animal, and that's how progressives feel right now,'' said Jim Jordan, a Democratic strategist. ''And the public is going to see the ugliest possible side of the Republican Party.''
Ultimately, it may matter more how this affects independent voters, who have made the difference in the most recent elections.
Mr. Walker has said the entire episode in Wisconsin would be forgotten by most people once the state budget was balanced and new jobs had arrived, but Ms. Greenberg said the way Republicans forced the vote would turn off independent voters.
''We've had three change elections in a row, and in every instance, people would say what we want is for politicians to come together and get something done,'' she said, adding that Mr. Walker was ''dealing with this in a way that has really inflamed people, and Wisconsin has become symbolic.''
Mr. Jordan agreed. ''Independents are the most sensitive to overreach and ideological extremism,'' he said.

HEADLINE: How Flaws Undid Obama's Hope For High-Speed Rail in Florida

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The rest of the world calls them bullet trains because they go so fast. But in the United States, the nickname is apt for a different reason: They keep getting shot down.
The nation's first true high-speed railroad was supposed to leave the station in 2015, a sleek Tomorrowland-worthy train that would have whisked riders between Orlando and Tampa at speeds of up to 168 miles an hour.
The federal government had agreed to pay $2.4 billion of its estimated $2.6 billion in construction costs, railroad companies were vying to build and operate it, and state transportation planners had even dummied up proposed timetables: Train 7092 would depart Tampa at 8:10 a.m. and arrive in Orlando at 9:04 a.m.
The fast train was sought, and won, by Florida's former Republican governor, Charlie Crist. But it was killed last month by his successor, Rick Scott, who joined several other Republican governors in spurning federally financed train projects over fears that their states could be on the hook for future costs. The final nail in its coffin came last week when a Florida court ruled that the new governor could not be forced to accept the federal money and start building it. 
The demise of the Florida line is different, though. It will delay the country's first bullet train ride by years, if not longer, and deprive the Obama administration of what it had hoped would be a showpiece that would sell the rest of the nation on high-speed rail.
The administration said Friday that it would give Florida's $2.4 billion to rail projects elsewhere and invited other states to apply for the money.
The story of the line's rise and fall shows how it was ultimately undone by a tradeoff that was made when the route was first selected.
The Tampa-to-Orlando route had obvious drawbacks: It would have linked two cities that are virtually unnavigable without cars, and that are so close that the new train would have been little faster than driving. But the Obama administration chose it anyway because it was seen as the line that could be built first. Florida had already done much of the planning, gotten many of the necessary permits and owned most of the land that would be needed.
In the end, though, the state's new governor decided not to build it at all, worried that those very drawbacks would ultimately make it a boondoggle.
White House Seeks a Legacy
When the Obama administration chose Florida to get a large chunk of stimulus money to build the nation's first high-speed rail line, some Republicans in Washington worried privately that the project might prove too popular. It was, after all, a multibillion-dollar federal project being lavished on Florida, an important swing state that President Obama had won in the last election, with the money focused squarely on the Interstate 4 corridor between Tampa and Orlando, the home of one of the most crucial blocs of independent voters in the state.
Things did not work out that way.
President Obama announced the selection of Florida in 2010 in the most visible possible setting: his State of the Union address. ''Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Fla., where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad,'' he said, before flying to Florida the next day to promote the project in a town-hall-style meeting.
''There is no reason why other countries can build high-speed rail lines and we can't,'' Mr. Obama told a cheering crowd. ''And that's what's about to happen right here in Tampa.''
In 2009, it had been the Obama administration that had pushed to bring high-speed rail to the United States. The vehicle was the $787 billion stimulus package, which, though it was originally sold as a public works program, devoted more money to tax cuts and aid to states than to infrastructure. With much of the construction money in the stimulus ending up paying for prosaic things like repaving roads, the administration decided to make sure that some of it would leave a lasting legacy: it devoted $8 billion to railroads and high-speed rail.
To the Obama administration, the benefits seemed obvious. The money offered a chance to put people to work designing and building railroads. High-speed trains would lure riders who would otherwise drive or fly, reducing congestion, pollution and the nation's dependence on foreign oil. And simply building new futuristic trains zipping around at more than 150 miles an hour would be an accomplishment in itself, one that could lift the spirits of a recession-battered nation.
State Lobbies for a Bullet Train
It was Governor Crist -- who had been considered a possible Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008, and who already had his eye on a run for the Unites States Senate -- who had lobbied vigorously to win some of that stimulus money to build a high-speed train in a state reeling from the downturn. ''Florida is the state that can turn imagination into reality for world-class high-speed rail in the United States faster than anywhere else in the nation,'' he wrote to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood in the fall of 2009.
His boast was probably true. Florida had long flirted with the idea of building high-speed rail: its voters had once passed a constitutional amendment requiring the state to build it, only to repeal it later over cost concerns. As a result, the state had already done much of the necessary planning work, gotten crucial environmental approvals and, perhaps most important, owned most of the land for the tracks, which would run along the median of Interstate 4.
The 21-mile leg between Orlando International Airport and Walt Disney World, which agreed to donate land for a stop, had the potential to attract lots of riders, and revenue -- though such a short distance would be better served by a conventional train, or perhaps a monorail.
A Route Is Seen as Too Short
Florida's route had some glaring imperfections, though.
Tampa and Orlando are only 84 miles apart, generally considered too close for high-speed rail to make sense. The train trip, with many stops along the way, would have shaved only around a half-hour off the drive. Since there are no commercial flights between the two cities, the new line would not have lured away fliers or freed up landing slots at the busy airports. And neither Tampa nor Orlando has many public transportation options. So the question arose: Could riders be persuaded to leave their cars behind and buy tickets to places where they would still probably need cars?
The state wanted to build the project so badly, though, that after Mr. LaHood hinted that Florida should do something about its lackluster commuter rail service if it wanted a shot at winning the federal rail money, Mr. Crist complied in December 2009 by calling a special session of the Legislature. The state agreed to build a new commuter train in central Florida, and to beef up its struggling line in south Florida.
It worked. When the high-speed rail grants were announced a month later, Florida was a big winner.
The Department of Transportation did not have that many options. Only two states, Florida and California, were deemed far enough along in their planning to receive money for building actual bullet trains -- trains that can travel more than 150 miles an hour, on tracks of their own that are not shared with other trains.
The California line -- linking Los Angeles and San Francisco with trains that would go up to 220 miles an hour -- was expected to cost at least of $42 billion, and could not open before 2020 in the most optimistic projection. The Tampa-to-Orlando line, by contrast, was expected to cost around $2.6 billion and had a shot at opening by 2015.
Both states became big winners of the rail money, which grew to more than $10.5 billion after Congress devoted more money to railroads in the federal budget. The rest of the money was used to build or improve conventional train service: most of the states got at least some of it.
Florida stood out: it was on track to open the first bullet train on its own dedicated tracks in the United States. It would have been a demonstration project, visible to the millions of tourists who descend on the Orlando theme parks each year.
Still, it was probably not the line most people would have chosen if they were starting from scratch. When America 2050, a planning group, ranked potential routes in a report called ''Where High-Speed Rail Works Best,'' the Tampa-to-Orlando route was not even included because the cities are too close together.
Although the state's plan called for eventually extending the line down to Miami, making the train an attractive alternative to short-hop flights or long drives, the extension would have required more time and planning and much more money to build. When the planning group considered a route linking Tampa, Orlando and Miami, it ranked it 100th among potential high-speed rail routes in the United States, far behind likelier choices like the Northeast Corridor. (The Acela trains running between Boston and Washington can reach speeds of up to 150 miles an hour, but average around half that because they share their curvy tracks with other trains.)
G.O.P. Opposition Mounts
Then things began to fall apart. As the 2010 midterm elections heated up, Republicans began running against the federal largess states have traditionally sought.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, killed a long-planned commuter train tunnel under the Hudson River. Scott Walker, the new Republican governor of Wisconsin, killed a new conventional passenger train line that was to be built between Milwaukee and Madison, and paid for with $810 million in federal stimulus money. The new governor of Ohio, John R. Kasich, killed a $400 million federally financed line that would have linked Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. When President Obama called for expanding the nation's rail program in this year's State of the Union address, Sarah Palin took to her Facebook page to denounce it as ''a bullet train to bankruptcy.''
With Florida's new governor, Mr. Scott, expressing reservations about the plan, the Obama administration moved quickly to award $342 million of the forfeited money from the Midwest to Florida. That brought the federal commitment to Florida to roughly $2.4 billion, almost enough to cover the projected $2.6 billion cost.
But the backlash was strong in Florida. In his race for the United States Senate last year, Mr. Crist found his success at winning stimulus money for Florida turned into a liability. Conservatives, and a newly powerful Tea Party movement, saw the federal spending as a problem, not as a solution to the state's high unemployment rate. Mr. Crist ended up leaving the Republican Party and running, unsuccessfully, as an independent.
Last month, Mr. Scott decided to scuttle the project after reading a report by the Reason Foundation that questioned its ridership estimates. The foundation is a prominent libertarian policy research organization that employs several respected transportation analysts, but it gets some of its funding from donors with ties to the oil industry, including foundations related to Koch Industries, which owns oil refineries.
''The truth is that this project would be far too costly to taxpayers, and I believe the risk far outweighs the benefits,'' Mr. Scott said.
But a state-sponsored ridership study, which was released this week, concluded that the proposed line would actually have been a money-maker from the start.
Other Prospects Remain
Obama administration officials are still pushing ahead with their goal of winning a $53 billion commitment to railroads over the next six years, and say that other states are clamoring for the money rejected by Florida.
Transportation advocates are continuing their push, too; this week the U.S. Public Interest Research Group released a video with two actors from ''Mad Men,'' in character, expressing their certainty that America would build bullet trains. (''I read a piece that said that in 40 years, gas is going to cost almost a dollar a gallon,'' one says.) And Representative John L. Mica of Florida, the new Republican chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, supports high-speed rail, but would like to see efforts focused on the Northeast Corridor linking Boston, Washington and New York, the nation's most successful rail route. But any effort to make that a true high-speed line is years -- if not decades -- away.
Now, with the collapse of the Florida route, it looks as if the nation's first segment of true high-speed rail will be in an even unlikelier place -- linking Fresno and Bakersfield, in California's Central Valley, and scheduled to end construction in 2017.

HEADLINE: Lockout Becomes Part of Playbook

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
As the realization set in that labor strife had sent the N.F.L. into a legal limbo, the league's players and executives tried to get a handle on what the breakdown in negotiations and the union decertification would mean for them, even if nearly all of them had been bracing for what happened on Friday.
''I was hoping for the best but was prepared for the worst,'' Jets tight end Dustin Keller said, speaking before the N.F.L. announced a lockout shortly after midnight. ''I tried to be optimistic, but in the back of my mind I didn't think we were going to get a deal done today. Hopefully, we'll get it done so it doesn't interfere with the start of the season.'' 
Keller said all the players had been prepared to work out on their own, away from their teams' facilities.
''A lot of the players have already started working out around the area, or where they live, and we'll all go about our business getting ready for the season,'' Keller said.
Speaking of the Jets, he added: ''It's not going to be a problem for us. We're a pretty tight-knit group of guys, so we're going to have a step up on the rest of the N.F.L., because we know we're going to have put the time in together.''
Still, almost everyone with a stake in the league has expressed disappointment in how events unfolded.
''I'm just sad more than anything else,'' said the former quarterback Trent Dilfer, now a television analyst.
''I'm sad things have gotten to this point. I'm sad at some of the venomous talk that has come out afterward because I think that will just get in the way of getting it done.
''I wasn't hopeful for a deal. Total panic was going to have to set in before a deal was done. And I don't just mean with players and owners, but the media, Congress. Not until total panic sets in will a deal get done.''
Nothing resembling total panic broke out Friday.
Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, was even smiling when he did television interviews, saying: ''The answer is, we'll get it done, and we'll get it done means we won't miss any football. Their route of litigation will result right back in negotiations again. I just spent a billion dollars on a stadium, and I didn't plan on not playing football in it.''
John Mara, the Giants co-owner, looked much more somber in front of a pack of television cameras, saying he was exasperated with the turn of events.
''The union's position has been take it or leave it, and has had the same position since last September,'' Mara said. ''We made an offer today to split the difference between the two sides. They came back and said it was insufficient. Their objective was to go the litigation route.''
Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco took to Twitter to express his thoughts, hashtagging himself an unemployed winner and posting this: ''I am free to partake in any activity I want to. With the way my mind works things are gonna get real interesting.''
Redskins defensive end Phillip Daniels also used Twitter to express his thoughts.
''I feel bad for the fans,'' he wrote. ''It's not like we asked for more money. We wanted to see open books to see the best way to come to new agreement.''
Cornerback D'Angelo Hall, Phillips's teammate, posted: ''Apologies to the fans that at this moment we won't have football! Hopefully we all work this out for the betterment of the game.''
Drew Brees, the New Orleans quarterback, who was one of the lead names in an antitrust suit filed against the league, updated his thoughts on Twitter as well: ''Not once have the players asked for more money during this negotiation. That is a fact. Past players sacrificed a great deal to give us what we have now in the NFL, and we will not lay down for a second to give that up. I don't expect anyone to feel sorry for us. We have a responsibility and at some point you just have to stand up for what is right.''

HEADLINE: Expatriate Games

BYLINE: By JOSH WINTERS

 BODY:
For seven years, Josh Winters partied with the Mideast elite and lived to tell about it.
This is the story of a person who does not claim to be a fighter for patriotic causes, a political leader or diplomat, it is merely a story of an ordinary citizen, who found himself thrust into the midst of events he had no choice but to be a part of - events he could neither evade or distance himself from, as they unfolded. This is just a story of a Yemeni citizen.''- Mohsin Alaini from his book, '' 50 Years in Shifting Sands,'' translated by Hassan al-Haifi. 
In 2003, I landed in Yemen for the first time to surf and study Arabic dialects. I traveled at the invitation of Haitham Alaini, a young entrepreneur who was educated at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. He had returned to Yemen to start a construction business that would eventually expand into oil and gas infrastructure, as well as security and I.T. He had a convoy of black Land Cruisers meet me on the tarmac and take me to his family's home. The ride through downtown Sana's trash-strewn streets was my first glimpse of a society seriously out of whack. During the next seven years, as I partied with the region's high rollers and influence peddlers, the gulf between privilege and poverty would only get wider and more surreal.
Alaini's family home is in the city's diplomatic quarters. Its walls are hung with pictures of Haitham's father, Mohsin, posing with J.F.K., with Zhou Enlai, with Nasser and with several other luminaries of the Arab Nationalist Movement of the '60s and early '70s. Mohsin Alaini was Yemen's prime minister five times during that tumultuous period. His son, my host, grew up shuttling between world capitals, as Yemen split and reunited, north and south swept up in the two ideological passions - Arab nationalism and Soviet-style socialism - of the 1960s. By the early '80s, whatever was left of the Arab Al-Nahda (renaissance) was replaced by a culture of lavish consumerism fueled by oil wealth.
Mohsin Alaini now lives and writes in Cairo, the city where he attended law school in the 1950s. Although most of his writing is political, he published a memoir that's a snapshot of an Arab world rocked by dissent, much as it is now. He was part of a small group of Yemeni intellectuals who, inspired by the Egyptian revolution of July 1952, returned to Yemen intent on modernizing the country and establishing a republic. This is the ironic heritage of those autocratic regimes that have been upended by popular protests this year.
Alaini generously provided my friends and me with a Land Cruiser, two bodyguards, a satellite phone and a stack of guns. The next morning we left mountainous Sana by road, bound for the provinces. We didn't return for 12 weeks as we explored every cove and peninsula of Yemen's rocky Indian Ocean coast. This began my long and happy relationship with the rougher parts of Yemen and the Horn of Africa.
The desert coast of Somalia is another matter. Getting there is difficult. Somalia has little in the way of infrastructure, never mind consistent flight schedules available online. When my friends and I decided to surf there, our first stop en route was Dubai, where several Somali political exiles corralled us into endless meetings over Turkish coffee pleading for us to reinstate them to power. We nodded sympathetically and told them we had no means to help them. They smiled conspiratorially. It seems an American abroad is always thought of as a C.I.A. operative, unless he's on safari or sketching a French cathedral.
When we eventually made it to Galkacyo, the main city of Somalia's northern state of Puntland, we were collected from the airstrip by yet another convoy of Land Cruisers bearing smiling men with guns. We would spend the next month driving up and down the coast of Puntland, from Ras Xaafuun down to Eyl, with its angry pirates and bleak sand dunes. Our host was a local businessman who maintained his own private militia, as one does in failed states. Abdirizak Osman was a soft-spoken warlord, a graduate of Brown, with a fondness for golf and summer vacations in the Hamptons. He kept his wife and children at a lavish home in Dubai but spent most of his time nurturing his telecom business: STC Puntland. His business was thriving at that time, partly because his main rival had its assets frozen by the United States after 2001.
Osman ran the business from a sparsely furnished compound where he could take shelter from family members and townspeople who collected outside the gates of his main home, demanding adjudication or electricity, or any of the thousand things that one takes for granted in a state that has a functioning government. Upon leaving, we took tea with him, thanking him for his hospitality and wondering what we could send him from the United States. He chuckled quietly and looked around his house, furnished like an Ethan Allen showroom. He said: ''Six months ago, I ordered a container of cigarettes from an Israeli-American. I paid in advance $100,000, and he disappeared with my money. Perhaps you can look into that for me? And secondly, the road between Galkacyo and Garowe is in bad shape. I need it to be paved.''
As guests of a man who keeps a private army of several hundred, it's tough to say no. We said we would do our best.
I shuttled back and forth to the Mideast until 2008, when I moved to Dubai to start a consulting business, leveraging my experience building overpriced spec homes for gaudy Russians back in Los Angeles. I rented a small one-bedroom apartment for a blistering $6,000 a month because it was the only available flat I could find. Compensation for white-collar expats who worked in Dubai was grossly out of proportion to salaries back home. The streets were dense with Italian luxury two-seaters and blacked-out Range Rovers. The city's financial firms, eager to lure the investment capital of wealthy and reportedly impulsive Gulf Arabs, competed to have the hottest looking staff. Five-inch stilettos and pencil skirts were de rigueur office attire, and the red lacquered Louboutin sole was ubiquitous. One developer topped the competition by employing sensationally beautiful Romanian twins with bleached blond pixie cuts as his receptionists.
Every night promised a new soiree for some vanity project, from a gallery for abstract Iranian sculpture to an online shopping service where one could order books, iPods, cigarettes, all guaranteed to be delivered in less than an hour.
Kate was one of those luxury-loving expats: a 23-year-old Republican with an insatiable appetite for Missoni. She was the the brand manager for Veuve Clicquot, and she was running two or three parties every night. Every new boutique and new ayurvedic cosmetic line demanded a lavish bash with premium bubbly. The news of the American financial crisis was shrugged off. The Islamic prohibition on alcohol was shrugged off. This was Dubai, after all.
But by early 2009, things started to change, and no one wanted to talk about it. The opportunistic expats quietly bolted, even though Dubai's oldest families thought it best to proceed as if nothing had changed. Conspicuous consumption began to slacken, and major construction projects went silent. The mass exodus of white-collar workers sent rents plummeting. The long-term parking lot of the airport was full of abandoned Ferraris and Range Rovers, left by fired expats who had no intention of trying out Dubai's breach-of-contract laws. Bankruptcy laws were still a year away, and debtors' prison was the rule.
Luckily, that summer, I was awarded a big project in the Yemeni capital. The coastal drive from Dubai to Aden is fantastic at any time of the year, but the summer monsoon is the best. The difference between Yemen and the other states on the peninsula is stark: Yemen has a large and impoverished population, larger than Syria and almost as populous as Iraq. Just across the peninsula in the Gulf States, per capita incomes are in the $40,000 range, while in Yemen it is closer to $1,000. The disparity and proximity make the restlessness in Yemen understandable. The first time I crossed the peninsula, it was on a barely discernible track. This time, it was on a freshly paved highway where armed trucks from police checkpoints pulled in behind me as escorts for each stage of the road.
I rented a single-story house made of stone quarried from the surrounding mountains, in the leafiest part of Sana's diplomatic quarter. I used the main hall to adapt local 150cc bikes into little cafe racers. The landlady was a Yemeni whose age was impossible to discern behind her hijab. Her English, though, had a flat Midwestern cadence. She arrived once a month to collect the rent and to complain about the foliage in the courtyard. The occupant before me was the Dutch embassy, and they had very nice furniture, she told me. I asked why the garden was such an untamed wilderness when I arrived. She addressed me by my full name, and said that the issue was not Dutch gardening, but her disappointment in me as a tenant; as an American, she expected more.
My new assignment brought me back into contact with Haitham Alaini, who had in the interim years befriended a couple of Afghan businessmen who ran their businesses from the comfort of Dubai. Kabir Arghandiwal, his neighbor in a high-rise called the Capricon Tower, was an affable fellow who loved Ed Hardy shirts and Diesel shoes. His Lebanese wife was a social fixture on Dubai's art scene who reputedly made Kabir promise in a prenup that he could never take her nor their children to Afghanistan. He and his extended family manage logistics contracts for the ISAF forces in Afghanistan, and he is a partner in a passenger air service, FlyDubai.
Saad Mohseni was the third member of this group of Dubai neighbors who were sometimes called ''the axis of evil'' by their American friends. As chairman of the Moby Group, which he founded, Saad Mohseni was Afghanistan's first media mogul. Not only has he pushed programming that provokes religious conservatives and government officials alike, but he has also built his media empire on ad revenue, which is astonishing in a war-ravaged economy. From his first days as a USAID-funded upstart until today, when ex-State Department staff work to expand his media efforts across the globe, he has shown a keen sense of how to balance politics and profitability. A headline in a local paper recently called him ''Top Adman,'' which is less glamorous than ''the Rupert Murdoch of Afghanistan,'' but perhaps more accurate. His success has opened many doors, including a partnership with the real Murdoch for an Iranian TV network based in Dubai.
On a warm quiet Friday morning in 2008, I joined Mohseni and Alaini outside a Starbucks in the financial center. Mohseni was wearing the weekend uniform of Dubai's ascending power broker: cotton walking shorts belted a bit high, sockless loafers and an expression of haughty indifference. His wife, Sarah Takesh, was dressed in cotton hippie-chic of her own design, made by her company in Kabul. She was reading ''The Dirt,'' the Motley Crue story. Saad made polite conversation; Sarah made a point of being engrossed in the history of rock. They bickered over the details of their coming vacation in the Maldives. They fussed about shipping damage to their custom-made furniture, in transit from workshops in Kabul.
Mohseni and Alaini had been brought together by an interesting and universally admired character in Middle Eastern politics: Tom Freston, who has been tireless in his efforts to connect Mohseni to media players and politicians in the United States. He brokered Mohseni's partnership with Murdoch, and has been in many ways his mentor. It may seem curious that the man who was head of Viacom should be trolling war zones for proteges, but Freston is a man of many interests. While balancing his involvement in Oprah's new network with Bono collaborations, he maintains an unusual itinerary. In 2009, before Yemen topped America's National Security priority list, he came to Dubai, to discuss a TV station in Yemen with Mohseni, among other things.
As of last year the TV station was still a work in progress. Mohseni met me for brunch at Baker & Spice in Dubai. While Sarah chatted about spending the rest of her pregnancy in the south of France, I asked Saad how long it would take for a TV venture like his to be profitable. He said one year. Clearly, he wasn't counting on hustling airtime to local businesses at the going rate in Yemen (about $5 a second).
Later that summer, I traveled to Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, which by most estimates is among the poorest countries in the world, despite vast natural resources. I was a guest at the home of Rudy Ilumbe, a 26-year-old entrepreneur who grew up in Helsinki. Ilumbe is a big man who speaks quietly and listens intently. His English is smooth and polished, but he is more comfortable in French. His house is a sprawling Palm Springs-style ranch filled with Vitra furniture and an empty swimming pool. When I asked if he ever has pool parties, he said simply, ''Swimming is for white people,'' and then laughed. Other than the stock white Land Cruisers that his security detail rolls in, there was a Range Rover, a Bentley and an Audi S5 in the carport, each slammed and rimmed to match one another. We took the S5 out onto Kinshasa's rutted dirt streets to the place where Ilumbe had recently booked 50 Cent. Over the first of many bottles of Perrier that his entourage racked up, Ilumbe toasted me and said: ''I was always taught that nothing comes without hard work. In Finland I believed it and I worked hard, but I have to tell you; in Congo, making money is too easy.''
Ilumbe is tight with the president of Congo. He has secured gold, diamond and petroleum concessions for his European clients, and his consulting firm is booming.
Later that evening, Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso stepped up to the table, hat low over his eyes, swigging from his own bottle of Perrier. As is customary from Kinshasa to Beirut to Mumbai, each magnum of Champagne is brought to the table with lit sparklers and a shout-out from the D.J. The name of Sassou became irritatingly repetitive as the night wore on and the bottles stacked up. Denis Christel is the son of the dictator of Congo-Brazzaville, Congo's neighbor. He has been accused of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of the country's oil revenues for shopping sprees in Paris, Dubai and Hong Kong. I excused myself from the table and moved through the packed club toward the restroom. Suddenly three guys materialized out of the crowd, escorting me through, and clearing the bathroom before I entered.
Somewhere toward the end of 2010, this story comes to an end with a bang, not a whimper. The day the cartridge bombs were discovered on planes in England and Dubai, I made some ill-timed inquiries to the offices of FedEx Yemen. The Yemeni military sealed the office, and because of my questions, I was told that I was no longer welcome in their country. Which is how I found myself exiled to East L.A. in late December, while across town at Soho House, Tom Freston convened a meeting with the owner of Yemen FedEx and other Mideast elite for a weeklong strategy session.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Fraying Ties Between Education and Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Degrees and Dollars,'' by Paul Krugman (column, March 7):
Finally, an economist breaks ranks and questions the magic of education as the solution to the country's long-term economic difficulties. 
More education does not ensure that appropriate jobs will appear. The content of gross domestic product, not only its overall rate of growth, is a crucial issue.
We Americans need to be educated to have a more realistic understanding of how to build a satisfying economy. Mr. Krugman's realism opens the debate.
S. M. Miller Cambridge, Mass., March 7, 2011
The writer is a senior fellow at the Commonwealth Institute.
To the Editor:
If computers are taking over complex but routine white-collar tasks, the current obsession with testing in schools is exactly wrong.
As we saw when the computer Watson played two human rivals on ''Jeopardy!'' and won, computers will do better on tests than will people. Thus we are teaching children skills designed for obsolescence.
Traditional American, as opposed to European or Asian, schooling has focused on creativity, spontaneity and providing a second chance to get it right. These are the things that generate new ideas, new policies and new products -- things computers can't do.
Hal Winsborough Madison, Wis., March 7, 2011
The writer is emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman falls into the trap of regarding college education as job training.
The larger benefit of college is the development of critical thinking, which helps individuals identify and develop new work and business opportunities, manage personal finances, lead healthy lives, raise fulfilled children, participate in politics as informed citizens and obey the law.
This is why Americans need a college education.
Jack Herschlag Upper Montclair, N.J., March 7, 2011
To the Editor:
While Paul Krugman correctly diagnoses the hollowing out of the middle class, the correct policy solution is still, in fact, improving education.
Allowing workers to bargain for higher wages will be meaningless if the workers themselves are inferior. The path to higher wages for the middle class is improving the quality of our workers, so that service jobs are outsourced to us. Artificially inflating the wages of relatively unproductive workers will only hasten outsourcing.
Only by improving our system of education to produce the best, most productive workers can we guarantee that the next generation of Americans will have jobs in a globalized service economy.
Jesse Slater Columbus, Ohio, March 7, 2011
To the Editor:
In the absence of a good liberal arts college education, I might not have recognized Paul Krugman's opening line -- ''It is a truth universally acknowledged that education is the key to economic success'' -- as an allusion to Jane Austen's in ''Pride and Prejudice.''

HEADLINE: At State-Run Homes, Abuse and Impunity

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Russ Buettner and Alain Delaqueriere contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Nearly 40 years after New York emptied its scandal-ridden warehouses for the developmentally disabled, the far-flung network of small group homes that replaced them operates with scant oversight and few consequences for employees who abuse the vulnerable population.
A New York Times investigation over the past year has found widespread problems in the more than 2,000 state-run homes. In hundreds of cases reviewed by The Times, employees who sexually abused, beat or taunted residents were rarely fired, even after repeated offenses, and in many cases, were simply transferred to other group homes run by the state.
And, despite a state law requiring that incidents in which a crime may have been committed be reported to law enforcement, such referrals are rare: State records show that of some 13,000 allegations of abuse in 2009 within state-operated and licensed homes, fewer than 5 percent were referred to law enforcement. The hundreds of files examined by The Times contained shocking examples of abuse of residents with conditions like Down syndrome, autism and cerebral palsy. 
At a home upstate in Hudson Falls, two days before Christmas in 2006, an employee discovered her supervisor, Ricky W. Sousie, in the bedroom of a severely disabled, 54-year-old woman. Mr. Sousie, a stocky man with wispy hair, was standing between the woman's legs. His pants were around his ankles, his hand was on her knee and her diaper was pulled down.
The police were called, and semen was found on the victim. But the state did not seek to discipline Mr. Sousie. Instead, it transferred him to work at another home.
Roger Macomber, an employee at a group home in western New York, grabbed a woman in his care, threw her against a fence, and then flung her into a wall, according to a 2007 disciplinary report. He was then assigned to work at another group home.
Mr. Macomber, in fact, was transferred to different homes four times in the past decade for disciplinary reasons. It was not until last year, after he left a person unattended while he went into a store, that he was put on employment probation and eventually dismissed.
Over the past year, the state agency overseeing the homes, the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, has repeatedly declined to make its top officials available for interviews. A spokesman, Herm Hill, said that the vast majority of the agency's employees were conscientious, and that its hands were often tied because of the disciplinary and arbitration rules involving the workers' union. Mr. Hill emphasized that the agency takes allegations of abuse ''very seriously.''
But this month, after learning of The Times's findings, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo forced the resignations of Max E. Chmura, who led the agency, and Jane G. Lynch, the chief operating officer of the state's Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, which is charged with protecting people with developmental disabilities.
''It is a basic function of state government to protect the most vulnerable among us,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.
The Cuomo administration said it would undertake immediate and comprehensive review of the agencies and their practices. Asked about the low rate of referral of allegations of abuse to law enforcement -- for example, only a quarter of sexual abuse cases were reported -- officials said they were reviewing flaws in their record-keeping.
But they have acknowledged that it had been the practice of the agency to handle most accusations of abuse internally, despite the office's lack of forensic capacity. It does not use a crime lab or standard evidence-gathering techniques, and its investigators generally lack law enforcement training; sometimes, they are simply the supervisors of the accused employees.
The Times reviewed 399 disciplinary cases involving 233 state workers who were accused of one of seven serious offenses, including physical abuse and neglect, since 2008. In each of the cases examined, the agency had substantiated the charges, and the worker had been previously disciplined at least once.
In 25 percent of the cases involving physical, sexual or psychological abuse, the state employees were transferred to other homes.
The state initiated termination proceedings in 129 of the cases reviewed but succeeded in just 30 of them, in large part because the workers' union, the Civil Service Employees Association, aggressively resisted firings in almost every case. A few employees resigned, even though the state sought only suspensions.
In the remainder of the cases, employees accused of abuse -- whether beating the disabled, using racial slurs or neglecting their care -- either were suspended, were fined or had their vacation time reduced.
Most of the state-operated homes are in economically depressed areas upstate, and the jobs they provide -- paying from $29,000 to nearly $62,000 with generous benefits -- are sometimes among the few decent employment opportunities. The state has no educational requirements for the positions, which involve duties like administering drugs, driving residents to day activities, feeding them and preventing them from choking. Some of those hired have shown no previous interest or skill in caring for difficult populations.
''There are some people that don't belong there; I know some myself,'' said Robert Matuszewski of Buffalo, who was suspended and ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling for neglecting a resident and for referring to his female colleagues as ''bitches.'' ''They make me look like a schoolboy.''
In some cases, not even criminal convictions are disqualifying. Henry Marrero, an employee at a group home in Utica, was convicted of beating a 99-year-old man while moonlighting at a nursing home -- slapping the man three times in the face and once on the stomach. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was barred from participating in federally financed health care programs. But he kept his state job working with the developmentally disabled.
Former regulators, employees within the system and advocates have grown increasingly dismayed at what they say is the state's tolerance of abuse of the residents, whom the state refers to as ''consumers'' in its records.
''It's absolutely staggering and shocking,'' said Michael Carey, an outspoken voice for the developmentally disabled in New York. ''There is massive systemic abuse and a failure to hold these individuals properly accountable.''
Mr. Carey's autistic son, Jonathan, died in state care in 2007, in what was ruled a homicide at the hands of a state employee. His death led to the passage of Jonathan's Law, which required the state to begin disclosing incidents of abuse to parents.
What is especially troubling to advocates is not just that the group-home employees are often moved around, rather than fired, even after egregious incidents of abuse. It is also that, after they arrive at their new workplaces, they often abuse again.
While working at a group home in western New York, Dwayne K. Smith told a developmentally disabled woman in his care to dance ''in a provocative manner,'' instructing her, according to state records, to ''shake your booty and/or your boobs.'' Reports also said he told a man and woman in his care to kiss and embrace, which they did. Mr. Smith was then transferred to a nearby home, and not long after, he sexually harassed a co-worker, taunted two people in his care by repeatedly questioning their sexuality and served beer to another, state records showed.
Protection by the Union
The Civil Service Employees Association, one of the most powerful unions in Albany, makes no apologies for its vigorous defense of the group-home workers it represents.
But the union's approach -- contesting just about every charge leveled at a worker -- has contributed to a system in which firings of even the most abusive employees are rare. Most disciplinary measures represent a compromise between management and the union, often reached at the urging of an arbitrator chosen by both sides.
Ross D. Hanna, the director of contract administration for the association, likened the union's role to that of public defenders, saying it was required by state law to represent its members.
''If they're brought up on charges, we have an absolute duty to represent them,'' Mr. Hanna said. ''That's our job.''
He added: ''When we know the person is guilty, we try to convince the person to get out of it by resigning. But if the person decides to go forward, we have to do our best job.''
This disciplinary system has made it possible for employees like Mitchell T. Lovett, who worked in several different homes on Long Island, to rack up 10 offenses -- including twice punching residents in the face -- before losing his job, according to personnel records.
In 1988, three years after he was hired, Mr. Lovett was cited for neglect after a person in his care walked out of a group home at night; he had not conducted all of the required bed checks. Both were serious offenses for a population for which wandering off is a frequent problem.
The state sought an eight-week suspension, but after the union objected, Mr. Lovett was given a letter of reprimand.
Five years later, he received another letter of reprimand for 17 unauthorized absences. The next year, he was disciplined for a dozen unauthorized absences. In 1995, he was disciplined three times: he was late on 11 occasions, left his shift without authorization and failed to conduct any of the required checks of residents' beds during a night shift.
In 1999, the state sought another eight-week suspension after Mr. Lovett spent up to three and a half hours a shift making personal phone calls. In an interview, Mr. Lovett explained that he had been going through a divorce. He was docked a week's worth of accrued time and reimbursed the agency for his phone calls.
The state first tried to fire Mr. Lovett in 2000, when he was accused of physical abuse. Mr. Lovett said he caught a resident in the eye with his elbow while trying to subdue him.
The state characterized the matter differently. ''You punched him in his left eye,'' a disciplinary report said.
The union contested the charge; Mr. Lovett was sent to another home, one of three transfers for disciplinary reasons during his career.
A few years later, the state tried to fire him again when his driver's license was suspended -- making it impossible for him to drive the residents to their daytime programs. But the firing was overturned during arbitration, and he received yet another letter of reprimand.
By 2009, Mr. Lovett was assigned to a group home in Lynbrook. During one of his shifts, he and another employee were preparing to bring residents home from an outing. One resident, a 60-year-old man with ''severe developmental disabilities,'' refused to leave, ''throwing his arms and legs around,'' according to two employees from another home who were witnesses. In the process, he knocked off Mr. Lovett's glasses.
Mr. Lovett punched the man in the left eye. Two witnesses were said to be ''shocked'' and reported the episode to their supervisors.
In the interview, Mr. Lovett said he had thrown no punches. He said he had been rubbing the man's back to calm him, and his actions were misinterpreted in the commotion.
An arbitrator did not believe him, and Mr. Lovett's firing was upheld.
The union declined to discuss Mr. Lovett's case, saying it was against their policy to talk publicly about personnel matters. In a statement last week, the agency said that it ''often faces significant obstacles'' in ''securing removal of some employees who may have committed abuses,'' and said that it would review its procedures. Mr. Lovett, 49, said he had been unfairly disciplined in some cases, and blamed stress and deficient training in others. He said that as a father of five, he almost always worked another job, including selling real estate or insurance.
''It's a lack of training,'' he said, ''and they allow you to do certain things a certain way for a long time, then the rules change, and people get caught up in doing things that everybody's doing. So when in Rome, you do as the Romans, you know?''
''The job is really stressful,'' he added. ''You have residents that you work with that are attacking you, they have hepatitis, they have things that can be transferred. They bite you, they hit you, they verbally abuse you. It's almost like working in a prison.''
Few Consequences
One obstacle complicates any effort to take action against employees accused of abusing those in their care: The victims often cannot talk or have extreme cognitive impairment. Local law enforcement officials point to this to explain a lack of prosecution of cases.
But another factor seems to be at work. In many cases, the developmentally disabled do not have families actively involved in their lives, and, hence, no advocates to assure that state officials and the police take the mistreatment seriously.
The case involving Mr. Sousie is especially illustrative.
Five years ago, Mr. Sousie, then 47, was working at the home in Hudson Falls, about 50 miles north of Albany. After a co-worker saw him alone and standing between the legs of the severely disabled woman, who was lying on her back, the police were alerted. The victim was taken to the hospital, where a rape kit was administered, and Mr. Sousie was placed on administrative leave.
The victim was ''unable to communicate,'' the police report said, and had no relatives in regular contact.
The inquiry by the Hudson Falls police foundered. It took the department nearly 10 months to get a DNA report on the seminal fluid from the state police laboratory. But during that time, officers never obtained a specimen of Mr. Sousie's DNA for comparison.
The case then sat dormant for nearly a year and a half, during which time Mr. Sousie was allowed to return to work at a different home. The Washington County district attorney, Kevin C. Kortright, and the Hudson Falls police chief, Randy Diamond, said DNA technology was not sufficiently advanced in 2007 to make progress in the case, even though it was in widespread use at the time.
Finally, in 2009, an enterprising police detective took up the case, and a court order was obtained to get a DNA sample from Mr. Sousie. A case was brought against him in county court, including a felony sodomy charge, only to be dismissed after a judge ruled that the district attorney's office withheld evidence from the defense.
Mr. Sousie was convicted of endangering an incompetent person, a misdemeanor in Hudson Falls, and spent less than a year in jail. Law enforcement officials had trouble explaining the delays and errors in the case and blamed the victim's inability to communicate.
''Certainly, if you had somebody who could communicate better, it would be an easier investigation,'' Chief Diamond said. ''That's the biggest hurdle in this case.''
Mr. Kortright likened it to ''the rape of a 3-year-old,'' adding, ''It's a hard road without a confession by the defendant.''
While the prosecution was plagued with problems, the state's response was even more puzzling.
After any episode that warrants discipline, the state is supposed to serve the employee involved a notice of discipline, a formal listing of accusations, but none was issued in this case, despite the presence of a witness and of physical evidence. The office did not conduct more than a perfunctory inquiry. Mr. Hill, the agency spokesman, declined to discuss the matter.
Mr. Sousie, in an interview, denied that he had been involved in a sexual assault.
''I was tucking in my shirt, and I got accused of raping a client, that's what happened,'' he said. When it was pointed out that his lawyer had, as a defense, argued that Mr. Sousie had been masturbating -- hence the presence of physical evidence -- he conceded, ''That's the defense that we used, yes,'' but declined to elaborate.
The state had reacted more aggressively when Mr. Sousie, back in 1992, assaulted a co-worker. In that case, state records said, Mr. Sousie punched the other employee in the face. ''Then you threw him onto the floor, and while straddling him, you yelled profanities at him.''
Explaining what had happened, Mr. Sousie said, ''My wife and a co-worker were getting to know each other at work, and that didn't sit too well.''
The state moved to fire Mr. Sousie, but instead reached a settlement with the union. He was placed on probation for two years, had 80 hours of back pay withheld, lost six days of leave time and was ordered to undergo counseling. But he remained on the job.
If the Hudson Falls detective had not revived the sexual assault case and sent him to jail, of course, Mr. Sousie would, presumably, still be employed.
In the interview, Mr. Sousie, who was released from the county lockup last year, said he was now looking for work and looking forward to collecting his state pension.
''Today's another day, you know,'' he said. ''I'm waiting till I get old enough to draw my retirement.''
Waning Oversight
In 1972, the Willowbrook scandal brought nationwide attention to the conditions of the developmentally disabled in state care. While Willowbrook had long been troubled -- Senator Robert F. Kennedy called it a ''snake pit'' in 1965 -- it was footage by Geraldo Rivera, then a young television reporter, that resonated.
The images of disabled children were searing. ''Untended, some smeared with their own feces, many of the children were unclothed and all were simply left to sit in the ward all day,'' The Times wrote at the time. ''The only sound picked up by the technicians was something of an eerie communal wail.''
Prodded by the federal courts, Gov. Hugh L. Carey began a huge overhaul of the state's system of care, and turned to Clarence Sundram, a young lawyer, to help lead the way. Mr. Sundram, a 28-year-old immigrant from India, helped conceive of the Commission on Quality of Care, which would provide the first independent oversight of how people with developmental disabilities were treated.
''We really had no capacity to investigate,'' Mr. Sundram said in an interview. Existing investigative agencies, he added, ''didn't particularly understand the mental health system, so they tended to write these very sensationalist reports that weren't particularly helpful in terms of, how do you fix this problem.''
Mr. Sundram ran the commission for two decades, bringing an outspokenness and assertiveness to the new agency.
He was sometimes confrontational and made frequent use of the bully pulpit, demanding that the news media pay attention to this population. Mr. Sundram took on broad problems, like the use of physical restraint and seclusion, and the need to report serious episodes to law enforcement.
His approach did not always sit well with commissioners at the state's Office of Mental Health and the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, who felt Mr. Sundram was always inviting more scrutiny of their problems.
But there is no doubt that after Mr. Sundram left in 1998, the attention he brought to the issue all but disappeared and the agency's public profile collapsed.
These days, the commission is more likely to play down allegations of abuse than to root them out. And its resources are limited: in 2009, it investigated less than two percent of allegations of abuse or neglect of the disabled by employees.
The commission also appears to operate under a media blackout: Jane G. Lynch never spoke to a reporter during her nearly three-year tenure, her staff members said, and declined to comment for this article.
When you stop speaking out publicly, Mr. Sundram said, ''nobody has any idea what the hell you are doing.'' Given the competing demands for attention, he said, the public will simply move on.
Governor Cuomo has asked Mr. Sundram to return to Albany to help overhaul the agency.
A Variety of Offenses
The hundreds of files examined by The Times provided a disturbing inventory of offenses committed by employees -- few of which ever got them fired.
Kenyetta Williams, an employee at a group home on Long Island, left a resident ''soiled with feces and urine and suffering from a broken leg'' on her bedroom floor for more than an hour, the records stated. Ms. Williams was suspended. In a brief interview last week, she said she was taking care of too many residents and covering for an absent co-worker at the time.
It was her 13th disciplinary write-up since 1994. Another employee, in the Finger Lakes region, was fined $375 after allowing a person in her care to sit in a van in her own feces for five and a half hours.
In 2009, the state recommended firing Charles Weimer, an employee in western New York who told a resident, ''Why don't you get a Brillo pad and scrape the black off you?'' Mr. Weimer, who had previously been written up for abuse, sleeping on duty, medication errors and neglect, was reassigned, and was only later fired for violating his probation.
Michelle Penharlow, another employee in western New York, ''picked up a knife'' and pointed the blade and shook it at a resident, according to a 2008 discipline report, and kicked a resident ''in or about the buttocks.'' The state called for her firing, but she was suspended and transferred to another home instead. The next year, after being written up for 10 different incidents of verbal abuse, neglect and mistreatment, she was fired.
Because the more than 2,000 state-run group homes are scattered in communities statewide, little supervision is provided on-site, and it is often up to staff members to turn in their colleagues when one misbehaves. Typically, four to eight developmentally disabled residents live together in what are known as Individual Residential Alternatives; they are sometimes cared for by as few as two employees.
There is no question the jobs are stressful: Some residents can be violent themselves, and others see the world as a small child does.
Some of the employees disciplined for abuse blame their co-workers for their troubles.
Roger Macomber, the employee in western New York, faced charges including flinging a disabled woman across a room into a wall and destroying notes describing unexplained bruises on a person in his care.
He said that he had been turned in by a trainee who did not understand that aggressive residents could not be handled with kid gloves. He said he argued with the trainee before she made her accusations: ''I called her a liar, I called her paranoid, I called her stupid,'' Mr. Macomber said. ''Because of that, she brought up all these different incidents that she had seen.''
A Whistle-Blower Thwarted
Despite the agency's tendency to return offending employees to work, there is one disciplinary matter it has taken seriously -- punishing a whistle-blower named Jeffrey Monsour.
Mr. Monsour, a 50-year-old from upstate New York, went to work for the agency in 1999, after a career helping to run family restaurants ended with his father's retirement. He was partly inspired by his family's experience caring for his aunt, who had Down syndrome.
Mr. Monsour found his work as a developmental aide -- the agency's primary caretaker position -- rewarding, though it was not without challenges. In 2004, he was asked to conduct a fire drill at a group home in Glens Falls when a young man with Down syndrome refused to evacuate.
''He sat on the floor and wouldn't leave,'' Mr. Monsour recalled. ''So I wrote up that he could not evacuate.''
He was told by regional managers to conduct another drill. Again, the resident refused to leave, and became upset when Mr. Monsour tried to help. Supervisors arranged a third drill using another escape route, but the resident would only edge down the stairs on his bottom, blocking the exit for everyone else.
''After that point, the management there was ruthless to me,'' Mr. Monsour said. ''They were mad I brought the issue up and just didn't sign the slip and say he could get out in two minutes and 30 seconds like everybody else, or three minutes. You know, he couldn't get out -- what do you want me to do?''
Mr. Monsour believes the episode cost him a promotion, but he was undeterred and did something unusual. He filed a Freedom of Information Law request, seeking records of fire drills, and later confronted Mr. Chmura -- then a top deputy -- with records suggesting that drills were being falsified.
In some cases, disabled clients were said to have evacuated from their beds at night in less than three minutes, a breakneck pace a veteran worker like Mr. Monsour found unlikely.
In 2009, when a fire at a home in the Adirondacks killed four residents, an investigation showed that the home's fire drill reports were ''substantially inaccurate,'' and ''contained serious irregularities which called into question the veracity of the drills.''
Mr. Monsour e-mailed Mr. Chmura, chiding him that ''my concerns fell on deaf ears.'' Mr. Chmura responded, assuring Mr. Monsour that the agency reviewed his claims.
Mr. Monsour kept sending out Freedom of Information Law requests, obtaining records showing, among other reports, long absences from work for top officials in the Albany area and stark inconsistencies in the discipline of workers. He was shocked to see some workers had returned to work after physical abuse.
He was also increasingly uncomfortable with what he saw as his union's complicity and ran an unsuccessful campaign for president of his local in 2009.
The Civil Service Employees Association ''is right there in bed with them,'' he said, adding, ''when you're getting interrogated, they know there was just a case settled where somebody did something severe, and they got a mild penalty, and they're not telling you this.''
As Mr. Monsour's information-seeking continued, the agency began frequently bringing him in for questioning. In one evaluation, he was called ''not a team player'' because he called 911 after a resident wandered off, running through traffic. The agency later redacted the reference from his evaluation.
In another episode, supervisors at the agency filed a special disciplinary report used to document workplace violence, saying Mr. Monsour became overly upset when informed of a disciplinary action against him. The report was rejected as insufficient by another agency official.
In 2007, Mr. Monsour was interrogated at length after he allowed a resident, who was being visited by his mother, to share some of the eggplant parmesan served to him by the staff at the group home with her.
The interrogation was taped by agency officials and by Mr. Monsour, but agency officials later told him in writing that he could not release the tape to the media. They sent Mr. Monsour a second letter warning that he could not even release a transcript redacted to protect patient confidentiality.
Mr. Monsour believes a large part of the problem is that supervisors do not spend enough time in homes beyond weekday work hours, underscoring the challenge in managing such a sprawling network of residences.
''You can't manage all these group homes from a telephone,'' he said, adding, ''there are a lot of good developmental aides who are put in bad situations by management.''
Mr. Monsour wrote to Gov. David A. Paterson's office last year and the attorney general's office, requesting an investigation of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities. Along with his letter, Mr. Monsour included the disciplinary files he had obtained through Freedom of Information Law requests. The governor's office never responded, and the attorney general's office, then run by Mr. Cuomo, referred the matter back to Mr. Monsour's superiors.
''I didn't even get a call from an investigator,'' he said, adding, ''I was thrown under the bus.''
Mr. Monsour's efforts appear to have had little effect on the culture inside the agency.
Employees across the capital region, the area where Mr. Monsour works, were recently warned to keep quiet about episodes inside the group homes. One handout distributed by management bluntly directed employees not to mention reports of abuse in daily progress notes kept on residents. Doing so, the handout warned, could make them subject to subpoena.
''DON'T report in your notes that an Incident Report was filled out,'' the instructions said, adding: ''IF IT ISN'T DOCUMENTED, IT WASN'T DONE.''

HEADLINE: As Death Toll Rises, a Frantic Effort to Rescue Survivors

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and MARK McDONALD; Martin Fackler reported from Nakaminato, and Mark McDonald from Tokyo. Reporting was contributed by Yasuko Kamiizumi and Michael Wines from Tokyo, Nelson Schwartz from New York, Thom Shanker from Washington, and Makiko Inoue from Nakaminato.

 BODY:
NAKAMINATO, Japan -- While nuclear experts were grappling with possible meltdowns at two reactors after the devastating earthquake and ensuing tsunami in northern Japan, the country was mobilizing a nationwide rescue effort to pluck survivors from collapsed buildings and rush food and water to hundreds of thousands of people without water, electricity, heat or telephone service.
Entire villages in parts of Japan's northern Pacific coast have vanished under a wall of water, and many communities are cut off, leaving the country trying to absorb the scale of the destruction even as fears grew over the unfolding nuclear emergency.
Japanese news media estimates of the death toll from the natural disasters ranged from 1,300 to 1,700, but the total could rise. Many communities were scrambling to find the missing; in the port town of Minamisanriku, nearly 10,000 people were unaccounted for, according to the public broadcaster NHK. Much of the northeast was impassable, and by late Saturday rescuers had not arrived in the worst-hit areas. 
Most of the deaths were from drowning, but Japan's Self-Defense Forces and firefighters were working to prevent a higher toll, rushing up the coast in helicopters and struggling to put out fires burning in industrial complexes or sweeping through Japan's many vulnerable wooden homes.
Hundreds of thousands of people were being evacuated from the flooding and quake damage, as well as the threat of radiation exposure around the nuclear plants in Fukushima Prefecture.
To aid in the rescue efforts, the United States, which has several military bases in Japan, is sending in helicopters and destroyers. It is also sending an aircraft carrier, the Ronald Reagan, which has the ability to act as a hospital as well as to convert seawater into drinking water, said a spokesman for the Navy's Seventh Fleet in Japan.
Japan had clearly learned the lessons of the devastating Kobe earthquake of 1995, when the government refused to accept offers of international help early enough, leading to criticism that some of the 6,000 deaths could have been avoided.
Severe aftershocks continued to rock a traumatized country. The United States Geological Survey recorded 90 quakes off the eastern coast on Saturday alone, five of them with magnitudes larger than 6.0. Kyodo News reported more than 125 aftershocks since Friday afternoon's earthquake.
The continual swaying and rolling of the ground deepened the disorientation of a nation accustomed to disaster, but which has not experienced anything on this scale for generations.
Around two nuclear plants along the northern coast of Honshu Island where cooling systems had failed for five reactors, the Japanese authorities were evacuating people and handing out iodine. Some experts believe iodine can help head off long-term effects of radiation exposure, including thyroid cancer.
The breadth of the natural disasters and the potential for untold nuclear damage pose new challenges for a fragile government that has struggled with political scandals, continued economic woes and public frustration over its inability to weaken entrenched bureaucrats.
Aerial photographs of ravaged coastal areas showed a string of cities and villages leveled by the power of the tsunami. Plumes of black smoke rose from burning industrial plants. Stranded ships bobbed in the water. Town after town reported that parts of their population were unaccounted for. Survivors gathered on rooftops, frantically shouting or signaling for help.
With phone service cut throughout the area, some radio and television stations broadcast pleas from people trying desperately to find their family members or at least to assure them that they were alive. ''This is Kimura Ayako in Sapporo, looking for the Tanakas in Soma,'' one caller said. ''We are O.K. Please tell us your location.''
Hatsue Takahashi of Onagawa in Miyagi Prefecture sent out a message on NHK Education TV to Rina Takahashi in the same town: ''Hang on,'' she said. ''I'll go there to meet you.'' And Sachiko Atara of Iwaki city called out across the airwaves in hopes of reaching Hideharu Komatsu in Sendai: ''We are all O.K., waiting for your contact.''
In Oarai, a port about 150 miles south of hard-hit Sendai, fishing boats, truck and cars lay 100 yards back from the water's edge, deposited in a jagged line like seashells left behind by the farthest reach of powerful waves. Some fishing boats had capsized; those swept into town by the tsunami teetered on their sides, or were tossed upside down.
JR, the railway company, reported that three passenger trains had not been accounted for as of Saturday night, amid fears that they were swept away by the tsunami. There were reports of as many as 3,400 buildings destroyed and 200 fires raging. Analysts estimated that total insured losses from the quake could hit $15 billion, Reuters reported.
Even as estimates of the death toll from Friday's quake rose, Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, said 100,000 troops would be mobilized for the increasingly desperate rescue recovery effort. Meanwhile, several ships from the United States Navy joined the rescue effort. The McCampbell and the Curtis Wilbur, both destroyers, prepared to move into position off Miyagi Prefecture.
In addition, the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group was expected to arrive Sunday. Besides serving as a hospital, it can also be used as a platform for refueling helicopters from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Japan was also accepting offers of help from other countries.
Convoys of Japanese military helicopters could be seen flying over the earthquake zone on Saturday, and trucks filled with soldiers were moving into the area.
While aftershocks from the earthquake continued, the tsunami wreaked the most damage. Tsunami experts estimated that despite Japan's extensive warning systems and drills, there would only have been between 15 and 30 minutes after the earthquake struck before the tsunami washed in, leaving those in coastal areas precious little time to flee.
One-third of Kesennuma, a city of 74,000, was reported to be submerged, the BBC said, and photographs showed fires continued to rage there. Iwate, a coastal city of 23,000 people, was reported to be almost completely destroyed, the BBC said.
Local television here reported that the authorities had found 300 to 400 bodies in the town of Rikuzentakata, in Iwate Prefecture. In Minamisoma, in Fukushima Prefecture, 97 residents of a retirement home were found dead. And an additional 100 bodies were found Saturday in Miyagi Prefecture, near the quake's epicenter, bringing the total in those places to more than 500.
Although aftershocks were continuing to rattle Tokyo, signs of normality were appearing. Flight schedules were resuming at Tokyo's principal airports, Narita and Haneda, and most of Tokyo's trains and subways were operating.
Farther north, aerial photos showed floodwaters receding from the runways at the airport in Sendai, perhaps the hardest hit of the coastal cities.
Military units were in Sendai on Saturday, working at evacuation shelters or helping search-and-rescue teams. Sendai's Web site, posted in Tokyo because much of the north was still without electricity, recorded a grim list of the toll: 1.4 million homes in the city without electricity, and 500,000 homes without water. At a school turned refugee center, Nakano Elementary School, 350 people were lifted out by a Self-Defense Forces helicopter, and 400 people in Arahama Elementary School were in the process of being plucked out by helicopters.
''The rescue is going on through the night, of course,'' Michael Tonge, a teacher from Britain, said early Sunday morning from his home in Sendai.
Mr. Tonge said many people in Sendai were still without power, although his home had not lost electricity. ''The government is telling people not to use it too much as they need the power to help bring the nuclear reactor under control,'' he said.
No buildings had collapsed in his neighborhood, Mr. Tonge said, and people were not panicking -- typical of a nation accustomed to order and schooled to stay calm and constructive.
''The few shops open have people queuing nicely,'' he said, ''with no pushing or fighting or anything.'' He said he hoped the earthquake would not come to be known as the ''Sendai quake.''
''I haven't heard it being called the Sendai quake here, but if that's what people are calling it, then that is unfortunate,'' said Mr. Tonge, who lives there with his wife, Yuka, and their 3-year-old daughter, Aoi. ''This is a beautiful city with nice people. A great place to live.''

HEADLINE: Debate Over Baseball's Origins Spills Into Another Century

BYLINE: By JOHN THORN. 
This article was adapted from the book ''Baseball in the Garden of Eden'' by John Thorn, a baseball historian. The book, to be published Tuesday by Simon & Schuster, examines the origins of the game.

 BODY:
Moving beyond the binary and false options of Abner Doubleday and Alexander Cartwright Jr. as the father of baseball, three better candidates emerge: Daniel Lucius Adams, William Rufus Wheaton and Louis Fenn Wadsworth. Cartwright's plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame declares he set the bases 90 feet apart and established nine innings as a game and nine players as a team. He did none of these things, and every other word of substance on his plaque is false.
Adams, known as Doc, set the base paths at 90 feet, among other notable innovations, including creating the position of shortstop -- eight years after Cartwright left New York in the California gold rush of 1849. Wheaton created the Knickerbocker rules by copying a set he had drawn up for an earlier ball club, the Gothams, in 1837. 
As to nine men and nine innings -- and perhaps even more -- these may be credited to Wadsworth. A first baseman for the Gothams and the Knickerbockers from about 1850 to 1862, the mysterious Wadsworth may provide the most compelling story of all.
No one credited him as an innovator until 1907, when the Mills Commission neared the end of its three-year mandate to determine the origins of baseball. On Dec. 30, Abraham G. Mills hurriedly dictated his conclusions to his stenographer and anointed Doubleday, as per the wishes of Albert G. Spalding, whose brainstorm the commission had been.
Yet Mills took care in his final report to note a ''statement made by Mr. Curry, of the pioneer Knickerbocker club'' that ''a diagram, showing the ball field laid out substantially as it is today, was brought to the field one day by a Mr. Wadsworth.'' Despite having officially crowned Doubleday, Mills followed with queries about the identity and whereabouts of Wadsworth for nearly three months, fruitlessly.
On March 20, 1908, the commission's conclusions were published in Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide. No more was heard about Wadsworth until 1973, when Harold Peterson wrote a biography of Alexander Cartwright called ''The Man Who Invented Baseball.'' In it, he observed, ''Mr. Wadsworth, whose Christian name, occupation, residence and pedigree remained secreted in Mills's bosom, was never heard of'' again.
Mills and Peterson believed that if Wadsworth presented a diagram, it must have been in 1845. Herein lay a crucial misunderstanding. Wadsworth was a Gotham until April 1, 1854, when he inexplicably switched allegiances (perhaps in exchange for considerations that would have made him the game's first professional). Did he bring a diagram to the Knick field in 1854-55, when the baselines were not yet established at 90 feet and the pitcher's distance was unspecified?
Maybe yes, maybe no. But he certainly gave us a game of nine innings and nine men, at a critical time when sentiment leaned to seven. Before the first convention of New York area ball clubs on Feb. 25, 1857, a Knickerbocker-dominated rules committee adopted Section 26, making the game seven innings and setting the minimum number of players to a side at seven. In the convention, however, on Wadsworth's rebel motion, the assembled delegates changed the recommendation to nine.
Bu his victory spelled the end of his tenure with the Knickerbockers. Wadsworth failed to appear for a game on June 8, 1857, though he had been named to play. Six days later, he resigned; by the next month, he was again manning first base with his accustomed panache, but for the Gothams.
Wadsworth left a trail that historians and genealogical experts had been unable to pick up. Wadsworth family histories offered no clue. But by 2004, the search tools of the Internet and some proprietary databases opened a new world and, little by little, his story began to unfold.
Wadsworth was born in Connecticut in 1825 and graduated from Washington College in Hartford (now Trinity College) in 1844. Then he went to Michigan, where his well-to-do parents had bought land, and he began a legal career in Manhattan in 1848. A tempestuous character who made enemies easily, Wadsworth was little recalled in New York once his playing days were done.
He later became a judge in New Jersey; was widowed; began to act erratically in his official duties, owing to drink; and lost an estimated $300,000 (perhaps $8 million when adjusted for inflation). Wadsworth was reduced to selling newspapers on the streets until 1898, when he committed himself to Plainfield's poorhouse. For the next 10 years, no one connected him with baseball.
Wadsworth died on March 28, 1908, eight days after publication of the Spalding guide containing Mills's decision. An obituary in The Hartford Daily Times said, ''A veritable bookworm, day after day, he would sit reading.''
''In the summer,'' it continued, ''he was particularly interested in following the scores of the ballgames of the big leagues, and of late years, the game was the one great object of interest to him.''

HEADLINE: The Ascension of Peter Zumthor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Over lunch in Los Angeles some months ago, with the actor Tobey Maguire and his wife, Jennifer Meyer, Peter Zumthor was imperious, charming and a little reserved, as usual. The Swiss architect was in town to discuss a new design for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Maguire and Meyer had invited him out to persuade him to build a house for them. Having long avoided commissions for houses for the rich and famous, Zumthor, now 67, lately concluded that it might be nice to put aside a little nest egg. Besides, he could imagine leaving a mark on a city where plenty of other great architects had worked. So when coffee arrived, he promised to take a look at the property but asked that Maguire and Meyer make a tour of his work in Europe and afterward visit him at his studio in Haldenstein to talk about what they saw. Then he would decide if he could design their house -- whether, in effect, they could be his clients.
''We'll leave right now,'' Maguire volunteered, half rising from the banquette as if prepared to drive at that moment to the airport and hop the first flight for Zurich. 
Zumthor can inspire that sort of reaction. A couple of years ago, when he won the Pritzker Prize, architecture's Nobel, the press declared him a ''prophet.'' ''Skyscrapers are being shortened or stopped entirely due to lack of money, and luxury construction sites from Dubai and Abu Dhabi to Moscow and Peking are lying fallow,'' a writer in Die Welt noted. Zumthor represented a changed ethos. Zumthor himself, a little wishfully, perhaps, told me not long ago that he regarded the prize as reflecting ''a new orientation, back to the earth, back to the real thing, architecture in the traditional sense of making things. I think this awareness is coming back.''
Maybe. In any case, as the designer of some of the subtlest and most admired buildings of the last quarter-century, Zumthor has hardly been toiling in obscurity. But he has eschewed the flamboyant, billboard-on-the-skyline, globe-trotting celebrity persona, setting himself apart from, and in his own mind clearly somewhat above, some of his more famous colleagues. His works, even from the most superficial perspective, differ from Frank Gehry's or Zaha Hadid's or Jean Nouvel's or Norman Foster's, for starters, because they are not flashy: they often don't grab you at all at first glance, being conceived from the inside out, usually over many painstaking years. Moreover, because Zumthor runs a small office and doesn't often delegate even the choice of a door handle, he hasn't taken on many projects, and most of the ones he has completed aren't very big.
As Peter Ruedi, a Swiss critic, wrote recently in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, what results might lead people to mistake Zumthor at first for ''an ascetic.'' But ''he is the opposite,'' Ruedi rightly noted. He is ''an essentialist of the sensual.''
When we met at his studio, Zumthor materialized half an hour late, clearly a little skeptical, as if he wanted me to know that he had little interest in being written about, or at least wanted to appear as if he did. He cuts a striking figure, with a strong nose, close-cropped gray hair and beard, bushy eyebrows and gray blue eyes, and a hawkish gaze he exploits to intimidate or seduce, depending on his audience. ''Normally architects render a service,'' he began, skipping the usual pleasantries. ''They implement what other people want. This is not what I do. I like to develop the use of the building together with the client, in a process, so that as we go along we become more intelligent.''
Not just Maguire and Meyer have been asked to make the pilgrimage to Haldenstein, a speck on the Swiss map. It is sometimes said that Zumthor lives and works there because he's a recluse. But he lives and works there because he can. His studio is split between a pair of buildings, one wood, the other a quasi-monastic glass-and-concrete retreat, on a low terrace above the Rhine at the base of a huge slope, facing pretty snowcapped mountains. It's an anomaly among the quaintly gabled houses with children's plastic slides and bird feeders cluttering the backyards. Associates toil in rapt, somewhat doleful silence, Zumthor brooding on the opposite side of an interior garden, from which occasionally drifts music by Sonny Rollins or Iannis Xenakis. Downstairs and in the other building, architects slave over models for his often-eccentric projects, among them a memorial devoted to witches in the northernmost part of Norway and a 48-room hotel in the high desert in Chile, 1.5 miles above sea level, miles from any human habitation. Zumthor's plan for the hotel resembles a squashed doughnut, which I would recall one evening when he remarked over drinks that while his work ''is close to Le Corbusier because we share the same culture,'' he wished to ''make a design on the scale of Oscar Niemeyer.''
We all dream about our opposites, but on second thought, Zumthor and Niemeyer, the great Brazilian Modernist of fantastical, futuristic extravagance, maybe aren't all that far apart. They share a separatist's mentality and a profound debt to local culture, sticking mainly to their own necks of the woods, and a deep sensual sensibility. They also have in common an aesthetic faith in engineering. Annika Staudt, who leads Zumthor's model-making crew, recalled, as we drove one afternoon from Austria to the studio, Zumthor's pavilion for Switzerland at Expo 2000 in Hannover, Germany, which she encountered as a teenager. ''I went with my school, and everything else there looked fake, but in his pavilion you could actually feel the wood, you could smell it, and you could see the steel in between, and it was all very mysterious but real,'' she said. ''So after that I read what he had written. And the way he described things seemed totally familiar, as if I had known what he was saying but never said it myself -- about the noises things make, the experience of touching things, walking through them.''
A good place to sense what Staudt means is Zumthor's Bruder Klaus chapel, in western Germany. It rises from a modest ridge above the farming village of Wachendorf. In winter, a few deer gambol through crunching snow from the surrounding forest, sniff then retreat. The uphill trek from the nearest road, across an empty field, acts like a natural decompression chamber before the first glimpse of the building: an abrupt concrete block with an odd triangular door on one end.
Inside, pitched walls lead to a sort of cave or teepee with a high, teardrop oculus, open to the sky. A handful of people fit comfortably in the space, but ideally it's made for one or two. Bruder Klaus was a hermit. There are no windows; there is no electricity or running water. Where a central altar might be, there's a shallow pool of water, formed of rain and snow falling through the oculus. Small bottle-glass portholes add points of light, and undulating walls bear the imprints of 112 spruce trees, chopped down from Zumthor's clients' farm, then slowly burned, leaving blackened traces in the thick concrete.
''A small space to be quiet'' is how Zumthor described the chapel to me. For the few solitary minutes I spent inside it, it seemed like the most peaceful and secret spot on earth.
The story goes that a family of devout farmers wrote to Zumthor, out of the blue, having hardly a clue of who he was, knowing only that the archbishop in nearby Cologne had hired him to plan a museum, and they asked him to build a field chapel for them -- and Zumthor agreed, as long as they could wait a decade. I visited the family at their home. They turned out not to be yokels but prosperous and sophisticated, and they were perfectly aware of who he was. Zumthor, who waived his fee because he found the project intriguing, and who devoted years, as it turned out, to devising the chapel with a construction method that would allow villagers to build it themselves, house-raising-style, now grumbles about how much the chapel ultimately cost him, and how his clients kept trying to cut corners, although he said they ultimately acceded to everything.
Still, the original story has a kernel of truth, because with Zumthor a client is entering, firstly, into a relationship that entails Talmudic discussions and Job-like patience. Ask for an appointment with him, and you may get no response for days or weeks. He employs no publicist, dedicates no aide to media relations. Zumthor has long done what he wants and only what he wants. This has been his virtue and burden, inviting comparison with the late American genius Louis Kahn, another proud perfectionist who built just a few buildings, making the most of a coterie of committed clients to leave behind a handful of masterpieces.
Zumthor has often said that the biggest disappointment of his professional career -- an even bigger loss for Berlin, as it turned out -- was the abandonment several years ago of his plan for a museum on the site of the former Gestapo headquarters. Battling for more than a decade with a shifting, indifferent roster of midlevel government bureaucrats, he found he ''had no partner,'' as he put it. Building finally stalled when German political will faded after the opening of a Jewish museum and Holocaust memorial in the city made the project seem less pressing.
''In the end it helped me, because people said I didn't compromise,'' Zumthor rationalized. ''But it was an emotional catastrophe at the time.''
Assuming Zumthor does find a sympathetic partner, though, what gets built will have invariably emerged from a long and complicated gestation process. In Bregenz, Austria, Rudolf Sagmeister, the curator of Zumthor's celebrated Kunsthaus there, which opened in 1997, described how Zumthor parried with locals for ages to get what he wanted.
''It is the dream of architects, especially the ones who hate their lives, to do just a few things but perfectly, each thing a milestone, so architects envy him,'' Sagmeister said. We were seated in a cafe beside the museum, facing a small square, which Zumthor also designed, where a pair of toddlers played in a patch of cold winter sunlight.
Sagmeister went on: ''He's the symbol of what architecture can still be, that is, a labor of love, and of how to work, with a dozen or so assistants from around the world, not huge teams of people, but associates who stay for years and work in a quiet office built around a garden -- an idyll, where you talk about art, architecture and living. He listens to what you want. He poses clever questions and asks a lot. He wants to know about the surrounding area, he wants to know whether the clients have time, whether they're willing to wait, to go through a process of discovery. Investors aren't interested in this sort of thing. They need a schedule. They're buying a kind of product. That's not what they get with Peter. And it's not what he wants in a client.''
Sagmeister recalled how Zumthor resisted calls for a big lakeside window and a restaurant at the top of the Kunsthaus, then stood up to contractors who insisted it would be impossible to achieve the quality of concrete he demanded. ''Some people questioned the glass facade and said that the terrazzo floors would crack. But Peter knew he was right, because he had tested everything himself. So he persisted, and now people here are very proud and we have had no problems and even all these years later, thousands of people come to Bregenz just to see the building.''
Not long ago, Zumthor and I set out from Haldenstein to see his most celebrated work, a town-owned spa connected to a hotel in the mountain village of Vals. Gradually, warily, as we drove, he warmed and gave me a little of his life story. Born into a large Catholic family outside Basel, he was brought up to follow in his father's footsteps as a master cabinetmaker. He remembered his father, not altogether unfondly, as a martinet who taught him ''how to be exacting and uncompromising,'' as he put it, and how to work with his hands. Zumthor attended a Swiss school for applied arts, modeled after the Bauhaus, with teachers from the Bauhaus, from whom he learned ''all the basics of design, the craftsmanship of drawing and looking, of mixing colors, white space and negative space -- form, line and surface.'' He then studied industrial design in New York at Pratt, but never earned an architecture degree, which now seems to be a point of pride. He loves to complain that young architects, having come to rely on computers, ''don't know how things are constructed'' and have ''lost a sense of scale.'' His studio is famous for producing the most extravagant models in wax, lead, aluminum and clay, sometimes even full-scale ones, installed so clients can walk through them and so that Zumthor can see how a design holds up after months or years. ''It's all talk these days,'' he complained in the car. ''Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier came from a tradition in which architects still knew how things were made, how to make things well. We should force universities to train carpenters and woodworkers and leather workers. Architects all want to be philosophers or artists now. I'm lucky to have had my education, because in the States, especially, you've lost contact with the real business of building.''
I've heard Zumthor's detractors respond to this sort of argument by saying he's a Swiss clockmaker. They stress that he thrives in a small pond but that the rough-and-tumble of global-scaled 21st-century projects demands a more flexible and grander vision. It is true that his projects are not enormous; there is an intimacy to his work. At places like Bregenz or the Bruder Klaus chapel, visitors respond not just to how his buildings look but also to their sounds, smells, to the light as it changes around them, even to the feel of the walls and floors -- to what Zumthor has described as the ''beautiful silence that I associate with attributes such as composure, self-evidence, durability, presence and integrity, and with warmth and sensuousness as well.''
As we drove, I came to realize we were going through something of an accelerated version of the process he goes through with clients. The farmers in Wachendorf had told me: ''He causes people to want to give their best. People see it in Zumthor, and see it is a unique situation working with him, a rare opportunity in life.'' I asked about influences on him, and he talked about artists he first encountered in the '60s and '70s -- Americans like Richard Serra, Walter De Maria and Michael Heizer, sculptors who adapted Minimalism toward massive projects that extended into the landscape. He also extolled the mercurial German artist Joseph Beuys, the Luftwaffe pilot turned artist-shaman, who endowed eccentric materials, including wax and felt, with all sorts of private and historical allusions, and whose life itself became a kind of performance. ''With Beuys,'' Zumthor explained, ''my interest has had to do with the mythology and sensuousness of his materials, the importance of his personal life in his art. He was looking at objects with history, with a past.''
Zumthor was at that moment steering through spectacular landscape. ''My first real job,'' he pointed out, ''was in this canton, surveying traditional building types and settlements, cataloguing the ancient economic systems, the system of the farmstead, studying every old house, inside and out. I tried to find out why things here look the way they do, what makes them beautiful, aesthetic. For me as an architect it turned out to be about overcoming architectural Modernism, in which everything had to be new and nothing was supposed to have history. The Bauhaus seems to me now very limited in that respect, and this survey work helped me overcome that limitation.''
We arrived at the Vals spa, where his wife, Annalisa, met us in the hotel bar. An attractive, poised woman, she seemed a forbearing partner for a man whom associates describe, not altogether unsympathetically, as demanding and self-critical. The hotel was a sleek but nondescript Modernist box, which Zumthor distilled to its '60s essence, and to which he added his spa, like the Baths of Caracalla to a Days Inn. Built into the mountainside as a maze of lofty, exquisitely proportioned volumes, with heavy, bespoke walls made of finely cut slabs of local stone fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle, the spa invests ordinary leisure-time bathing with a sacramental gravity. It lends existential weight to even the simplest, most banal rituals -- walking from room to room, looking out a window, reclining on a bench, gazing up at the sky or hearing the splash of water and the echo of footsteps. Bathers move like supplicants through wet stone chapels.
''Vals is not about an outside object,'' Zumthor wanted to make clear. ''It's not about lap pools and slides and gadgets. It is about what happens inside, the bathing, oriented toward the ritual, as if in the Orient. It's about water and stone and light and sound and shadow. People in Vals said it was elitist, that our plan would fail. The old hotel manager even quit, and the marketing expert the village hired said we were doomed, that the town would be crazy to follow an architect. But some local guys said, no, we'll try this. They had become so excited by developing the plan that their conviction was genuine. They had started to feel part of what we were doing, and convinced other people, and finally the rest of the community. We took people seriously, and so the whole process was transparent.''
A local businessman was sipping a beer, listening. ''Now it's our Matterhorn,'' he volunteered.
When I tried out the spa myself early the next morning, a few bathers were already soaking in deep contemplation. The baths, all of them different, each came as a surprise, appearing around a corner, or down some steps. Zumthor had talked about the ''longing'' of spaces to be discovered. In Cologne, the new structure he built for the Kolumba museum, which houses the archdiocese's art collection, shares its site with the ruins of a Gothic church bombed during World War II and with a chapel, a 1950s period piece by Gottfried Bohm. Zumthor embraced the ruins and the chapel, wrapping a perforated brick facade like a cloak around both, and also around the museum, the discreet entrance to which opens onto galleries that, as with the baths, are all distinct but feel custom-made for the art, just as the art, uplifted by the most sensitive architecture, feels as if it were made for the rooms.
''I think the chance of finding beauty is higher if you don't work on it directly,'' Zumthor has said in describing his philosophy. ''Beauty in architecture is driven by practicality. This is what you learn from studying the old townscapes of the Swiss farmers. If you do what you should, then at the end there is something, which you can't explain maybe, but if you are lucky, it has to do with life.''
Later that morning, we drove to a pair of small wooden houses he recently completed for himself and Annalisa near a peak above Vals. She grew up at these heights. A wood house was her dream. For his part, Zumthor welcomed an excuse to rethink the local log-cabin design. He stuck with classic wood-beam construction, but in place of the old four-walled box structures that produced small, dark rooms, he essentially turned the boxes into towers spanned by broad sheets of glass that allowed for wide-open spaces framing spectacular views.
Working with the traditional wood beams was crucial, he said. ''Solid wood has almost disappeared as too expensive, complicated and old-fashioned,'' he explained. ''I reintroduced it as a construction method here because it feels good to be with, to be in. You feel a certain way in a glass or concrete or limestone building. It has an effect on your skin -- the same with plywood or veneer, or solid timber. Wood doesn't steal energy from your body the way glass and concrete steal heat. When it's hot, a wood house feels cooler than a concrete one, and when it's cold, the other way around. So I preserved the wood-beam construction because of what it can do for your body.''
You can feel exactly what he means if you travel an hour or so away to Sumvitg to see another chapel he designed, nearly a quarter of a century ago. An avalanche during the mid-1980s destroyed the Baroque chapel there. The village priest held a competition for its replacement. Zumthor's plan called for a pointed wedge of dark shingled wood clinging to a mountainside, like the mysteriously stranded bow of an ancient ship, with clerestory windows, a modest single door atop simple concrete steps and two bells perched on a slender tower. The interior, light-bathed and exalting, suggests the ship's galley: a wooden jewel box with a creaky wood floor.
''That was on purpose,'' Zumthor told me. ''I put a slight warp in the floor to make the creak, which would exist just below your level of consciousness. Call it romantic, I guess. All music needs some kind of container, and this container must be designed. That's what architecture can do. I always think, 'What should be the acoustic in a museum, a chapel, your bathroom?' Architects may not ask clients this question, but people can always tell you what they want.''
He looked around. ''It's so touching to see after all these years,'' he decided. ''I told the priest, 'What I can offer you is the memory of the church I had as a boy.' '' At that moment, he caught sight of a cheap wood cabinet, crammed near the front door, installed without his approval, he said. ''But it is O.K.,'' he told himself. Then he opened the front door, listening for the satisfying clunk of the door handle, squinted into the winter sun and crunched back through the snow toward the car.
Months later, Zumthor told me that he agreed to take on the house for Maguire and Meyer. Maguire had requested a basketball court, Zumthor said. Zumthor imagined gardens instead, an Alhambra in Hollywood. I said nothing, already knowing who would win that argument.
That this very Swiss architect should be building not just a movie star's house but also rethinking a major public space for this quintessentially American city might seem odd. Zumthor spent time in Los Angeles years ago, it turns out, and like so many Europeans fell for its foreignness. But more than that, Los Angeles, like Zumthor, has cultivated its own idiosyncratic take on Modernism, steeped in locale: in landscape, climate, sunlight, space. Zumthor is, in fact, strangely at home there.
That's certainly how he looked, in white band-collar shirt, loose brown linen jacket and black baggy slacks, arriving at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art one morning, to brainstorm. With a big, open sketch pad, pencil in hand, Zumthor stood in a conference room before a handful of staff members, including Michael Govan, the museum's director. ''You're invited to say I'm crazy or whatever,'' he began, doodling absently in the pad. ''I start with the collection, which is the basis of the museum. I think of separate collections, putting them on different floors, and then I have this terrible feeling, like I am in a department store, with shoes and shirts. So then I draw a forest. And in the forest I find jewels. I have to go here, there, to get them. I think of these jewels as parts of the collection, with their own pavilions, and this gives me a new feeling.''
Imagine the pavilions as metaphorical trees, he went on, ''their volumes up in the branches, up in the air. So then I need a system of ramps. Maybe there is a catwalk system.'' He sketched more quickly. ''Now we have the opposite feeling from a department store. But I am getting confused, weak. I want the sense of informal freedom. I want to feel I am outside. I want a village, but with an upper level, a lower level.'' He was sketching, sketching. ''But it must give a feeling of peace. Now I feel it will be right only if the collections have real homes.''
Zumthor was testing his audience. John Bowsher, the museum's point man for special installations, rose to the bait. Time, he said, unfolds differently in Los Angeles than it does in, say, New York or Switzerland. There is ''the evenness of life here, the pace of life lived in cars,'' he said. ''And so if you give people the same evenness in the museum, then it's nothing special.''
Zumthor paused. ''To say, 'Let's build something flexible,' this doesn't produce good results,'' he said. ''I have to give these alienated works of art some energy, something so that people don't just pass by them and say, 'Did you see African art?' 'I don't know.' So now I no longer see a village but a park. I hate a didactical museum. The goal is a highly emotional place, to put someone in a mood to listen or read or feel.''
Govan spoke up. He said the museum had certain treasures, which needed special treatment. How might the collections be reorganized around them? he asked. Might a new layout lead to new ways of telling art history? The conversation slowly devolved into issues of zoning, parking and gas lines and away from time, trees and treasures. After the meeting ended, Zumthor instantly started fretting. He was hired to reconsider just the eastern part of the campus. The western end was a hodgepodge of buildings and parkland, he said, with a half-baked attempt at classical order. ''I don't understand this axis idea, like for the French king,'' he said. ''I'm too late.'' He consoled himself with the prospect of devising paths and vistas around the campus for outdoor works of art by Heizer, Jeff Koons and Robert Irwin.
The next day he repeated more or less the same spiel before Terry Semel, co-chairman of the board of trustees and a former chairman of Warner Brothers and Yahoo. Semel wanted to hear about attracting more families to the museum and linking it to the La Brea tar pits next door. He recalled his own experiences running a theme park, opening new attractions from time to time to keep the public coming back. Staggering the opening of new pavilions might do the same for the museum, he suggested. ''Why not make a place the whole family wants to come to a couple of times a year, more, not just once?''
''The museum needs to be in close relation to the park,'' is how Zumthor chose to respond. ''I also have a vision of kids running around, asking, 'What's that golden building back there?' ''
A golden building? Semel inquired, but Zumthor brushed aside talk of what the buildings would look like. That evening, he told me: ''Museum officials always claim they have the greatest collection of this or that, and of course they are always right. And their question for me is: 'What will it look like?' Then I have to go back and talk content, function, how a place works, and I tell them I need time before I get to their question.''
On reflection, he decided that the meetings had gone all right and were the start of a long and complicated project, which was the pleasure of architecture for him. His mind turned back to the idea of galleries in treetops. ''I believe in the spiritual value of art, as long as it's not exclusive,'' he said. ''It is the same with architecture.''
''It's about elevation,'' he added. ''Everybody can go up, after all.''

HEADLINE: New Worries For Buyers Seeking Mortgages

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
AT last, the hunt was over.
After months of having her hopes dashed as swiftly as they were raised, viewing nearly 40 apartments and cycling through three different brokers, Deborah Herman finally found the perfect New York City home.
The moment she stepped into the two-bedroom apartment at 59th Street and First Avenue, with its oversized windows and sweeping views of the Queensboro Bridge, she just knew.
''We made an offer, and we got it,'' she said.
That was in August. But it was only in February, nearly six months later, that she finally closed on the $1.15 million apartment. 
In the intervening months, as she battled through a computer glitch and reams of documentation, Ms. Herman underwent a crash course in the complexities of navigating the mortgage market -- which itself continues to undergo profound change.
The dread of not finding a lender after the market collapsed in 2009 has been replaced by uncertainty, confusion and frustration. According to brokers and lenders, the list of demands that stand between finding a place to buy and signing on the dotted line simply never stops morphing.
Changes proposed by the Obama administration to limit the role of the federal government in the mortgage market could further alter the rules of the road, for borrowers and lenders alike.
In New York City, there is particular concern about the federal government's lowering the limit on the loans it will buy through the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, and the other housing finance giant, Freddie Mac.
Lower-income buyers could also be affected as the federal government seeks to limit the size of loans eligible to be bought by the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs.
And let's not forget the federal government's proposal to eliminate the mortgage interest tax deduction for high-income earners; the changes in the way brokers will be compensated because of new regulations; and the fact that banks -- despite recent profits -- are still leery of lending. Taken together, all these elements create a situation that can paralyze potential buyers.
''Confusion and uncertainty can have the same impact as fear, unfortunately,'' said David S. Marinoff, a mortgage broker and managing director of the Guard Hill Financial Corporation.
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that even though affordability was at an all-time high, the usual equation involving interest rates, housing prices and personal income was almost irrelevant, if shoppers were unable to get mortgages to buy properties now tantalizingly within reach.
Private banks have swung too far in overcorrecting for the excesses of the credit boom from 2003 to 2008, he said, and are actively looking for ways not to lend.
''Housing does not truly recover until lending does,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It is currently dysfunctional.''
At the moment, the federal government, through Fannie and Freddie, is supporting about 90 percent of new mortgage loans, because banks are reluctant to make loans without government guarantees.
Currently, Fannie will buy loans of up to $729,750.
In September that limit will fall to $625,500 if no action is taken by Congress. Considering that the average Manhattan apartment in the last quarter of 2010 sold for $845,000, according to Mr. Miller, the change could affect a wide swath of the market.
For instance, even if a buyer put 20 percent down -- which would be $169,000 for the $845,000 home -- the total loan needed, $676,000, would still be above the new limit. The buyer would have to come up with $50,500 more to avoid paying the likely higher interest rates that a lender would charge on a ''jumbo'' mortgage, assuming that the buyer could qualify for a loan at all.
Yet many politicians have been calling for the federal government to lessen the role it plays in the mortgage market, even if the first steps prove painful. There are also plans, several years down the road, for ending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac altogether.
Before the credit crisis in 2008, the limit on loans that Fannie would buy was $417,000. But when private lending all but disappeared and the government seized control of Fannie, the agency raised the limit of loans it would buy to $729,750 in more expensive cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco.
Banks simply weren't lending at that time, Mr. Marinoff said.
Real estate brokers and private mortgage lenders say that although 2010 was not as bleak as 2009, tighter credit has affected nearly every sector of the market in New York City.
For lower-income families, mainly outside Manhattan, the collapse in subprime lending to borrowers with a problematic credit history or low incomes has led to a boom in the number of loans backed by the F.H.A. and Veterans Affairs.
In 2005, fewer than 1 percent of all the loans issued in the city were backed by these agencies. In 2009, 16 percent of loans in the city were made possible by these federal programs, according to a recent report by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
But another change being proposed by the Obama administration -- shrinking the size of loans eligible to be bought by the F.H.A. and V.A. -- could mean that less affluent buyers would need to come up with larger down payments as well. The government also said it would raise fees on F.H.A. borrowers for the third straight year.
The reasons for all the proposed changes are well chronicled, since it was easy credit and lax oversight that led to the bubble to begin with. And there has been bipartisan agreement that the role of the government needs to be scaled back.
Sarah Gerecke, the executive director of the Furman Center, says changes that bolster the confidence of borrowers and lenders will be a positive step.
But others worry about the effect that all the changes will have on a still-fragile market.
Borrowers and developers in New York City will also be facing new hurdles resulting from two regulations that Fannie put in place starting March 1. In the first, if a buyer wants to get a federally backed loan for an apartment in a new condominium conversion, Fannie is requiring that the property be inspected to determine how much cash the condo board needs to keep in reserve for capital improvements.
Especially for older buildings, the rule could require that developers keep more than 20 percent of their annual budget in reserve -- much more than the current norm of 10 percent for condos.
One result, according to Orest Tomaselli, the chief executive of National Condo Advisors, an independent advisory group, could be higher maintenance fees.
Co-ops are not covered under the new regulation.
The other new regulation declared that Fannie Mae would not issue loans to people buying into converted condominium buildings in which more than 30 percent of the units remained rent-stabilized, unless the project had been previously approved.
These changes, taken together with lower limits on the loans Fannie will issue, could severely affect what is still a halting recovery, Mr. Tomaselli said.
Beyond the new rules and regulations, even those who qualify for a loan can be flummoxed by the process of getting from preapproval to closing.
Ms. Herman, who bought the apartment overlooking the Queensboro Bridge, said she had been armed with $440,000 in cash in the bank and tax returns from the previous three years showing an annual income of $700,000 to $1.1 million.
Weeks turned to months as Ms. Herman, who owns a linen supply company, awaited final approval on the loan. And every 30 days she was required to update all the financial information she had turned over to the bank.
Then, at some point during her wait, a glitch surfaced in the electronic transfer of her mortgage payment for her Florida home, making it seem as if she had missed a payment.
Her credit score fell to 670 from 740, and the deal almost collapsed. Only after another flurry of letters, a phone call from her lender in Florida to the prospective lender in New York, and another three-week delay, did the matter get resolved.
She had always planned to put 20 percent down, but as the deal drew closer, she was told by the New York lender that the only way she would get the seven-year adjustable-rate mortgage at 3.5 percent was to put 38 percent down, bringing the amount below the $729,750 ceiling for a federally guaranteed loan.
''Fortunately,'' she said, ''I had the money.''

HEADLINE: Medicaid and the N.Y. Budget: Sensible Cuts, and Little Political Flak

 BODY:
New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo has achieved a significant political and budgetary victory getting the state's powerful health care providers and its major health care workers' union to agree to live within a strict Medicaid spending limit for the next fiscal year and accept a slow rate of growth after that.
Medicaid costs are a quarter of the state's operating budget, and this agreement is an important step toward closing a projected $10 billion deficit. 
The governor's Medicaid Redesign Team -- which was dominated by health care providers and public officials -- agreed to hold state spending on the major portion of Medicaid to $15.1 billion next year, well below the $18 billion originally projected. They also agreed to hold future growth to a 10-year rolling average of medical inflation. That is a very stringent standard.
Over a recent five-year stretch, the state's share of Medicaid spending grew by an adjusted rate of more than 6 percent a year; medical inflation has been increasing by about 4 percent. If the team can't find the savings, the state will step in to make it happen.
The redesign team approved dozens of proposals to cut spending, all of which have been incorporated into Mr. Cuomo's budget or related legislation. The Legislature, which must enact a final budget by April 1, should adopt most of the recommendations. They are sensible and necessary. We urge lawmakers to force out a misguided cap on malpractice awards -- a provision engineered by hospital leaders that would deprive many injured patients of fair compensation.
The biggest immediate savings in the plan would come by cutting payments to providers and managed care companies. Those cuts would be mitigated by subsidies to help failing safety net hospitals, nursing homes and clinics to restructure, merge with more solvent institutions or close in an orderly fashion. Still, there is a risk that people in some poor neighborhoods may find it harder to get care.
The plan would place new burdens on some of the state's most vulnerable citizens -- the poor, the sick, the elderly. But for the most part they were protected from substantial harm. There would be no change in eligibility standards to force people off the rolls and no wholesale elimination of benefits previously offered.
Instead, there would be narrowly tailored reductions. Right now, patients who need rehabilitative services like physical, occupational or speech therapy have no limits on the amount of care they can receive. The new budget would limit them to 20 visits in a 12-month period. The goal is to reduce excessive utilization. But 20 visits might not be enough for some badly disabled patients, and an efficient monitoring process will be needed.
Home care visits for housekeeping services would be limited to eight hours a week in New York City, placing more of a burden on families. Reimbursements to fee-for-service dentists would be cut, making it harder for patients to find a dentist who will take them.
Medicaid patients would also be asked to pay a bit more in co-payments. Right now they pay $3 for a clinic visit or a brand-name drug. That would rise to $3.40. Right now, they pay $25 for a hospital stay. That would rise to $30. The increases seem modest, but any co-payments carry the risk of discouraging some poor people from seeking care they really need.
The package contains many sound reforms, including greater use of managed care and other forms of care coordination. If done well, those steps should lower costs and, one hopes, improve treatment.
One of the biggest changes in this process is political. For years hospitals and health care workers have used their clout in Albany -- and high-priced advertising campaigns -- to ward off cuts and reform. Mr. Cuomo pre-empted them, first by threatening to wage his own advertising campaign against them and then by inviting them to join his Redesign Team.
Now instead of battling the governor, the Greater New York Hospital Association and Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, representing health care workers, have together initiated an advertising campaign praising his leadership and urging the Legislature to give him what he wants.
It was smart to bring these key players into the effort to find ways to cut spending quickly and a real coup to get them to accept very tight spending limits. But Mr. Cuomo must be careful not to give them a disproportionate say going forward in reshaping the state's health care system. Officials need to give patients' advocates a stronger voice. The only patients' advocate on the redesign team abstained from approving the package.

HEADLINE: The Case for Europe's Blue Chips

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR many American investors, European stocks were an afterthought last year, as a growing debt crisis threatened to upend economic recovery on the Continent. But in recent months, European shares have rebounded.
Even as European leaders grapple for a solution to their region's debt crisis, Wall Street is now debating another question: Should investors, who are flocking to blue-chip stocks for the first time in years, favor the European or domestic variety?
Both the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe index and the Standard & Poor's 500 are up nearly 4 percent this year. ''European stocks still offer compelling values,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
The price-to-earnings ratio for European shares is just 13.2, below the 15.2 of the S.& P. 500. For many years previously, European stocks traded at a premium to American shares.
There's also the currency advantage to consider. The Wall Street consensus is that the dollar is likely to weaken further against the euro this year, continuing a trend that's been unfolding since last summer. If that happens, Americans who invest in European shares will enjoy a lift -- over and above any stock price gains -- just because of the euro's relatively stronger value.
They're already enjoying that tail wind. Shares of Siemens, the German conglomerate, for example, have gained 2 percent this year, as the company has enjoyed better-than-expected profits -- partly because of sales growth in rapidly expanding emerging markets. But tack on the effect of the weakening dollar and those returns more than double, to 5 percent.
''A weak dollar is good if you're an American investing overseas,'' said Alec Young, international equity strategist at S.& P. Equity Research Services. But ''if it lasts too long,'' he added, ''it could turn out to be bad.''
Just as a falling dollar can improve prospects for American investors abroad, it can be a boost for domestic companies trying to export their products overseas. That's because a weakening currency makes their products cheaper for foreign customers. Conversely, a stronger euro makes it harder for European companies to export their goods.
''There is a price at which the currency exchange rate impacts the business model,'' said David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ''It's north of $1.40,'' he said, referring to the current exchange rate of just under $1.40 to the euro. ''But is it $1.50, $1.60, $1.70? I have no idea.''
For now, he said, European stocks still look attractive.
But it's not just the weakening dollar that investors must weigh, some strategists say. Another consideration is why the dollar is falling against the euro in the first place.
One reason is that the European Central Bank has signaled that it may soon raise short-term interest rates to combat a rising threat of inflation. In fact, Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank president, recently hinted that a rate increase could come as early as next month. By comparison, most investors think the Federal Reserve will hold short-term rates in the United States steady until the start of 2012.
Why are the European bankers considering such a quick move? Consumer prices in the region have risen 2.3 percent over the last year, noticeably faster than the 1.6 percent gain in the United States. And rising oil prices, spurred by the political turmoil in the Middle East, is likely to feed European inflation fears.
If the European Central Bank does tighten its monetary policy, it will not only be tapping the brakes on the region's economy, but may also put further pressure on the dollar, because global investors will be rewarded with higher yields for parking their cash in euros. That, in turn, may add to the pressure European exporters -- and their earnings.
''With slower growth and slightly higher inflation there, I would imagine the profit squeeze in Europe will be a little bigger than in the U.S.,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight.
Would that be enough to snuff out the European rally?
Mr. Young said he didn't think so. ''If we were talking about rates moving from 4 percent to 5 percent, this would be a bigger issue,'' he said. But since rates are only about 1 percent now, ''It's not that big a factor,'' he said.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, disagrees. He said that if the European Central Bank soon raised rates, ''European policy officials will probably come to realize by late summer that they tightened too early.''
He expects the domestic economy, meanwhile, to keep heating up. ''The combination of hotter growth here and policy changes that could slow the growth there would seem to favor domestic large caps,'' he said.
For the moment, investors who are wondering where to place bets may want to make decisions case by case and sector by sector, Mr. Kotok said.
Because of uncertainties about health care reform in the United States, he said, investors looking at pharmaceutical companies might favor Sanofi-Aventis -- the French giant that recently bought Genzyme -- over a domestic drug maker.
But, he said, if investors want to bet on energy, they might favor a domestic player like ExxonMobil over Royal Dutch Shell, based in the Netherlands, as Exxon is making a big push into the potentially promising domestic natural gas market.
When it comes to your overall portfolio, though, it's ultimately not a case of either/or, he said. ''You need to own stocks both here and over there to be properly diversified,'' he advised.

HEADLINE: In Yemeni Capital, Security Forces Attack Protesters' Encampment

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- Fighting escalated between antigovernment protesters and security forces on Saturday, and four people were reported killed, even as President Ali Abdullah Saleh promised the White House that he would not use violence against the demonstrators.
At least three people were killed here in the capital, and a 14-year-old boy was killed in a protest in the south, witnesses said.
The American ambassador here, Gerald M. Feierstein, warned that the situation had become ''dangerous'' and urged both sides to pursue negotiations. 
The confrontations came a day after the largest protest yet in the three-week uprising, when an estimated 100,000 people staged a sit-in in Sana demanding the ouster of Mr. Saleh, who has ruled for more than three decades.
The numbers had dwindled to about 10,000 by early Saturday morning, when the police moved in with water cannons to try to demolish tents set up by protesters outside Sana University. Then the shooting started.
''We finished our morning prayers, and then they rushed at us with a water cannon and then live bullets and tear gas,'' said Sadeq al-Haijazy, an unemployed protester, his head bandaged after he was hit by a thrown rock. ''But we are staying here until we die.''
Plainclothes pro-government forces with Kalashnikovs fired from the rooftops and upper floors of nearby apartment buildings. At least some of the shooting appeared to be with rubber bullets.
Some protesters retaliated by throwing rocks toward the security forces, which included about 200 soldiers and plainclothes forces, breaking pieces of stone from a barrier that soldiers had previously used to block the protests.
''They wanted to push us back off this street,'' said Abdel Kader al-Mamari, an engineer standing in a puddle left over from the water cannon barrage. ''They don't understand that what we want is to change the regime.''
Hundreds of people were wounded in the clash, at least 13 of them by live fire, according to doctors at a nearby mosque that is serving as a field hospital. Volunteer medical staff members there rigged up intravenous drips and bandaged wounds.
The doctors said two people had been killed by live ammunition. A third person, a female bystander, was fatally shot in another part of the city, European Union security officials said.
There were also clashes in the southern port city of Mukalla, where a 14-year-old boy was killed by security forces, according to local reports.
An American Embassy statement on Saturday urged the Yemeni government, an American ally, to investigate the reports of violence. It rejected accusations ''that the U.S. has somehow condoned the use of violence by any side.''
It urged both sides to negotiate. On Friday, John O. Brennan, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, telephoned Mr. Saleh, urging that ''representatives of all sectors of the Yemeni opposition should respond constructively to President Saleh's call to engage in a serious dialogue to end the current impasse,'' a White House statement said.
Mr. Saleh ''reiterated his hope that the opposition will engage immediately in a dialogue with the government as well as his public assurance not to use violence against peaceful demonstrators,'' the statement said.
But some protesters on Saturday angrily rejected the idea that they should talk with a government that was shooting at them.
''The White House tells us to have dialogue, what is the use?'' said Riyadh al-Selwy, a student holding an onion to his nose to ease the sting of tear gas. ''It's been 33 years. We want democracy like you,'' he told an American reporter.

HEADLINE: Police in Azerbaijan Arrest Antigovernment Protesters

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Baku, Azerbaijan.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The police in Azerbaijan arrested 50 protesters on Saturday, the second day of demonstrations in Baku, the capital, calling for the resignation of President Ilham Aliyev, whose family has been ruling the oil-rich state since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Several hundred protesters gathered Saturday for a rally organized by an opposition party, Musavat, which intended to ride the wave of revolts in the Middle East and North Africa. On Friday, about 60 people showed up to protest, following instructions on a Facebook page to wear red and find one another on the streets. 
On both days, the police were waiting for the demonstrators, arresting them as soon as they began to gather. They had a harder time controlling the fluid crowd on Saturday, filling a series of vans with detainees and calling in reinforcements.
''It is impossible to live under an authoritarian regime,'' said one protester, Elkhan Alnagiyev, who was promptly arrested by undercover police officers who had seen him speaking to a journalist.
Another protester, Rashad Aliyev, said he had come because he was unemployed.
''It's not that there are no jobs; it's that I don't know anyone who will put me in a job,'' Mr. Aliyev said. ''They are oppressing us.''
Azerbaijan, a major producer of oil and natural gas with a population of nine million, was ranked as one of the most corrupt countries in the world last year by Transparency International.
The authorities have begun a campaign to crack down on graft, with high-profile firings of university administrators and other officials.
Mr. Aliyev has also been criticized for restricting the press and for failing to create meaningful democratic institutions.
Over the past week, the authorities warned university students that they could be expelled if they missed classes during the protests. Mubariz Qurbanli, a member of the governing New Azerbaijan Party, said the low turnout on Friday proved that the people of Azerbaijan did not support the opposition.
''Everyone understands that confrontation and chaos harm each member of society,'' Mr. Qurbanli said in comments that were carried by the Interfax news service on Friday. ''All such attempts will meet the same fate because there is no support for more radical politics in Azerbaijan.''
The Interior Ministry reported that 43 people had been detained on Friday and 50 on Saturday, and said that about 40 of those were likely to be prosecuted, according to Interfax.
Among those detained before the protest were Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, the only organizer of the Friday protests who is living inside the country; he was taken into custody on March 4.
The United States Embassy said in a statement that it was following reports of Mr. Hajiyev's detention ''and, in particular, allegations that he may have suffered abuse and been denied legal counsel.''
The police also detained Etibar Salmanli, who was shown on a YouTube video distributing pink leaflets about the protests. On Thursday, the Justice Ministry closed the Azerbaijan Human Rights House, which that assists activists and defenders of human rights.
The protest on Friday was among the first to be organized online in Azerbaijan, where the number of Facebook users has jumped in recent months.
According to Socialbakers.com, a Facebook traffic-tracking Web site, Azerbaijan's Facebook use grew by about 5 percent in February to reach 324,880 people, more than three-quarters of whom are 18 to 34 years old.
''Facebook is a huge asset for us,'' said Turgut Gambar, who was arrested and released Friday after the police spotted him with a group of young people dressed in red.
''I hear people talking about the 11th of March without us making a huge, huge effort.''

HEADLINE: The Problem With Pointing Fingers

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. You work as part of a team that has made a serious mistake and lost business as a result. You know who dropped the ball and think that this person should be held accountable. How can you place the blame in an acceptable, professional way?
A. The last thing you want is a reputation for throwing co-workers under the bus. It's far more politically savvy and productive to approach the mistake as a team problem. 
''Recommend a post-mortem analysis of what happened, where you look at the chain of events, what occurred and what didn't, and questions get answered in a good-faith process,'' says Ben Dattner, a management consultant and author of ''The Blame Game: How the Hidden Rules of Credit and Blame Determine Our Success or Failure.''
Even if it was clearly just one person who made the mistake, it's helpful to look at ways the entire team can make sure the error isn't repeated.
Jodi Glickman, president of Great On The Job, a communications training firm in Chicago, says that little is accomplished by focusing on one person's mistake. ''It's not about the one error,'' she says. ''It's about the breakdown in communications or the lack of understanding of responsibilities.''
You can, however, speak privately to the person. Let the person know you are aware that the mistake is his or her responsibility, Ms. Glickman says, and ask how you could help prevent it from happening in the future.
Q.What if someone blames you for something that isn't your fault? Can you protect yourself without seeming overly defensive or childish?
A. Avoid a knee-jerk response and take a step back instead, says Lynn Taylor, chief executive of Lynn Taylor Consulting, a workplace productivity firm in Santa Monica, Calif., and author of ''Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant.'' She suggests putting yourself in the other person's shoes to try to understand why he or she is blaming you. ''Is the person threatened? Are they confused about your role versus their role?'' she says. Show empathy to help defuse the tension, letting the person know you understand that there is reason for concern.
Then look at the duties associated with your job to determine which project tasks were within your scope of responsibility and which ones weren't, and take that to your manager, says Jill A. Brown, an assistant professor of management at the College of Business and Economics at Lehigh University.
Keep your tone professional, and stick to the facts. Acknowledge that while you weren't involved with the problem, you will be happy to help resolve it, Ms. Taylor says. ''You can go to the person who dropped the ball and offer to brainstorm ways to approach the client again or recapture the business,'' she says.
Q. How does all the finger-pointing in a workplace affect its culture?
A. Unfortunately, finger-pointing or scapegoating is fairly common, says Ms. Brown -- especially recently, as many workers have been feeling insecure about their jobs. When people are insecure, they tend to shirk responsibility for their mistakes, she says.
A culture of blame can create a very difficult work environment, says Alina Tugend, who writes the Shortcuts column for The New York Times and is the author of ''Better By Mistake.''
Research shows that people in the workplace tend to copy blaming as a behavior, whether consciously or unconsciously, thus perpetuating the problem, Ms. Tugend says. ''Conversely,'' she adds, ''when people see others taking responsibility for their mistakes or failures, they also copy that, creating a better overall work environment.''
Q. Giving and receiving credit for a job well done is important, too. What's the right way to give credit to others?
A. Credit motivates employees, Mr. Dattner says, and when there is a lack of it, people become demoralized and disengaged. But make sure that the amount of credit you give is commensurate with the accomplishment, Ms. Taylor says. ''If it's a small thing someone did, for example, don't make it a public event,'' she says. Instead, thank the person privately or by e-mail -- and be specific about what you're acknowledging.
Vary the way you pat colleagues on the back. ''If you say 'great job' to someone at every staff meeting, it loses its meaning, so mix things up,'' Ms. Taylor says. Give credit only when it's truly deserved and then do so in a variety of ways and places -- at meetings, during a lunch, in an e-mail, by text or by memo, using different language each time, she says.
Q. Although acknowledging others is important for overall morale, does it benefit you directly in any way?
A. Giving credit to others publicly positions you as a leader, Ms. Brown says, because the ability to give credit is an important dimension of leadership. It also makes others want to work with you and for you, Ms. Glickman says. ''If you share credit, are conscious of other people's agendas and are always trying to make your colleagues look good, people will love you,'' she says. ''They will want to be on your team.''

HEADLINE: Hartford Symphony Seeks to Stay Vital

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LIKE many orchestras, the Hartford Symphony Orchestra is refashioning itself for the 21st century -- a task for which its new music director, chosen after a search that began two years ago, seems particularly well suited.
When Carolyn Kuan, 33, takes the orchestra's reins next season, she will bring substantial credentials in contemporary music to the position; she will also be the first female music director in Hartford's 68-year history. But it may be her prospective ability to connect with the city's civic and cultural life that recommended her most for the job.
''We wanted someone who could make a case as a leader about the role of the symphony in our community,'' said Michael Yaffe, chairman of the search committee and associate dean at the Yale School of Music. 
Edward Cumming, the departing music director, has already made efforts to appeal to churches, chambers of commerce and the like over the nine seasons of his tenure -- the orchestra even won an award from the MetLife Foundation for community engagement in 2004 -- but he said that improving the quality of the music had taken precedence. ''How well the orchestra sounds has always been my top priority,'' he wrote in an e-mail, ''much more so than, say, reaching out to the community.''
Ms. Kuan, on the other hand, views the music director's role as one in which furthering the orchestra's integration into the community is as important as maintaining its artistic excellence.
''We're moving toward a more participatory world,'' said Ms. Kuan, who graduated from Smith College with a double major in music and economics and did postgraduate work at the University of Illinois and the Peabody Institute in Baltimore. ''People want to know how the symphony is relevant.''
Since her appointment was announced in January, Ms. Kuan, who was associate conductor of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, artist in residence at the New York City Ballet and assistant conductor of the Baltimore Opera Company, has begun to meet with public figures in Hartford. She is considering giving outdoor concerts on weekends to draw people downtown and expanding the orchestra's presence in schools.
Her travels in Hartford are already reflected in her programming. Inspired by a visit to the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, her inaugural concerts as music director-designate, running from this Thursday to Sunday, will include Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' and ''The Chairman Dances'' by John Adams, whose title refers to a scenario in which Mao Zedong does a foxtrot.
Ms. Kuan has built her reputation for new-music advocacy as Marin Alsop's longtime assistant conductor at the Cabrillo Festival for Contemporary Music in Santa Cruz, Calif. Tom Fredericks, Cabrillo's director of development, praised Ms. Kuan's contributions. He said her tenure in Hartford could serve as a test of how easily the culture of new music can be spread.
Ms. Kuan said she would assess the ''taste and comfort level'' of the Hartford audience before programming too much new music, and a preliminary draft of the 2011-12 schedule features much standard repertory. But it also reveals a contemporary sensibility, with the inclusion of Jan Mikael Vainio's 2010 concerto ''Fujiko's Fairy Tale,'' which showcases beatboxing, a form of vocal percussion often associated with hip-hop performance. Ms. Kuan's imprint is likely to grow as her directorship -- she has signed a three-year contract, with a two-year option -- unfolds.
Mr. Cumming has taken programming risks, too, winning two awards for adventurousness from the League of American Orchestras. He has also won the players' respect. The concertmaster, Leonid Sigal, said the change in music directors -- which Mr. Cumming and Kristen M. Phillips, the orchestra's executive director, agreed was a joint decision -- was ''bittersweet.'' The principal horn, Barbara Hill, lauded Mr. Cumming's rapport with audiences.
But Mr. Sigal also said the change had added an air of excitement. And Ms. Hill, who will be the soloist in Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 4 at this week's concerts, said Ms. Kuan, in her trial performance last December, displayed impressive control and confidence -- traits that should serve the organization well, in and out of the concert hall, during uncertain times.
The Hartford Symphony Orchestra's Music Director-Designate Concerts, featuring works by Mozart, Adams and Mussorgsky/Ravel, runs March 17 to 20 at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts, 166 Capitol Avenue, Hartford. Tickets: $33.50 to $65.50; limited availability at other prices. Information: hartfordsymphony.org or (860) 244-2999.

HEADLINE: Are Statistics Practical? Count the Ways, Online

 BODY:
A HOST of Web sites and smartphone apps, designed in collaborative efforts, are aiming to turn an outpouring of government data into practical information.
A good place to start learning about this growing domain is the government Web site whitehouse.gov/open. And some of the more interesting applications are highlighted at data.gov/developers/showcase. Universities have also been getting into the act. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., for example, has organized a cluster of apps that can be seen at data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Demos. 
Various innovations can serve very specific purposes:
Want to know who is visiting whom at the White House? Try the White House Visitor Search.
Want to know if your flight is likely to arrive on time? Fly on Time can help.
Need to make sure that the car seat you got as a hand-me-down has not been the subject of a factory recall? Recalls.gov bills itself as ''a 'one-stop shop' for U.S. government recalls.''
Looking for a job, or wondering about the labor market where your sister lives? The Unemployment Marker can point the way. Many of these new uses are popping up in the health field. The Department of Health and Human Services has set up an Apps Expo that offers some of the more promising ones. For a great example of what can be done in this area, you can watch a video provided by a start-up, Palantir, that was selected to be featured at the expo. Another expo winner is Asthmapolis. Asthma patients are given an inhaler that is equipped with a GPS monitor that collects location data whenever they inhale. This information can be used to track the spots where people have asthma symptoms, and to identify people whose asthma is not under control.
Even something as boring as the Federal Register can be modernized with a little electronic wizardry. The register contains rules, proposed rules and public notices of federal agencies, as well as presidential documents. Reading it has been about as interesting as reading an old telephone book. But there is now a more readable Web edition, and, perhaps more important, the information is now being released in a machine-readable form called XML that lets users format the data any way they want.

HEADLINE: Options for the 'Underwater'

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
STRUGGLING homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth have had few options to restructure their loans, but that may soon be changing for a few of them.
Six months after the Federal Housing Administration announced an $11 billion refinancing initiative for these ''underwater'' borrowers, nearly two dozen lenders have agreed to take part in a new loan modification program.
Two exceptions are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government buyers of loans, which will not allow loans that they still own to qualify for the program. 
The F.H.A. program -- called Short Refi -- requires major concessions from lenders, which must agree to write off at least 10 percent of the principal balance, and from investors, who, if they own the mortgage, must also agree to the deal.
To qualify, homeowners must be current on their monthly mortgage payments and not already have an F.H.A. loan. The size of the new primary loan cannot be more than 97.75 percent of the current value of the property; refinanced loans for homeowners whose properties carry second liens cannot exceed 15 percent of the property value.
In late February, Wells Fargo and Ally Financial, formerly known as G.M.A.C., said that they had created test programs for the F.H.A. option. ''We currently are conducting a small-scale pilot of the F.H.A. Short Refi program for loans in our owned portfolio,'' said Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, in a statement, ''to help us better understand which customers may benefit and qualify.''
Bank of America, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase are not participating in the program, according to spokesmen for them. ''Without the participation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' said Terry H. Francisco of Bank of America, ''we don't believe the program can help a significant number of our borrowers.''
But Mark C. Rodgers, a spokesman for Citibank, said that his bank was ''participating in a third-party pilot program along the same lines as the F.H.A. Short Refi program.'' He declined to provide details.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the F.H.A., said this month that 23 lenders had signed on to the Short Refi program, though it will disclose only the names of the five lenders that have already restructured a total of 44 loans. They are: Wall Street Mortgage Bankers of Lake Success, N.Y.; 1st Alliance Lending of East Hartford, Conn.; Nationstar Mortgage of Lewisville, Tex.; E Mortgage Management of Haddon Township, N.J.; and Glacier Bank of Kalispell, Mont.
HUD estimated that 500,000 to 1.5 million borrowers could be eligible for the program.
Even so, it faces challenges in Congress; on Thursday, the House of Representatives voted to end it.
One mortgage expert, John Diiorio, the owner of 1st Alliance Lending, said that big banks were taking part behind the scenes, by referring homeowners to third-party lenders that could restructure their mortgages. He added that 1st Alliance had ''several hundred F.H.A. Short Refi'' loans in the pipeline.
Because the F.H.A. announced the program only last September, and because such loans take three to four months from start to finish, Mr. Diiorio said, the number of refinanced loans should increase in coming months. He said that, on average, 1st Alliance had negotiated a principal reduction of $86,000 on a $256,000 loan, a 33.5 percent cut, to $170,000.
But he said lenders and investors had agreed to reduce principal for only half of the loans he had worked on.
The refinanced borrower, Mr. Diiorio said, had to pay a slightly higher fixed rate, typically 6 or so percent. But he added that the financial impact was the same as a 5 percent rate on a higher-balance loan of $100,000, with less principal forgiven. ''It seems counterintuitive,'' he said, ''but the economics work both for the consumer and for the lender.''

HEADLINE: You Cooked What? I'll Trade You Granola!

BYLINE: By DEBBIE KOENIG

 BODY:
THE kombucha guy was doing it wrong, and so was I.
By the time Rich Awn, the owner of the one-man tea-and-coffee brewery Mombucha, arrived at the food swap in a TriBeCa apartment building, the table brimmed with inventive homemade goods, including vodka infused with the needles from an organic Christmas tree. Next to each offering was a green placard where swappers could ''bid'' -- I had already scribbled my name and my offer (chocolate-chip cookies, Samoa bars and granola) on cards for Meyer lemon curd and a few other enticing treats.
Mr. Awn's problem was that he saw the event as a promotional opportunity, and quickly began pouring samples of his surprisingly tasty (to someone like me, anyway, who had always avoided kombucha) fermented brews. Mine was that I had gone simple and homey in a crowd that favors innovative and esoteric: who would want cookies, even ones as perfectly crispy and chewy as my own, when they could trade for fresh vegan garlic chickpea pasta or finishing salts infused with rosemary, sage and matcha? 
Food swapping is nothing new -- ancient Babylonian homemakers probably traded olive oil for beans. In modern times, bartering has mostly been associated with poverty; think of the country doctor paid with eggs. But in certain precincts of Brooklyn, where artisanal food buffs have become as ubiquitous as artisanal beards, the lingering recession has combined with a do-it-yourself fervor to fuel any number of edible swaps.
This one is known as BK Swappers, and it began last March, when Kate Payne, a writer and canner who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, e-mailed Megan Paska, the founder of Brooklyn Honey, offering jars of her triple-citrus marmalade for some of Ms. Paska's honey. ''We came to the conclusion that it would be really fun to get all of our food-centric friends together and do a swap on a larger scale,'' Ms. Paska recalled. ''When you make a batch of pickles, jam or the like, you often end up with excess that you'd feel comfortable letting go of for the sake of keeping your pantry interesting. For a few of those excess jars, you end up getting fresh, handcrafted foods for virtually no cost.''
Twenty-three cooks attended that first event, in Ms. Payne's apartment. They swapped provisions like homemade sauerkraut, portions of not-canned soup and sourdough bread starter. They have swapped every other month since at different locations, attracting up to 40 participants through Twitter and Facebook -- and a lengthy waiting list: I signed up the day that the February swap was announced, and an hour later it was fully booked. Groups inspired by BK Swappers now meet in at least a half-dozen other cities, including Austin, Tex. (where Ms. Payne now lives); Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; and Minneapolis; there is also a swap scheduled in London this spring.
February's was the first BK Swappers event in Manhattan: April Somboun, a marketing manager and avid home cook, hosted the event in a party room on the 19th floor of her boyfriend's Lower Manhattan apartment building. Most participants are amateur cooks, and most are women; veterans bring extra portions to share in a kind of potluck.
Lisa Guido, a new media producer in her 40s who lives in Park Slope and whose citrusy Buddha's hand-infused vodka was highly sought-after, said she started swapping after she learned to cure guanciale, or pig's jowl. ''I wanted to show it off,'' she said. Sam Kramer, 30, an illustrator from Greenpoint, came because her ''boyfriend's not a food person.''
''He won't eat pickles,'' she explained. ''Here, I can get things I don't have the chance to make.''
Jane Lerner, a writer who took over co-organizing duties after Ms. Payne moved away, brought Thai green curry paste. Like a proud mother, she shared iPhone pictures of the paste taken when it was still in her mortar and pestle, and described the steps involved in making it. She also shared the secret to being a successful swapper: ''It's uncool to repeat yourself.''
For the first 90 minutes, people milled about, smelling and tasting, bidding on their most-wanted items. When Ms. Lerner announced the start of trading, the group's adrenaline level surged, and I wondered what my humble treats would earn. Might I score a jar of Ms. Guido's candied tangelo peel? Ms. Kramer's shepherd's pie, still warm from the oven? Or perhaps a bottle of Mr. Awn's Crescent City Koffee, a beverage that tastes like sweet vinegary java, infinitely better than it sounds?
I was pretty sure the answers would be no, no and no. My chocolate-chip cookies and Samoa bars -- an homage to the Girl Scout cookie -- had attracted just one offer each, and the sign-up card for my chocolate cherry granola remained blank. It felt similar to the reaction I got when leaving my Williamsburg apartment in minimal makeup and comfortable shoes.
But a funny thing happened: Nobody paid attention to the placards. Instead, people marched up to whomever had made their first-choice item and offered to trade. Once I realized I did not have to wait for people to come to me, I grabbed my goodies and jumped in. Twenty minutes later, the Samoa bars had garnered jars of peanutella and hot fudge sauce, and a portion of that shepherd's pie. The chocolate-chip cookies earned me raspberry marshmallows, that Meyer lemon curd, and candied temple orange peel -- close enough to tangelo to make me happy. And my ignored, unwanted granola? For that, I wrangled a jar of four-fruit marmalade and (yes!) a liter of Crescent City Koffee. Swapping turned out to be invigorating, even inspirational.
Mr. Awn, for his part, scored big: In addition to my cookies and granola, he got another jar of granola, Ms. Guido's vodka, two kinds of marshmallows (Meyer lemon and peppermint), two kinds of herbal tea blends, three bags of flavored salts, and fresh eggs from a backyard chicken coop.
''This kombucha blend of mine has a really high currency value on the swap market,'' he marveled, fine with having collected a phalanx of fans rather than a fistful of dollars. ''The Tibetans say, 'He who makes money on kombucha will have money problems his whole life.' ''
The next BK Swappers gathering is scheduled for April. Clearly, I'm going to have to step up my game if I return -- and I plan to return. Wonder how quickly I can learn to make my own mustard. No, chutney. No, sriracha. ...

HEADLINE: 14 Easy Weekend Getaways

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS. 
MICHELLE HIGGINS writes the Practical Traveler column.

 BODY:
FORGOT to plan for a spring break? Haven't gone skiing yet this year? It's March, people!
Which means two things: You're overdue for a break, and it's not too late to plan one. Even if you just slip away for a weekend.
Want to be on the beach by midafternoon? There are new flights to Destin, Fla., and the Turks and Caicos that are ready to make that happen. Feeling the urge to hit the mountain before the snow melts? Heavy snowfall and spring rates as low as $99 a night are making resorts like Breckenridge, Colo., and Snowbird, Utah, good bargains. Or are poolside cocktails more your style? There are plenty of options in Palm Springs, Calif., where newly renovated hotels are showing off freshened digs.
So, here you go. Whether you want high desert landscapes, powdery slopes or pristine blue water, we've done all the heavy lifting for you. Here are 14 top-notch escapes that require fewer than four hours in either a car or a plane from more than a dozen major cities. Wherever you live, we've got you covered. 
Breckenridge, Colo.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Denver; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Tex.; Dallas; Houston; Chicago; St. Louis; Minneapolis; Oklahoma City.
WHAT YOU GET Sunny powder days, apres-ski party scene, live music, beer and food festivals.
WHY GO NOW March and April are two of the snowiest months of the year at this four-peak Rocky Mountain resort, roughly 80 miles from Denver. By the end of February this year, 29 feet had fallen already, beating out the resort's traditional 25-foot average. Breckenridge stays open until April 24 this year -- a week longer than usual -- and hosts dozens of special events from the annual Beer Festival (April 9), featuring live music and more than 20 breweries from around the country, to the Bite of Breck food fest with discounts on eateries during the month of April. Springtime also brings special promotions like 40 percent off many condominiums and $99 hotel rates.
WHERE TO STAY The Great Divide Lodge (www.breckresorts.com/greatdividelodge) has some of the best rates in April, with Spring Fever deals as low as $99 a night. (For all destinations, rates are for weekends in March and April.) The nearby Mountain Thunder Lodge offers rates from $171 a night. And ResortQuest's River Mountain Lodge three blocks from the gondola has studios from $140 a night.
Destin, Fla.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Dallas; Houston; Miami; Niagara Falls, N.Y.
WHAT YOU GET Emerald-green surf, Southern charm, family-friendly everything, dolphins frolicking offshore.
WHY NOW Even though its sugar-white beaches were largely unspoiled by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill last year, tourism came to a standstill at this laid-back resort town on Florida's upper northwest coast. While visitors are now on the upswing -- thanks in part to aggressive marketing efforts -- rates remain low with hotels offering discounts of as much as 20 percent, according to Mark Bellinger, chief executive of the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''There are a lot more package plans -- stay two nights, get the third night free,'' he said, and hotels are throwing in extras like golf or half a day of fishing to entice guests. Destin is also easier to get to thanks to Vision Airlines, a new low-fare carrier that will begin nonstop service March 25 to Northwest Florida Regional Airport from 13 markets including Little Rock, Ark., Louisville, Ky., and Asheville, N.C., with rates as low as $79 each way. It plans to add more routes by April 1.
WHERE TO STAY Jetty East Condominiums (jettyeast.net) is a beachfront condo-hotel with one-bedrooms from $137 a night on weekends in March and April. Sterling Shores condominiums (sterlingresorts.com) has a 4,300-square-foot lagoon-style pool, a 42-seat surround-sound theater and one-bedrooms from $169 a night. Looking for a more resort village feel? Eight miles east of Destin, the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort (www.sandestin.com), a 2,400-acre family resort, has two-bedroom villas from $139 a night if booked 21 days ahead.
Kiawah Island, S.C.
EASY GETAWAY FROM: Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Detroit; Miami; Nashville; New York; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.
WHAT YOU GET A golfer's paradise, bike trails, several miles of beaches.
WHY NOW Average daytime temperatures are in the high 60s and low 70s, ideal weather for golf, tennis, biking, birding or strolls on the beach -- which is what this quiet barrier island about 20 miles south of Charleston, S.C., is all about. While much of the tiny resort community belongs to the private Kiawah Island Golf Resort, 11 miles of beach is open to the public at Beachwalker Park. If you don't want to stay at the resort, there are plenty of rentals available ranging from golf course condos to beachfront homes. Southwest Airlines began flights to Charleston this month from Baltimore, Chicago, Nashville and Houston.
WHERE TO STAY: The sprawling Kiawah Island Golf Resort (kiawahresort.com) is offering rates as low as $160 a night for one-bedrooms this spring. ResortQuest (resortquestkiawah.com) offers 250 rentals on the island with rates from $419 a night for an oceanfront villa. Homeaway.com has 444 listings on Kiawah Island, from one-bedroom condos starting at $95 a night to three-bedroom beach cottages from $300 a night.
Montreal, Quebec
EASY GETAWAY FROM New York; Boston; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Chicago.
WHAT YOU GET French cuisine, an indie music scene, European flair.
WHY NOW Temperatures in this Quebec metropolis won't really warm up until May, but visiting at this time of year has its benefits. Hotel rates are as much as 50 percent off. Night life heats up as diversions turn indoors. There are also plenty of homey restaurants and cozy cafes. And if you really can't stand the weather, you can escape to the city's Underground pedestrian network: 20 miles of shops under the city streets. If you go, check out Tourisme Montreal's Sweet Dealpromotion, which runs through May 31 and offers 50 percent off a second night's stay, with nightly rates from $115 U.S.
Where to stay: Best Western Ville-Marie Hotel & Suites (hotelvillemarie.com), in the financial district, offers rooms with Wi-Fi from 109 Canadian dollars (about $114 U.S.) a night. The 24-room Le Petit Hotel (petithotelmontreal.com) in a former leather factory in the historic district, has rates from 159 dollars a night. The Le St.-Martin hotel (lestmartinmontreal.com), opened in June, has rooms from 195 dollars.
Negril, Jamaica
EASY GETAWAY FROM Atlanta; Baltimore; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; New York; Orlando; Miami.
WHAT YOU GET Easy snorkeling, live music, cliff diving and general laid-back island vibes.
WHY NOW Even though it is peak season, it's not hard to find an affordable hotel here, with choices ranging from all-inclusive mega-resorts to quiet boutique hotels perched on cliffs. Plenty of nonstop flights from the East Coast make this island easy to get to.
WHERE TO STAY The Rockhouse Hotel (rockhousehotel.com), perched atop a craggy outcropping with ladders and stairs leading down to the water, has standard rooms from $160 a night. The Samsara Hotel and Spa (negrilhotels.com), has an all-inclusive option from $90 a person based on two people sharing an air-conditioned ocean-view room. On Negril's Seven-Mile Beach, the all-inclusive Grand Pineapple Beach Negril (grandpineapple.com) offers rooms in colorful cottages from $284 a person a night; $75 a child 2 to 16.
Palm Springs, Calif.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Los Angeles; Denver; Salt Lake City; Seattle; San Francisco; Sacramento; Phoenix; Dallas; Portland, Ore.; Las Vegas.
WHAT YOU GET Midcentury modern glamour, a retro pool party scene, gay-friendly dance clubs, easy hiking.
WHY NOW Even after the economy took a nose dive, this desert town on the western edge of the Coachella Valley continued to freshen up its resort stock with more than $180 million in new construction and renovations that added 1,000 rooms over the past few years. While spring is a prime time to visit, with daytime temperatures in the mid-80s and special events that keep downtown hopping, like the annual Dinah Shore Weekend (March 30 to April 3, and billed as the largest lesbian event in the world), many hotels are still offering deals. Want to escape the party scene? Take the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway up to Mount San Jacinto State Park (at 8,516 feet), which offers more than 50 miles of hiking trails, some perhaps still holding snow.
WHERE TO STAY Tucked away on a residential street, the Kelly Wearstler-designed Viceroy Palm Springs (viceroypalmsprings.com) offers three pools, a spa and a nod to old Hollywood. Book the SoCal Sojourn for discounted rates starting at $210 a night, including two cocktails and a $50 credit for food or drinks. The Riviera Palm Springs (psriviera.com), with 406 guest rooms, two pools and gardens anchored by fire pits, just lowered its starting rates by $10 a night to $159. A short drive from downtown, the stylish Parker Palm Springs (theparkerpalmsprings.com), designed by Jonathan Adler, offers a Spa Junkies deal from $199 on Friday nights and $249 on Saturdays that includes a $200 credit on spa treatments.
Providenciales, Turks and Caicos
EASY GETAWAY FROM New York; Newark; Atlanta; Miami.
WHAT YOU GET Sparkling blue waters, laid-back luxury, sun-soaked beaches.
WHY NOW Just last month, JetBlue began flying to Providenciales nonstop each day from Kennedy Airport in New York, which means three and a half hours between the late-winter grunge of Queens and some of the Caribbean's best beaches. (JetBlue is also flying once a week from Boston.) Continental also has new nonstop flights from Newark, which means travelers from the New York area can be on the beach by early afternoon. Because it is technically in the Atlantic, just below the Bahamas, this island chain (and its 80-something-degree days) may be the closest thing to the Caribbean you can get to that fast.
WHERE TO STAY La Vista Azul Resort (lvaresort.com), which opened last summer with 78 rooms with full kitchens, two rooftop swimming pools and Jacuzzis, is a short walk from the beach. Rates begin at $192.50 a night. The chic 91-room Gansevoort Turks + Caicos (gansevoorttc.com), on Grace Bay Beach, has a 7,000-square-foot infinity pool and rates from $440 a night with the three-night Big Blue package, including airport transfers, a breakfast buffet and scuba diving. For a splurge, each room at the all-suite Grace Bay Club (gracebayresorts.com), has ocean views from $980 a night.
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico
EASY GETAWAY FROM Los Angeles; San Diego; Phoenix; Denver; Houston.
WHAT YOU GET Miles of golden sand, sunsets on the Malecon, open-air dance clubs, whale watching.
WHY NOW Drug-related violence, concentrated mainly in the northern border region of Mexico, has cast a pall over the entire country and scared tourists away from popular Pacific coast resorts like Puerto Vallarta, which have remained safe for visitors. As a result, deals abound. ''We have special offers available even in our most luxurious accommodations,'' said Antonia Lavendar, director of commercialization for the Puerto Vallarta Convention and Visitors Bureau. If lounging poolside at an upscale hotel on the cheap, margarita in hand, isn't enough, there are galleries and boutiques along the Malecon promenade, cobblestone streets to explore in the colonial Old Town zone, zip-line canopy tours in the nearby Sierra Madre Mountains, and whale-watching trips just offshore.
WHERE TO STAY The 14-acre Westin Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa is offering rates as low as $129 a night -- a 20 percent discount. The Presidente InterContinental Resort dropped starting rates for its newly decorated oceanfront suites to $148 a night in March from $198 last year; in April, rates begin at $180. Villa del Palmar (villagroupresorts.com) offers 562 suites with balconies or terraces for as low as $85 a night with all-inclusive rates that begin at $211 per person per night for meals and many water sports.
San Antonio, Tex.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Atlanta;Charlotte; Chicago; Denver; Los Angeles; Memphis; Milwaukee; Nashville; Orlando, Fla.; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; San Diego; Tampa, Fla.
WHAT YOU GET Spanish missions, Chicano art, Tex-Mex fare and Texas hospitality.
WHY NOW To commemorate the 175th anniversary of the Battle of the Alamo, the city is inaugurating a yearlong series of events and special promotions this month including hotel packages that offer discounts of up to 20 percent off room rates and extras like free breakfast or riverboat tickets. Mild spring temperatures are perfect for strolling along downtown's meandering River Walk, lined with restaurants and bars, or visiting the San Antonio Mission National Historic Park, featuring four well-preserved missions and hiking and biking trails. If that's not off the grid enough, head to nearby Hill Country for great barbecue and rolling landscapes budding with wildflowers.
WHERE TO STAY The Drury Plaza Hotel (druryhotels.com), right on the River Walk, offers flat-screen televisions, popcorn in the lobby and a rooftop pool with rates from $119 a night with the Remember the Alamo package. Near the Riverwalk and the Alamo, the Best Western Sunset Suites (bestwesternsunsetsuites.com) has rates from about $118 a night. Looking for luxury? The sprawling JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa (jwsanantonio.com), about 30 minutes from downtown, with six acres of heated pools, fountains and waterfalls, has rooms from $269 a night.
San Diego
EASY GETAWAY FROM Phoenix; Las Vegas; San Francisco; Los Angeles; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Dallas; Denver; Salt Lake City; Tucson; Sacramento.
WHAT YOU GET Salty ocean breezes, lush public parks, downtown waterfront, family fun.
WHY NOW With business from conventions still off, California's second-largest city is looking to fill its varied hotels, restaurants and spas with leisure travelers, and many are offering hefty incentives, according to Adam Weissenberg, who heads Deloitte's United States Tourism, Hospitality and Leisure division. With miles of beaches, plenty of golf and family-oriented attractions, including the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld and Legoland, ''it's a great location and you can find good deals now,'' he said. Stroll along the Embarcadero, a 1.7-mile stretch of downtown waterfront. Explore the city's historic Gaslamp Quarter -- 16 and a half blocks of restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, shops and art galleries. Or head to Balboa Park (balboapark.org), the 1,200-acre public park that is home to the Old Globe Theater, the zoo and 15 major museums.
WHERE TO STAY The Pearl Hotel (thepearlsd.com), in the seaside Point Loma section, is offering a two-night stay for as low as $249 total when travelers book the Two Night Delight, which includes a $100 gift certificate for its restaurant. The beachfront Catamaran Resort Hotel (catamaranresort.com) is offering a second night at 50 percent off this spring with rates from $149 a night. For families, the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina (starwoodhotels.com) has a Break With the Family deal from $199 a night, including a balcony room, four zoo passes, bicycle rentals and an in-room movie each night.
Santa Fe, N.M.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Los Angeles; Dallas; Denver; Houston; Kansas City, Mo.; Portland, Ore.; Salt Lake City; Seattle; St. Louis; Las Vegas; Phoenix; San Diego; Tucson.
WHAT YOU GET Romantic fireside nooks, art galleries, beautiful landscapes, rejuvenating spas, steamy hot springs.
WHY NOW March is off-season in this high desert city about an hour north of Albuquerque's airport, which means lower hotel rates and no crowds at the city's many Native American museums, restaurants, spas and some 250 galleries. With average high temperatures of 55 degrees and lows of 28, March is still a great time for spring skiing in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains just 16 miles from the heart of the city, sipping hot chocolate by a kiva fireplace or getting in touch with your inner artist through a class in painting, pottery or photography. As the thermometer rises in April, the streets become more lively, the farmers' market moves outdoors, there are concerts, plays and dance performances and Friday-night gallery openings pick up. Take in the city's adobe-style architecture on a historical walking tour, visit an American Indian pueblo north of Santa Fe or soak in one of the surrounding area's mineral hot springs.
WHERE TO STAY Inn on the Alameda (innonthealameda.com), located between the Santa Fe Plaza and Canyon Road art galleries, has 71 rooms from $170 a night and offers a three-night Taste the City Different package starting at $792 for two guests, which includes cooking classes, demonstrations and a culinary walking tour for specific dates through April 30.

Book the Savor Santa Fe package and get a $40 breakfast voucher and a $50 credit for a massage or facial.
Snowbird, Utah
EASY GETAWAY FROM Las Vegas; Denver; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Ore.; Salt Lake City; Seattle.
WHAT YOU GET Fresh powder, live music, no crowds.
WHY NOW An annual snowfall average of 500 inches ensures a long season, keeping the entire mountain open well into spring. March is typically tied with February for the snowiest month, but April still gets plenty, and rates drop significantly. In April, for example, Snowbird is offering a Spring Stay and Ski package from $99 a person a night with a three-night stay. A scenic 45-minute drive from Salt Lake City International Airport makes same-day skiing and flying a reality from many major cities, and live music every weekend from end of March through April keeps skiers grooving.
WHERE TO STAY The Cliff Lodge (snowbird.com), with rates from $129 in April, has a newly renovated spa with a rooftop pool and hot tub and is Snowbird's only ski-in, ski-out property. The Lodge at Snowbird has efficiencies from $119. A North Studio in the Inn at Snowbird offers rooms with kitchens and fireplaces as low as $99 a night in April.
Stowe, Vt.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Boston; Albany; New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit.
WHAT YOU GET Winter sports, farm-to-table dining, New England charm.
WHY GO NOW Softer snow and warmer temperatures at this time of year make skiing, snowshoeing, dog-sledding, sleigh riding and other winter sports more fun. Stowe's Spruce Peak and Mount Mansfield (Vermont's highest peak at 4,395 feet) remain open through April 17. And with a 200-year-old village full of shops, restaurants and cozy pubs, there is still plenty to do after the slopes close. Spring is sugaring season in Vermont, when trees are tapped and sap is collected for making syrup. There is also a new performing arts center and nearby Vermont landmarks like Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream plant, providing options for everyone in the family. The nearest major airport is in Burlington, Vt., about an hour west of Stowe.
WHERE TO STAY Stowe Mountain Lodge (stowemountainlodge.com), adjacent to the gondola connecting Spruce Peak to Mount Mansfield, has rates from $199 and is offering 20 percent off for two-night stays and 30 percent off for three nights through April 30. The Trapp Family Lodge (trappfamily.com), run by descendants of the Trapp family of ''Sound of Music'' fame, has a Making Tracks Snowshoe package with rates from $399 a person for two-night stays through March 27 that includes three-course dinners, and guided snowshoe treks. On Main Street, the Green Mountain Inn (greenmountaininn.com) offers rooms for as low as $99 in April.
Tucson, Ariz.
EASY GETAWAY FROM Albuquerque; San Diego; Las Vegas; Los Angeles; Seattle; Chicago; Dallas; Houston; Salt Lake City; Denver.
WHAT YOU GET Sunny days, starry desert nights, P.G.A. golf courses, pampering spas.
WHY NOW The Sonoran Desert usually begins to bloom in late April, a bonus when hiking in Sabino Canyon, mountain biking on the Arizona Trail or saddling up at a dude ranch. It is high season, but there are ways to skirt even the steepest rates. Not willing to shell out $3,000 for three nights at Canyon Ranch? Pay $300 for a Spa Day that includes one $130 treatment, lunch and all classes. Or check out the Tubac Golf Resort and Spa, which is offering an Indulge Yourself deal from $260 a night that includes accommodations, a $120 spa credit and a $10 spa gift card.
WHERE TO STAY The 398-room Loews Ventana Canyon (loewshotels.com), with two P.G.A. golf courses and a 7,000-square-foot spa is offering 20 percent off starting rates of $249 a night if you stay three nights and book the Loews Long Weekend deal. The Westin La Paloma (westinlapalomaresort.com), set on 250 acres with a Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course and five pools, has rates from $249 in April. The Embassy Suites Tucson Paloma Village (embassysuites.com) offers a family fun package with an in-room movie and four tickets to Sabino Canyon from $170 to $270.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 27, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover story on March 13 about 14 weekend getaways from major American cities misstated the price for two nights at the Catamaran Resort Hotel in San Diego.

HEADLINE: Where Home Is One Big Art Gallery

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
Patchogue
SINCE he graduated from Binghamton University last year, Jay Varney, an artist, has been itching for the new Artspace Patchogue Lofts on Terry Street here to be completed.
While most of his friends relocated out of state, Mr. Varney, 23, moved in with his parents in East Patchogue and considered Manhattan and Philadelphia. But it didn't take much to persuade him in favor of the eye-catching contemporary five-story building in Patchogue geared to providing artists a place to live and work.
''Pretty much this is the reason I stayed,'' said Mr. Varney, who, since moving into the building late last month with his girlfriend, Megan Whelan, 22, a banker, has turned the $1,138-a-month one-bedroom apartment into a gallery of sorts. A darkly hued 4-by-8-foot oil painting titled ''Castle Conway'' hangs on one wall, a 3-by-5-foot seascape titled ''When My Ship Comes In'' on another; in total the apartment showcases eight of his paintings. 
''There will be so many opportunities that come out of this,'' Mr. Varney said, citing the other artists he would meet, as well as the multiple opportunities to display his work in the voluminous communal gallery space and the retail gallery in the building.
The couple -- chosen, like the other tenants, through a lottery in October -- were among the first to move into Artspace, an $18 million project that has resulted in 45 affordably priced studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom industrial loftlike units. Features include nine-foot ceilings with exposed ductwork and pipes, floor-to-ceiling windows, gallery track lighting and concrete floors. The building is the 24th to be completed by Artspace, the national nonprofit real estate developer for the arts, and the first affordable work/live development on the Island built for artists. The company has a dozen more such projects in the works, in Scranton, Pa.; Elgin, Ill.; and Washington, among other sites.
Shawn McLearen, the Artspace project manager, says this kind of development differs from ''traditional affordable housing'' because it serves ''multiple agendas at the same time,'' including economic development and arts and culture.
The building was designed with a huge lobby; each floor has a large communal area and eight-foot-wide hallways, for ''tenants to use as exhibition space,'' Mr. McLearen said. ''We want to facilitate their work.''
Rental prices range from $817 to $1,470, depending on the unit size and tenant's income; utilities are covered, except for electricity. So far, 14 apartments have been leased and another three tenants approved, Mr. McLearen said. Applications are accepted online at www.artspace.org/properties/patchogue.
Besides qualifying financially, prospective tenants are interviewed by an ''artist selection committee.'' They present a portfolio and are quizzed on their willingness to live in a ''cooperative environment.''
When there is a gallery opening, for instance, tenants can take part by opening their doors. ''It's a huge art crawl where people are walking around,'' Mr. McLearen said. The idea is ''to make sure this isn't just a place where people come and go, but want to stay.''
The project took root several years ago, when Mayor Paul V. Pontieri Jr., looking for a way to give Patchogue a new identity, contacted Artspace. His idea was to bolster the 1999 rebirth of the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts, which started out in 1921 as a vaudeville house.
''We have a $7 million theater,'' Mr. Pontieri said he had reasoned. ''We have to tie it to something else.'' The site for Artspace, donated by the village, was a block from the theater: two underutilized municipal parking lots and a blighted house. The plan will also involve recreating the alleyway between the two as a ''fine arts alleyway.''
Another of the loft's new tenants is Cheryl Frey, 33, a visual artist, who with her husband and two children is paying $1,565 a month for a three-bedroom duplex with an oak staircase and a soaring living-room ceiling.
Ms. Frey teaches mosaic-making classes in libraries and after-school programs. She said she ''liked the idea of being in an area where they encourage creativity, where it's O.K. to get paint on the wall.'' Unable to afford a separate studio, she is eagerly splitting the downstairs into eating, living and studio areas. ''I can put a large canvas down,'' she said. ''I like to work big.''
Dana Flaherty, 34, a social worker and photographer, recently moved with her 6-year-old daughter into a two-bedroom unit. Ms. Flaherty says she, too, hopes to work and network with neighboring artists. With its new galleries, a wine bar, a brewery and restaurants nearby, she said, Patchogue is being transformed. Looking out her window, she added, ''I feel like I'm in Brooklyn or Manhattan.''
Mr. Varney, for his part, is raring to get started. ''Whatever they are willing to let me do,'' he said, ''I want to show as much of my work as I can.''
One opportunity will be at the C2 Fine Art Gallery, where he showed two paintings last year, and which is relocating from Main Street to one of Artspace's two street-level retail sites. Charlie Baker, the owner and treasurer of the Patchogue Arts Council, said he planned to ''give priority'' to resident artists next year. The gallery's first show at Artspace is scheduled for April 1.
''Some of it is fine art and some music or poetry,'' he said, explaining that those disciplines would be incorporated at gallery openings. ''We want to work synergistically.''

HEADLINE: This Data Isn't Dull. It Improves Lives.

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
GOVERNMENTS have learned a cheap new way to improve people's lives. Here is the basic recipe:
Take data that you and I have already paid a government agency to collect, and post it online in a way that computer programmers can easily use. Then wait a few months. Voila! The private sector gets busy, creating Web sites and smartphone apps that reformat the information in ways that are helpful to consumers, workers and companies.
Not surprisingly, San Francisco, with its proximity to Silicon Valley, has been a pioneer in these efforts. For some years, Bay Area transit systems had been tracking the locations of their trains and buses via onboard GPS. Then someone got the bright idea to post that information in real time. Thus the delightful app Routesy was born. Install it on a smartphone and the app can tell you that your bus is stuck in traffic and will be 10 minutes late -- or it can help you realize that you are standing on the wrong street, dummy. It gives consumers a great new way to find out when and where the bus is coming, and all at minimal government expense. 
Another example involves weather data produced by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The forecasts you find on the Weather Channel, or on the evening news or online, use the agency's information. Again, the government produces and releases raw data, and the private sector transforms it into something useful for the public.
Several other departments in the Obama administration are looking to expand the use of such techniques. On data.gov, you will find huge amounts of downloadable data that had heretofore been inaccessible. As a sign of the importance that President Obama has attached to this approach, he put it on the government's agenda on Jan. 21, 2009, his second day in office. (Disclosure: My book, ''Nudge,'' published in 2008, advocated this broad idea; Cass R. Sunstein, co-author of the book, is now administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.)
Now the administration is pushing to use this concept as a tool for regulation, and as a method of avoiding more heavy-handed rule making. The idea is that making things more transparent can immediately turn consumers into better shoppers and make markets work better. One might think that such an initiative would receive nearly universal support -- after all, who could be against openness and transparency? But it turns out that some people are.
Two cases are under discussion right now.
First, the Department of Transportation is considering a new rule requiring airlines to make all of their prices public and immediately available online. The postings would include both ticket prices and the fees for ''extras'' like baggage, movies, food and beverages. The data would then be accessible to travel Web sites, and thus to all shoppers.
The airlines would retain the right to decide how and where to sell their products and services. But many of them are insisting that they should be able to decide where and how to display these extra fees. The issue is likely to grow in importance as airlines expand their lists of possible extras, from seats with more legroom to business-class meals served in coach.
Electronic disclosure of all fees can make it much easier for consumers to figure out what a trip really costs, and thus make markets more efficient, without requiring new rules and regulations. (As someone who once bought two tickets on a discount airline from London to Dublin for the advertised price of $:1 each, then ended up paying hundreds of dollars for the privilege of bringing along two heavy suitcases, I acknowledge having a sore spot on this issue.)
Another initiative has been proposed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In 2008, Congress overwhelmingly passed and President George W. Bush signed legislation mandating an online database of reported safety issues in products, at saferproducts.gov. The Web site ran for a few months in a ''soft launch'' and went into full operation on Friday.
But a majority in the House of Representatives passed an amendment last month that might have stopped this initiative in its tracks. The amendment, sponsored by Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, would have prohibited the agency from spending any further money to start the site. One goal, of course, was to cut the budget, although proponents of the amendment also argue that the Web site might include information that is erroneous and damaging to the businesses that sell children's products.
Yet several provisions in the final rules protect manufacturers from false or malicious statements. Consumers have to include identifying information and sign an affidavit testifying to the truth of their complaints. Furthermore, manufacturers will be able to see complaints before they are posted, and can then correct mistakes or add comments.
ALTHOUGH this amendment was passed in the name of deficit reduction, the requested money for the site is a puny $3 million a year. If we want to reduce the cost of government regulation, this is exactly the kind of effort we should be applauding and expanding.
Compared with the tiny costs, the benefits of this program could be enormous. Thirteen years ago, two of my dear friends experienced the nightmare that parents dread most. They were called at work by their child-care provider and told that their 18-month-old son had died in a crib accident. Imagine their anguish when they later learned that other children had died in this model of crib, and that still others had died in cribs with similar design. Yet there was no easy way for any parent or child-care provider to know that.
In a recent three-year span, some 265 children under the age of 5 died in accidents related to nursery products, the government has reported. If this program could reduce that number even slightly, the cost would seem amply justified.
Moving the government into the 21st century should be applauded. In a future column, I will explain how the release of some kinds of data can even help consumers better understand themselves.

HEADLINE: Gates Tells Bahrain's King That 'Baby Steps' to Reform Aren't Enough

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
MANAMA, Bahrain -- In the wake of a violent clash between protesters and Bahrain's security forces and pro-government vigilantes, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates warned this tiny kingdom's ruling family on Saturday that ''baby steps'' toward reform would not be enough to meet the political and economic grievances sweeping the region.
Mr. Gates also cautioned Bahrain's king and crown prince during two hours of meetings in Manama, Bahrain's capital, that if the reform process was prolonged, the United States feared that Iran would become involved and create more chaos. 
''I expressed the view that we had no evidence that suggested that Iran started any of these popular revolutions or demonstrations across the region,'' Mr. Gates told reporters afterward on his plane. ''But there is clear evidence that as the process is protracted, particularly in Bahrain, that the Iranians are looking for ways to exploit it and create problems.'' He added, ''Time is not our friend.''
Mr. Gates did not offer any details of the evidence he cited.
Despite his warnings, Mr. Gates said he was convinced that the king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, and the crown prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, were serious about reform and starting a dialogue with protesters demanding more democracy. The immediate problem, Mr. Gates said, was that the main opposition party in Parliament had not agreed to conditions for the talks -- an obstacle that the crown prince appeared to address in comments to reporters traveling with Mr. Gates.
''There are people far, far more conservative than I,'' the crown prince told reporters at the Sakhir Palace in Manama. ''I by no means am on the right of the political spectrum, and they need to sit down and talk. I'm hopeful that they will join the dialogue without preconditions.''
The crown prince also said that ''at the end of the day we all are going to have to live in the same country together and talk to one another.''
Mr. Gates, the highest-ranking member of the Obama administration to visit Bahrain since the protests started last month, was in the kingdom to reassure the rulers of Washington's support, but also to prod them toward change. To the consternation of the largely Shiite protesters, Washington has continued to back the government of the royal family, whose members are Sunni.
Administration officials say that the king listened when President Obama asked him to pull back his security forces at the start of the protests, when seven demonstrators were killed, and has earned the administration's support to try to undertake reform on his own.
On Friday night, as Mr. Gates arrived, security forces firing what protesters said were rubber bullets and pro-government Sunni vigilantes wielding sticks and swords beat back a group of several hundred protesters near the royal palace in Riffa, a residential neighborhood for the ruling family and the Sunni Muslim elite. The protesters said they had been met with stones and clouds of tear gas. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that it had fired eight tear gas canisters, and the Ministry of Health said 32 people were treated for injuries, mostly bruises or tear gas inhalation.
Mr. Gates was not near any of the protests on Friday, and the area was largely deserted by the time he passed by in his motorcade on the way to the palace on Saturday.
The main protest area in Bahrain, Pearl Square, a traffic roundabout, was also peaceful on Saturday morning. Young men and families relaxed in the tent city that has sprung up at the roundabout, where graphic pictures of the seven killed demonstrators are prominently displayed.
Mr. Gates said he told the king and crown prince that with pro-democracy protests sweeping the region -- in Bahrain alone, as many as 100,000 demonstrators have massed in the streets -- there could not be a return to the status quo. Mr. Gates said he told them that change ''could be led or it could be imposed.'' He added, ''Obviously, leading reform and being responsive is the way we'd like to see this move forward.''
Mr. Gates was in Bahrain, the home of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, at the end of a weeklong trip to Afghanistan, Germany and Belgium. At NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, he remained strongly resistant to imposing a no-flight zone over Libya, and NATO all but rejected the idea.
But Mr. Gates, who has said that imposing a no-flight zone would be complicated and would require air strikes on Libya's air defense system, appeared to soften his position in his remarks on his plane on Saturday.
''If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone, we have the resources to do it,'' Mr. Gates said. ''This is not a question of whether we or our allies can do this. We can do it. The question is whether it's a wise thing to do.''

HEADLINE: Court in Minnesota Has Been a Home Field for a League's Labor Disputes

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
For N.F.L. players, federal court in Minneapolis is a legal nirvana.
Over nearly 40 years, cases filed there by players and their union have found favor in legal rulings by United States district court judges like Earl Larson and, since the late 1980s, David S. Doty. Names like John Mackey, Freeman McNeil, Marvin Powell and Reggie White have been featured plaintiffs.
And on Friday, when the N.F.L. Players Association decertified itself as a union, the Minneapolis court once again became the legal theater for football, this time in a particularly tense impasse. Ten players, including the star quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Drew Brees, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L. in the court and asked for an injunction to prevent the league from initiating a lockout, which the N.F.L. said was in effect as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
''The N.F.L. has a long history of violating federal antitrust law in an effort to minimize its labor costs,'' the players' lawsuit alleges about a subject that has become as familiar to the South Fourth Street Courthouse in downtown Minneapolis as First Amendment cases are to the Supreme Court in Washington. 
But how did this Midwest court become the focal point for so many N.F.L. legal battles and, in effect, the home field for the players? The answer is apparently in a request that Mackey, the Baltimore Colts' Hall of Fame tight end, made decades ago when he became the president of the players union in time for contract talks with the league.
''Two members of his negotiating committee, Pat Richter of the Washington Redskins and Ken Bowman of the Green Bay Packers, were in law school at the University of Wisconsin,'' Ed Garvey, a former executive director of the union, said in a telephone interview. ''So Mackey said, 'Ask your law professor who we should hire as labor counsel.' ''
They consulted Nathan Feinsinger, a professor and noted arbitrator, who suggested speaking to Leonard Lindquist, a founding partner at the Minneapolis firm Lindquist & Vennum, Garvey said.
Eventually, one of the firm's partners, Edward Glennon, became the union's chief litigator. And it was Glennon, Garvey said, who ultimately hit on a novel legal strategy in dealing with the league and its owners.
''He said we didn't have the strength to take them on in bargaining, but we had a solid case against them in antitrust,'' Garvey said. Glennon then filed what became the Mackey case.
In that case, fought in Minneapolis in the mid-1970s, Glennon successfully argued that the so-called Rozelle Rule violated antitrust laws.
The rule, named for Pete Rozelle, the league's commissioner at the time, required that a team that signed a player who was a free agent had to compensate his former team with players or draft picks or both. If the teams were unable to agree on the exchange, Rozelle would decide through arbitration what the compensation should be.
Larson wrote in his decision in the Mackey case that some players had been economically damaged by the Rozelle Rule. Eliminating it, he said, ''will not spell the end of the National Football League.''
''Judge Larson not only said that the Rozelle Rule violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, but that it was an illegal subject of bargaining,'' Garvey said.
But if Larson set the tone for the sport's labor disputes, it was Doty who became the league's bete noire.
Since soon after his appointment to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Doty has regularly ruled against the league. In 1988, he found against the league, in the Marvin Powell case, but was reversed on appeal. He then presided over the jury trial in 1992 that found that the league's Plan B system of limited free agency was a violation of antitrust laws; Doty said he would impose his own version of free agency if the league and union did not negotiate their own, which they did in early 1993.
From then until Friday, Doty oversaw what became known as the Reggie White settlement and the N.F.L. labor agreements that followed. Much of that oversight dealt with appeals of decisions made by a special master. He has upheld some of the special master's rulings in favor of the league. But this month, he reversed one, saying that the league acted against players' interests in failing to maximize revenue from networks when it renegotiated its current television deals. He could thus prevent the league from using $4 billion in television revenue during the lockout.
But whether Doty would be the judge to hear Brady v. the National Football League is not clear. For now, another judge at the courthouse is assigned to it.
Doty, 81, is as much a Minnesotan as Joe Mauer, the All-Star catcher of the Twins. He was born in Anoka and attended Marshall High School in Minneapolis, and then the University of Minnesota and its law school. He played football for the Gophers -- as a linebacker and fullback -- but the toll on his body was too much after a few weeks of practice. ''I was fast for my size, but I wasn't very good,'' he told The Washington Post in 1992.
He was a captain in the Marines, and keeps a Mameluke sword hanging in his office.
In a quarter-century in private practice, he worked for corporations, including utilities, and as part of his legal work, took on unions. His name was submitted to Reagan for the federal bench by Senator David Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican. In a 2007 article in The Federal Lawyer, a magazine, Doty was asked about giving up a well-paying private practice to sit on the bench. ''I wasn't as successful as people think,'' he said, jokingly.
In another interview, in Sports Business Journal three years ago, Doty looked back at the Powell case and said that team owners ''pretend they're getting beaten around.''
''Well, they did, initially, but they had a position that was not legally sound,'' he added. Referring to Paul Tagliabue, who was a lawyer for the league and went on to become its commissioner, he said, ''I think if you ask Tagliabue, he would say, 'The whole thing has come our way.' '' Although the owners have complained, Doty added, ''all they've done is make tons of money.''
And it is money, and how to divide it among players and owners, that is at the heart of the latest confrontation. Not surprisingly, the complaint filed by the players on Friday reads like a greatest-hits canon of football decisions by the Minneapolis court, with references to the Mackey, McNeil, Powell and White cases. If Doty does hear the new case, it would be much like a veteran player reopening a dog-eared playbook.
Of course, another judge might read it like a made-for-Minnesota legal thriller.

HEADLINE: Where to Stash All That Cash

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
As his country burns around him, the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has stashed away tens of billions of dollars in cash in United States dollars, Libyan dinars and possibly other currencies in banks and in Bab Al Azizia, his Tripoli compound, intelligence officials and a person with ties to the Libyan government disclosed last week.
A rainy day fund of such dimensions helps Colonel Qaddafi withstand economic sanctions and a freeze on Libyan government assets abroad. 
And, of course, if he flees, the hard cash is easier to carry than other assets like cars or houses.
In fact, history offers a long list of dictators, despots and kings stockpiling cash in times of trouble -- as well as instances of outright thievery.
The former Philippine first lady, Imelda R. Marcos, and her three children were charged with removing 22 crates of Philippine pesos from the country when they fled to Hawaii in 1986.
In Haiti, President Jean-Claude Duvalier and his wife, Michele, withdrew at least $33 million from the country's central bank, transferring it to foreign accounts, and may have stored some money and jewelry in a safe-deposit box at a Citibank branch on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, according to court papers filed by the Haitian government after he was forced from power in 1986.
The Panamanian dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was reported to have stashed $5.8 million in denominations of 10s, 20s, 50s and 100s in a file cabinet behind a desk at his home. United States authorities seized the money during the invasion of Panama in 1989.
In 1997, shortly before the forces of Laurent Kabila took power in Congo, formerly called Zaire, aides close to former President Mobutu Sese Seko smuggled crates of diamonds and more than $40 million in cash out of the country on a jet chartered by the South African government, according to The Sunday Independent, a South African newspaper.
Then, in 2003, in the hours before American bombs began falling on Baghdad, one of President Saddam Hussein's sons, Qusay Saddam Hussein, was said by officials to carry off nearly $1 billion in cash from the vaults of the country's Central Bank.
The volume of cash was so great -- some $900 million in American $100 bills and as much as $100 million worth of euros -- that a team of workers took two hours to load the money on three tractor-trailers.
Which raises the question: What does a mountain of cash worth tens of billions of dollars actually look like?
According to the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing, all dollar notes have the same dimensions: 2.61 inches by 6.14 inches by 0.0043 inches. Each note weighs approximately one gram.
That is true for all notes in circulation -- $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. (Notes worth more than this value -- 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 -- were taken out of official circulation in 1969, according to a bureau spokeswoman, Darlene Anderson, though some still circulate, and Colonel Qaddafi could possibly have some of those.)
Ten billion dollars in, say, 100-dollar notes, stacked one on top of the other would weigh about 110 tons and take up about 100 large storage pallets. According to Jack Weatherford, an anthropologist and the author of ''The History of Money,'' the difficulties of securely storing large stockpiles of money were evident from the beginning of civilization.
Some of the first metal coins, a mixture of silver and gold, were minted during the reign of Croesus, who ruled Lydia in modern Turkey from 560-546 B.C. But as Croesus's wealth piled up in his palace in the capital, Sardis, ''it attracted the interest of the Persians right next door and all the money was taken,'' said Professor Weatherford.
In the 20th century, Sultan Said bin Taimur of Oman, father of Oman's current leader, encountered yet another problem.
There was no developed banking system he trusted, when his country began to earn lucrative oil revenues. He piled up hard currency like British pounds in his palace in Muscat, but rats began to gnaw at it, Mr. Weatherford said.
Seeing the family legacy diminishing may have been a reason his son, the current sultan, precipitated a coup and toppled his father in 1970.
''That is a problem you have with paper money,'' Mr. Weatherford said. ''Insects, rats and other animals gnaw at it.''

HEADLINE: Cuba Gives 15-Year Prison Term to American Accused of Subverting Government

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Elizabeth A. Harris contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- An American contractor who United States officials said went to Cuba to deliver communication equipment to religious groups was sentenced Saturday to 15 years in prison by a Cuban court, the latest turn in a case that could trip up thawing relations between the countries.
The United States has portrayed the contractor, Alan P. Gross, 61, as a suburban Washington humanitarian who was merely bringing satellite telephone equipment, which could be used to bypass heavy Internet restrictions in Cuba, to the small community of Cuban Jews when he was detained in December 2009. 
But Cuban authorities said American officials, who eventually acknowledged that Mr. Gross lacked a proper visa and was working on a secretive United States Agency for International Development, or Usaid, program to expand Internet access, must have known such equipment was barred in Cuba without a permit.
They accused Mr. Gross of being a spy, tried him and convicted him of taking part in ''a subversive project of the U.S. government that aimed to destroy the revolution through the use of communications systems out of the control of authorities.''
The Obama administration has called Mr. Gross's case a sticking point in improving relations with Cuba.
''We deplore this ruling,'' said Philip J. Crowley, the State Department spokesman. ''Alan Gross is a dedicated international development worker who has devoted his life to helping people in more than 50 countries. He was in Cuba to help the Cuban people connect with the rest of the world.''
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, issued a statement Saturday saying the sentence ''adds another injustice to Alan Gross's ordeal. He has already spent too many days in detention and should not spend one more.''
Analysts had predicted the conviction and sentencing. But they say it is likely that Mr. Gross, who suffers from diabetes and has lost 90 pounds in detention and whose 26-year-old daughter has received cancer treatment, would be freed on humanitarian grounds.
Cuba, this thinking goes, wanted to make a statement about what it considered the intrusion on their sovereignty of the Usaid programs. The Associated Press reported that Cuban television last week broadcast the first part of a documentary on Usaid, accusing it of waging a cyberwar against the country.
Still, given that President Obama has relaxed some travel restrictions to the island and limits on sending money there while Mr. Gross was being detained, and that Cuba has released a number of dissidents, it was unclear whether the Gross case would have any long-term impact.
''The judicial process had to conclude to open the door for a political solution,'' said Philip Peters of the Lexington Institute, a nonpartisan policy group in Arlington, Va., who has been following the case.
Mr. Gross's case became a cause celebre among Jewish groups in the United States and for a range of religious leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who offered to mediate the dispute with President Raul Castro.
Mr. Gross's American lawyer, Peter J. Kahn, said in a statement Saturday that Mr. Gross would explore an appeal.
''Having already served a 15-month sentence in a Cuban prison, Alan and his family have paid an enormous personal price in the longstanding political feud between Cuba and the United States,'' Mr. Kahn said. ''We will continue to work with Alan's Cuban attorney in exploring any and all options available to him, including the possibility of an appeal.''
A statement from the Cuban judges on the Cuban News Agency Web site said that during the trial, Mr. Gross ''had recognized having been used and manipulated by the Usaid'' through its contractor, Development Alternatives Inc., of Bethesda, Md., for which Mr. Gross worked.
His relatives and friends have said he has traveled the world as an international development worker, and a company he formed in 2001, Joint Business Development Center, said it had increased Internet connections in several countries.
Mr. Gross had visited Cuba several times in the months before his arrest.
American officials have said Usaid programs in Cuba, a $20 million initiative, were being reworked to emphasize educational exchanges and small-business growth rather than efforts that could be perceived as directly weakening the government.

HEADLINE: A Changed Starbucks. A Changed C.E.O.

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
SEATTLE
RAISE your hand if you remember when Starbucks seemed cool.
Anyone?
Think back. To before the planet groaned with 17,000 Starbucks shops. Before the pumpkin spice lattes and the Ciao Amore CDs. Before the Strawberries & Creme Frappuccino ice cream, the Starbucks cream liqueur, the Pinkberry-inspired Sorbetto.
In short, to before Howard D. Schultz and his trenta-size ambition turned a few coffeehouses here into the vast corporate Empire of the Bean.
The world has often seemed three espressos behind Mr. Schultz -- which is why the low-key guy sitting in his office here doesn't quite seem like Howard Schultz. 
Did he just say ''but''? As in, ''We have won in many ways, but ...''? Was that a ''we'' instead of an ''I''? A note of humility?
Yes, this is Howard Schultz: the man who willed Starbucks onto so many street corners -- and then, for a moment, looked as if he might lose it all.
Not even Mr. Schultz could have predicted how Starbucks would change our culture when its first shop opened here, in Pike Place Market, on March 30, 1971. Like it or not, Starbucks became, for many of us, what we talk about when we talk about coffee. It changed how we drink it (on a sofa, with Wi-Fi, or on the subway), how we order it (''for here,grande, two-pump vanilla, skinny extra hot latte'') and what we are willing to pay for it ($4.30 for the aforementioned in Manhattan).
But during the depths of the recession, Starbucks nearly drowned in its caramel macchiato. After decades of breakneck expansion under Mr. Schultz, tight-fisted consumers abandoned it. The company's sales and share price sank so low that insiders worried Starbucks might become a takeover target.
So, after an eight-year hiatus, an alarmed Mr. Schultz returned as chief executive in January 2008. He shut 900 shops, mostly in the United States, drastically cut costs and put the company back on course.
Friends and colleagues say this hellish experience left Mr. Schultz a changed man. Starbucks, these people say, is no longer ''The Howard Schultz Show.'' The adjective that many use to characterize his new self is ''humble'' -- a word that few would have applied to him before.
''Everything Starbucks did in the past, more or less, had worked,'' Mr. Schultz said in an interview in January at the company's headquarters, with a view of Puget Sound south of downtown Seattle. ''Every store we opened was successful, every city, every country.''
He continued: ''Growth had a life of its own -- and that's O.K., when you're hitting the cover off the ball every time, but at some point, nothing lasts forever.''
One thing hasn't changed: the man dreams big. In that same interview, Mr. Schultz spoke of expanding into still more products and in markets like China. He is pushing, of all things, a brand of instant coffee. The words ''Starbucks Coffee'' were just removed from the company's green mermaid logo because he wants to waltz his brand up and down the grocery aisles. On Thursday, he announced that the company had struck a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters to distribute Starbucks coffee and teas for Keurig single-serving systems. Shares of Starbucks jumped nearly 10 percent on the news, reaching their highest level since 2006. The stock closed at $36.56 on Friday.
Mr. Schultz and his colleagues say Starbucks will keep its feet on the ground this time, but some outsiders have doubts. Detractors say Starbucks long ago ceded its role as a gourmet tastemaker to become a ''billions-and-billions served'' chain like McDonald's. Starbucks -- ''Charbucks,'' to those who complain that its heavily roasted coffee tastes burned -- will never rekindle the old romance, these people say.
''Has anybody said they came back because people love the coffee again?'' asks Bryant Simon, a history professor at Temple University and author of ''Everything but the Coffee: Learning About America From Starbucks.''
''They came back because they're remaking themselves as a brand that competes on value, largely -- a brand that's everywhere, easily accessible, predictable,'' Mr. Simon says.
HOWARD SCHULTZ, now 57, is a tall, sinewy man with a toothy grin and a silky sales pitch. He rarely sticks to script, preferring to speak off the cuff, whatever his audience. In conversations, he leans in, locks eyes and gives the impression that, right now, there is no one else in the world he would rather be talking to. When he speaks of ''soul'' and ''authenticity'' and ''love,'' you could almost forget that he runs a multibillion-dollar business that has become an uneasy symbol of globalization. Or that the British actor Rupert Everettonce likened Starbucks to a metastasizing cancer.
The story of Mr. Schultz's life and career has been told many times, not least by Mr. Schultz. (His second book, ''Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul,'' is to be published on March 29.) But some highlights bear repeating:
He grew up poor in the Bay View housing projects in Canarsie, Brooklyn, received a football scholarship to Northern Michigan University and, after a variety of jobs, joined the fledging Starbucks in 1982, as head of marketing. Inspired by Italy's coffee culture, he left Starbucks and opened his own coffee shop. Then, in 1987, he bought Starbucks, which at the time had all of six shops. By 1995, Starbucks had 677 shops. By 2000, it had 3,501, and that year Mr. Schultz stepped aside as C.E.O.
And so it went for Starbucks, one success after another, until the recession hit and exposed the company's overreach to the world.
In December 2007, Mr. Schultz was worried that the Starbucks brand was losing its luster, and he and the board decided that in the new year, they would push aside Jim Donald and announce that Mr. Schultz would return as C.E.O. That month, Mr. Schultz, his wife, Sheri, and their two children flew to Hawaii for their annual getaway.
But on the beach in Kona, he just couldn't relax. He kept checking the company's daily sales figures and was horrified to see that they were falling by double digits.
Also in Hawaii then was his friend Michael Dell, who had recently returned to run Dell Inc. On a long bicycle ride along the coast, Mr. Dell told Mr. Schultz that when he returned to Dell, he wrote what he called a ''transformational agenda.'' Mr. Schultz then created his own plan for Starbucks.
His goals were to fix troubled stores, to rekindle an emotional attachment with customers and to make longer-term changes like reorganizing executives and revamping the supply chain.
He returned to Seattle, handed copies of his plan to the company's senior executives and posed the big question: Are you in, or are you out? Eight of those top 10 executives have since departed.
''What the company needed then was what he used to be to us -- the innovation, the refusal to not be a champion,'' says Troy Alstead, the chief financial officer. ''A lot of people were questioning, in that span before he came back, 'Were we done?' And Howard came back, and it wasn't even a question anymore.''
MR. SCHULTZ usually rises at 4 a.m., without an alarm, downs a Starbucks Sumatran coffee at home, followed by a short double latte or espresso macchiato from one of two Starbucks stores he visits on his way to work. He arrives in his office by 6:30.
Friends and colleagues agree that he is as fanatical as ever about Starbucks. Millard Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew, recently e-mailed Mr. Schultz to complain that the coffee lids at a Starbucks on Astor Place in Manhattan kept spilling coffee on his shirt. Mr. Schultz's reply: ''On it.''
Mr. Drexler, who has a habit of e-mailing C.E.O.'s with complaints, says: ''I can give you many more examples when they say, 'I'll send this to a research department or a gatekeeper.' '' But, he says of Starbucks, ''to have that kind of quality control they have around the world is pretty extraordinary.''
It was on such a morning in early 2008 that Mr. Schultz was convinced he had a product that would re-energize the company's tired sales. It was called Sorbetto after the Italian for ''sorbet,'' and the drink was a twist on Pinkberry, the frozen yogurt chain in which Mr. Schultz is an investor.
Mr. Schultz had flown to Italy to taste the ingredients of his new product and thought he had the next Frappuccino. By that summer, 300 Starbucks locations in California were bathed in pink to promote the new drink. Starbucks had shipped in ingredients from Italy, and Mr. Schultz had primed investors.
But customers didn't like the sugary concoction. And neither did Starbucks baristas, who had to spend an hour and a half cleaning the Sorbetto machines at the end of their shifts. A few months later, Mr. Schultz abandoned Sorbetto.
''Sorbetto, we did too quickly, and that was my fault,'' Mr. Schultz says.
The headlong introduction was a mistake, but it was also classic Schultz.
''He likes things moving quickly, he likes people to be decisive, he's got this energy level, this need for driving and for winning, and I think at times it's hard for some people to keep up,'' says Michelle Gass, the president of Seattle's Best Coffee, which Starbucks owns. After his missteps, Ms. Gass says, Mr. Schultz has become more disciplined and a better listener.
Mr. Schultz concedes that he can no longer run Starbucks through the Cult of Howard. And he readily acknowledges that he badly misread the economy and underestimated the extent to which his customers would pull back during the recession.
At the time, he says, he had a hard time accepting that Starbucks would become a poster child for excess.
After his return, he halted new store openings and, with a P.R. flourish, closed every Starbucks in the nation for three hours to retrain baristas. The chain ran its biggest ad campaign ever, emphasizing the quality and freshness of its coffee. It ordered baristas to dump brewed coffee after 30 minutes.
But growth in same-store sales dipped below zero for the first time ever, and the company's share price kept falling. It was a new feeling for Mr. Schultz, like the A student who breezes into college and then gets C's.
Executives concluded that Starbucks had to close 200 American shops. The board suggested 600. Executives said that if sales and the economy got worse, they would also cut $400 million in costs. The board said no, let's start cutting costs immediately, while closing locations. Starbucks ultimately closed 900 locations worldwide and cut $580 million in costs. As the decline in same-store sales neared 10 percent, board members asked executives to model what would happen if the sales slide hit 20 percent -- which once would have been unthinkable.
''Nobody knew where the bottom was,'' recalls James G. Shennan Jr., a venture capitalist who has been on the company's board since 1990. ''The general agreement around the table was we better have the doomsday plan.''
In December 2008, almost a year after he returned as C.E.O., Mr. Schultz flew to New York on the company jet. He and his team were scheduled to meet with analysts from Wall Street, where Mr. Schultz, once a darling, was now being doubted as never before.
On the plane, he reviewed the grim quarterly numbers: Profits were underwhelming, and holiday sales looked dreadful. Just before the meeting, the company's chief financial officer, Pete Bocian, resigned.
Mr. Schultz reread the script for the presentation -- and didn't like what he saw. He worried that the stock price might drop so low that someone would swoop in and buy the company.
He summoned his executives to his Fifth Avenue apartment. Late into the night, around the dining room table, they revised the presentation.
The next day, as the executives rehearsed, Mr. Schultz kept interrupting. Vivek Varma, who had recently joined Starbucks as head of public affairs, told him that he should leave.
No one could remember anyone talking like that to Mr. Schultz. But he left. The next day, he and the other executives painted a somber picture for analysts and laid out the recovery plans. Rather than plunge, the company's share price rose 20 cents that day.
Over the next year, Starbucks made much deeper and more difficult changes than Mr. Schultz had originally envisioned. By April 2009, same-store sales, though still down from a year earlier, were finally rising. By the holidays, they had turned positive.
INSTANT coffee: the very words leave a bad taste in many people's mouths. But Starbucks has been developing instant coffee in earnest since 2006. Mr. Schultz says his industry considers instant a ''death category.'' It is, however, a $20 billion one.
Before he returned, Mr. Schultz complained that if Apple could develop the iPod in less than a year, Starbucks could surely develop an instant coffee in that time. Finally, in January 2009, the new product, Via, was scheduled for a full-scale introduction.
But there was a problem: market research was showing that skeptical customers needed a lesson about instant coffee. Some executives worried that a big rollout might flop. Ms. Gass and a few others told Mr. Schultz that Starbucks should delay Via and introduce it in two cities before going national.
''That was hard for him,'' Ms. Gass says. But rather than overrule his executives, as he might have in the past, Mr. Schultz agreed. It turned out to be the right decision. After testing Via in Seattle and Chicago, Starbucks rewrote the plan for a nationwide introduction. For instance, instead of just giving away free samples, which customers forgot in the bottom of their briefcases, purses and backpacks, it prepared Via in the stores and gave customers a blind taste test.
In 2010, sales of Via were over $200 million. The instant coffee is now also sold in grocery stores and in Britain, Canada, Japan and the Philippines.
The methodical introduction of Via offered a sharp contrast to the old Howard Schultz whose gut told him -- wrongly -- that Sorbetto would be a winner. But he has also gone so far as to embrace big-company ideas like focus groups, which he used to shun. Delegating, and accepting other people's conclusions, is now easier for him. ''There's been more arguing, challenging and debate in the last two to three years than there's ever been,'' says Mr. Alstead, the chief financial officer.
Mr. Schultz's take: ''What leadership means is the courage it takes to talk about things that, in the past, perhaps we wouldn't have, because I'm not right all the time.''
Born entrepreneurs are not necessarily born managers. You need creativity and drive to start a company, discipline and delegation to run one. In the last year, people who work closely with Mr. Schultz say, he has shown he can make the leap.
Perhaps the bigger question is whether Mr. Schultz can, as he likes to say, preserve Starbucks's soul, or whatever soul it has left. In a switch, the company is designing new stores with local woods, furniture and art, to make them feel more like a neighborhood shop. It is also buying specialty beans in limited supply, as artisanal shops do.
Whether Starbucks can recapture a neighborhood feel, as Mr. Schultz insists, is anyone's guess. For many people, especially in areas where carefully made, lighter-roast coffee from the likes of Stumptown and Intelligentsia is trendy, Starbucks has become a place to go for free Wi-Fi, or to use the restroom, or to buy a coffee on the go.
There is a market for a convenient coffee chain, as the recent Starbucks sales rebound shows. But some customers and analysts say that the mass-market approach conflicts with Mr. Schultz's vision of a global giant that somehow feels local everywhere.
Mr. Simon of Temple University says: ''When you're selling stuff people don't need, you've got to be selling something else, and that's what Starbucks lost. There's a kind of dissonance between the messaging and the actual practice.''
Mr. Schultz no longer plans to blanket the United States with new Starbucks stores, sometimes with multiple locations on one block -- a practice that inspired a contest on Flickr to see how many Starbucks shops people could fit into a single photograph. Instead, like so many other executives, he has his sights on China. Starbucks already has roughly 430 stores in mainland China and plans to have 1,500 there by 2015. India beckons as well. The company also plans to sell a wider variety of drinks and foods in grocery stores and its own shops, like Kind fruit and nut bars, which Starbucks put on the map.
IT may be difficult to believe, but there was a time when McDonald's was a novelty. But, like Ray Kroc, who took over a small hamburger business and built it into the most successful fast food operation in the world, Mr. Schultz has learned that growth can be seductive, and that it can exact a price.
Starbucks and its leader are more measured than during his last stint in the corner office. ''I think we are very conscious of the things that we have done wrong over the years, particularly when we just got caught up in the growth phase,'' says Mr. Shennan, the Starbucks director. ''We are not going to do that again under Howard's management, I tell you, or the current board's.''
In January, three years after his return, Mr. Schultz stood before 1,100 employees at the headquarters here. Three thousand more from around the world were patched in via Webcast. The company had finished its strongest holiday season ever, and Mr. Schultz had just unveiled its new, ''coffee''-less logo. Yet his words were laced with caution.
''We have won in many ways,'' he said, ''but I feel it's so important to remind us all of how fleeting success and winning can be.''

PERSON: E. B. Leisenring Jr. 

HEADLINE: E. B. Leisenring Jr., Coal Executive, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
E. B. Leisenring Jr., the scion of a powerful Pennsylvania coal family who led industry negotiators during a long and bitter mine workers' strike in 1978, ignoring pleas by President Jimmy Carter and helping to win a settlement that largely favored mine owners, died on March 2 at his winter home in Aiken, S.C. He was 85.
The cause was heart failure, his family said. Mr. Leisenring (pronounced LYES-en-ring) also lived in Berwyn, Pa. 
The strike, lasting 110 days, was the country's longest at the time and left one miner dead, killed in a gunfight between United Mine Workers members and nonstriking workers. Coal truck tires were slashed, and workers ignored a federal court injunction ordering strikers back to work.
Mr. Leisenring, who had worked in the family mines himself before rising to become president of the Westmoreland Coal Company, one of the industry's biggest, had long been a national spokesman for mine owners. At the time he was chairman of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association and a former chairman of the National Coal Association.
As the strike dragged on and talks reached a stalemate, Mr. Leisenring initially refused to comply when President Carter asked operators to resume negotiations, then reluctantly agreed. Newsweek said Mr. Leisenring treated the White House with ''magisterial disdain.''
The settlement he helped negotiate was widely believed to favor the coal companies. The union failed to win its principal goal, the right to stage ''wildcat,'' or unauthorized, local strikes, and made concessions on health care and other benefits.
The strike ended up costing the miners more than $50 million a week in wages and was said to have depressed national quarterly economic growth. Mr. Leisenring said the strike cost Westmoreland $2 million a day.
Mr. Leisenring traced his roots in the coal industry to his great-grandfather John who started a company in the hard coal, or anthracite, region of Pennsylvania in 1835. It developed into a skein of small companies that grew into bigger ones.
In 1882, the Leisenrings acquired major holdings in the Westmoreland Coal Company, one of Pennsylvania's biggest producers. They also controlled the even bigger Stonega Coke and Coal Company.
Mr. Leisenring was president of Westmoreland from 1961 to 1988 and chairman for another 10 years. In 1964, he merged Stonega into Westmoreland.
He took Westmoreland in new directions. Originally concentrating on anthracite coal in Pennsylvania, used mainly for home heating, the company expanded in West Virginia and elsewhere to mine bituminous coal, which was being increasingly used to generate electricity. He opened huge new mines in Western states and developed coal markets in Japan and other countries. He also set up safety programs that cut the number of accidents in his mines by more than half.
He led the National Coal Association in 1970-71 and in 1970 led a coal industry mission to the Soviet Union.
Edward Barnes Leisenring was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and grew up in a family that had climbed from the coalfields to the heights of Main Line Philadelphia. At 15, he accompanied his father on a business trip to Wise County, Va., where he first entered a coal mine.
In the 2003 book, ''In the Kingdom of Coal,'' Dan Rottenberg wrote that as a teenager Mr. Leisenring was ''permanently smitten'' with the miners and ''their soot-covered faces, hard hats and cap lamps.'' Mr. Leisenring attended the Episcopal Academy in Newtown Square, Pa., and the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut before enrolling at Yale. There he and 19 other Philadelphia bachelors organized the Flask and Bottle Society, a social organization. He graduated in 1949.
His membership in the bachelors club ended two years later, when he married Julia duPont Bissell, a member of a socially prominent family in Wilmington, Del. She survives him, as do his children Erica Leisenring, Edward W. and John Leisenring; and nine grandchildren.
After leaving Yale, Mr. Leisenring headed straight for Big Stone Gap, Va., to work as a survey crewman, measuring coal seams. After a year, he told the mine manager that he wanted to join the U.M.W. and get his hands dirty. He worked underground for a year, loading mining cars by hand. Forbes in 1975 said that an older miner one day asked him, ''Isn't your daddy some kind of ramrod in this outfit?''
Mr. Leisenring allowed as how he was. ''Well,'' the miner replied, considering the tough, dirty job they were doing, ''your daddy must have it in for you.''

HEADLINE: When to Get Your Wallet Out

BYLINE: By KEVIN SALWEN. 
Kevin Salwen and his daughter, Hannah, are the authors of ''The Power of Half: One Family's Decision to Stop Taking and Start Giving Back.''

 BODY:
I'VE long considered myself a relatively generous person.
Here in Atlanta, I carry around McDonald's gift cards for encounters with homeless men and women, build Habitat for Humanity houses and donate 3 to 5 percent of our family's annual income to charity. In short, I'm logical about my giving on United States soil.
But when I travel to developing countries, all that logic disappears. The expanded power of a dollar, combined with what seems like infinite need, creates so many situations in which no answer seems appropriate. I find myself feeling like either a deep-pocketed patsy or a skinflint.
In Palmyra, Syria, I once refused to buy a $4 T-shirt from a child hawker, prompting his outraged query: ''Why are Americans so cheap?'' On the other end of the spectrum, at a roadside stand in rural India, I handed a man with a trained monkey the equivalent of $10, a ridiculous amount that would support his family (and the chimp) for days. And in Accra, Ghana, I was bargaining for a mask and thought the shopkeeper would burst into tears because I had no more cedis (he accepted my final offer of every bill I had). 
Each situation left me wondering: did I do the right thing? Is there a ''right'' way to spend, tip and give money when traveling?
The idea of ''responsible tourism'' has taken hold in recent years, largely in the guise of eco-travel, in which environmental factors become central. But one stumbles into many other ethical issues when traveling. One of the most unavoidable -- especially when in the developing world -- is how to help. Some groups are making this easier, notes Martha Honey, executive director of the Center for Responsible Travel in Washington. Many tour operators and hotels help travelers work with charities that improve life in local communities, connecting them with orphanages, farms or schools.
Other companies focus more on education and raising funds. Lindblad Expeditions, for example, which operates cruises to eco-sensitive destinations, has raised over $6.3 million for environmental partners like Galapagos National Park by soliciting passengers during trips (and offering credits for future travel). And a British nonprofit, TravelPledge.org, allows users to donate money to nonprofit organizations in the areas they have visited.
But what if you travel on your own? Are there ways to make your spending matter? How much should we tip the bellhop? How aggressively to bargain? When to give to panhandlers?
Repeatedly confounded by these questions, my wife, Joan, and I started to compile an informal rule book for what we call ''econ-travel.'' Rules are breakable, of course -- and many of these have been -- but by having them, I find myself less caught up in the decision-by-decision anguish of what to do.
1. Fix a daily or weekly budget. You may not be able to avoid feeling like a patsy or a skinflint, but a budget of how much to spend, tip or give will create a structure for your own sanity. The goal is to walk that tricky line between helping and having every encounter turn into a negotiation. You'll never make everyone happy, but at least you'll have a framework.
2. Overbuy gifts for yourself and others. This is our favorite method of economic development. It helps fuel employment (the most dignified form of money transfer) and it has the residual benefit of having something to bring back home. On a trip to India, we bought a gorgeous hand-woven rug in Jaipur, a piece that we were told took more than four months to make. As our guide, Ashok Verma, later told me in Varanasi, India: ''Crafts are the best thing to buy; they have people's dreams woven into them.''
3. Don't bargain down price, bargain up quantity. Joan wanted to buy a set of colored stamps with bindi (Indian forehead dots) for her students (she teaches seventh grade). One hundred rupees, the vendor said. No, too expensive, she replied, following cultural norms of bargaining. The negotiation was on. Finally, Joan bought three sets for that same 100 rupees (about $2). The man got his price, she got more stamps. Ms. Honey urges travelers to stop bargaining before they are the only winner. ''Let people earn a real wage,'' she cautions.
4. Try to be more than a consumer. Local citizens ''may be economically poor but they are often culturally rich,'' says Harold Goodwin, professor of Responsible Tourism Management at Leeds Metropolitan University in England. So, engage in their culture by getting off the large bus and taking an interest in how they make their living. It's O.K. to take photos of individuals who capture your interest -- but only if you ask first and pay if requested, he adds. The rule is simple, Mr. Goodwin says: ''Treat them as you would like to be treated.''
5. Let others earn a living by helping. In American airports and hotels I never get help with my luggage; wheeled bags roll, don't they? But overseas, I've learned to relax and let someone else carry my suitcase. It's a rational way for local residents to feed their families, and certain people have turned luggage-carrying into an art: when we were leaving the Varanasi train station, a man offered to carry our bags, then stacked both my and Joan's roller suitcases on his head for our 200-yard walk.
6. Don't give to panhandlers. Handouts send a multitude of wrong messages about dependency and the value of work. Plus, handouts encourage more begging, often by children (an awful alternative to school). Long-term change never starts with a quarter or even $10 stuck into someone else's palm. Still, even Ms. Honey concedes she breaks down sometimes. ''I tend to give to women and children because they are the most vulnerable.''
7. Instead, buy stuff on the street. The hawker's life is a tough one, always a fight against weather, traffic and crime. So if you want to help, buy more than you usually might. Granted, I acted counter to this by not buying that T-shirt from the boy in Palmyra, but, as I think about it now, what would it have harmed if I had? Since then, I've purchased boiled eggs, bagged water, toys, even a novel. (I politely said no on the kitchen strainer.) Why not bolster that small-business spirit?
8. Sample local food. Tourists in the developing world often eat at a limited number of hotels or restaurants deemed safe by guidebooks. There's logic to that, especially where food-borne illness is concerned. But you'd be missing out on part of the reason you travel in the first place.
''Buy food and beverages from local producers, taste the locally produced foods and enjoy this as part of your holiday experience,'' Mr. Goodwin says. For instance, you haven't really tasted a banana if you've never had one grown for immediate consumption (compared with ones modified for export and sold blemish-free in United States supermarkets). Peels help keep the fruit safe, as does boiling in the case of a cup of local tea. The winners are the farmers, who often are at the bottom of the economic pyramid.

 BODY:
BLOOD, BONES AND BUTTER
The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef
By Gabrielle Hamilton
291 pp. Random House. $26.
It's hard to think of another American chef who has outdone Gabrielle Hamilton in converting the humblest of stages into the heftiest of reputations. The restaurant she opened in downtown Manhattan in 1999, Prune, has barely enough room for the 30 diners it squeezes in at brunch, lunch and dinner, and despite the reliable presence of dozens of additional customers waiting on the sidewalk, she has either escaped or resisted the itch for expansion that so many of her contemporaries scratch and scratch. Prune has no annex or uptown sibling; there is no Prune Dubai. Just this one cramped, irresistible nook with its scuffed floors, nicked tables and servers in pink. 
And yet Hamilton's renown among, and even beyond, the food cognoscenti is huge. That's principally because what she has championed at Prune -- hearty comfort food prepared to a gourmet's standards and served in a manner so unceremonious that the utensils don't always match -- foreshadowed some of the most prominent dining trends of the day. It owes something as well to her success as a woman in a field still dominated by men. But there's another explanation: Hamilton can write. For many years now, she has popped up in prominent publications as the author of eloquent, spirited glimpses into the heart, mind and sweaty labor of a chef. So the growing ranks of the restaurant-obsessed have been able to feast not only on her deviled eggs but also on her prose.
After much anticipation, the inevitable memoir has arrived. ''Blood, Bones and Butter'' traces nearly all of Hamilton's life and career, from an unmoored childhood through her triumph at Prune, which didn't end the search for a sense of place and peace that is the overarching theme of this autobiography, as of so many others. It's a story of hungers specific and vague, conquered and unappeasable, and what it lacks in urgency (and even, on occasion, forthrightness) it makes up for in the shimmer of Hamilton's best writing.
Recalling her mother's penchant for heavy eyeliner, she flashes back to ''the smell of the sulfur every morning as she lit a match to warm the tip of her black wax pencil.'' Hamilton invokes the ''voluptuous blanket of summer night humidity,'' captures the tantalizing promise of delicate ravioli by observing that ''you could see the herbs and the ricotta through the dough, like a woman behind a shower curtain,'' and compares breast feeding to being cannibalized, ''not in huge monster-gore chunks, but like a legion of soft, benign caterpillars makes lace of a leaf.''
There are rhapsodic passages aplenty about eating and cooking, and while such reveries can easily seem forced or trite, hers ring sweetly true. She's recounting actual rapture, not contriving its facsimile on cue. You can feel her amazement as her father roasts whole lambs on a spit and her awe at the dexterity with which the chef Andre Soltner pulls off a perfect omelet, using only a fork. Readers with limited appetites for food porn, beware. This is one salacious expedition into the folds of orecchiette and fine points of puntarelle. Hamilton's obvious belief that all the world can be refracted through its edible components is so complete that it leads, in a few instances, to sentences that almost come across as satires of food writing. ''I had no clue that my parents were unhappy with each other until I was sweeping up cornichons and hard salami and radishes off the kitchen floor'' is the opening line of a chapter chronicling her parents' breakup. Her family is coming apart, and still she's taking inventory of their larder.
That happens early in the book, following an account of growing up in a bucolic part of Pennsylvania along the Delaware River, and it flags the onset of drift and delinquency. During Hamilton's teenage years, her parents are often gone or distracted, and at times she's left to fend for herself. She lies about her age to get dishwashing work. She steals. And by age 16, she's made her way to Manhattan, an early graduate from an alternative high school doing battle with the platoons of cockroaches in a Hell's Kitchen apartment she shares with her older sister.
She winds up waiting tables, and that, along with the dishwashing, establishes the book's main leitmotif: time and again she is drawn -- pulled, really -- back to the world of food and hospitality. It happens even when she struggles against it, a battle suggested by the book's subtitle, ''The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef.'' Economic necessity is the proximal reason, but not the real one. Through feeding people Hamilton exerts control over a life rendered chaotic and undependable when her parents split; she takes care of others in the way her parents didn't take care of her. This is clearest in her description of opening Prune, which illuminates how much more than menu planning goes into the creation of a restaurant. Hamilton is guided by nostalgia and yearning, and wants above all to forge an emotional connection with her guests.
She's funny about the pretensions of other restaurants, proclaiming that Prune would ''never serve anything but a martini in a martini glass. Preferably gin.'' And she's blunt about the moment-to-moment drudgery of running the place. While Anthony Bourdain's memoir ''Kitchen Confidential'' only purported to deglamorize restaurant work, then went on to give it a naughty, swashbuckling romanticism, Hamilton takes you out back behind Prune, where, all alone, she discovers and disposes of a rat swollen with maggots. No sane reader will aspire to this.
She is blunt as well about how tedious she finds discussions of gender in the workplace, how insufferable she considers the self-satisfied milieu at the farmers' market and how surreal, ludicrous and, yes, exhilarating she deems the celebrity-chef treatment. But that candor draws attention to its absence on other fronts. For many years she is coupled and, according to a throwaway phrase, madly in love with a woman she meets while in Michigan to do graduate work in creative writing, but she says little else about the relationship, and doesn't wrestle in a satisfying way with the questions raised by her affair with, then marriage to, a man. He and she live apart even after the birth of their two children, and this arrangement is initially addressed with a frustrating casualness. Even later, when she examines the marriage further, it remains opaque, though his Italian lineage and their sojourns in Apulia give her the material for the last, too leisurely quarter of the book.
Hamilton may, justifiably, not want her focus to swerve from the kitchen to the bedroom, but she winds up seeming selectively guarded and evasive, and maybe a bit careless. In many places the book cries out for connective tissue that's missing, and there are specific omissions that throw a reader off balance. Although elated by her entry into that graduate program, Hamilton doesn't say what she writes there -- even as she's being caustically dismissive of her classmates' efforts. And when her mother reappears in the book after a long absence, Hamilton vents a fury at her that she hasn't set the stage for.
A more general anger and even disdain for other people's vanities and inconsistencies flicker throughout the book. They undercut her likability as a narrator, though she's redeemed time and again by her self-reliance, her industriousness and her observant, clever storytelling. She notes that less than a week after tackling the maggoty rat, she was on her way in a black town car to Martha Stewart's television show for a cooking demonstration. And she returns toward the end of the book to those ravioli, revealing only then that what lay inside was terrible. Her timing is perfect, her metaphor clear and her point indisputable. Sometimes pasta and people don't make good on all the hope you have invested in them.

HEADLINE: A Director's Toughest Competition

BYLINE: By NICOLAS RAPOLD

 BODY:
IN the sausage factory of moviemaking the remake is an age-old temptation. For love or money (but usually money) studios have tapped old stories for different times, fresh stars and ambitious directors, streamlining conceits and translating inconvenient foreign languages. Fans of the originals usually cry desecration, and even talented remakers have trouble living up to the aura surrounding their predecessors' versions, much less the appeal.
But a special beast in the menagerie of reworkings is the remake undertaken by the same director. These do-overs find a filmmaker competing with nobody's reputation but his own, and for viewers they yield the fascination of watching an artistic personality exerted twice upon the same material.
Such second chances are the rule in ''Auto-Remakes,'' a series at Anthology Film Archives in the East Village that begins Friday and continues through March 31. The 18-film selection puts directorial originals and their own certified copies on equal footing in paired screenings. While contemporary examples have included Michael Haneke's ''Funny Games'' and the Pang brothers' ''Bangkok Dangerous,'' the Anthology lineup favors heavyweights of the repertory canon -- Hitchcock, Ford, Hawks, Ozu -- whose robust styles and long filmographies already invite auteurist contemplation. 
''It seems that all these directors, like all great filmmakers, are drawn to the same themes, and the series puts each filmmaker's sensibilities in an interesting kind of focus,'' said Jed Rapfogel, film programmer at Anthology. ''There's the idea of somebody having grown as an artist or having different tools at hand.''
The pairings vividly throw into relief the strategies and techniques of each filmmaker. Hitchcock's kidnapping thriller ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' (1934), the British-made predecessor to the longer 1956 production starring Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day, has the dense, helter-skelter feel of an eager, even impatient talent pulling out all the stops, making every sound and shot a paranoiac nexus of intrigue. While the earlier film's most memorable figure is the cruelly insouciant villain played by Peter Lorre, the standout in the 1956 film is Stewart's family man on a disastrous Morocco vacation -- he's a righteous Technicolor portrait in American decency and a prime example of Hitchcock's deep interlacing of star power and subject.
The panicked scurry of the 1934 film and the deepening menace of its 1956 expansion underline the role of rhythm in directorial variation. Ernst Lubitsch, another influential master of narrative formulas and tonal nuance, took two Vienna couples' adulterous misadventures in ''The Marriage Circle'' (1924), his romantic comedy, and quickened them with nimble, cheerful cynicism in ''One Hour With You'' (1932), set in Paris. The crisply compressed later project zips along as Maurice Chevalier and company wittily express their worldliness and worries in couplets and song.
Music would also transform the remake of Howard Hawks's ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), which starred Barbara Stanwyck as a nightclub hottie opposite Gary Cooper and an institute of eggheads. ''A Song Is Born'' (1948), a Danny Kaye vehicle that needed a director, features jazz greats like Benny Goodman and Louis Armstrong but, lacking Stanwyck and the original script written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, swings mainly in its star-studded jams. Hawks called the shoot ''an altogether horrible experience,'' though he had the comfort of a quarter-million-dollar paycheck and the release of ''Red River'' the same season.
Sometimes a change in genres afforded the opportunity to intensify or sharpen salient aspects of the original. Already set in the West, Raoul Walsh's late gangster picture ''High Sierra'' (1941) stars Humphrey Bogart as a recently released career criminal recruited for one last job, ending with a doomed retreat up a sheer mountain face. In the noirish western ''Colorado Territory'' (1949) Walsh lets landscape entirely drive the mood, as a jailbird (now played by Joel McCrea) haunts desolate desertscapes and Spanish ruins. The solitude of Bogart and his companion (Ida Lupino), alone together, is replaced by a tight web of matter-of-fact betrayal; McCrea's face conveys a weary fatalism. (Warner Brothers would remake the title yet again in 1955 as ''I Died a Thousand Times.'')
Walsh's two pictures, as with several pairings in the series, came on either side of World War II, and nearly three decades separate the two featured entries by Yasujiro Ozu, the sole foreign-language representative. Ozu's interest in the nuances of family dynamics and his sympathy for economic travails remain consistent in both the silent, black-and-white ''I Was Born, but ...'' (1932) and ''Good Morning'' (1959), whose color, foursquare arrangements of houses and silk screens are Mondrianesque. An adorable older-younger brother duo is the touchstone in both films, but where the earlier picture finds the bullied youngsters accusing their company-man father of hypocrisy about life's social hierarchies, their postwar, boom-time successors direct their silent protest at their family's lack of a television.
The small-town canvas and its reflections of the national character also attracted John Ford to return to the well. The postbellum Kentucky stories of Irvin S. Cobb about a county magistrate yielded him folksy fodder for ''Judge Priest'' (1934) and ''The Sun Shines Bright'' (1953). Ford's repeated citation of the later film as his favorite (out of a 150-strong oeuvre) suggests his depth of feeling for the material. Both adaptations build to communal affirmations of brotherhood, but in the later version Ford reinstates a lynch-mob scene dropped from the original and casts Charles Winninger, a favored character actor, in the lead role originated by Will Rogers as a country-sly troubleshooter. The result, though manhandled by a producer, is a vivid portrayal of courage and conscience.
But the most unusual revisitation in Anthology's series might be Trent Harris's ''Beaver Trilogy'' (1979-2000). Mr. Harris's serendipitous documentary sketch of the lovable goofball Larry Huff -- a TV-mad Olivia Newton-John impersonator in the skeptical world of Beaver, Utah -- is followed by two brief reinterpretations: a 1981 video re-enactment with Sean Penn and a tragicomic 1985 dramatization filmed with Crispin Glover.
''I remember when I showed the very first documentary of the kid to a few friends, they were laughing at him, and they didn't sense the pain he was going through,'' said Mr. Harris, who first grouped the three together in 2000. ''So I tried to do the thing with Sean, so they could see the tormented side, the darker side. I made each one because I was trying to fix it really.''
Anticipating later avant-garde vogues for restaging, the trilogy's progression from observational oddity to sometimes painful portrait presents a poignant search for subtext, in which the very notion of a remake can evoke the vagaries of identity. It's a fitting conclusion to a series that shows how, for filmmakers, the greatest creative risk taking can paradoxically come when repeating themselves.
Correction: March 20, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about directors remaking their own movies misidentified a co-writer of Howard Hawks's 1941 comedy ''Ball of Fire.'' Besides Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett also wrote the screenplay -- not Leigh Brackett, who has written other screenplays.

HEADLINE: Supply Disruptions of Power and Water Threaten Japan's Economy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Nick Bunkley and Verne G. Kopytoff contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As the humanitarian and nuclear crises in Japan escalated after the devastating earthquake and tsunami, the impact on the country's economy appeared to be spreading as well.
While the nation's industrial clusters in the south and west seemed to be spared the worst, the crisis at damaged nuclear plants north of Tokyo was threatening to cause an energy squeeze that could set back all sectors of Japan's economy.
To help bring electricity back to the devastated areas, utilities across Japan are cutting back and sharing power, imposing rolling blackouts that will affect factories, stores and homes throughout the nation. The emergency effort is expected to last up to two weeks, but could take longer.
''The big question is whether this will seriously affect Japan's ability to produce goods for any extended period of time,'' said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist and investment strategist. 
Assembly plants for Japan's big three automakers -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- were closed on Sunday and planned to remain closed on Monday. Automakers said some plants experienced damage that was not extensive, but damage to suppliers and to the nation's transport system and infrastructure was expected to affect their ability to make and move their products.
Japan's economic outlook, already problematic, is now even more uncertain, economists and analysts say, because the dimensions of the disaster remain unclear, especially at the damaged nuclear plants.
''The Japanese economy threatens to suffer another bout of recession,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.
Economic activity in Japan contracted in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the country was overtaken by China as the world's second-largest economy, after the United States. Activity may well shrink for the first half of this year, Mr. Zandi said, though he predicted that the rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of the quake would help provide a rebound in the second half.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's biggest, opened as usual on Monday, with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo down 4.5 percent, at 9,800 points, at midday.
To try to stabilize the markets and prop up the economy, the head of Japan's central bank said on Sunday that the bank would pour money into the financial system on Monday. Analysts estimated that the bank could add $25 billion to $40 billion in liquidity.
Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan, did not mention an amount, but emphasized the bank's resolve. ''We will monitor market conditions and plan to provide markets with a lot of liquidity first thing tomorrow morning,'' Mr. Shirakawa said, after attending a meeting of cabinet ministers.
Rebuilding costs that could run in the tens of billions of dollars may require Japan to make tough decisions about government spending, economists say. Its ratio of government debt to the economy's annual output is already at 200 percent, the highest among industrialized nations and far higher than in the United States, for example. So reconstruction, economists say, may make cuts in government spending elsewhere a necessity.
The yen is expected to strengthen against the dollar, as Japanese investors bring money back from overseas to shore up their savings and provide money for the rebuilding campaign. Those financial flows back into Japan will drive up demand for the yen, increasing its value. After the Kobe earthquake in 1995, the yen rose about 20 percent against the dollar over a few months.
On Monday, the yen was stronger, with the dollar trading at 81.35 yen. One ripple effect could be a reduction in demand for United States Treasury bonds, adding pressure to American interest rates, according Byron R. Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners. The Japanese have been large buyers of United States bonds, but, Mr. Wien said, ''they are going to be using their money to rebuild, so they will be smaller buyers of our debt securities.''
If energy curbs and infrastructure damage hinder production in a significant way, it could harm Japanese companies and affect consumers abroad. Japanese automakers have shifted much of their manufacturing overseas in recent years. But some popular models are still made in Japan for export, including fuel-efficient cars like the Toyota Prius and the Honda Fit. Disruptions in exports could hurt sales at a time when rising gasoline prices have increased demand for those cars in the United States.
Japan is also a crucial global supplier of electronic goods and parts used in an array of industrial and consumer goods. The country produces an estimated 40 percent of the lightweight chips used to store data in smartphones and tablet computers, and it is also a leading maker of liquid crystal displays used in consumer electronics products.
Most high-tech goods these days are produced through carefully orchestrated procurement and manufacturing networks that combine parts from around the globe, often shipped on tight daily production schedules. Even temporary shortages can drive up prices sharply for a while.
The daily spot market for certain kinds of semiconductor chips will most likely feel the impact soonest. ''There will be a lot of nervousness,'' said Jim Handy, an analyst at Objective Analysis, a semiconductor research firm. ''This may cause phenomenal shortages in the spot market.''
Companies with chips that have gone only part way through the manufacturing process would most likely have to backtrack a step and rework those chips when the power returns. Doing so could add a day or two to the time required to finish a batch of chips.
''You're going to have productivity losses,'' Mr. Handy said.
Klaus Rinnen, managing vice president at Gartner, a technology research company, said a colleague in Japan, near Tokyo, told him that he was scheduled for rolling blackouts twice a day. However, shutting off power to chip manufacturers twice a day would be impossible to manage, he said, because fluctuations in power create defects and high losses.
Water is also an important component of the chip-making process, Mr. Handy said, and any cut in water supplies or an increase in contaminated water would hurt production.
In the end, only large important customers may end up getting their chip orders, Mr. Handy said. Even those will most likely receive less than their contracts stipulate.
Sony's six factories in the region affected by the earthquake were all damaged, and the company said it had no clear idea when they would reopen. All the facilities have halted operations.
The destruction was most severe at a plant in Miyagi Prefecture that makes Blu-ray discs and magnetic tapes. The tsunami flooded the first floor and the surrounding area, forcing nearly 1,150 workers and 110 neighbors to seek safety upstairs. On Saturday, Sony chartered a helicopter to deliver supplies to those trapped.
By Sunday afternoon, all but 20 had left the plant to check on their families and homes. Some may return to the factory overnight, depending on whether their homes are still intact.
Freescale Semiconductor's plant in Sendai, which makes chips for the automotive and consumer electronics industries, was also shut down. All employees were safely evacuated, the company said.
The overall effect on the technology market, Mr. Handy said, would be serious.
''It looks like it's going to be pretty awful -- the electricity, the water, the railroads -- there could be plants that shut down,'' he said. ''All those things are going to cause problems. Just pile all that together and it's all bad.''
In the global energy market, there are already signs of a reaction to Japan's troubles, with the expectation the country will turn to liquefied natural gas to replace electricity output lost at the damaged nuclear plants. Two tankers at sea, carrying liquefied natural gas from Russia, have been diverted to Japan, according to industry reports.
''Liquefied natural gas will be the default fuel to replace the electricity generation Japan has lost,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''Liquefied natural gas tankers will be diverted to Japan, the market that needs it the most, and desperately so.''

HEADLINE: Another Inside Job

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Count me among those who were glad to see the documentary ''Inside Job'' win an Oscar. The film reminded us that the financial crisis of 2008, whose aftereffects are still blighting the lives of millions of Americans, didn't just happen -- it was made possible by bad behavior on the part of bankers, regulators and, yes, economists.
What the film didn't point out, however, is that the crisis has spawned a whole new set of abuses, many of them illegal as well as immoral. And leading political figures are, at long last, showing some outrage. Unfortunately, this outrage is directed, not at banking abuses, but at those trying to hold banks accountable for these abuses. 
The immediate flashpoint is a proposed settlement between state attorneys general and the mortgage servicing industry. That settlement is a ''shakedown,'' says Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. The money banks would be required to allot to mortgage modification would be ''extorted,'' declares The Wall Street Journal. And the bankers themselves warn that any action against them would place economic recovery at risk.
All of which goes to confirm that the rich are different from you and me: when they break the law, it's the prosecutors who find themselves on trial.
To get an idea of what we're talking about here, look at the complaint filed by Nevada's attorney general against Bank of America. The complaint charges the bank with luring families into its loan-modification program -- supposedly to help them keep their homes -- under false pretenses; with giving false information about the program's requirements (for example, telling them that they had to default on their mortgages before receiving a modification); with stringing families along with promises of action, then ''sending foreclosure notices, scheduling auction dates, and even selling consumers' homes while they waited for decisions''; and, in general, with exploiting the program to enrich itself at those families' expense.
The end result, the complaint charges, was that ''many Nevada consumers continued to make mortgage payments they could not afford, running through their savings, their retirement funds, or their children's education funds. Additionally, due to Bank of America's misleading assurances, consumers deferred short-sales and passed on other attempts to mitigate their losses. And they waited anxiously, month after month, calling Bank of America and submitting their paperwork again and again, not knowing whether or when they would lose their homes.''
Still, things like this only happen to losers who can't keep up their mortgage payments, right? Wrong. Recently Dana Milbank, the Washington Post columnist, wrote about his own experience: a routine mortgage refinance with Citibank somehow turned into a nightmare of misquoted rates, improper interest charges, and frozen bank accounts. And all the evidence suggests that Mr. Milbank's experience wasn't unusual.
Notice, by the way, that we're not talking about the business practices of fly-by-night operators; we're talking about two of our three largest financial companies, with roughly $2 trillion each in assets. Yet politicians would have you believe that any attempt to get these abusive banking giants to make modest restitution is a ''shakedown.'' The only real question is whether the proposed settlement lets them off far too lightly.
What about the argument that placing any demand on the banks would endanger the recovery? There's a lot to be said about that argument, none of it good. But let me emphasize two points.
First, the proposed settlement only calls for loan modifications that would produce a greater ''net present value'' than foreclosure -- that is, for offering deals that are in the interest of both homeowners and investors. The outrageous truth is that in many cases banks are blocking such mutually beneficial deals, so that they can continue to extract fees. How could ending this highway robbery be bad for the economy?
Second, the biggest obstacle to recovery isn't the financial condition of major banks, which were bailed out once and are now profiting from the widespread perception that they'll be bailed out again if anything goes wrong. It is, instead, the overhang of household debt combined with paralysis in the housing market. Getting banks to clear up mortgage debts -- instead of stringing families along to extract a few more dollars -- would help, not hurt, the economy.
In the days and weeks ahead, we'll see pro-banker politicians denounce the proposed settlement, asserting that it's all about defending the rule of law. But what they're actually defending is the exact opposite -- a system in which only the little people have to obey the law, while the rich, and bankers especially, can cheat and defraud without consequences.

HEADLINE: Antigovernment Protesters Seal Off Bahrain's Financial Center

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Thousands of antigovernment protesters in Bahrain blocked access to the financial district in Manama, the capital, on Sunday, preventing workers from getting to their offices and pushing back police officers who tried to disperse them.
It was the most serious challenge to the royal family that rules Bahrain since protests began last month.
Witnesses said the police used tear gas and fired on the protesters with rubber bullets. 
''This was a very, very big day,'' Mohammed al-Maskati, president of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, said by telephone from Pearl Square, the epicenter for protests in central Manama. ''Now the protesters control these streets. There are walls of rubble keeping out the police and armed groups. People say they will not sleep tonight.''
There were also clashes at the campus of the main university, where protesters contended that the security forces were protecting armed vigilantes accused of fomenting tensions between the 70 percent of the population that is Shiite Muslim and the Sunni ruling family and elite.
The latest protests occurred a day after Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates stopped in Bahrain and warned the Khalifa family, which has ruled Bahrain for two centuries, that it must go beyond the ''baby steps'' of reform to meet the economic and political demands sweeping much of the Arab world.
The White House issued a statement on Sunday that said the United States strongly condemned violence that had occurred in Bahrain and Yemen, and added, ''We urge the government of Bahrain to pursue a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the opposition rather than resorting to the use of force.''
Bahrain, a kingdom on the Persian Gulf, is home to the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet and is a crucial American ally. The Obama administration has supported the Khalifa family through the unrest, unlike the policy it adopted in seeking to remove the leaders of Libya and, to a lesser extent, Egypt. But the White House has tried to push Bahrain's government to meet many of the protesters' demands, worried that Iran, which is overwhelmingly Shiite, could exploit the unhappiness of Shiites in Bahrain.
''I expressed the view that we had no evidence that suggested that Iran started any of these popular revolutions or demonstrations across the region,'' Mr. Gates told reporters after his visit on Saturday. ''But there is clear evidence that as the process is protracted, particularly in Bahrain, that the Iranians are looking for ways to exploit it and create problems.''
He added, ''Time is not our friend.''
The demonstrations on Sunday occurred on King Faisal Highway at the entrance to Manama's financial district. In a statement, the government said the violence began when ''a group of protesters attacked unarmed police officers, resulting in one police officer being stabbed and another sustaining a serious head injury.''
''Police then sought to disperse approximately 350 protesters by using tear gas in order to clear the road,'' the government said. ''The Ministry of Interior is currently undergoing operations to reopen the King Faisal Highway.''
By Sunday evening, witnesses said, the highway remained essentially closed to traffic and was in the hands of demonstrators.
''It is like a ghost town with the highway closed and the financial district closed,'' Hussein Muhammad, a bookstore owner and activist, said by telephone. ''Thousands of people came all morning, and hundreds were injured.'' Two demonstrators suffered serious head injuries, witnesses said.
Last month, Obama administration officials said that Bahrain's king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, listened when President Obama asked him to pull back his security forces after seven people were killed at the start of the protests.
The demonstrators have grown frustrated that they have been allowed to hold on to Pearl Square, a traffic circle, but have not achieved their political goals. That is why, they said, they chose to move on the financial center in a country that prizes its business-friendly policies. And there is growing concern that the pro-democracy movement is deteriorating into a Sunni-Shiite split.
''We want a new constitution, fair and free elections and a government elected directly by the people,'' Mohammad Mattar, an engineer and member of the Waad pro-reform movement, said by telephone. ''These are not sectarian demands, but political ones. We want a constitutional monarchy, a clear relationship between the ruling family and society. But the security forces are trying to create a sectarian divide.''
Bahrain's crown prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, meanwhile, renewed a call for national dialogue on Sunday, promising that the talks would address proposals to increase the power of Parliament, Reuters reported.
''We have worked actively to establish contacts to learn the views of various sides,'' he said in a statement that was read on Bahrain TV, ''which shows our commitment to a comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue.''
Mr. Gates said on Saturday that he told the king and crown prince that change ''could be led or it could be imposed.''
He added, ''Obviously, leading reform and being responsive is the way we'd like to see this move forward.''

HEADLINE: Hours Apart, Two Officers Die in the Line of Duty: In Brooklyn, Falling Over a Railing In a Scuffle

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN; Nate Schweber, Tim Stelloh and Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It was a relatively routine call, the kind that the New York City police usually handle without too much trouble. A frightened woman in Brooklyn telephoned 911 early Sunday morning and reported that her ex-boyfriend was threatening her.
''He said he's going to kill me,'' the woman cried. ''He said he's across the street, and he's going to kill me and 'Don't call the cops!' ''
Four officers responded to the single-room-occupancy building in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, where the 48-year-old woman lived, and then drove her to a nearby brownstone to have her point out the man who had menaced her.
But on the darkened streets, the call, one of the 700 domestic violence reports a day that the police get, ended with the death of a police officer. As the police led the suspect out onto the stoop of the brownstone, the police said, he pushed one officer over the railing, causing the officer to tumble nine feet to a landing near the basement and break his neck. 
Police officials said the officer, Alain Schaberger, 42, of the 84th Precinct, a 10-year veteran of the force who was engaged to be married, was pronounced dead shortly afterward at Lutheran Medical Center.
They identified the suspect as George Villanueva, 42, an unemployed man who had 28 prior arrests, mostly for robbery and burglary; had been to prison twice; and had been accused in a dozen reports of domestic violence by the woman who called 911 on Sunday. The woman, whose name is being withheld, had obtained two orders of protection against Mr. Villanueva.
What appears to be a routine assignment can become deadly very quickly,'' Police CommissionerRaymond W. Kelly said at a news conference at the hospital. ''You don't know going to encounter.''
Officer Schaberger was the first city officer to die in the line of duty since May 28, 2009, whenOmar J. Edwards, who was in plain clothes, was mistakenly shot in Harlem by another police officer while trying to arrest a suspect who had broken into his car. (Since then, at least two officers have died from 9/11-related illnesses, according to the police.)
And Officer Schaberger was killed just a few hours after a police officer in Nassau County was shot and killed in what was apparently another case of mistaken identity.
In the last four months alone, according to a law enforcement official, Mr. Villanueva had been arrested at least three times on charges of domestic violence against the same woman he was accused of threatening Sunday. On Nov. 3, he was accused of punching her in the face and head earlier that week. On Dec. 7, he was accused of punching her so severely in a Nov. 25 sidewalk fight that she required 10 stitches. On Feb. 4, he was arrested for a Jan. 18 episode in which he was accused of punching her at a party. The police had made a follow-up visit to the woman on Feb. 9, as part of a domestic violence prevention program. The outcomes of the domestic violence cases were not clear Sunday.
Jose Feliciano, 49, a resident of the Bergen Street building where the woman lives, said that Mr. Villanueva's picture was posted near the entrance as someone who should not be allowed to enter. Still, he said, the woman, had continued to date Mr. Villanueva, although in the Feb. 4 complaint she described Mr. Villanueva as her ex-boyfriend.
''She tells me he beats on her,'' the neighbor said, adding: but ''she is in love with him.''
Another resident, William Daly, 64, said that he had heard Mr. Villanueva threaten the woman- ''He'd say, 'I'll kill you if you go with any other man but me' '' - and that a month ago he saw him punch her on the building's wheelchair ramp.
''He came sweeping around and right to the side of her face - wham,'' Mr. Daly said. ''She fell on the ground on one knee.''
Mr. Villanueva's uncle, Ely Figueroa, 62, said he, Mr. Villanueva's father and Mr. Villanueva had spent Saturday night watching boxing matches and sharing three cases of beer. He guessed that Mr. Villanueva had downed six to nine beers, but Mr. Figueroa said that he did not appear drunk.
The 911 call came in at 4:22 a.m. Sunday from the woman, and a security guard at the building also called 911, saying Mr. Villanueva was arguing with the woman though he was not allowed near the building.
The officers took the woman to 45 St. Marks Place, where Mr. Villanueva and his father, Luis, live. The officers escorted Mr. Villanueva out of his apartment, and as they emerged onto the stoop, the woman got out of the police car and shouted, ''That's him!''
Mr. Villanueva began to struggle as the officers were trying to handcuff him, and he shoved Officer Schaberger over the railing of the steps, the police said. The brownstone's stoop is four steps up from the ground level, but there is another set of stairs leading to a basement entrance.
''We have witnesses that say he was pushed with two hands from the steps over the railing,'' Commissioner Kelly said.
Officer Schaberger, his heart still beating, was taken away by ambulance but was pronounced dead at the hospital. Another officer subdued Mr. Villanueva with a Taser, and Mr. Villanueva was taken to Woodhull Hospital for observation for several hours Sunday. The police charged him with first-degree murder for the aggravated murder of a police officer, criminal contempt and assault. Mr. Villanueva was arraigned late Sunday. No plea was entered, and he remained in custody.
Mr. Villanueva stayed silent and kept his head down as he was led out of a police station house to jail Sunday night. His brother, Danny Villanueva, expressed condolences to the officer's family but described what had happened as ''a tug of war'' between the police and his brother, rather than a push. He said it would have been easy for someone to fall over the knee-high railing. ''It's a bad situation altogether,'' he said.
Officer Schaberger was born in Saigon in 1969 to a Vietnamese mother and an American father and moved to East Islip on Long Island when he was 5, said his fiancee, Shoshone Peguese. He served in the Navy from 1991 to 1995, worked as a security guard, then graduated from the Police Academy in July 2001. Ms. Peguese, 45, lived with Officer Schaberger in a modest yellow wooden house near the banks of a stream on a rural road in Cortlandt Manor, about an hour north of New York City.
Ms. Peguese, who works for New York City Transit, said she and Officer Schaberger would go whale watching on Cape Cod. She is a member of the Peedee Indian Nation in Beaver Creek, S.C., and took Officer Schaberger to powwows, where he loved to sit and watch her dance.
''People thought he was Native American,'' she said.
He was not the first officer to die while trying to intervene in a domestic dispute. On one such call in 1996, Officer Vincent Giudice either fell onto or was thrown into a broken mirror, and bled to death as a result of a slashed thigh.
Outside the 84th Precinct station house on Gold Street in Downtown Brooklyn, where purple bunting was hung in mourning on Sunday and counselors and chaplains came and went, Officer David Kozlow said domestic violence calls could be among the most challenging because of the passions involved. He said he had been to the Bergen Street residence himself.
''They have one thing on their mind,'' he said of many domestic violence suspects, ''that they want to get back at this person.'' Sometimes, he said, they do not even acknowledge police officers because of tunnel vision created by their anger.
Joseph F. King, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said ''domestics,'' as they are called, are often the trickiest disputes to handle because they have the appearance of being ordinary and everyday. ''You throw in alcohol and drugs and all that emotion, and it's a potentially dangerous mix,'' he added.
Nate Schweber, Tim Stelloh and Karen Zraick contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Tight Times, PBS Leans on Pledge Drives

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
If it feels as though Suze Orman and the cast of ''Les Miserables'' have taken over your local public television station, you're not dreaming.
The current pledge drive comes to an official end on March 20 (although many stations set their own schedules), and the baby boomer concerts, ''Laugh-In'' retrospective, doo-wop groups and self-help gurus will go on hiatus. But in a few short months, those programs and similar ones will be back.
Since 2005, the average amount of time PBS member stations devote to on-air pledge drives has increased by 9 percent, according to PBS. Some stations now devote a full 10 weeks a year to the special shows. 
Driving the expansion is the same theme weaving through much of public television: money. Financially troubled state governments are rapidly cutting and sometimes eliminating subsidies for public media.
In Washington, the threat of losing federal funding looms large, with last week's turmoil at NPR, PBS's public radio counterpart, only adding to opponents' ammunition. The economic downturn crippled many foundations that traditionally support public media, and corporations have cut back underwriting.
That leaves stations turning to viewers during pledge drives, which are more effective than direct mail. While many viewers grumble when they cannot find their staples of ''Masterpiece Theater'' or ''Frontline,'' there is another pool of viewers who like the concerts.
''I believe strongly that it's totally appropriate for us to be doing that, going on the air to a perfectly targeted group of our users and explaining why we need their help,'' said Robert Altman, the general manager of WMHT in Troy, N.Y.
National pledge drives date to the early days of public broadcasting, in the mid-1970s, when they were called festivals. They were meant not just to raise local money, but to draw federal and state funds by showing Congress that public television had passionate supporters, said Lawrence Grossman, who worked on ad campaigns for the festivals and later become the president of PBS.
Even then, the drives had their critics; an early festival featured Nashville's ''Grand Ole Opry,'' which some stations believed was beneath them, Mr. Grossman said. That program did ''phenomenally well,'' he recalled.
Today, according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which administers federal funds for public broadcasting, individuals are the largest source of support for local public television stations, providing 24 percent of station revenue in the 2009 fiscal year.
In aggregate, stations raised $32 million in the last pledge period in December, said John Wilson, PBS's chief programmer. That figure was down 8 percent from a year ago, on average.
So far in March, traditionally the biggest drive, the trend has reversed. Preliminary figures show a 31 percent increase in the number of dollars pledged compared with March 2010, PBS said, citing the quality of the month's offerings -- the ''Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert'' has been a particular hit -- and the increased visibility of public broadcasting because of the federal funding fight.
Some stations have cut back on pledge drives -- or changed the way in which they conduct them -- since complaints about the drives reached their peak a few years back. A few stations have shunned the special concerts and are asking viewers to support regular shows.
KLRU-TV in Austin, Tex., which dropped its June pledge drive completely, has created local events around pledge programs like an antiques appraisal fair and has a rule that no public affairs programs are to be interrupted, said Shane Guiter, director of development. Complaints, he said, are ''way down from five years ago.''
PBS, meanwhile, is looking at offering less expensive downloads of music as a pledge gift, instead of the actual CDs, to appeal to younger audiences, Mr. Wilson said.
Within the next few months, viewers who bypass their local stations to watch PBS programming at PBS.org will find themselves the focus of more aggressive fund-raising pleas as well. This spring, after years of debate, PBS will begin testing a much-delayed online giving system that has been in development for more than a year.
Donors will be able to give directly through a streamlined process on PBS.org. Using information from the donor's Internet connection, PBS will be able to determine the person's location and shepherd the donated funds -- as well as a donor's name and e-mail address -- to the nearest local station.
While some stations initially feared PBS was trying to co-opt donations for itself by bypassing local stations, those criticisms have subsided as the project has evolved. PBS.org draws a diverse audience with an average age of 34.2 years, said Jason Seiken, who oversees new media for PBS. That's 20 years younger than the average age of KLRU donors, said Mr. Guiter, a member of the project's advisory committee.
''I see this as an opportunity for us to make connections with a new set of viewers or supporters or folks that we haven't been able to reach yet,'' Mr. Guiter said.
While some stations, like KLRU, have their own online giving systems, the average PBS station raises just 7 to 8 percent of its membership revenue online, Mr. Guiter said. By comparison, the average nonprofit group raises about 11 percent. (KLRU draws 18 percent of membership revenue online.)
The hope, said Mr. Altman of WMHT, is that the new initiative will provide a way ''for the millions of people who are visiting PBS.org to more easily express their support.'' How lucrative it will be remains unclear.
''There's a sense that we know there are large numbers of people visiting PBS.org who aren't members,'' Mr. Altman said, but ''the short answer is, we just don't know.''

HEADLINE: In Turkey, Thousands Protest a Crackdown on Press Freedom

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Thousands of people marched in central Istanbul on Sunday to protest a crackdown on the press in Turkey after the arrest of more than a dozen journalists this month. 
In the most prominent case, two investigative journalists, Nedim Sener and Ahmet Sik, were arrested on charges of involvement in a 2003 military-led plot to overthrow the pro-Islamic government.
Protesters chanted slogans like ''Don't remain silent; the next might be you if you remain silent,'' ''Ahmet and Nedim are our people of honor,'' and ''Free press, free society.''
Critics of the crackdown say that the arrests are an effort by pro-government officials in the judiciary and the security forces to silence critics of the governing Justice and Development Party.
Turkey aspires to join the European Union, and a recent report on Turkey's performance in the membership process harshly criticized journalists' arrests and a record-high tax penalty ordered in 2009 against Dogan Media Group, which has been critical of the government.
''The high number of legal suits against journalists and undue pressure on the media undermines freedom of the press in practice,'' said the report, which was prepared by European Union officials.
With four months to go before a general election, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rebuffed criticism and called the officials who prepared the report ignorant of Turkey.
''There is no balance in this report,'' Mr. Erdogan said at a news conference last week. ''The wording of this report does not reflect the press freedom in Turkey.''
The government also denies claims by opponents that it has been seeking to silence vocal critics through legal action and called on people to respect the investigations, which they describe as Turkey's confrontation with undemocratic military practices.
Turkey is ranked 138th out of 178 countries in the ''world press freedom index'' issued by the Paris-based advocacy group Reporters Without Borders.
Turkish officials say that there are 27 journalists in jail, all because of crimes unrelated to their journalistic activities. That is in stark contrast to a list issued by the Freedom to Journalists Platform, a Turkish group, listing 68 journalists in jail on charges that it says violate freedom of expression, inciting public hatred.
The United States has also expressed concern over the recent reports on media oppression in Turkey and called for a transparent judicial process.

HEADLINE: Figure in Insider Case Sought to Quit Goldman

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Rajat K. Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs director accused by the government of passing insider information about the Wall Street firm, had tried to resign from the Goldman board in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis, only weeks before he is said to have provided the tips to the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam.
According to a new audiotape recording released by federal prosecutors late Friday, Mr. Gupta sought to leave the Goldman board to take a job as a senior adviser at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm led by Henry R. Kravis, a friend of Mr. Gupta's. 
The recording also suggests that Mr. Gupta may have been having personal troubles at the time he is accused of passing the tips. The tape offers an unusual window into Mr. Gupta's world during the time that the government says he tipped off Mr. Rajaratnam.
The case is being zealously tracked by corporate America's top echelon because of Mr. Gupta's deep connections at the highest levels: he ran McKinsey & Company, the prestigious consulting firm, for a decade and served on several prominent boards, including those of Procter & Gamble and AMR, the parent company of American Airlines.
On Sept. 9, 2008, Mr. Gupta submitted a formal resignation letter to Goldman, a person briefed on the recording said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But the firm's executives, including its chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, persuaded him to stay on the board because they thought that it would send the markets a bad message to have a director resign as a financial crisis was exploding.
Two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission contends, Mr. Gupta told Mr. Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathaway's $5 billion investment in Goldman before it was publicly announced the next day. The S.E.C. also says Mr. Gupta swapped confidential Goldman information with Mr. Rajaratnam two other times during 2008. In each case, Mr. Rajaratnam traded illegally on the tips, the S.E.C. says. A lawyer for Mr. Gupta has denied the charges.
Mr. Gupta eventually did not stand for re-election from Goldman's board and stepped down when his term ended in May 2010.
The news of Mr. Gupta's resignation letter to Goldman's board in 2008 was hinted at in the audiotape of a telephone conversation on Aug. 15, 2008, between Mr. Rajaratnam and Anil Kumar, both friends of Mr. Gupta's and confirmed by people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Kumar, a former executive at McKinsey, has pleaded guilty to insider trading and testified last week as a government witness in Mr. Rajaratnam's trial.
On the nine-minute call released by prosecutors, the two men discuss Mr. Gupta's family, Goldman, K.K.R. and his role as chairman of New Silk Route Partners, a private equity firm, which in some cases competes with Goldman for deals.
''Goldman is one board right,'' Mr. Rajaratnam says on the recording. ''And he's, you know, he's essentially an observer status, right? He's not in there, you know, rolling up his sleeves.'' Later he added: ''And the issue is the perceived conflict of interest.''
The two also suggest that one reason for Mr. Gupta's decision to leave the Goldman board in 2010 was a post he had taken at K.K.R. in 2008.
''But is it really that he was so greedy for the $12 million that K.K.R. has offered him?'' Mr. Kumar asks on the recording.
Mr. Rajaratnam said that ''he ran the numbers with me, right, it was about $5 million a year with upside.''
A K.K.R. spokesman said that Mr. Gupta worked for the firm as a senior adviser and the compensation numbers discussed by Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Kumar were inaccurate. Mr. Gupta stepped down as a K.K.R. adviser this month after the S.E.C.'s action against him.
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the recording.
Later in the conversation, Mr. Rajaratnam further speculates on why Mr. Gupta took the position at K.K.R. and decided to leave Goldman.
''My analysis of the situation is he's enamored with Kravis, and I think he wants to be in that circle,'' Mr. Rajaratnam says.
''That's a billionaire circle, right? Goldman is like the hundreds of millions circle, right?'' He added: ''And I think here he sees the opportunity to make $100 million over the next five years or 10 years without doing a lot of work.''
Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Kumar also seem worried about their friend.
''At some point, what I worry about is that there can be this massive implosion in him,'' Mr. Kumar said.
''He didn't seem comfortable,'' Mr. Rajaratnam said. ''He seemed like he was tormented, right?''
The second week of Mr. Rajaratnam's criminal insider trading trial begins on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. The first two minutes of the nine-minute recording were presented on Friday as evidence of insider trading in Mr. Rajaratnam's trial.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Possible Lesson From the Luddites

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON and LISA LEE

 BODY:
The British weavers known as the Luddites, who destroyed looms 200 years ago, thought rising unemployment within their ranks was because of machinery. But there's a case that inflation, money supply expansion, budget deficits and trade barriers were equally to blame. Maybe we haven't learned much in two centuries.
The Luddite riot on March 11, 1811, was an attack on wide knitting frames in the Nottinghamshire village of Arnold. The rioters' believed that their livelihoods had been endangered by a dumbing-down of their skilled work by automated looms. The riots spread to Manchester, a main cotton center, late in 1811. Prime Minister Spencer Perceval's government, which had a robust approach to public order, made frame-breaking a capital offense a year later; 17 offenders were eventually executed. After that, Luddite activity gradually faded out. 
The economic conditions facing the Luddites bear consideration today. Britain had been off the gold standard since 1797 and consequently suffered considerable inflation, with prices double in 1813 compared with 1793. Real interest rates were historically low. The yield on long-term British government Consols, the nearest equivalent of today's long-dated Treasury bonds, averaged below 5 percent, only 1 percent above the inflation rate. The Bullion Report of 1810, whose drafters included the economist David Ricardo and the monetarist Henry Thornton, specifically blamed excessive credit for inflation. Much of this credit was absorbed by the government, which ran a deficit of about 12 percent of the gross domestic product because of spending on the concurrent Napoleonic wars.
Of course, there were some large differences from today. A wartime trade embargo had cut off many European markets for British textiles. Nevertheless, the overall picture was one of cheap money leading to labor-saving capital investment, while inflation eroded wages and restrictions and excessive government deficits dampened economic activity.
The Luddites have been mocked for attacking the productivity-enhancing machinery that led to unprecedented improvements in living standards. But given the economic policies of the time -- which bear an uncomfortable resemblance to some of our own -- the Luddites were justified in believing that only higher unemployment, with no discernible improvement in conditions on the horizon, was their fate.
A Bargain Buyout?
Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm in Los Angeles, is cozying up to another buyout. Fresh off its participation in the unsavory yet successful takeover of the retailer J. Crew, Leonard Green is teaming up with owner-managers to buy the discount chain 99 Cents Only. The $1.3 billion bid offers a mere 14 percent premium. It seems to be another sweetheart deal in the making.
After the back-door dealings that marred the J. Crew acquisition, shareholders were left with only a fig leaf of a requirement that managers shop the company elsewhere. Shareholders won some minor concessions but voted to sell the company to TPG and Leonard Green, which hatched the deal with Millard Drexler, the J. Crew chief executive and a big shareholder.
Leonard Green is now looking for something cheaper but equally accessible, and 99 Cents Only is a prime candidate. It has strong cash flow and no debt except leases held off the balance sheet. And investors are starting to think bargain retail may have further to run. The investor Nelson Peltz tried to pounce on Family Dollar last month with an offer of up to $7.6 billion.
The 99 Cents Only chain has other attractions. Its headquarters are geographically close to Leonard Green's. And managers at 99 Cents Only have an outsize influence. The Schiffer-Gold family owns about a third of the company. David Gold is the chairman, Eric Schiffer is the chief executive and Jeff Gold the president and chief operating officer. The three men represent nearly half the seven-member board.
The independent directors could be easy targets, too. Two of them -- 80-year-old Marvin Holen and 76-year-old Lawrence Glascott -- have been sitting in the position for at least 15 years. Mr. Glascott was previously the company's accountant. The other two directors are also Los Angeles fixtures.
If shareholders are lucky, the mellow Southern California vibe won't affect the directors' critical thinking. Leonard Green's offer values the 99 Cents Only enterprise at just over seven times estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year to March 2012.
Family Dollar rejected something closer to nine times. Even the J. Crew deal, for all its shortcomings, provided shareholders a full price. Not everything at 99 Cents Only needs to be sold on the cheap.

HEADLINE: Premier Calls Mounting Crisis Worst Since World War II

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and MARK McDONALD; Martin Fackler reported from Sendai, Japan, and Mark McDonald from Tokyo. Moshe Komata and Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
SENDAI, Japan -- Japan reeled from a rapidly unfolding disaster of epic scale on Sunday, pummeled by the death toll, destruction and homelessness caused by the earthquake and tsunami and new hazards from damaged nuclear reactors that were leaking radiation. The prime minister called it Japan's worst crisis since World War II.
Japan's $5 trillion economy, the third largest in the world, was threatened with severe disruptions and partial paralysis as many industries shut down and the armed forces and volunteers mobilized for the far more urgent effort of finding survivors, evacuating residents near the stricken power plants and caring for the victims of the 8.9 magnitude quake that struck on Friday.
The disaster has left more than 10,000 people dead, many thousands homeless and millions without water, power, heat or transportation. 
The most urgent worries concerned the failures at two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where engineers were still struggling to avert meltdowns and where some radiation had already leaked. An explosion at one of the reactors on Monday did not appear to have harmed it, Japanese officials said.
Fukushima Daiichi and another power station, Fukushima Daiini, about 10 miles away, have been under a state of emergency since the quake. The collective anxiety about Japan caused a rout in the Japanese stock market on Monday morning, with the main index falling 5.5 percent, the worst drop in three years.
Worried about the severe strains on the banking and financial systems, the Bank of Japan pumped about $86 billion into the economy on Monday, and the government was discussing an emergency tax increase to help finance relief and recovery work.
The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the country's crippled nuclear power grid, announced a series of rotating blackouts to conserve electricity -- the first controlled power cuts in Japan in 60 years.
The death toll was certain to climb as searchers began to reach coastal villages that essentially vanished under the first muddy surge of the tsunami, which struck the nation's northern Pacific coast near the port city of Sendai. In one town alone, the port of Minamisanriku, a senior police official said the number of dead would ''certainly be more than 10,000.'' That is more than half the town's population of 17,000.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan told a news conference in Tokyo late Sunday: ''I think that the earthquake, tsunami and the situation at our nuclear reactors makes up the worst crisis in the 65 years since the war. If the nation works together, we will overcome.''
The government ordered 100,000 troops -- nearly half the country's active military force and the largest mobilization in postwar Japan -- to take part in the relief effort. An American naval strike group led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan also arrived off Japan on Sunday to help with refueling, supply and rescue duties.
The quake and tsunami did not reach Japan's industrial heartland, although economists said the power blackouts could affect industrial production -- notably carmakers, electronics manufacturers and steel plants -- and interrupt the nation's famously efficient supply chain. Tourism was also bound to plummet, as the United States, France and other nations urged citizens to avoid traveling to Japan.
AIR Worldwide, a risk consultant in Boston, said its disaster models estimated property damage to be as high as $35 billion. The company said 70 percent of residential construction in Japan was wood, and earthquake insurance was not widely used.
Amid the despair and the worry over an unrelenting series of strong aftershocks, there was one bright moment when the Japanese Navy rescued a 60-year-old man who had been floating at sea for two days.
The man, Hiromitsu Arakawa, clung to the roof of his tiny home in the town of Minamisoma after it was torn from its foundations by the first wave of the tsunami, the Defense Ministry said. He saw his wife slip away in the deluge, but he hung on as the house drifted away. He was discovered late Sunday morning, still on his roof, nine miles south of the town and nine miles out to sea.
The quake was the strongest to hit Japan, which sits astride the ''ring of fire'' that designates the most violent seismic activity in the Pacific Basin.
About 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate danger zones around the two compromised atomic facilities in Fukushima Prefecture. Japanese officials reported that 22 people showed signs of radiation exposure and as many as 170 were feared to have been exposed, including some who had been outside one of the plants waiting to be evacuated. Three workers were suffering what officials described as full-blown radiation sickness.
In a televised address the trade minister, Banri Kaieda, asked businesses to limit power use as they returned to operation on Monday. He asked specifically for nighttime cutbacks of lights and heating. The power company said the blackouts would affect three million customers, including homes and factories.
The Japan Railways Group cut operations at six of its commuters lines and two bullet trains to 20 percent of normal to conserve electricity.
Tokyo and central Japan continued to be struck by aftershocks off the eastern coast of Honshu Island. A long tremor registering 6.2 caused buildings in central Tokyo to sway dramatically on Sunday morning.
Search teams from more than a dozen nations were bound for Japan, including a unit from New Zealand, which suffered a devastating quake last month in Christchurch. A Japanese team that had been working in New Zealand was called home.
A combined search squad from Los Angeles County and Fairfax County, Va., arrived from the United States with 150 people and a dozen dogs that would help in the search for bodies.
Assistance teams were also expected from China and South Korea, two of Japan's most bitter rivals.
Tokyo's acceptance of help -- along with a parade of senior officials who offered updates at televised news conferences on Sunday -- was in marked contrast to the government's policies after the 1995 Kobe earthquake, which killed more than 6,000 people. Japan refused most offers of aid at the time, restricted foreign aid operations and offered little information about the disaster.
Here in Sendai, a city of roughly a million people near the center of the catastrophe, many buildings cracked but none had collapsed. Still, city officials said that more than 500,000 households and businesses were without water, and many more lacked electricity as well.
Soldiers surrounded Sendai's city hall, where officials were using two floors to shelter evacuees and treat the injured, using power drawn from a generator. Thousands of residents sought refuge inside and waited anxiously for word from their relatives. A line of people waited outside with plastic bottles and buckets in hand to collect water from a pump.
Masaki Kokubum, 35, has been living at the city hall since the quake. He had worked at a supermarket, and his neighborhood lost power and water. He said he had not slept in three days.
''I can't sleep,'' he said as he sat in a chair in a hallway. ''I just sit here and wait.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Community Left Devastated After Bus Crash

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Reporting was contributed by David W. Chen, Corey Kilgannon, Juliet Linderman, Mick Meenan, Colin Moynihan, Jeffrey E. Singer and Rebecca White.

 BODY:
The arc of some of their lives followed a common, defining narrative of the immigrant experience. Two of the men had worked in restaurants, one as a cook and the other as a waiter in Manhattan's Chinatown. Their wives had worked in garment factories. A fifth victim had worked for a grocery store, and lived in a Chinese enclave in Brooklyn.
They had all come here in pursuit of a better life, and decades later, had enough so they could retire, spend time with their families and take an occasional trip to the casinos. But their lives came to an abrupt, uncommon end: They were among the 14 passengers who were killed in the brutal crash of a bus this weekend as it returned at dawn to Chinatown from the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut. Besides those who died, 18 more were wounded, several of them critically.
The crash had a devastating effect on members of the city's Chinese population; if they did not know someone on the bus, they feared that they did. 
On Sunday, people visited two Bronx hospitals where the injured were taken and went to the morgue to identify the dead. Others crowded the Fifth Precinct station house in Chinatown seeking information.
A popular dry cleaning store on Madison Street in Chinatown failed to open on Saturday, and then again on Sunday, leaving customers and neighbors to wonder whether its owner was among the victims.
Complicating matters, some of the victims -- injured and dead alike -- still had not been identified by late Sunday, leaving city officials to wonder whether their relatives and friends were hesitating to step forward for fear of revealing their illegal immigration status, and prompting Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to issue a reassuring appeal.
''You should not worry about your documentation or anything like that,'' Mr. Bloomberg said after visiting some survivors at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx.
''The police don't ask that, but really do need help finding out who some of these people are.''
Law enforcement officials said they were still investigating the cause of the crash. The driver of the bus told investigators that he had lost control after a passing tractor-trailer on Interstate 95 clipped the bus. But passengers told the authorities that the driver had swerved several times before the bus toppled on its side, straying from the traffic lane and running over rumble strips at the highway's shoulder.
The bus skidded about 500 feet, first along a guardrail, before violently plowing into a support pole of a large highway sign. The pole sliced through the bus, shearing it in half and turning the vehicle into a bloody tableau of twisted metal and mangled bodies.
The driver, Ophadell Williams, was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx on Sunday, a hospital spokesman said. Two passengers were in serious condition there.
As investigators sought evidence of culpability, the Chinese population in New York was cast into a state of confusion and mourning.
Sai Ling, 57, lost her parents in the crash. Sitting in her apartment on the 31st floor of Confucius Plaza, an apartment complex in Chinatown, she frequently broke down in tears as she talked about her parents, both Chinese immigrants.
Her father, Kam Ng, 81, a retired restaurant cook, regularly visited Mohegan Sun, Ms. Ling said. He would often go on his gambling trips with friends; his wife, Yuk Ng, 79, a retired garment factory worker, preferred to stay at their home on Long Island and play mah-jongg.
But in recent weeks, Ms. Ng, who had sunk into a deep sadness after the death of her sister two months ago, had been regularly accompanying her husband on his casino jaunts.
''She was nice to everybody; he was very quiet, very traditional,'' Ms. Ling said. ''They were so sweet.''
As Ms. Ling spoke, the family's community rallied around. A steady stream of neighbors and friends arrived with food, and the phone rang frequently.
''She went, played at the casino, and died,'' Ms. Ling said. ''I think she's happy. She took him with her; they went together.''
At Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, six passengers were still in very critical condition, four of them on breathing equipment, hospital officials said. The patients were suffering a range of injuries, including head wounds, multiple bone fractures and even multiple amputations.
One patient, a 50-year-old man who had a breathing tube down his throat and was unable to speak, still remained unidentified on Sunday evening, officials said.
Among the dead in the crash on Saturday was another elderly couple: Thomas and Maylin Wong, who every Friday night left their modest fourth-floor apartment on Mott Street in Chinatown and walked two blocks to board the bus to Mohegan Sun, said Mokit Lee, 42, a niece of Ms. Wong. Mr. Wong was a retired waiter, his wife a retired factory worker in the garment district.
''There wasn't much else for them to do around here, so this was their entertainment,'' Ms. Lee said, standing outside the station house in Chinatown, where she stopped on Sunday, looking for information on her relatives. ''They weren't big gamblers -- just chump change -- but they enjoyed it.''
She and neighbors said the Wongs had lived most of their lives on Mott Street, raised two children and always took care of children in the extended family, including several grandchildren.
''My aunt had a bad knee, and we told her to stop going, but she wouldn't leave her husband's side,'' she said. She added, her voice somber: ''Now she'll never leave his side anymore.''
The accident will probably prompt renewed government scrutiny of the scores of short- and long-haul discount bus companies that operate out of Chinatown. The bus involved in the crash was owned by World Wide Tours, based in Gowanus, Brooklyn. The accident was the company's fourth recorded crash in as many years, records show.
Mr. Bloomberg said it was ''a constant battle'' for regulators to ensure that discount bus companies obey safety standards.
But in spite of the crash on Saturday, and the longstanding, mixed reputations of some of Chinatown's bus companies, the buses continued to depart on Sunday with many seats occupied.
Even one of the survivors of the crash was so undaunted by the experience that he hopped another bus to Mohegan Sun on Sunday.
Bernardo Garcia, 50, said he usually made the trip several times a week and was not going to let the accident stop him.
Another survivor, Chung H. Ninh, 59, an unemployed chef, had been planning to take the same bus route and head back to Mohegan Sun. But at dusk, he said he felt tired and would postpone the trip until another day.
''I'm not scared to go back,'' he said in an interview. Except for some scratches on his hand, there was little evidence that he had just survived a bus crash. ''I used to practice kung fu, and that's why I'm so strong.''
Anyway, he added, he lost $200 on Friday night and was down to his last $600. He wanted to win his money back.

HEADLINE: Auto Plants in Japan Remain Closed as Companies Take Stock

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
Most Japanese auto assembly plants will remain closed on Monday, even though the factories are outside the hardest-hit regions and did not experience significant damage from the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck on Friday.
Automakers scrambled on Sunday to determine whether they would be able to build and export cars in light of the rolling power blackouts (meant to conserve electricity) and the damage to Japan's infrastructure.
''There is no way to get our products out, even if we make them, with the roads and distribution system damaged,'' a spokeswoman for the Honda Motor Company, Natsuno Asanuma, told The Associated Press. 
The three major automakers -- Toyota, Nissan and Honda -- have American plants that produce most of the models they sell in the United States. But many luxury cars, like the Lexus, or the smaller, fuel-efficient cars, like the Toyota Prius and Honda Fit, are built in Japan, and disruptions in exports could cost the companies sales at a time when rising gasoline prices have increased demand in the United States.
For Toyota, the disaster comes as it is trying to recover after the recall of more than 14 million vehicles since 2009. Toyota built 3.3 million vehicles in Japan last year, about 43 percent of its global output, with more than half sent overseas.
A Toyota spokeswoman in New York, Mira Sleilati, said all of its plants in Japan would be closed Monday but that no information was available about supplies of the Prius or other Japanese-built models. Besides the nearly 141,000 Priuses exported and sold in the United States last year, Toyota sold more than 229,000 Lexuses, which were mostly built in Japan.
Earl Stewart, the owner of Earl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach, Fla., said demand for the Prius had surged so much that he recently sold out. He worries that Toyota might not be able to get many more to his dealership any time soon.
''I put used Priuses on my showroom floor because we don't have any new ones,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''The timing could not be worse. I don't know how long it will take to get the roads and ports cleaned up and get Priuses back on the ships.''
Toyota had planned to start building the Prius in the United States starting in 2010 but canceled those plans during the recession; instead it is readying a plant in Mississippi to assemble the Corolla, a compact sedan.
Other affected models are the Toyota Yaris, a subcompact, and the Scion xB and xD, which are small hatchbacks sold at Toyota dealerships.
Two plants that build the Yaris and Scion models are among four operated by Toyota subsidiaries that were damaged and had to be shut down. The plant that builds the Yaris was opened less than a month ago in Miyagi, an area north of Tokyo that suffered substantial damage.
Nissan built 1.13 million vehicles in Japan last year and Honda made fewer than a million, slightly more than a quarter of the vehicles they sell worldwide.
Honda said some plants would remain closed at least through Monday. Its dealers in the United States get more than 80 percent of their cars and trucks from North American plants. Several Honda hybrid models, including the Insight and CR-Z, and the Acura RL and TSX are made in Japan.
A Honda research and development center in Tochigi was damaged, causing the death of an employee, and it had to be closed.
Reuters reported that operations at the five assembly and parts plants for Subaru vehicles had also been halted.
Nissan said all of its plants in Japan would remain closed on Monday but that most appeared to have avoided major damage. Officials were evaluating the facilities and had not made a decision about when they would reopen. Nissan dealers are not expected to experience any immediate effects, but there could be supply problems for Infiniti, Nissan's luxury brand, which is built in Japan.
The tsunami destroyed 1,300 Nissan vehicles at the Port of Hitachi awaiting export to American dealers as well as 1,000 vehicles at a service center in Miyagi, said a spokeswoman in the United States, Katherine Zachary.
Cordy Cerami, the general manager at Infiniti of Montclair, a dealership outside Los Angeles, said: ''We were assured that the plants were intact, but the suppliers were unsure. We should know something Monday or Tuesday.''
Despite the uncertainty for his dealership, Mr. Cerami said, ''Our concern is for the people of Japan first and foremost.''

HEADLINE: Listen to Judge Lippman

 BODY:
Acknowledging New York's deep fiscal crisis, Judge Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief judge, has reluctantly agreed to make cuts in his $2.7 billion budget request, including a reduction in the number of people working for the court system. But he is refusing to back down on his call for a $25 million increase, to $40 million, in support for civil legal service programs that help low-income New Yorkers faced with foreclosures, evictions, domestic violence and other serious legal problems. 
His commitment comes at a time when Republicans in Washington are determined to slash the federal contributions to these essential programs.
Judge Lippman knows what he is up against politically but is undaunted. In a recent talk at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan, he described the shocking need for help out there -- and the cost to justice and the judicial system if it continues to go unmet.
He told of state courtrooms that are ''standing room only, filled with frightened, unrepresented litigants -- many of them newly indigent -- who are fighting to keep a roof over their heads, fighting to keep their children, fighting to keep their sources of income and health care.'' And he cited the astonishing fact that in New York City 99 percent of tenants in eviction cases and 99 percent of borrowers in consumer credit cases have no lawyers.
''What is at stake,'' he said, ''is nothing less than the legitimacy of our justice system,'' adding that the rule of law ''loses its meaning when the protection of our laws is available only to those who can afford it.''
Judge Lippman offered a final practical reason for increasing spending on civil legal services: preventing unwarranted evictions, avoiding foster care placements, helping clients get access to federal benefits and easing court delays will carry real economic benefits for the state. He is right on all counts. The Legislature should approve the increase.

HEADLINE: Adieu, Sweet Life Of '20s Luxury

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In its heyday, it was the epitome of an era that haunts us still as a fleeting moment of America on the cusp of something it never quite duplicated or achieved -- money with style, sin that seemed innocent, human-scale pleasures, a jazz-inflected version of the American dream minus today's cynicism and rust.
''Shakespeare-spouting poets and, when it came to that, Shakespeare-spouting pugilists might be seen there, milling and churning among senators, polo players, professional gamblers, Supreme Court justices, and horsy debutantes; the house was like a decompression chamber between social extremes,'' one of Herbert Bayard Swope's biographers wrote of the scene at Swope's Sands Point mansion on the North Shore of Long Island. 
There was croquet on the 13 acres of lawn, illumined by car headlights and parties at all hours for what Swope's wife, Margaret, described as ''an absolutely seething bordello of interesting people.'' They included Bernard Baruch, George Gershwin, Robert Moses, the Marx Brothers, Irving Berlin, Vanderbilts, Whitneys and Harrimans. It's the world F. Scott Fitzgerald captured in ''The Great Gatsby,''which still seems fresh and urgent almost -- remarkably -- a century later.
So it's no surprise that the world's Fitzgerald-ologists and experts on Long Island's faded luxe life are being besieged with queries about a 25-room, 20,000-square-foot Colonial Revival mansion called Lands End that is said, in part, to have inspired ''Gatsby,'' and is now facing demolition so the property can be subdivided for five more modest houses, at $10 million or so each.
In truth, many homes in both Sands Point and Kings Point -- the first Fitzgerald's old-money East Egg, the second his nouveau riche West Egg -- inspired ''Gatsby'' during the period from 1922 to 1924, when Fitzgerald lived in what his wife, Zelda, described as ''our nifty little Babbitt-home at Great Neck.'' Fitzgerald spent the time drinking himself blind, spending money he didn't have, and oh, yes, writing much of what is still the prime contender for the Great American Novel.
But few houses defined the era as much as the home built in 1902 and later owned by Swope, editor of The New York World and, in parts, the Tina Brown or Rupert Murdoch of his day.
According to Ruth Prigozy, an English professor at Hofstra University and executive director of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Society, Fitzgerald and his friend Ring Lardner used to gaze across Manhasset Bay at the property, much as Gatsby did, pining for Daisy. So the house was at once the inspiration for Daisy's old-money preserve in East Egg and the Swope parties a model for the revels at Gatsby's house in West Egg.
Perhaps 500 of the grandest mansions have already been knocked down, said Monica Randall, who has chronicled the era and its architectural heritage. So the demolition of Lands End is just one last domino falling from a long-gone era. And yet, the gravitational pull of Gatsby's world endures, undimmed.
Dan McCall, a professor emeritus at Cornell University, taught the book for 40 years. He marvels at the hold Gatsby still has on students. On the one hand, he said, with its hypnotic prose, its layers of longing for money, status, reinvention and love, it's still channeling the American experience. ''It's not an antique to them, it's never gone out of style the way some books I teach.'' On the other hand, he said, Gatsby's evocation of the American dream has an innocence and passion that are impossibly distant, like astral material from a lost galaxy. ''Gatsby's dream, the way he's so devoted to it, that's not something you find much in this economy, at this time. I think it's breathtaking for kids in college. It's an America they haven't heard about from their parents.''
Of course, Gatsby's dream was built on deceit and illusion. The Roaring '20s ended in the Great Depression. Fitzgerald burned out and died at 44.
Still, like the old ruined mansion, he did capture something epic and elusive in American life. So there's yet another Gatsby film coming -- starring Leonardo DiCaprio -- in 3D! If Gatsby were around today, maybe he'd be Bernie Madoff or one of the other swindlers of Wall Street fallen to earth. Maybe there's something of him in Mark Zuckerberg, concocting his virtual social network with no need for the grand mansion or the seething bordello.
Maybe someone will write today's ''Gatsby.'' Or maybe it would just be an epic tweet: ''Yo, Gatz. Blue lawn, green light, so close, but too far. Ahh, Daisy. We beat on, boats vs. the current, borne back, lol, into the past.''

HEADLINE: Amazon Pressured On Sales Tax

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Across the country, state officials struggling with big budget shortfalls are trying to get Amazon.com to take on a role it does not want: tax collector.
Amazon's skirmishes with states over whether it should collect sales taxes have been an ongoing battle. But the fighting has recently escalated, coinciding with the economic woes that have left a number of states struggling with multibillion-dollar deficits, and looking for money wherever they can find it.
Last Thursday, Gov. Pat Quinn, Democrat of Illinois, signed a law that compels online retailers that work with affiliates in his state to collect sales tax on purchases by residents.
Affiliates are partner sites that earn commissions by advertising or linking to an online retailer's products, sending traffic that way. Lawmakers in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Minnesota and Vermont have introduced similar legislation. 
Amazon, based in Seattle, is fighting back. It vehemently opposes the legislative efforts, and in letters to state officials, has called the provisions unconstitutional and counterproductive.
''We play by the same rules as other retailers, as the national chains collect online only for states where they have physical stores,'' Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president for public policy, said in a statement.
Meanwhile, last fall, Texas officials sent Amazon a tax bill for $269 million, after determining that the retailer's Dallas-area warehouse, owned by a subsidiary, qualified as a local address under state tax rules. Amazon had argued for years that without stores and offices in the state, it had no obligation to collect sales tax there. The dispute is to be decided in a coming administrative hearing.
In retaliation for Texas's move, Amazon said last month that it would close the warehouse next month and cancel plans to build another.
''It's a time-honored custom to not pay taxes,'' said Susan Combs, the Texas comptroller. ''A lot of people try not to, but it's up to the state to make sure that there's tax fairness.''
The new laws are intended to help fill state coffers as lawmakers are being forced to cut funding to education, Medicaid and public safety. The changes are also promoted as leveling the playing field between online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores, which must tack on an extra 8 percent in most states, give or take, to the price of every transaction.
A state can compel companies to collect taxes only if they have a physical presence in the state, or a nexus, as the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota in 1992. Absent a nexus, online retailers and mail-order companies can sell products without collecting the tax.
What many people fail to realize, however, is that the tax is still due. Residents are supposed to self-report what they owe in their annual state tax filing, but most people do not.
State officials have long lamented the shortfall and sought ways to collect a bigger portion by using a mix of education and threats. California, for instance, expects to be shortchanged $1.15 billion in 2010 from e-commerce and catalog sales, according to estimates from the state Board of Equalization.
The only way to close that gap is for online retailers and others to start collecting sales tax, said Betty T. Yee, a member of California's Board of Equalization.
''There seems to be a groundswell of activity by other states that suggest that the time is right,'' she said.
Eliminating the tax gap would provide more than enough money to offset proposed cuts to California's universities or to its programs for the developmentally disabled. But Ms. Yee said any law would most likely be challenged in court and would therefore be unlikely to lift state revenue for some time.
Amazon collects sales tax in only five states -- Kansas, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota and Washington -- where it has offices or another physical presence.
It avoids collecting in several other states where it has warehouses by assigning their ownership to a subsidiary. Until the tax dispute in Texas, Amazon had encountered few problems with that arrangement.
Now, though, as Amazon seeks to open warehouses in South Carolina and Tennessee, it is also pressing for specific legislation to exempt it from collecting sales tax, using the jobs created by the facilities as leverage.
But the company is running into some resistance. For example, in Tennessee officials canceled a hearing last month about adjusting tax rules after the governor imposed a 45-day moratorium on new regulations. In South Carolina, legislation that had exempted Amazon from collecting tax has expired; it is unclear whether it will be renewed or not.
''The governor is taking a hard look at the issues surrounding Amazon,'' said Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina's governor, Nikki Haley. ''Economic development and job creation are two of her highest responsibilities and priorities, and while the governor wants to make sure we keep promises made to companies, she also wants to make sure we are being fair to the companies that we already have in this state.''
Amazon's fight in California, as in Illinois and other states, revolves around its affiliates. Lawmakers are trying to broaden the definition of physical presence in the state to include partner sites of all retailers, not just Amazon.
Amazon's response in California, as in other states, has been to threaten to sever ties with affiliates if such laws are passed. In that way, the company can circumvent any sale tax requirements.
It took the first step to carry out the threat in Illinois last week, saying it would eliminate its affiliate program there on April 15. Amazon has previously dropped affiliates in Rhode Island, North Carolina and Colorado under similar circumstances.
George Runner, a member of California's Board of Equalization, which collects several kinds of taxes, said changing tax laws would end up hurting Amazon's 10,000 affiliates in the state. Amazon would simply continue selling products directly from its Web site or through out-of-state affiliates, without having to collect tax on the government's behalf, he said.
California would end up with no extra money, Mr. Runner said, despite predictions otherwise. In fact, it may get less considering the financial damage done to Amazon's affiliates.
''If the argument is revenue, we don't believe it will happen,'' Mr. Runner said.
Amazon is challenging the legality of a New York law enacted in 2008 that requires it to collect taxes based on its affiliates. The case is currently in the state appeals court.
Meanwhile, New York collected $70 million in sales tax from online retailers, including Amazon, for fiscal year 2009-10, according to the state Department of Taxation and Finance.
Despite its protests to collecting the sales tax, Amazon supports a streamlined system simplifying the current hodgepodge of state and local levies. But a streamlined system, which has the support of two dozen states, requires Congressional action.
Traditional retailers like Sears, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy and Wal-Mart applaud efforts to require Amazon to collect sales tax. They call it a matter of fairness because their stores do.
''I think it puts all retailers at a disadvantage,'' William R. Harker, senior vice president at Sears Holdings, said of Amazon's sales tax obligations. ''What we and other retailers are looking for is for the playing field to be level.''

HEADLINE: By Asking for Less, Obama May Reap More

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
The biggest difference in this new phase of Barack Obama's presidency: he's not so needy.
During 2009-10, President Obama needed a lot from Congress: a $787 billion stimulus package to counter the economic crisis, a financial regulation overhaul to prevent the next one and big health care and energy programs to fulfill his vision for future growth.
Now, by circumstance and by choice, he doesn't. 
The new Republican House won't give Mr. Obama what he wants on issues like energy or immigration, anyway. And if he fails to win scaled-back versions of his priorities, his aides can blame a divided Congress more easily than a Democratic one, they figure.
The only thing Mr. Obama truly needs - a spending deal to keep the government running - is as important to Republicans as to the White House. If that limits Mr. Obama's policy horizons, it also liberates him from the vote-wheedling that sometimes undercut his pledge to change Washington.
Instead, the president and his aides are pursuing education, energy and economic goals through methods over which they have more control: trade promotion, other executive and regulatory authority, and use of the bully pulpit.
''They have a new orientation,'' said John Podesta, who directed Mr. Obama's presidential transition and remains close to top White House officials. ''It's less about talking back to Congress, and more about getting stuff done.''
Whether it will work, as a matter of substance or politics, remains an open question.
The Rhythms of Office
In large part, Mr. Obama is accommodating the tidal rhythms that buffet every president. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, too, saw their partisan and ideological waves crest soon after taking office, then recede after midterm election setbacks.
Presidents Reagan and Clinton navigated those shifts without losing the ability to advance their goals - or win re-election. Jimmy Carter and the first President George Bush couldn't.
The most visible White House adjustment is the effort to communicate more coherently about the public's dominant concerns: economic recovery.
That means traveling more consistently to carry his message of ''winning the future'' outside Washington - to Cleveland, Miami and Boston in the last three weeks.
It means providing access to the president more selectively. ''He's done a bit more regional and local level'' media interviews instead of national ones, said Martha Joynt Kumar, a scholar who tracks presidential communication.
And it means, as much as possible, repeating the president's State of the Union exhortation for students, teachers, scientists and business executives to ''out-innovate, outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world.''
Aides for previous presidents call it a sensible adjustment to reduced clout on Capitol Hill. ''Hammering home megathemes that are important to people outside Washington,'' said Dan Bartlett, communications director to President George W. Bush, ''is a good communications strategy.''
But Mr. Bartlett cautioned that ''they're not going to see the needle moving'' on public opinion unless they stick with their strategy for months. A fractured, frenetic news media environment makes patience more difficult.
So do events that presidents can't control, like unrest across the Middle East and an accompanying rise in gas prices for American consumers. Even with unemployment falling to 8.9 percent last month, polls show those events have eroded some of Mr. Obama's gains since the midterm elections.
Shifting the Tone
Last week, Mr. Obama used his bully pulpit on an unconventional issue reminiscent of how Mr. Clinton promoted uniforms for schoolchildren and anticrime neighborhood watch groups. He hosted a White House event on preventing bullying in schools and elsewhere.
Some conservatives grumbled. But Mr. Obama's aides watched the Internet hits pile up via Facebook and child-rearing Web sites and counted it a success in breaking through to average Americans.
''It takes them completely out of the treacherous and poisonous Washington partisanship, and he gets to be president of all the people,'' said Mr. Podesta, who served as Mr. Clinton's White House chief of staff. ''Michele Bachmann may make fun of him, but who cares?''
Democrats care more about the president's aloofness from their budget battles with Republicans on Capitol Hill. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia publicly blistered Mr. Obama last week for having ''failed to lead.''
Sometimes the president's posture has been notable for its audacity. He chided Congressional Democrats last week for having insisted on their ''100 percent maximal position'' in budget negotiations - when what they insisted on was actually the administration's position.
Obama aides calculate that distance now will enhance the president's ability to shape a compromise later. ''Don't play every card until you have to play it,'' agreed Mike McCurry, Mr. Clinton's onetime press secretary.
But White House officials also know that Mr. Obama's success will turn far more on the robustness of economic recovery than on how they talk about it.
''If you don't have the substance,'' Mr. Podesta said, ''the communication won't work.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 520 Miles of Waterfront To Get Long-Range Plan

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Less than five years ago, preservationists criticized the Bloomberg administration for allowing Ikea to pave over a dock for repairing ships in Red Hook, Brooklyn. They said city officials had forsaken New York's working waterfront by catering to developers of hangar-size stores and luxury condominiums.
But now some of those same critics are praising Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city leaders for assembling a long-term plan that gives some leeway to the maritime industry while trying to lure New Yorkers to the water's edge -- and, in many places, onto the water itself, in kayaks and boats. 
On Monday, the mayor and Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, are to release to the public the first comprehensive, 10-year plan for the development of the city's 520 miles of shoreline.
The plan, which was required by a bill Ms. Quinn sponsored and the Council passed in 2008, makes clear that cleaning up and redeveloping the waterfront is a priority of Mr. Bloomberg's that he hopes will be a part of his legacy.
The plan does not call for significant new city or state spending, Ms. Quinn said in an interview. Instead, it is an effort to consolidate all of the projects already proposed or under way to make the rivers, bays and shoreline more integral to daily life and commerce in the city.
''This plan gives us the opportunity to look and see where we have really capitalized on this asset and where we haven't,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''If we hadn't done this plan, we wouldn't as clearly know that 13,000 jobs are supported by the maritime industry.''
Robert K. Steel, the deputy mayor for economic development, said that all the ''waterfront projects together are a priority.'' That means that plans for dozens of parks and piers along the rivers would no longer be considered individually but as a whole, which could protect them in times of cost-cutting, Mr. Steel said.
The same goes for what is left of industry along the water. The report notes that, along with employing some 13,000 people, waterfront businesses, using tugboats and barges to move goods and materials around the harbor, reduce truck traffic in the city. Mr. Steel said there was enough space for all the competing users, like private builders, longshoremen and canoeing enthusiasts.
Along with the 10-year plan, Mr. Bloomberg is releasing an ''action agenda'' of projects scheduled to start in the three years left of his third term in office. Those plans, which include finishing the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the East River Esplanade, will cost more than $700 million, all of which has already been allocated, a spokesman for the mayor said. Separately, about $1.6 billion in improvements to the city's wastewater treatment plants should help reduce pollution in the waterways, the report says.
Roland Lewis, chief executive of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, which represents groups with commercial and recreational interests along the waterfront, said, ''The city has come a long way from when we were paving over that graving dock in Red Hook where Ikea was built.''
Mr. Lewis, whose organization sued to save the dock beneath Ikea, likened its loss to the role that the destruction of the original Pennsylvania Station played in the city's preservation movement. ''It was sort of a wake-up moment,'' Mr. Lewis said, adding that the dock still existed under the Ikea parking lot and could be uncovered and used again someday.
Mr. Lewis said the recession that slammed the brakes on a lot of building plans also helped the alliance's cause. ''The economy,'' he said, put the brakes ''on some of the waterfront development that was going forward at breakneck speed.''
''There was a little bit of kismet,'' he added, ''that the call for a re-evaluation of the waterfront happened at this moment.''
What was crucial, Mr. Lewis said, was for all of the city, state and federal agencies that have some say over what happens in, on and around the city's waterways to work more cooperatively. If that can be done, he said, then Mr. Bloomberg ''could rightfully be called the waterfront mayor.''
Still, Mr. Lewis added: ''We want to see him do more, faster and better. But when we look back in 20 years, I think we'll say this is one of the great legacies of his administration.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Nuclear Push May Be in Peril

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Kareem Fahim contributed reporting from Benghazi, Libya, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Tripoli, Libya.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The fragile bipartisan consensus that nuclear power offers a big piece of the answer to America's energy and global warming challenges may have evaporated as quickly as confidence in Japan's crippled nuclear reactors.
Until this weekend, President Obama, mainstream environmental groups and large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed that nuclear power offered a steady energy source and part of the solution to climate change, even as they disagreed on virtually every other aspect of energy policy. Mr. Obama is seeking tens of billions of dollars in government insurance for new nuclear construction, and the nuclear industry in the United States, all but paralyzed for decades after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, was poised for a comeback.
Now, that is all in question as the world watches the unfolding crisis in Japan's nuclear reactors and the widespread terror it has spawned.
''I think it calls on us here in the U.S., naturally, not to stop building nuclear power plants but to put the brakes on right now until we understand the ramifications of what's happened in Japan,'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut and one of the Senate's leading voices on energy, said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' 
Nuclear power, which still suffers from huge economic uncertainties and local concerns about safety, had been growing in acceptance as what appeared to many to be a relatively benign, proven and (if safe and permanent storage for wastes could be arranged) nonpolluting source of energy for the United States' future growth.
But even staunch supporters of nuclear power are now advocating a pause in licensing and building new reactors in the United States to make sure that proper safety and evacuation measures are in place. Environmental groups are reassessing their willingness to see nuclear power as a linchpin of any future climate change legislation. Mr. Obama still sees nuclear power as a major element of future American energy policy, but he is injecting a new tone of caution into his endorsement.
''The president believes that meeting our energy needs means relying on a diverse set of energy sources that includes renewables like wind and solar, natural gas, clean coal and nuclear power,'' said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. ''Information is still coming in about the events unfolding in Japan, but the administration is committed to learning from them and ensuring that nuclear energy is produced safely and responsibly here in the U.S.''
Three of the world's chief sources of large-scale energy production -- coal, oil and nuclear power -- have all experienced eye-popping accidents in just the past year. The Upper Big Branch coal mine explosion in West Virginia, the Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the unfolding nuclear crisis in Japan have dramatized the dangers of conventional power generation at a time when the world has no workable alternatives able to operate at sufficient scale.
The policy implications for the United States are vexing. ''It's not possible to achieve a climate solution based on existing technology without a significant reliance on nuclear power,'' said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington and an energy and climate change adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign. ''It's early to reach many conclusions about what happened in Japan and the relevance of what happened to the United States. But the safety of nuclear power will certainly be high on the list of questions for the next several months.''
''The world is fundamentally a set of relative risks,'' Mr. Grumet added, noting the confluence of disasters in coal mining, oil drilling and nuclear plant operations. ''The accident certainly has diminished what had been a growing impetus in the environmental community to support nuclear power as part of a broad bargain on energy and climate policy.''
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said that the United States should not overreact to the Japanese nuclear crisis by clamping down on the domestic industry indefinitely. Republicans have loudly complained that the Obama administration did just that after the BP oil spill last spring when it imposed a moratorium on deepwater oil drilling until new safety and environmental rules were written.
''I don't think right after a major environmental catastrophe is a very good time to be making American domestic policy,'' Mr. McConnell said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
He said that the American public and politicians had recoiled after Three Mile Island, rejecting permits for the construction of dozens of nuclear plants on the ''not in my backyard'' impulse.
''My thought about it is, we ought not to make American and domestic policy based upon an event that happened in Japan,'' Mr. McConnell said.
Mr. Obama has been as supportive of nuclear power as any recent president as he has tried to devise a political and technical strategy for ensuring energy supplies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power, along with expanded offshore oil drilling, ''clean coal'' development and extensive support for renewable energy, are part of his ''all-of-the-above energy strategy,'' an approach and terminology borrowed from Republicans. But his support for coal and oil as part of a grand compromise on energy were set back by last year's mining and drilling disasters, and today's problems with nuclear in Japan cannot help.
Concerns about earthquakes and nuclear power have been around for a long time; new questions might also be raised now about tsunamis and coastal reactors.
In Mr. Obama's State of the Union address and in his budget, he proposed an expansion of nuclear energy technology and $36 billion in Department of Energy loan guarantees for the construction of as many as 20 new nuclear plants.
That policy will be on the table at a hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, when Steven Chu, the energy secretary, and Gregory B. Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, are scheduled to testify.
''We will use that opportunity to explore what is known in the early aftermath of the damage to Japanese nuclear facilities,'' said Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, the committee chairman, ''as well as to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the safety of U.S. nuclear sites.''
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a skeptic of nuclear power who nonetheless supported expansion of nuclear power as part of the House energy and climate legislation he co-sponsored, said the United States needed tougher standards for siting and operating nuclear plants.
He said regulators should consider a moratorium on locating nuclear plants in seismically active areas, require stronger containment vessels in earthquake-prone regions and thoroughly review the 31 plants in the United States that use similar technology to the crippled Japanese reactors. ''The unfolding disaster in Japan must produce a seismic shift in how we address nuclear safety here in America,'' Mr. Markey said.

HEADLINE: Defying the Economics of Baseball

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Jonah Keri, the author of a new book about the Tampa Bay Rays, talks about the team's Wall Street owners and its surprising recent success.

 BODY:
Jonah Keri is a former stock-market columnist for Investor's Business Daily and now a writer for The Wall Street Journal and FanGraphs. He's the author of a new book, "The Extra 2%: How Wall Street Strategies Took a Major League Baseball Team From Worst to First," about the Tampa Bay Rays. 
In 2005, a group of investment bankers with little baseball experience took over the Rays and have since turned the team into one of the sport's best. (For more on the Rays and their owners, you can read Landon Thomas's 2006 article from The Times.)
My conversation with Mr. Keri follows.
So how did the Rays (with a 2010 payroll of about $72 million) finish ahead of the Yankees (2010 payroll: $206 million) and Red Sox (2010 payroll: $162 million) in two of the last three seasons? What is their edge -- the "extra 2 percent" in your title?
Mr. Keri: The Rays look for that extra 2 percent absolutely everywhere. There are all the basic baseball ideas, of course. They dream up ways to build an optimal lineup and they put relief pitchers in position to succeed against certain types of hitters, just like every other team does. But in the Rays' case, they go much deeper. The manager, Joe Maddon, is more open-minded and intellectually curious than any other manager in baseball. He regularly meets with the "quant guys" in the organization, and is willing to make substantive, enduring changes based on their input.
One great example is something called the Danks Theory. It's named after a left-handed pitcher named John Danks, a change-up specialist who's often tougher against right-handed hitters than left-handers, which is unusual in baseball. Erik Neander, the team's co-head of R.&D. (the fact that the Rays even have an R.&D. division, as if they're Google or Apple, says a lot), met with Maddon and suggested that the Rays start same-handed hitters against pitchers like Danks. And it worked. Maybe strategies like these amount to two or three wins a season. But when you're competing against the two biggest, baddest, richest teams in the sport in the Yankees and Red Sox, every little edge counts.It's really much more than an on-field idea, though. For instance, the Rays hold more postgame concerts than any other team in baseball. There are some fairly significant costs to staging a concert, but they've crunched the numbers and found that the attendance boost makes it well worth the added cost, and hassle. The Rays also offer free parking for carpools of a certain size; that has the double effect of enticing extra fans to the park and making sure the roads and parking lots around the stadium aren't painfully crowded.
People have asked me, "What do the Rays do that absolutely no one else does?" It's tough to pinpoint one thing. But it's that collection of 2 percent edges that adds up to a lot -- in this case, two AL East titles in the past three years, and a ball club whose franchise value has skyrocketed in the five-and-a-half years since Stuart Sternberg and his partners took over.
Can you think of any similar situations in the stock market or finance generally or the economy? That is, are there forces we know are hugely important even if we don't yet know -- or are still learning -- how to measure them?
Mr. Keri: The thing about the Rays, or any baseball team worth its salt, is that they're two steps ahead of whatever new measures people are discussing in public -- even ahead of some of the best think tanks like FanGraphs or Baseball Prospectus. A financial world comparison would be how the stock market responds to economic conditions well before those conditions are obvious to the masses. The Dow hit bottom in early 2009, then started this huge uptrend that's still going strong today. At the time the market hit bottom, everything looked terrible. Unemployment was rising, the housing market looked awful, and of course we were just coming off a Wall Street meltdown that, were it not for government intervention, might have torpedoed the entire world economy. But the market sees things that you and I can't. 
Mr. Keri: There are many reasons not to move the Rays out of St. Petersburg. For one, the team has seen marked improvement in attendance over the past three seasons, as compared to the franchise's down years. For another, there may be reason to believe attendance will continue to improve in the ensuing seasons, as casual fans finally come around to the idea that the team doesn't stink anymore, and more importantly, as local unemployment retreats from 12 percent, which ranks among the highest in the nation.
If you want to specifically discuss the ones you mention: San Jose might get the Oakland A's soon anyway, at least as soon as Major League Baseball relaxes its asinine territorial rules (which give the San Francisco Giants the right to veto an A's move to San Jose). Portland has been down this road several times with no success, and it just lost its Triple-A team. It's tough to see Portland suddenly turning around and packing a big league ballpark.
Mr. Keri: The Pirates and Royals are actually on the right track; you just have to squint a bit to see it. The major publications unanimously voted the Royals' farm systems to be the league's best this year. The Pirates, meanwhile, own a strong core of young hitters already on the major league roster, with a pair of front-line pitchers drafted out of high school with the potential to help down the road. So yes, basic, meat-and-potatoes scouting and player development should play a pivotal role in both teams' potential revival.
Beyond that, both the Pirates and Royals need to keep their eyes open for opportunities to gain those 2 percent advantages. The core of the Rays' roster right now isn't just David Price, Evan Longoria and other high draft picks turned homegrown stars. It's Ben Zobrist and Dan Johnson and Joel Peralta and yes, even Manny Ramirez -- players acquired for substantially less than market value, at just the right time. Even the best farm system in the game won't be enough to make the Royals a World Series team; they'll need to aggressively seek out those other opportunities.
There is one other ray of hope (so to speak) for Pirates and Royals fans, though. They don't play in the American League East, where the Yankees and Red Sox will continue to be nightmares every year, the Toronto Blue Jays are underrated and even the Baltimore Orioles are pointed in the right direction. It might be time for Major League Baseball to abolish the divisions all together and create balanced schedules across the board. On the other hand, by leaving the divisions intact, it would be that much sweeter if the underdog Rays toppled their loaded opponents and shocked the world yet again.

HEADLINE: A Question of Savings (2 Letters)

 BODY:
A Question of Savings
To the Editor:
John Tierney's column ''When Energy Efficiency Sullies the Environment'' (Findings, March 8) misses the well-established point that energy efficiency represents the most cost-effective way to reduce energy use and pollution while making our economy grow and creating new jobs.
While there is some of evidence of limited ''rebound effects'' -- people might drive a little farther with a more fuel-efficient car -- research shows that even after accounting for such effects, 70 to 90 percent of the energy savings are still realized. And saving money by saving energy means we have more money to spend on the things we want.
There are two problems with Mr. Tierney's assumption that money saved by energy-efficient cars, buildings and industrial processes will be spent in ways that consume more energy. First, advanced economies like the United States are approaching saturation in many energy-intensive activities; no matter how efficient our car is, there are limits to how much driving we can do. 
Second, our economy is growing not principally by using more energy and materials, but rather with sophisticated designs and services that add more value to energy and materials.
I do agree with Mr. Tierney's main conclusion: that we need to create a stable, long-term market signal to drive investments in clean energy. In the meantime, we also need to continue advancing research, standards and policies that will support efforts around the world to reduce energy waste, save consumers money, and ensure cleaner air and water and a healthier planet.

To the Editor:
John Tierney suggests that energy efficiency standards for washing machines have forced consumers to pay top dollar for a front-loading washer, or settle for a more affordable top-loading model that performs badly.
Since our data were cited, we'd like to set the record straight. We found that some top-loading washers were poor performers, but a vast majority (76 out of 82 tested) scored ''good,'' ''very good'' or ''excellent,'' with only 6 scoring ''fair'' or ''poor'' on wash performance. A dozen recommended top-loading models sell for as little as $500.
Front-loading washers generally performed better than top-loading machines, but many of these washers were still relatively affordable, with several between $550 and $650. Consumers can buy quality washing machines at an affordable price or buy high-end products at a higher price. Either way, they're saving on energy and water consumption, thanks to energy efficiency standards, which can help us transition to a cleaner economy in the most cost-effective and affordable manner for consumers.
Shannon Baker-Branstetter

The writer is a policy counsel for Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.
John Tierney replies: In my column, I compared a 1996 Consumer Reports article on washing machines with one published in this year's March issue. In 1996, the magazine listed 18 top-loaders and recommended them all: 13 were ''excellent'' for cleaning, the highest rating, and the other five were ''very good.'' In this year's article, only four of the 31 ''best choices from our tests'' were top-loaders, and none of them received ''excellent'' ratings for cleaning.
In its 2007 article on washing machines, Consumer Reports itself noted: ''Not so long ago you could count on most washers to get your clothes very clean. Not anymore. Our latest tests found huge performance differences among machines.'' The magazine attributed the problem to the new federal requirements to save energy.
Calling All Lefties
To the Editor:
Re ''On the Left Hand, Answers Aren't Easy'' (18 and Under, March 8): As we learn more about left-handedness, old stigmas and misperceptions continue to fade. No longer, I'm reasonably sure, do schools try to make young children write with their right hand. That was what was attempted in my case, but my mother marched into the public school principal's office and told her, so to speak, ''Hands off!'' -- so a southpaw I have remained.
Yet the stigma is still there, and it carries over to other languages. Accordingly, from the French, one is considered ''gauche'' or ''maladroit'' when exhibiting clumsiness. It gets worse. In Italian, the word for left is ''sinistre.'' I'm sure there are other examples, and every one of them deserves to be banished by anybody in his or her right mind.
Ed Grimm
New York
To the Editor:
If only 10 percent of the population is left-handed, why did evolution select a preference for right-handedness? In a fascinating 1983 essay, ''The Throwing Madonna,'' William H. Calvin proposed that our ancestors developed a preference for throwing with their right arm because it had survival value, whereas throwing with the left arm did not.
His argument goes something like this: Throwing stones was an effective technique for hunting small animals. Women not only had to hunt for food, but they also had to care for their infants. Infants cry, which is not a good thing when you are trying to sneak up on an animal, but they can be soothed by the sound of their mother's heartbeat (this has been confirmed in several laboratory studies).
Holding infants with the left arm places them nearer to the sound of their mother's beating heart, keeping the infant quiet, and freeing the right arm for throwing (even today, women, but not men, are more likely to carry their infants with their left arm). Thus, mothers who were genetically predisposed to throw with their right arm were more successful hunters than mothers who held their infants with the right arm and threw with their left, and they survived to pass their right-armed preference on to their offspring.

You Can Say That Again
To the Editor:
As you aptly noted in ''Aging: Hearing Loss Is Common but Often Ignored'' (Vital Signs, March 8), the use of hearing aids in older adults is abysmally low. While nearly two-thirds of adults over 70 have hearing loss, only 40 percent of those with a moderate loss use hearing aids, and incredibly, only 3 percent of those with a mild loss do, according to the recently published study.
Even a mild loss will significantly impair an individual's ability to communicate and stay connected, and hearing aids help tremendously. How many elderly people given diagnoses of cognitive decline when the problem is that they simply can't hear? We believe that the first part of any cognitive evaluation for an adult must be a hearing test.

Studying a Fatigue Illness
To the Editor:
In ''Defining an Illness Is Fodder for Debate'' (March 8), your reporter David Tuller correctly noted that the way an illness is defined can often determine what is found in studies of it. He also suggested that this problem of definition had limited the interpretation of our trial of treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome, published recently in The Lancet. That is not the case.
The patients in this trial had a disabling chronic illness in which fatigue was their main symptom and for which no alternative had been found; that is the definition of the syndrome used in Britain. But we also assessed trial participants to see if they met two other definitions of the illness that are favored by some scientists.
We found that both cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise therapy, when added to specialist medical care, were most effective not only in the whole sample but also in the participants who met these alternative criteria. In addition, these treatments were the most effective whether or not a patient was depressed, a not uncommon accompaniment to this chronic and misunderstood illness. The trial also found that these treatments were safe so long as they were provided by appropriate therapists trained to help patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
So to Mr. Tuller's question ''Does the evidence from that study prove that these strategies would help patients identified as having chronic fatigue syndrome through very different criteria?,'' the answer is ''Yes, it does.'' Patients and their doctors now have robust evidence that there are two safe treatments that can improve both symptoms and quality of life, however the illness is defined.

The writers are the principal investigators of the PACE trial.
David Tuller replies: The article asked whether findings among a population defined by one set of criteria would apply to populations defined by ''very different criteria.'' In this study, all participants were first defined, identified and selected not by different criteria but by the same criteria, the so-called Oxford criteria used in Britain. Subgroups within that already screened population who also meet secondary criteria are not easily compared to patients who have not been screened, since an unknown number who met the secondary criteria might not have met the study's criteria for inclusion. The gold standard for making comparisons across groups of patients identified by three varying case definitions would be a study with three completely separate cohorts, not one large sample with two embedded subgroups.

HEADLINE: In Japan, a Disaster on Many Fronts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Japan Reels as Toll Rises and Nuclear Risks Loom'' (front page, March 14):
There is no question that ''one picture is worth a thousand words,'' and your front-page photo of a lone Japanese woman surrounded by mounds of incredible rubble undeniably makes that point.
The devastation in northeastern Japan is so horrific that it seems surreal. The Japanese may never know how many people died in this horrible earthquake and tsunami, and the cost of this disaster will likely be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. 
The release of radioactive material from the damaged nuclear plants will certainly cause more deaths and disease, and radiation being blown out into the Pacific Ocean may become a threat to the Hawaiian Islands and the West Coast of the United States.
While Japan may have been the best prepared nation to deal with a large-scale earthquake, there is no way any country could prepare for and deal with an 8.9-magnitude earthquake. This earthquake should serve as a cautionary tale for us here in America.
With our overpowering need for new sources of clean, sustainable energy, we should not rush headlong into building more and bigger nuclear power plants, unless we are prepared to build them to withstand the strongest devastating events Mother Nature can hurl at us.
Henry A. Lowenstein New York, March 14, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Nuclear Push May Be in Peril'' (front page, March 14):
The explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant should sober those who tout nuclear power as a solution to global warming. Nuclear power is vulnerable at many points in the fuel cycle, from the risk of reactor meltdown to the theft of radioactive materials for terrorism or proliferation. It requires safely storing nuclear waste for thousands of years.
Plants are vulnerable to both storm and drought. Meanwhile, global warming brings both of these -- and social chaos. As we enter such a world, technologies too dangerous to fail are too dangerous to pursue.
David Keppel Bloomington, Ind., March 14, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Crisis at Pair of Reactors Underscores Japan's Fear of the Nuclear Industry'' (news article, March 13):
While obviously the first concern that the international community has about the disaster in Japan is the dreadful loss of lives and the damage to property, the nuclear industry has to be troubled by the possible fallout from the partial meltdowns at nuclear plants in that nation.
For Japan, nuclear plants have been a two-edged sword. With few oil deposits and a dwindling amount of coal, Japan has had little alternative but to use nuclear power, despite the risk of earthquakes in a region prone to them.
Certainly any nuclear disaster will recall the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.
Unfortunately for the international nuclear power industry, the tragedy in Japan may reduce the call for dependence on that energy source, driving the price of oil and coal ever higher. The Three Mile Island incident and the disaster at Chernobyl delayed the use of nuclear power as an alternative energy source.
Nelson Marans Silver Spring, Md., March 14, 2011
To the Editor:
A lesson should be learned from the tragedy in Japan and the radiation leaks from the nuclear power plants. These plants should not be located near major population centers.
Nearly 10 million people live within 25 miles of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Buchanan, N.Y., north of New York City. This plant, like the power plants in Japan, is situated on an earthquake fault.
Although the New York area is not as likely to have as significant an earthquake as the one in Japan, the risks are severe because of Indian Point's proximity to so many people.
If Japan was unable to prevent nuclear power accidents after an earthquake, can Entergy, the owner of Indian Point, do a better job of protecting its neighbors?
Paul Feiner Greenburgh, N.Y., March 14, 2011
The writer is town supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh.
To the Editor:
Re ''The Best-Laid Plans'' (Week in Review, March 13):
For those in the United States who have been in denial about our aging infrastructure, the terrible earthquake and tsunami in Japan should finally convince them that we need to raise the public funds to bring our roads, bridges, public buildings, water and sewer systems, schools, trains and broadband networks up to 21st-century standards.
The only way we can accomplish this is by raising taxes on the wealthy and ensuring that corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Besides the benefit of improved structures, these projects would create jobs and strengthen the economy, recreating the growth of the post-World War II decades.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Shares End Lower

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street closed lower on Monday, following Japanese markets lower, as investors tried to assess the economic impact of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in Japan.
Shares of uranium producers were hit hard, as Japanese engineers struggled to prevent a meltdown at a stricken nuclear plant. Oil prices fell as markets worried that any slowdown in growth in Japan would crimp world demand.
The Standard & Poor's 500 closed down 7.89 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,296.39. Among the hardest hit names in the index was General Electric, which designed the nuclear reactors at the stricken Fukushima plant in northern Japan. It was down 2.4 percent. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.24 points, or 0.43 percent, to 11,993.16, while the technology heavy Nasdaq dropped 14.64 points, or 0.64 percent, t0 2,700.97.
In the bond market, prices rose for the benchmark 10-year bond as the interest rate fell to 3.33 percent from 3.4 percent late Friday.
Earlier, the Nikkei 225 index plunged 6.2 percent to close at 9,620.49 points, its lowest level since November, even as Japan's central bank pumped cash into the financial system and eased monetary policy to try and shield the country's economy from the disaster that hit northeastern Japan on Friday.
Crude oil prices in New York trading fell below $100 a barrel before rising slightly. Analysts had anticipated that the shutdown of Japanese refineries could cut demand. In afternoon trading in New York, benchmark crude for April delivery was three cents higher at $101.19 a barrel.
''This disaster has in effect temporarily frozen the world's third-largest economy,'' Richard Soultanian of NUS Consulting told The Associated Press. ''It seems clear that Japan's appetite for crude oil may be diminished in the near-term which should provide previously unforeseen slack in international oil markets.''
In Europe, stock markets were lower but they appeared to be bolstered by an agreement that European leaders struck early Saturday on measures intended to end the euro zone debt crisis, in part by injecting more flexibility into the way a bailout fund for the euro can be used. The deal bolstered government bond prices in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
In London, the FTSE-100 was down 54.43 points, or 0.92 percent.
In Frankfurt, the DAX index was down 114.86, or 1.65 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris fell 50.64 points or 1.29 percent.
As the fate of the quake-stricken nuclear reactors hung in the balance, the stocks of uranium producers were hit hard. The stock of Uranium Resources was down 26 percent, for example. Uranium Energy was down 25 percent, matching the decline in Denison Mines Corporation.
But stocks of companies involved in renewable energy were boosted. The share price of Suntech Power Holdings was 4.1 percent higher.
Insurance and reinsurance companies also suffered, as investors worried about the extent of their liabilities in covering the damage wreaked by the earthquake and tsunami.
Swiss Re, one of the biggest reinsurance companies, was down 5 percent.
As the crisis at damaged nuclear plants north of Tokyo threatened an energy squeeze for Japanese companies, Jens Nordvig, an economist at Nomura in New York, said there would probably be spillover effects on countries outside Japan, though the overall impact was likely to be small.
In the light of the natural disaster, Nomura shaved its estimate of Japanese growth this year, by about 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent, but ''that is too little to mean we are going to take any of the other numbers outside Japan down,'' Mr. Nordvig said.
Guy Lebas, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said there was repatriation risk to global markets -- Japanese companies and individuals moving money from the United States and elsewhere back to Japan for reconstruction or to have easier access to their savings.
Japanese investors, for example, are the second largest holder of Treasuries, after China, and any withdrawal could put some upward pressure on interest rates in the United States, he said.
He said there was some evidence of that at the end of last week. But on Monday as fears about the effects of the nuclear reactors remained uncertain, this was offset by investors around the world sending money back the other way, pouring money back into Treasuries as they sought a safe haven, causing them to strengthen.

HEADLINE: Energy Needs Sustain Nuclear Push: India and China Move Ahead While Advanced Nations Back Off

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and VIKAS BAJAJ; Vikas Bajaj reported from Mumbai, India. Reporting was contributed by Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong, Liz Alderman from Paris and Judy Dempsey from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Despite Japan's crisis, India and China and some other energy-ravenous countries say they plan to keep using their nuclear power plants and building new ones.
The Japanese disaster has led some energy officials in the United States and in industrialized European nations to think twice about nuclear expansion. And if a huge release of radiation worsens the crisis, even big developing nations might reconsider their ambitious plans. But for now, while acknowledging the need for safety, they say their unmet energy needs give them little choice but to continue investing in nuclear power.
''Ours is a very power-hungry country,'' Srikumar Banerjee, the chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission, said during a news conference Monday in Mumbai. Nearly 40 percent of India's 1.2 billion people do not have regular access to electricity, Mr. Banerjee said. ''It is essential for us to have further electricity generation.''
And in China, which has the world's most ambitious nuclear expansion plans, a vice minister of environment, Zhang Lijun, said on Saturday that Japan's difficulties would not deter his nation's nuclear rollout. 
With those two countries driving the expansion -- and countries from elsewhere in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East also embracing nuclear power in response to high fossil fuel prices and concerns about global warming -- the world's stock of 443 nuclear reactors could more than double in the next 15 years, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry trade group.
Not that Indian and Chinese officials are heedless of the risks of nuclear energy. India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said Monday that his country's Department of Atomic Energy would review all safety systems at India's nuclear plants, ''particularly with a view to ensuring that they would be able to withstand the impact of large natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes.''
During a political conference in Beijing on Sunday, Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said, ''Evaluation of nuclear safety and the monitoring of plants will be definitely strengthened.''
China's nuclear power industry has 11 reactors operating and plans to start construction on as many 10 new ones a year during the next decade. China's electricity consumption continues to climb 12 percent a year, even as usage stagnates in the West.
India, with 20 nuclear reactors already in operation, plans to spend an estimated $150 billion adding dozens of new ones around the country. Its forecast calls for nuclear power to supply about a quarter of the country's electricity needs by 2050, a tenfold increase from now.
One company that could benefit from the continued global push for nuclear energy is General Electric, a maker of reactors. Other big players include Areva of France and Toshiba's Westinghouse unit.
But on Monday, at least, G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, found himself on the nuclear defensive. G.E. was the designer of the reactors at the 40-year-old Fukushima Daiichi plant in Okuma, Japan, that was damaged by last Friday's tsunami and has had a series of explosions since then.
Mr. Immelt, who happened to be in New Delhi on a previously planned promotional tour for his company's products and services, said at a news conference Monday that it was too early to predict what effect, if any, the events in Japan could have on the nuclear energy industry. G.E.'s stock closed down more than 2 percent on Monday, to $19.92.
''We just have to let discovery take place, and let countries reach their own conclusions,'' he said. ''There has been an almost 50-year track record from nuclear power that people can look back on and make their own judgments on.''
Asked whether the Fukushima Daiichi plant's oceanfront location had contributed to its vulnerability, Mr. Immelt replied, ''On location and all that other stuff -- let's just let it take its course.''
So far, G.E. has not sold any nuclear plants to India. Most of the country's existing reactors have been built locally with some Russian help, and contracts have been awarded for more Russian-backed plants. India also signed a nuclear reactor deal with Areva in December for $9.3 billion.
The United States has lobbied extensively to open India's nuclear power market to American industry. Indian and American officials spent more than five years negotiating a nuclear energy agreement that was blessed by both governments and international nuclear agencies.
That deal, completed last August, is considered one of Mr. Singh's major foreign policy successes and a cornerstone of his Congress Party's pledge to help India's economic growth.
But the pact included an unusual liability clause that makes nuclear power plant suppliers, not just operators, liable if accidents occur.
Despite American pressure to change that provision, the Japan disaster could encourage Indian legislators to keep it in place.
G.E. and Westinghouse have said they will stay out of the Indian nuclear market unless the country changes its liability law to conform with international standards.
Walt Patterson, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London, predicted that the problems at Japan's nuclear plants would refocus attention on safety and away from the economic viability of atomic energy.
''The question mark about safety was really way down the agenda,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''This will bring it right back to the top of the agenda.''
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Monday said her country's plan to prolong the life of the country's nuclear power stations would be tabled while the German government reassessed the situation.
Switzerland on Monday suspended plans to build new plants and replace existing ones. The Swiss energy minister, Doris Leuthard, said in a statement that the ''safety and well-being of the population have the highest priority.''
But at the same time, Italy, Russia and the Czech Republic all said they would stick to their energy policies.
Across the Middle East, countries have been racing to build up nuclear power, as a growth and population boom has created unprecedented demand for energy, and as Iran forges ahead with the Bushehr nuclear facility.
The United Arab Emirates has taken the lead with a plan to build four plants in the city of Braka, on the Persian Gulf, by 2017 to generate about a quarter of the country's power by 2020.
The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, the project's developer, is ''closely monitoring the situation in Japan,'' a spokesman said Monday, although no reassessment of the effort is under way.
The emirates plan to use pressurized water reactors bought from Korea Electric Power Company of South Korea in a $20 billion deal, passing over French and American bids for the project.
One of the emirates, Abu Dhabi, chose Braka because it is near the water and an existing power grid, far from populated areas, and lies on a seismically stable landmass.
Because the Persian Gulf is an enclosed sea, planners say there is little threat of a tsunami in the event of an earthquake.
By contrast, Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant, also on the Persian Gulf, is much less seismically stable, which worries environmentalists. Any nuclear leak there would quickly reach the wealthy emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and others because the gulf's currents run clockwise.
The Iranian plant unloaded nuclear fuel in February after a computer worm infected the reactor.
Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Egypt are all also studying nuclear energy, and even oil-rich Saudi Arabia is considering a nuclear-powered city.
Most plants would be placed in seismically stable areas, although one planned by Jordan at the Red Sea port of Aqaba is on a major faultline.
Turkey on Monday said it would move ahead with plans for two nuclear plants, including one that may use Japanese nuclear technology from the Tokyo Electric Power Company and Toshiba. Numerous geological faultlines cross the country.
India's nuclear energy establishment has faced stiff opposition to its ambitious plans from environmentalists and villagers at plant sites.
Many of the questions posed to energy officials at Monday's news conference addressed a controversial nuclear project on the western coast of the country, north of Goa, a tourist destination.
As currently envisioned, it would be the world's largest nuclear energy complex.
But analysts in India said the Japan crisis was unlikely to stir up significantly more public protest against nuclear plants here, given the pressing demand for more electricity.
''If 1 percent of the population was against nuclear power, you might now get 2 percent,'' said G. Balachandran, a consulting fellow at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, a policy research organization in New Delhi. ''I am really not concerned about the opposition that may develop around this.''

HEADLINE: At Gowanus Canal, Unearthing Pollutants, and Perhaps Treasures

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Neighbors around the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn already know their waterway is a toxic soup of heavy metals, sewage and probable carcinogens.
But some dream of treasures that might also be uncovered as a federal Superfund cleanup of the canal gets under way.
Perhaps remnants of a tidewater mill dam? A few Indian arrowheads and fishing hooks? Bullets, brass buttons and, who knows, a few human bones from the Battle of Brooklyn?
''Very few people realize that the largest battle of the Revolutionary War was fought in Brooklyn,'' said Kimberly Maier, executive director of the Old Stone House, a museum on the site where some 400 soldiers from Maryland were nearly wiped out while holding back a much larger British force in August 1776.
''There's always been this great mystery of where the Marylanders were buried,'' she said. ''Were they in one specific grave about 100 feet from the curb along Third Avenue between Seventh and Eighth Streets, or dumped into the Gowanus wetlands? What turns up would be amazing.'' 
The Superfund program, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, is known for unearthing pollutants that pose a threat to public health. But as the agency designs its projects across the country, it also plays a less well-known role -- that of preservationist, documenting and often salvaging items of historical value found in contaminated soil, buildings and sediment at the bottom of rivers and canals.
That role can sometimes become as controversial as forcing polluters to pay for a cleanup or, as in the case of the Gowanus, interfering with a city's ambitious economic development plans.
Fredric L. Quivik, a professor of industrial history and archaeology at Michigan Technological University, said that in regions where E.P.A. administrators are ''single-minded'' about a cleanup, they may consider preservation efforts ''a distraction from their mission in life.'' He added, ''If there are local constituencies who care about these cultural resources, they'll raise a ruckus.''
Federal officials said that 20 to 25 percent of some 1,300 current Superfund sites contain artifacts or structures of historical interest to their local communities or that capture whole swaths of the nation's industrial eras. Many of the sites, the officials noted, are near water, which provided transportation and livelihoods to early industry and settlements.
One of the most significant examples of preservation at a contaminated site was found in Roebling, N.J., about 10 miles south of Trenton near the Delaware River. A museum is rising up there from the wasteland of what once was the steel mill complex founded by the family that built the Brooklyn Bridge and that produced the wire rope for the Golden Gate and George Washington Bridges.
The cleanup at the former John A. Roebling's Sons Company, which operated at the site from 1905 to the 1950s, when the company was sold to new owners that operated there until the 1970s, is ridding a 200-acre site of asbestos and heavy metals like chromium, lead and copper for future commercial and recreational development by the Township of Florence, which owns the land.
In the process of demolishing contaminated buildings and dredging river and creek sediment, the E.P.A. has saved mill tools, large spools and machinery, and the employment records of thousands of immigrant workers, most of them Eastern Europeans who were often recruited fresh from Ellis Island.
The federal agency, which has spent $115 million on the cleanup since it began in the late 1980s, has provided $7 million to renovate the mill's former gatehouse to establish the Roebling Museum, which opened to the public last summer. (Agency officials say the costs of historic property are financed with cleanup money, which either comes from polluters or, as in the case of the Roebling project, directly from the E.P.A.)
''What we're recovering here is the part this place played in the American industrial revolution, in the immigrant experience,'' said George Lengel, a Roebling Museum board member and local historian. ''We couldn't have done it without the E.P.A. This was too big a project for a small community.''
Under the National Historic Preservation Act, the protection agency is required to consider any possible harm to cultural resources. John F. Vetter, an archaeologist and the agency's expert in historic preservation, said the investigation of potentially historic resources runs parallel to that of contaminants at the outset of a cleanup so that alternatives are weighed to avoid or minimize any damage.
Some notable discoveries, which are usually given to state museums and local communities, include Lenape Indian artifacts from the old DeRewal Chemical Company site in Kingwood, N.J., and 20-foot-long pieces of timber from Fort Edward in upstate New York. The timbers, found in the dredging of part of the Hudson River that had been contaminated with the toxic chemicals known as PCBs from discharges by two General Electric factories, is now undergoing preservation work at the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum in Vergennes, Vt., before going to the New York State Museum in Albany.)
In the case of American Indian burial grounds, Mr. Vetter said, some have been left alone, and in other cases remains have been reburied elsewhere, with the agreement of tribes. When preservation interferes with the cleanup, Mr. Vetter said, a ''recordation,'' or documentation, takes place to at least have a public account of what was lost.
''In each case, we look at how much we can keep intact,'' Mr. Vetter added. ''In some sites, we're successful in preserving the historic features, and in others, we lose the historic features, and we do recordations.''
Yet the agency's primary mission is still the cleanup, according to Professor Quivik, and some of its administrators have been criticized by state preservation officials for doing just the minimum to comply with their obligations to history. Preservation at the sites often depends on the advocacy of state and local preservationists, he added.
''Otherwise,'' he said, ''you demolish it, cover it over or haul it to the dump.''
In Brooklyn, neighbors and community groups are already forming an ''archaeological and historic resources committee'' as part of the community advisory group overseeing the project. One committee member, Eymund Diegel, an environmental planner, said he saw the agency as an ally, but ''they will have to make technical choices that don't necessarily mesh with other plans.''
One brewing battle, he said, is whether to preserve or replace the canal's old bulkheads because of the need to create a barrier to prevent more contamination from the soil into the water.
''There's debate about what should be done,'' Mr. Diegel said. ''People are now discussing whether this or that should be preserved, and that's a healthy debate because the main problem with the Gowanus has been neglect.''
For all the excitement, Mr. Diegel and others acknowledged that expectations of major archaeological discoveries are low given how heavily the area has been developed over the centuries. Many residents, Mr. Diegel said, would be happy just improving the quality of water along the 1.8-mile-long canal, which was carved out of tidal wetlands and streams in the 1860s.
''Clean water,'' he said, ''is the ultimate archaeological resource they could find.''

HEADLINE: The Aftershocks In U.S. Treasuries

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
The United States Treasury market could feel financial aftershocks from Japan's earthquake. Offloading some of the Asian giant's $1 trillion of foreign reserves would raise cash to help rebuild after Friday's disaster. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is set to end its Treasury bond-buying program in June. If Japan, the second-biggest foreign holder, starts selling, that's another support gone -- with the potential to make borrowing more expensive for the federal government.
It's too early to estimate the cost of reconstruction efforts. But bond investors can no longer take for granted that Japan will leave its ample reserves intact as it has, broadly speaking, for the last several years. For the government, cashing in could be more palatable than yet more borrowing. Before last week's event's, Japan's debt already amounted to more than 200 percent of G.D.P., according to the International Monetary Fund. 
Between the public and private sectors, Japanese investors owned $882 billion of Treasuries at the end of last year, according to United States data, second only to the Chinese with $1.2 trillion. Traders on Monday were already speculating that Japan's institutional investors could sell liquid Treasury holdings to raise cash. It's not a stretch to imagine the Japanese government might do the same. Selling dollar-denominated assets could strengthen the yen, an undesirable outcome for the nation's manufacturers. But at a time of crisis it shouldn't be ruled out.
If it happened, it could further change the balance of supply and demand in the market for United States government debt. And there was already a question about who would step up to buy Treasuries when the Fed ended its buying program in three months.
The central bank has accumulated more than $400 billion of government paper since it started its purchasing program in November. It has been buying enough to absorb some three-fifths of new debt being issued by Washington to pay for the yawning federal deficit. Prominent investors including Bill Gross of Pimco have warned that interest rates could spike when the Treasury market loses its newest best friend. Now it can't be sure of one of its oldest supporters, either.
The N.F.L. Lesson
Quarterbacks like Tom Brady aren't doing the nation's teachers any favors. Public sector unions, like those representing educators, are under fire from state governors and taxpayers. At the same time, professional football players are embroiled in their own peculiar labor battle. There's not much common ground, but the popularity of the gridiron millionaires creates an odd contrast.
The National Football League Players Association dissolved itself as a union last Friday so that some of its members could file a lawsuit claiming the league is acting unfairly as a monopoly. This happened on the same day that Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, home of the Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers, signed into law broad new limits on the collective bargaining rights of state workers.
The athletes on average earn nearly $2 million a year, or roughly 25 times more than the state's teachers, and can't really claim the same societal value. Yet some 35 percent of those polled by Seton Hall University backed the N.F.L. players, with only 22 percent supporting the owners -- while a Quinnipiac University poll found more respondents supported Mr. Walker's plan than the union workers it weakens.
The football players are even fighting for some similar rights. They want higher wages for younger players and better pensions for older ones.
The economics of each situation may help explain the paradox. Though the N.F.L. players are millionaires and receive about 60 percent of the league's $9.3 billion of revenue, they are pitted against team owners with an average net worth of $1.4 billion apiece, according to Sports Illustrated. That makes the owners easy villains. As for the public sector unions, the hard times that have befallen the country make their steep pension and health plans ready targets for envious private sector workers.
Despite their professed admiration for teachers, it seems that Americans still look up to their sports heroes even more. Perhaps that's because athletes toil in a fairly pure meritocracy while many unions representing teachers cling to a system that all but guarantees jobs to even the worst performers. Or maybe teachers just need a famous, buff and telegenic celebrity to represent them -- not just a shop steward. AGNES T. CRANE

HEADLINE: Taliban Suicide Bomber Kills 36 Outside Military Recruiting Center in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Sangar Rahimi and Sharifullah Sahak contributed reporting from Kabul, and an Afghan employee of The New York Times from Kunduz.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- A Taliban suicide bomber posing as an army recruit blew himself up in the midst of a crowd outside an Afghan military recruiting center on Monday in the northern city of Kunduz, killing 36 people, including five children, the authorities there said.
The suicide bombing, the fourth in Kunduz Province since February, reaffirmed the area as a major focus of Taliban activity in recent months. 
The child victims were mainly shoeshine boys who were working the crowd waiting outside the center, according to the police, witnesses and hospital officials.
In Kunduz, despite the normal winter lull in insurgents' activities, Taliban suicide bombers have killed a district governor, 34 people at a census office and the police chief of the province since February. In the last half of 2010, they managed to kill the provincial governor while he prayed in a mosque, four security officers in an office of the United States Agency for International Development, and a group of four soldiers and four police officers.
Taliban spokesmen have said they had shifted their attention to areas like Kunduz in response to the surge of new American military forces concentrated mainly in southern Afghanistan. While places like Kandahar in the south have been unusually quiet over the winter, there has been comparatively little respite in Kunduz and other places to the north.
According to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office, an independent agency that monitors incidents in the nine-year-old war, there was an average of one attack a day in Kunduz Province in the last two weeks of February.
Kunduz is under the control of the German Army, which, although part of the NATO force in Afghanistan, is subject to what are called national caveats -- in this case they limit its authority to carry out offensive military operations.
In Monday's attack, the bomber killed 36 people and wounded 40 in all, according to Dr. Humayoun Khamosh at the Kunduz Public Health Department.
An Afghan reporter for The New York Times who reached the scene said he saw children as well as men in army uniforms among the victims. ''Most of the dead children are shoe polishers working in the area,'' he said. ''You could see their shoe polish boxes and brushes still there.''
President Hamid Karzai called the suicide bombing a ''vile attack'' that nonetheless would only encourage more recruits to join the fight against the Taliban. ''It will by contrast embolden their resolve and dedication to eliminate a cruel enemy that wants nothing but bloodletting,'' he said in a statement.
A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, took responsibility for the attack and said the bomber was a Kunduz resident, whom he identified by his single Afghan name, Saifullah.
''I strongly deny the allegation of civilian casualties in the attack,'' Mr. Mujahid said. ''Some known, pro-puppet-government circles claim that civilians and children who were playing in an adjacent park are among the dead, but in fact the park is almost a hundred meters away from the blast site.''
He conceded, however, that shoeshine boys were among the victims. ''While we are really sorry for any innocent civilians' losing their lives in our action, we strongly advise civilians not to approach Afghan and foreign military convoys, bases and individuals.''
The shoeshine boys, Mr. Mujahid added, ''were in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
In late January, the Kunduz Province police chief, Abdul Rahman Saidkhaili, boasted that Kunduz was, in his words, ''100 percent cleared of Taliban.'' Ten days later, a suicide bomber killed the governor of Chardara district in the province, jumping on him in his office on Feb. 10.
Then, on Feb. 21, another bomber entered the district government offices in Imam Sahib district, killing 34 people, many of them militiamen waiting to get national ID cards. And on March 10, a suicide bomber jumped on the police chief himself, killing him and three of his companions.
Many of the Taliban's targets have been so-called Arbakai, or village self-defense forces, and pro-government militiamen, whose role has been controversial in Kunduz and other areas.
While Kunduz is a majority Pashtun area, many of the government officials and police officers are ethnic Tajiks, associated with the former Northern Alliance that battled the Taliban for many years.
In many of the recent attacks, the bombers have managed to penetrate heavy security around their targets. ''There may well be some people inside the police headquarters who are spying and providing information to the insurgents,'' said Fatima Aziz, a member of Parliament from Kunduz. ''Otherwise, how is this possible?''
A prominent Taliban commander in Kunduz, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so he could evade capture by the authorities, said that in many places in Kunduz, as a result of government pressure, the group had withdrawn its fighters from combat. Their response has been to shift to a reliance on suicide attackers.
''Our tactics have changed, and now instead of doing grouped and organized attacks, we prefer the suicide attacks, and here we have many youths who are willing to do martyrdom attacks,'' the commander said. ''In the coming new year we will prove our physical existence in Kunduz.'' He was referring to the new Afghan year, which begins in March.
The latest attack overwhelmed the small hospital in Kunduz. Critically wounded victims lay in hallways, bodies were stacked in the courtyard for family members to identify, and wounded men and children screamed in pain as doctors rushed to attend them.
In a separate occurrence, also in northern Afghanistan, Taliban insurgents in the Charbulak district of Balkh Province besieged a police checkpoint early on Monday, exchanging fire with officers for several hours. A carload of police officers coming to the checkpoint's aid hit a roadside bomb, killing three of them, according to Gen. Abdur Rauf Taj, the deputy police chief in Balkh.

HEADLINE: For Honolulu's Homeless, an Eviction Notice

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
HONOLULU -- From his home on Ilalo Street, Banery Afituk can feel the breeze off Mamala Bay, two blocks away. Walking out his front door, to his right, he can make out the tops of the luxury ocean liners, and to his left, some of this city's finer high rises. ''I like it here,'' he said, as his three children played around him.
Home for Mr. Afituk, his pregnant wife and their children is, in fact, a tattered tent rising low off the sidewalk, one of dozens that have sprung up in a colony of homelessness near the downtown of this tropical tourist getaway.
But all these tents, including Mr. Afituk's, are about to disappear. Hawaii redevelopment officials told residents of this fetid colony that by Tuesday they would remove the estimated 75 remaining tents, lean-tos and other structures, forcing about 100 people who have called the area home to find somewhere else. 
State officials said they were simply trying to enforce the law and clean up the waterfront district to encourage development in a desirable corner of the island where the tents, piles of garbage and wandering homeless offer quite a contrast to the rest of Oahu.
But this forced exodus is only the latest chapter in Hawaii's difficult relationship with its homeless as it wrestles with two forces: a warm climate that facilitates outdoor living and the threat to the image of the state that is central to tourism.
Advocates for the homeless said this latest sweep would have the same effect as the last few: the homeless will simply take their tents elsewhere.
''I understand that they are caught between a rock and a hard place,'' Doran J. Porter, executive director of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance in Hawaii, said of state officials. ''This isn't an appropriate place for lean-tos and tents.''
And Mr. Porter said he knew full well that state officials were under pressure from the business community. ''My concern is that they need to have solutions of where these folks are going to go,'' he said. ''We can't keep kicking them out of one place where they go to another. That's why they are there in the first place: they were kicked out of Waikiki and the beaches. This has been going on for years.''
Anthony Ching, the executive director of the Hawaii Community Development Authority, said his agency's mandate to redevelop this 600-acre plot had been jeopardized by the illegal dwellings. He said once they were gone, city workers would power-wash the sidewalks and clean up garbage and grassy areas.
''We are not evicting them per se,'' he said. ''We are telling them they can't have structures on the roadway. That does not inhibit their use of the sidewalk.''
In the tents, people appeared accepting of their fate.
''I have no idea where I'm going to go,'' said Douglas Sencio, 52, who works at a carwash, as a young girl next to him ate spaghetti from a pan bubbling on a portable camp stove. ''It's comfortable. We try to make it comfortable. And they come to take it from us. They said, 'You have to move, you have no choice.' ''
This patch of poverty is in a stretch of Honolulu that most tourists probably do not see, unless they glance down some of the side streets running off Ala Moana Boulevard on the trip from the airport. It makes for a startling contrast in a place better known for the surfers on the wild beaches of the North Shore and the developed beaches of Waikiki, where tourists can be seen carrying frothy drinks down the beach, listening to the soft strum of Hawaiian folk music at the House Without a Key.
There is block after block of tents and tarps, shopping carts, bicycles and piles of garbage. Mr. Afituk said he went to a nearby restroom in the morning to bring back gallons of water to wash his children before school.
The dearth of nearby toilets or garbage pickup has contributed to the depredation of a neighborhood that the Hawaii Community Development Authority is eager to redevelop. In recent years, the University of Hawaii moved its medical school to Ilalo Street, and a nearby park where homeless people once camped has been renovated.
Still, there is evidence of a shift in attitudes toward the homelessness problem with the election last year of a new governor, Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat. He appointed a homeless coordinator soon after taking office.
But national advocates for the homeless said Hawaii had been slow to recognize the extent of its problem and to take advantage of federal resources to deal with it
Neil J. Donovan, the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the state was one of many trying to deal with the homeless through ordinances, like the one barring tents, rather than programs to create housing. ''That's just such a short-sighted approach,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''It's all about a lack of affordable housing.''
In 2009, the coalition named Honolulu the eighth meanest city in the country in its dealing with the homeless. Still, Mr. Donovan said Hawaii's situation was particularly challenging: on an island with limited land, escalating property values have made affordable housing scarce.
''A lot of communities have different options to present to people,'' he said. ''In Hawaii, if you are persistently poor, you are really stuck where you are, on the islands.''
The stories of the Hawaii homeless are not dissimilar from those in other areas: of jobs lost, time in prison, struggles with alcoholism and mental illness, of broken marriages.
''I'm just trying to save enough money to get a place,'' said Michael Taylor, who said he had been living on the streets for about six years. ''They've been chasing us all around town. Everywhere you go, they tell you to move on, or threaten to arrest you.''
Mr. Afituk, who like many of the homeless here came from Micronesia, said he and his family had been forced to move out of a one-room apartment after he lost a job last year. He said he was now working as a fire marshal at Pearl Harbor, but did not make enough to rent a home. ''I can't afford it,'' he said. ''It's $1,200 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.''
And as in other temperate places -- like Santa Monica, Calif. -- Hawaii's climate is a draw to people looking to live outside. ''I love it: free rent, free electricity,'' said Sherri Watson, 43. ''Who wants to stay in a bed-bugged shelter?''
Todd Wilbur, 36, said: ''It's not right that they shuffle us from one side to the other and back and forth. They just make us go in circles. Over here they are going to build a shopping center, another cafe. Why don't they put up affordable housing instead?''

HEADLINE: Saudis, Fearful of Iran, Send Troops to Bahrain to Quell Protests

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER and MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Ethan Bronner reported from Manama, Bahrain, and Michael Slackman from Berlin. Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, Steven Lee Myers from Paris, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

 BODY:
MANAMA, Bahrain -- Saudi Arabia's military rolled into Bahrain on Monday, threatening to escalate a local political conflict into a regional showdown with Iran.
Saudi Arabia has been watching uneasily as Bahrain's Shiite majority has staged weeks of protests against a Sunni monarchy, fearing that if the protesters prevailed, Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter regional rival, could expand its influence and inspire unrest elsewhere.
The Saudi decision to send in troops could further inflame the conflict and transform this teardrop of a nation in the Persian Gulf into the Middle East's next proxy battlefield between regional and global powers.
By midday, about 2000 troops -- 1,200 from Saudi Arabia and 800 from the United Arab Emirates -- entered Bahrain as part of a force operating under the aegis of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-nation regional coalition of Sunni rulers that has grown increasingly anxious over the sustained challenge to Bahrain's king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. ''This is the initial phase,'' a Saudi official said. ''Bahrain will get whatever assistance it needs. It's open-ended.'' 
The decision is the first time the council has used collective military action to help suppress a popular revolt -- in this case a Shiite popular revolt. It was rejected by the opposition, and by Iran, as an ''occupation.'' According to Iranian news reports, Iran even went so far as to call the troop movement an invasion. Iran has long claimed that Bahrain is historically part of Iran.
The troops entered Bahrain at an especially combustible moment in the standoff between protesters and the monarchy. In recent days protesters have begun to move from the encampment in Pearl Square, the symbolic center of the nation, to the actual seat of power and influence, the Royal Court and the financial district. As the troops moved in, protesters controlled the main highway and said they were determined not to leave.
''We don't know what is going to happen,'' Jassim Hussein Ali, a member of the opposition Wefaq party and a former member of Parliament, said in a phone interview. ''Bahrain is heading toward major problems, anarchy. This is an occupation, and this is not welcome.''
Rasool Nafisi, an academic and Iran expert based in Virginia, said: ''Now that the Saudis have gone in, they may spur a similar reaction from Iran, and Bahrain becomes a battleground between Saudi and Iran. This may prolong the conflict rather than put an end to it, and make it an international event rather than a local uprising.''
An adviser to the United States government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press, agreed. ''Iran's preference was not to get engaged because the flow of events was in their direction,'' he said. ''If the Saudi intervention changes the calculus, they will be more aggressive.''
Though Bahrain said it had invited the force, the Saudi presence highlights the degree to which the kingdom has become concerned over Iran's growing regional influence, and demonstrates that the Saudi monarchy has drawn the line at its back door. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Washington, has traditionally preferred to operate in the shadows through checkbook diplomacy. It has long provided an economic lifeline to Bahrain.
But it now finds itself largely standing alone to face Iran since its most important ally in that fight, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, has been ousted in a popular uprising. Iran's ally, Hezbollah, recently toppled the Saudi-backed government of Lebanon -- a symbol of its regional might and Saudi Arabia's diminishing clout.
But Bahrain is right at Saudi Arabia's eastern border, where the kingdoms are connected by a causeway.
The Gulf Cooperation Council was clearly alarmed at the prospect of a Shiite political victory in Bahrain, fearing that it would inspire restive Shiite populations in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to protest as well. The majority of the population in Saudi Arabia's eastern provinces, where the oil is found, is Shiite, and there have already been small protests there.
''If the opposition in Bahrain wins, then Saudi loses,'' said Mustafa el-Labbad, director of Al Sharq Center for Regional and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''In this regional context, the decision to move troops into Bahrain is not to help the monarchy of Bahrain, but to help Saudi Arabia itself .''
The Bahrain government said that it had invited the force in to help restore and preserve public order. The United States -- which has continued to back the monarchy -- said Monday that the move was not an occupation. The United States has long been allied with Bahrain's royal family and has based the Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain for many years.
Though the United States eventually sided with the demonstrators in Egypt, in Bahrain it has instead supported the leadership while calling for restraint and democratic change. The Saudi official said the United States was informed Sunday that the Saudi troops would enter Bahrain on Monday.
Saudi and council officials said the military forces would not engage with the demonstrators, but would protect infrastructure, government offices and industries, even though the protests had largely been peaceful. The mobilization would allow Bahrain to free up its own police and military forces to deal with the demonstrators, the officials said.
The Gulf Cooperation Council ''forces are not there to kill people,'' said a Saudi official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. ''This is a G.C.C. decision; we do not violate international law.''
But the officials also acknowledged that it was a message to Iran. ''There is no doubt Iran is involved,'' said the official, though no proof has been offered that Iran has had anything to do with the political unrest.
Political analysts said that it was likely that the United States did not object to the deployment in part because it, too, saw a weakened monarchy as a net benefit to Iran at a time when the United States wants to move troops out of Iraq, where Iran has already established an influence.
The military force is one part of a Gulf Cooperation Council effort to try to contain the crisis in Bahrain that broke out Feb. 14, when young people called for a Day of Rage, fashioned after events in Egypt and Tunisia. The police and then the army killed seven demonstrators, leading Washington to press Bahrain to remove its forces from the street.
The royal family allowed thousands of demonstrators to camp at Pearl Square. It freed some political prisoners, allowed an exiled opposition leader to return and reshuffled the cabinet. And it called for a national dialogue.
But the concessions -- after the killings -- seemed to embolden a movement that went from calling for a true constitutional monarchy to demanding the downfall of the monarchy. The monarchy has said it will consider instituting a fairly elected Parliament, but it insisted that the first step would be opening a national dialogue -- a position the opposition has rejected, though it was unclear whether the protesters were speaking with one voice.
The council moved troops in after deciding earlier to help prop up the king with a contribution of $10 billion over 10 years, and said that it might increase that figure. But if the goal was to intimidate Iran, or the protesters, that clearly was not the first response.
Bahrain's opposition groups issued a statement: ''We consider the entry of any soldier or military machinery into the Kingdom of Bahrain's air, sea or land territories a blatant occupation.''

HEADLINE: Towers Built for the Poor Are Hearing the Call Of the Condominium

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
For generations of space-starved New Yorkers, Cobble Hill Towers has been an affordable oasis. More than 130 years ago, its architect, Alfred Tredway White, designed its nine low-rise, red-brick buildings to demonstrate that housing for the poor could be both humane and economically feasible.
The buildings were known for their distinctive wrought-iron breezeways and features that were considered amenities at the time, like cross ventilation and access to sunlight. Rents were $1.50 to $2 a week. Today, the buildings are perhaps better known for a less attractive feature: the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which was built in the 1950s and sits right across the street. 
Still, the realities of real estate have finally arrived at Cobble Hill Towers, as it goes through the gallstonelike and quintessentially New York process of conversion.
In 2008, Frank Farella, the local developer who brought the property back from the brink in the 1970s, formed a joint venture with Hudson Companies to turn Cobble Hill Towers into condominiums. A number of rent-stabilized tenants have already taken buyouts and left, and renters who remain have until March 22 to decide whether to accept an offer to buy in at a discounted price for so-called insiders.
So far, the 188-unit building has accepted offers from nine residents, said Debbie Bhatt, Hudson Companies' project manager for the towers. Residents who do not take a buyout or buy-in can remain as tenants, and Hudson estimated that about half the building will do so.
Amanda and Jonas Abry said the deal offered them a rare chance.
''We never, ever thought we would be able to buy in the neighborhood,'' said Ms. Abry, who added that they were paying less than $500,000 for the two-bedroom apartment she, her husband and their 2-year-old son, Elijah, live in. ''We never were able to save that much money.''
They currently pay a market-rate $2,500 a month in rent, she said, adding that they had thought of the apartment as ''one of those places where you may be able to rent, but just not buy where you live.''
Ms. Abry said her family was happy with the apartment because it was newly renovated when they arrived in June 2009. Most apartments there are walkups, but the Abrys have a ground-floor apartment so they do not have to carry Elijah up stairs. Their apartment also sits on the building's inner courtyard, which Ms. Abry said makes her feel as if she is living on a college quad.
Ms. Bhatt wrote in an e-mail that the insider's price for each apartment was ''based on its layout, location in the complex and views'' and that the average offer, if enough people bought apartments, could drop to $459 per square foot, ''a fantastic opportunity when the Cobble Hill market'' is $800 per square foot.
But there are also residents who say they have been soured by the buying process. Some tenants pooled $6,400 to hire an independent engineer, who reported that the building needed $6 million in repairs, including new roofs, windows, balconies and stairs. Hudson said that the developer had committed to making most of those changes, but that it had not agreed to replace balcony drains and cellar and crawl-space floors. ''We just drew our line at taking care of lots and lots of things and not feeling that some items they mentioned were worthy of replacement,'' said David Kramer, a Hudson principal.
Carl Rosenstock, a resident since 1997, said he wanted to buy at Cobble Hill Towers. At first he was offered a price of $300,000 for his one-bedroom, or about $627 a square foot. He estimated that the apartment needed $50,000 to $75,000 in updates.
Ms. Bhatt said the latest insider price for the apartment could become $270,000, but Mr. Rosenstock said he found an even better opportunity: he bought a two-bedroom condo in Park Slope that records show cost him $527 a square foot. He has already moved into his new home and is getting ready to return his keys at Cobble Hill Towers.
''You're talking about a fourth-floor walkup with a view of the B.Q.E.,'' he said about his old apartment. ''I ended up with a duplex and a backyard patio.''
Parental Assistance
For New Yorkers wondering how their underemployed friends can afford a SoHo loft or a Park Avenue Classic Six, one comment on the real estate section of the parenting blog Urban Baby gives a clue:
''I posted a few weeks ago about my guilt around having my family subsidize my life by giving me enough money to buy a new larger apartment in Manhattan. I always wondered what friends or colleagues secretly thought but by hearing from anon strangers who had no need to 'be nice,' I realized that people don't think less of me (I do work and we pay our monthly bills) and I should shut up and enjoy it.
''It has been genuinely more liberating for me than years of therapy, so THANK YOU UBERS!!!''
And That's Not All
Apartment 47G at the Excelsior on East 57th Street has 2 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, expansive East River views, a sauna and 4,800 square feet of terrace spaces that ''conjure lawn bowling, a pergola and daydreaming.'' Topping it all off is a private glass-enclosed ''skytop'' pool.
Still, the lure of the high life has not spared the apartment from price cuts. Halstead first listed it in summer 2009 for $5.75 million. Sotheby's could not sell it either, and now Core is looking for swimmers and sunbathers with $4.75 million.

HEADLINE: Asking State Workers to Make Concessions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''State Workers and N.Y.'s Fiscal Crisis'' (editorial, ''Within Our Means'' series, March 6): 
Over the last two decades, average annual wage increases in the private sector outpaced wage gains won by state workers by 4.2 percent to 3.4 percent.
Most of the spike in current pension contributions results from the $78 billion in fund losses during Wall Street's meltdown, certainly not a reason to shortchange public workers. The average retired state worker gets a pension of $18,300. The Times cites six-figure pensions received by some workers, but does not note that they represent less than 1 percent of current pensioners.
As they have made clear all along, New York's unions stand ready to negotiate contract changes through collective bargaining. It is unreasonable to expect either public workers or low-income New Yorkers reliant on state programs to bear the brunt of balancing the budget if wealthy New Yorkers do not share the burden.
James A. Parrott Deputy Director and Chief Economist Fiscal Policy Institute New York, March 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Your editorial states: ''New York State is paying 10 times more for state employees' pensions than it did just a decade ago. That huge increase is largely because of Albany's outsized generosity to the state's powerful employees' unions.''
State employee union leaders currently refuse to consider the sacrifices the governor has proposed. In addition, a combination of union work rules that decrease productivity and various abuses worsens New York's budget problems.
A serious discussion about state employee benefits and productivity is necessary, but there is no credible long-term solution that does not involve curbing the power of the state unions.
Vastly overcrowded classrooms are in New York's future unless laws like the Triborough Amendment, which keeps provisions of an expired labor contract in effect until a new agreement is reached, are changed to decrease union power.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Defers Ruling on C.I.A. Operative

BYLINE: By WAQAR GILLANI and CARLOTTA GALL; Waqar Gillani reported from Lahore, and Carlotta Gall from Islamabad, Pakistan.

 BODY:
LAHORE, Pakistan -- The Pakistani government on Monday further postponed the resolution of the question of whether a C.I.A. operative being investigated for a double murder is entitled to diplomatic immunity. 
At a hearing at Punjab High Court here, the government said the Foreign Ministry had not clearly stated that the operative, Raymond A. Davis, was entitled to immunity.
The court ruled that the issue could be decided by the trial court in the murder case, which may begin on Wednesday.
Mr. Davis, a former Green Beret employed by the C.I.A., fatally shot two motorcyclists in Lahore in January. He has said he did so in self-defense, and the United States has said he is a diplomat and entitled to immunity.
The Pakistani government has sought to delay decisions on the case to allow public anger over the shootings to subside. Under pressure from opposition parties, and facing widespread discontent over the economy, the government has avoided making any decision that could be seen as pro-American and unpopular, and has left it in the hands of the Foreign Ministry and the High Court.
Ceding the decision of whether Mr. Davis has diplomatic immunity to the trial court will draw out the process and will not please the American government, which has demanded his immediate release. Mr. Davis has refused to sign a charge sheet, but the murder trial may now proceed at a hearing on Wednesday.
The High Court decision may prove unfavorable for Mr. Davis, since Pakistan's courts are susceptible to the pressure from the street -- religious parties and extremists have campaigned to have Mr. Davis hanged -- and from the military establishment. American officials have said Mr. Davis's team was involved in gathering intelligence on Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group under the wing of Pakistan's spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence.
The Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Mr. Davis holds a diplomatic passport and was issued an official business visa by the ministry, Deputy Attorney General Naveed Inayat Malik told the court on Monday. He said the ministry did not have any records on Mr. Davis's diplomatic immunity status.
Justice Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry complained that the government had not submitted a clear opinion on whether Mr. Davis was entitled to immunity and ruled that the issue could be decided by the court considering the murder charges.
The Davis case has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan and their intelligence agencies. The United States has made strenuous efforts to have Mr. Davis released.
The American Embassy, which had hoped for a clear confirmation of Mr. Davis's diplomatic status by the court on Monday, could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Betting on Ships, Carlyle To Form Joint Venture

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
8:19 p.m. Updated
The private equity giant Carlyle Group has raised its bet on the Chinese economy, announcing on Monday a $5 billion joint venture to buy shipping vessels and related assets in the region. 
Carlyle, along with Tiger Group Investments, Washington Family, the Seaspan Corporation and Seaspan executives Gerry Wang and Graham Porter,plans to commit up to $900 million in capital over the next five years.
''We believe there is a compelling opportunity to serve Asia's continuing growth in demand for shipping capacity and are pleased to partner with Gerry and Graham, who have a track record of success in the region,'' Yi Luo, managing director for Carlyle's Asian buyout group, said in a statement.
The joint venture represents Carlyle's growing interest in China and the surrounding region, which has greatly benefited from its strong economic growth. The investment group, led by Seaspan's chief executive, Mr. Wang, and its managing director, Mr. Porter, will focus primarily on China's shipbuilders and lenders.
''There is increasing desire among Chinese state-owned entities to control the ships that transport their goods around the world,'' Mr. Wang said in a statement.
Carlyle's push comes at an opportune time. The overcapacity in the industry has pushed down vessel prices while shipping services are increasingly in demand, says Georgi Slavov, the head of dry freight research at ICAP. Last year, Chinese exports surged to $1.51 billion, according to the C.I.A. World Factbook. And the country's continuing industrialization - which depends on natural resources like coal and iron ore from neighboring countries - should help fuel imports.
''The entire Pacific region is doing well in terms of industrial growth,'' said Mr. Slavov. ''There will be massive government spending on infrastructure, which will, in turn, generate more trade flows.''
Since the financial downturn, officials in China have persuaded banks to offer more loans to domestic and foreign ship buyers, according to Maria Bertzeletou, an analyst at the shipbroker Golden Destiny. She estimates that industry loans have increased roughly 10 percent over the last few years.
''More international ship buyers are starting to seek financing in China thanks to the Chinese government's encouragement,'' she said. ''Chinese banks have provided several billion dollars of loans to Western ship buyers since September 2008.''
Other private equity firms could follow Carlyle. There are potential deals in the European region, where shipping companies, battered by the recent credit crisis, are in need of capital, Ms. Bertzeletou said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Anxiety and Need Overwhelm a Nation

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and MARK McDONALD; Martin Fackler reported from Natori, Japan, and Mark McDonald from Tokyo. Reporting was contributed by Mac Bishop from Fukushima, Japan, Moshe Komata and Hiroko Tibuchi from Tokyo, and Bettina Wassener from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
NATORI, Japan -- What the sea so violently ripped away, it has now begun to return. Hundreds of bodies are washing up along some shores in northeastern Japan, making clearer the extraordinary toll of the earthquake and tsunami that struck last week and adding to the burdens of relief workers as they ferry aid and search for survivors.
On Monday, various reports from police officials and news agencies said that as many as 2,000 bodies had now washed ashore along the coastline, overwhelming the capacity of local officials. That, combined with the country's unfolding nuclear disaster and a regionwide stock market plunge, has become what Prime Minister Naoto Kandescribed as Japan's worst crisis since World War II.
About 350,000 people have reportedly been left homeless and are staying in shelters, awaiting news of friends and relatives among the many thousands who remain unaccounted for. The national police said early Tuesday that more than 15,000 were missing, though just 2,475 deaths had been confirmed since the quake, which the U.S. Geological Survey revised to a magnitude of 9.0, from 8.9, on Monday. 
With police officials estimating that 10,000 people may have been swept away in one town alone, Minamisanriku, north of here, there was every expectation that the toll would rise.
The disruptions to Japan's $5 trillion economy, the third-largest in the world, and collective anxiety over the stricken reactors caused a rout in the Japanese stock market that reverberated across the region on Tuesday.
A steep decline in the Japanese stock market, which lost 13 percent by midday Tuesday, sent other Asian markets tumbling. The Bank of Japan, which injected a record $183.8 billion into the economy on Monday to maintain liquidity, poured in tens of billions of dollars more on Tuesday, which failed to halt the slide.
Here in Natori, where some of the first pictures of the tsunami showed a towering initial wave lashing a line of trees, all that remains along the coast is a field of black mud. Brightly clad searchers bent to their work Monday -- the police in navy blue, the handlers of sniffer dogs in orange, the military squads in camouflage.
They made their way around marooned boats and collapsed houses, finding toys, torn bedding, tangled fishing nets and pieces of cars, toilets or pottery, all the mundane pieces of daily life, now broken. Occasionally, too, they found a body, sometimes already covered by a tarp.
The region continues to face widespread power and water shortages. When relief supplies do come, residents clamor for help. At Natori City Hall, survivors quickly lined up at a truck handing out large containers of water. Lines of nearly a mile formed in front of stations providing gasoline.
At City Hall, officials in this town of 70,000 residents have posted a list of the 8,340 people who arrived safely at 41 makeshift shelters. Dozens of people crammed into the building's small lobby to pore over the lists.
Those who could not find the name they sought wrote out messages on pieces of paper, and taped them to the entrance. Hundreds of pieces hung there.
Mikako Watanabe, 26, and Yumiko Watanabe, 24, were looking for their mother. They were at work when the tsunami struck, but their mother was napping at home in the Yuriage neighborhood, as she always did after her night shift as a nurse.
''I hope she woke up with the earthquake and got to safety in time,'' the older sister said. ''We have no way to contact her.''
On Monday, three days after the tsunami, they still had no word of her. Their message said, ''Yurika Watanabe, we're looking for you. Contact us if you see this.''
But communications are badly broken. With cellphone service largely knocked out, many residents are relying on the small number of surviving pay phones.
Some meetings are by chance. In the crowds, there were squeals of joy at reunions -- and crying for relatives not found. One woman wailed over and over, ''Her name is not on the list! Her name is not on the list!'' She said she was looking for her sister-in-law, who lived in Yuriage. She said that if she is not at an evacuation center, she must be dead.
Rescue teams from 13 countries pressed on with the searches. One used a German shepherd and a small spaniel in Yuriage. The shepherd would climb around the wreckage of homes and twisted hulks of cars, sniffing. If he started barking, the team sent in the spaniel, small enough to prowl around the crevices of the wreckage.
In one case, the spaniel also barked. The team began digging in the debris, but found nothing. ''Is there anyone here? Is there anyone alive?'' They yelled as they dug. A member of the team said that there was now a scant chance of survivors, and the dogs were finding only corpses.
Off in the distance, a small cluster of buildings stood undamaged on the sad expanse of the mud flats. Outlined against the afternoon sky, they seemed like tombstones.
Such was the rubble that soldiers used olive-drab power shovels and construction equipment to cut roads through the mountains of debris.
In the air, helicopters shuttled back and forth constantly, part of a mobilization of some 100,000 troops, the largest since World War II. Several convoys could be seen on the road to Sendai, a larger city to the north.
Some firefighters in Natori had arrived from as far away as the southern city of Hiroshima, reflecting the fact that rescuers had descended from across Japan.
In addition, helicopters and ships from the United States Seventh Fleet, including the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, had joined the tsunami relief effort.
Farther south, in the city of Fukushima, gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants were closed, and convenience stores had no food or drinks to sell -- only cigarettes. Red Cross water tankers dispensed drinking water to Fukushima residents who waited in long, orderly lines.
Because of the Fukushima nuclear plants being lost to the national power grid, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the plants, announced plans for rolling blackouts across the region to conserve electricity -- the first controlled power cutbacks in Japan in 60 years.
Tokyo-area residents worriedly followed a series of confusing statements from the power company about the location and duration of the power reductions. Just after 5 p.m., the utility said it had started cutting power to parts of two prefectures -- Ibaraki, north of Tokyo, and Shizuoka, south of the capital.
Tokyo was feeling the effects, too. Residents had struggled to get to work Monday as a number of important commuter rail lines ran on limited schedules. Six lines featuring Japan's famous shinkansen, or bullet trains, were not running. Six major department stores also closed for the day because workers were unable to reach the city.
The rush hour Tuesday morning was nearly as chaotic as commuters were unsure whether trains and subways would be operating. The power company's announcements continued to be misleading and unclear, and the company came under criticism from the central government.
The first set of blackouts Tuesday morning began in four prefectures outside Tokyo. The utility, which provides service to 45 million people in the region, said the cuts could continue for six weeks.
Public conservation of electricity was significant enough, the company said, that the more drastic blackout scenarios were being scaled back. Still, anticipating deep and lengthy power cuts, many people were stocking up on candles, water, instant noodles and batteries for radios.
Toyota also announced it was closing all its factories until at least Thursday, and in the stock market, shares in the car sector fell as much as 6 percent.
The U.S. Geological Survey recorded 96 aftershocks on Sunday, and many Japanese were alarmed at several earthquake warnings that appeared as televised bulletins on Monday. A warning at 4 p.m., an alert announced by gentle trilling bells told of expected ''strong shaking'' across the entire waist of Japan, essentially from Tokyo to Kyoto.

HEADLINE: China's Energy Industry Makes a Bold Push Into Developed Markets

BYLINE: By CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
PetroChina agreed last month to buy a 50 percent stake in a Canadian gas venture for $5.4 billion. If the deal goes through, it will be the largest overseas acquisition on record for the Chinese oil company.
The transaction will also signify a shift in the merger and acquisition strategy of the Chinese energy industry. For decades, major players like PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc focused on building out their operations in politically volatile regions like Sudan, Venezuela and Iran. Now, they are competing with the multinational giants on their own turf, striking partnerships and joint ventures in the United States, Canada and Latin America.
China is becoming an important driver of energy mergers. In 2009 and 2010, Chinese oil companies struck nearly $50 billion of deals outside their borders, roughly 5 percent of the industry total. 
The effort comes as companies in more developed markets are pulling back or divesting assets. Last year, majors like Statoil, ConocoPhillips and BP were net sellers.
Deal-making is part of the country's broader energy goals. With a population of 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy, China is the world's largest energy consumer and the biggest polluter.
But its energy demands are quickly outstripping its supplies, leaving the economy vulnerable to disruptions like the current Middle East turmoil. China, once Asia's most important oil exporter, started importing in 1993. With domestic production stagnating, the country generated 3.99 million barrels a day - less than half the annual consumption. The International Energy Agency estimates China will have to rely on imports for 79 percent of its oil needs by 2030.
''They have a lot of money, a lack of energy security, and their import dependency is not getting any better,'' said Paul Ting, an expert on China energy policy who runs an industry consultancy firm. ''They've just got to get energy any way they can.''
The country's oil majors recognized the supply problem decades ago. After Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy, PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc slowly moved to expand overseas. With large multinationals or state-run companies already in control of the better oil fields, Chinese players had to focus on the more volatile and politically vulnerable regions.
''They were late-comers to the game, and a lot of the good assets were taken,'' said Julie Jiang, an analyst at the International Energy Agency. ''They went to difficult areas.''
In 1996, PetroChina's parent entered Sudan, which has a history of civil war and human rights abuses that has kept many multinationals away. Despite worldwide protests, PetroChina built a significant operation in the territory, which now accounts for 3 percent of China's oil imports. The big three now operate in 31 countries, including Angola, Venezuela and, until recently, Libya.
Before the financial crisis, ''their reputation greatly exceeded what they were doing,'' said Erica S. Downs, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written on Chinese oil companies' changing strategies. ''If you look at 2009 and 2010, they're going for bigger-ticket items. They want to compete with the Exxon Mobils and the Shells of the world.''
PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc declined to comment.
Buyers are treading more cautiously than in the past. In 2005, Cnooc made an $18.5 billion hostile bid for Unocal in the United States. The prominent deal was quickly quashed by political opposition - a humbling experience that prompted the Chinese to reassess their aggressive stance overseas.
Now, the country's energy leaders are moving into the Americas in friendlier ways by taking smaller stakes or creating joint ventures. Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, said that even the banner year the major players had in 2010 was characterized by nothing more than a ''steady stream of midsized deals.'' For example, Sinopec joined up with Total of France to buy a 9 percent stake in Syncrude, a unit of ConocoPhillips in Houston, for $4.65 billion.
Chinese oil companies ''are on a steep learning curve, but they've come up it quite some way,'' said a banker familiar with the industry deal-making who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ''They're all conversant with Western culture and Western deal-doing.''
They're also learning to play politics. When Cnooc announced it was buying one-third of Chesapeake Energy's south Texas shale assets for $1.1 billion last October, it established the first successful onshore move by a Chinese oil company in the United States.
According to people with knowledge of the deal, Cnooc got the transaction ''precleared'' by the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel that monitors national security issues related to mergers and acquisitions. Cnooc management would not have gone ahead without that tacit approval, the people said.
''It's not like there's a prohibition on Chinese companies buying energy assets in the United States,'' said Bob Schlossberg, a partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Washington. ''But politics, let's face it, does play a part.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China's Premier Points to Inflation As the Government's Top Priority

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE and JONATHAN ANSFIELD

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, answering prescreened questions at an annual news conference, said Monday that China faced daunting challenges of taming inflation and developing a more consumer-based economy, and that the government would allow the nation's currency to appreciate but at a cautious pace in order to protect Chinese jobs and businesses.
In a plodding two-and-a-half-hour news conference at the conclusion of this year's national legislative conference, Mr. Wen said China's grass-roots elections should be expanded to higher levels of government, but stressed that change must occur ''step by step,'' under the control of the Communist Party. 
On the delicate topic of the revolts and revolutions that have besieged authoritarian Arab governments in recent months, he said China's record of speedy economic growth and fast-rising living standards made analogies with those countries ''not right.''
Mr. Wen spoke as the National People's Congress, in a vote whose results were preordained, approved the country's new five-year development plan. Its strategy promises a surge in government spending on domestic security and social programs like medical insurance, but offers little in the way of legal, political or banking reform. One principal goal, the government has said, is to lessen economic dependence on factory exports and build up innovation and domestic consumption.
Mr. Wen described the war on inflation as the government's top priority. Figures released three days earlier showed that consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in February compared with the same month a year before, the latest in a series of indications that China's economy is beginning to overheat.
The prime minister partly blamed international factors for the soaring costs, among them spiking oil prices because of the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. He also pointed to looser monetary policy in the United States, where the Federal Reserve had expanded monetary supply in recent months -- a policy known as quantitative easing -- in an effort to assist the economy.
But Mr. Wen also said China must continue to ''mop up excess liquidity'' at home if it is to hold prices in check. China has repeatedly ordered banks to issue less credit to curtail the money supply.
Figures issued Monday suggested that the restrictions could be taking hold. Compared with the same period a year ago, bank lending slowed in February, as did the growth in the money supply, as broadly measured by a yardstick known as M2.
Besides tightening monetary policy, Mr. Wen said, the government will hold local officials more strictly accountable for curbing housing prices and food prices. ''Inflation is like a tiger,'' he said. ''Once set free, it will be very difficult to put the tiger back in its cage. We must not take this issue lightly.''
Economists have urged China to allow the renminbi to appreciate in value to help curb inflation. But internationally, critics say that China artificially holds down the value of the renminbi against the dollar and other currencies to increase its exports. American officials also argue that this keeps the cost of American goods high and so limits China's imports.
Mr. Wen promised that the increase in the renminbi's value would continue. But he added: ''It should be a gradual process because we must bear in mind its impact on Chinese businesses and the employment situation.''
He stressed that China's five-year target of a 7 percent annual rise in the gross domestic product should not be considered low, insisting, ''it will not be easy for us to achieve.'' That is a drop, however, from the 7.5 percent goal of the past five years, which was ludicrously low: the economy grew an average of more than 11 percent annually during that period.
Mr. Wen reiterated his position that a lack of political reform could threaten China's economic advances, singling out corruption as the Communist Party's single biggest threat. He praised the development of village and local elections, saying, ''If we are to address the people's grievances and meet their wishes, we must create conditions for people to criticize and supervise the government.''
But Mr. Wen, who mentioned the need to reform China's political system just once in the annual work report he submitted to the legislature, was no less circumspect at the news conference.
He stressed that any change must take place under the leadership of the Communist Party. ''It requires a stable and harmonious social environment, and it needs to be taken forward in an orderly way,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Miami-Dade Mayor Faces Special Vote To Keep Job

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Mayor Carlos Alvarez of Miami-Dade County faces a recall vote on Tuesday that has tapped into the frustration of an area still reeling from a decimated housing market and stubbornly high unemployment. 
The effort was spearheaded by a billionaire auto dealer and Miami philanthropist, Norman Braman, who used more than $1 million of his own money to gather signatures. Mr. Braman's consultants collected 114,000 signatures; 95,000 of them were certified for the recall.
''This whole election is a referendum for change,'' said Mr. Braman, who emphasized that residents were fed up with incompetent elected officials in the county. ''If Alvarez is removed, it shows that people want change.''
An anti-tax advocate, Mr. Braman began the petition drive soon after Mr. Alvarez proposed raising property taxes for 40 percent of Miami-Dade homeowners last summer to plug a large budget deficit, a result of plunging property values. The Miami-Dade County Commission approved the budget. At the same time, unionized county employees whose wages had been frozen were due for a raise under a prior agreement and to have some of their benefits reinstated.
But the criticism reached beyond agreements with unions and property tax increases. The once-popular mayor, who was first elected in 2004, gave hefty raises to top aides in 2009, at the height of the recession, and also used a government car allowance to help pay for a BMW.
''No one ever challenged these things here,'' Mr. Braman said, explaining his decision to move forward with the recall. ''That's why he did it and the commission did it. It's impossible to challenge things here.''
The campaign against the mayor was strong, and early voting has been heavy. If he is recalled, commissioners would have 30 days from the election's certification to appoint a new mayor or to hold a special election. The next scheduled election is in 2012.
Mayor Alvarez, who seemed surprised by the intensity of the effort and the voter anger that followed, has accused Mr. Braman of misconstruing his record to settle old scores.
Victoria Mallette, the mayor's communications director, said that in the past four years the mayor had managed to close more than $1 billion in budget gaps while preserving an array of services. He has also received major concessions from unionized employees, including wage and benefits freezes. And she emphasized that 60 percent of property owners would see no property tax rate increase at a time when deficits were ballooning.
''There is a level of misplaced anger in the community, and that is why we're asking them to get informed on the issues and to understand,'' Ms. Mallette said. ''The government has reduced spending. We have shrunk the size of government and preserved services. Employees have made sacrifices.''
If successful, the recall would be the second largest in terms of population, behind only the removal of Gov. Gray Davis of California in 2003.

HEADLINE: Shares Tumble as Investors Worry About Japan

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
Stock markets plunged in Japan and across the rest of the Asia-Pacific region on Tuesday amid fears of the impact of the nuclear disaster and resulting concerns about radiation exposure.
The Nikkei 225 index, already badly mauled on Monday, plummeted as much as 14.4 percent on Tuesday to its lowest in two years, exacerbating the 6.2 percent slump the previous day, as warnings about a potential nuclear disaster in the country aggravated the pain already felt by the quake and tsunami. The broader Topix, or Tokyo Stock Price index, sank 14 percent.
Despite the damage in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami and its threat to global supply chains, economists said that unless the crisis at Japan's nuclear reactors worsened, the effect would probably be limited. Still, it comes at a precarious time for the world economy, with the United States and parts of Europe only recently showing signs of job growth and a broader economic recovery. 
''This is a major catastrophe for Japan, and it is yet another negative shock for the rest of the world,'' said David G. Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. ''The question is: How much does it set back world growth, and the answer is a bit,'' Mr. Blanchflower said, speaking on Monday before conditions worsened at the nuclear facility.
As the crisis at stricken nuclear plants north of Tokyo threatened an energy squeeze for major Japanese automakers and electronics giants, Jens Nordvig, an economist at Nomura in New York, said that there would probably be spillover effects outside Japan, though the global impact was likely to be small.
Nomura lowered its estimate for Japanese growth this year to about 0.9 percent from 1.3 percent. But the move ''is too little to mean we are going to take any of the other numbers outside Japan down,'' Mr. Nordvig said.
Investors in the United States were also nervous about the long-term implications for the economy as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped to a six-week low. The index fell more than 1 percent during the day before recovering slightly to close down 7.89 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,296.39.
Shares of uranium producers were hit hard, as Japanese engineers struggled to prevent a meltdown and analysts contemplated a worldwide slowdown or even a freeze in construction of nuclear power plants.
The stock prices of some of the world's big insurance companies also slipped as the markets looked to who would pay the bill for the devastation wreaked by the earthquake and tsunami.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 14.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,700.97. The Dow Jones industrial average also dropped 51.24 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 11,993.16.
Among the hardest hit industrial companies was General Electric, which designed the nuclear reactors at the stricken Fukushima plant in northern Japan. It fell 2.2 percent on the day.
Earlier on Monday, oil prices also dropped as markets worried that any slowdown in Japan, one of the world's biggest importers of oil, would crimp world demand. But later prices rose again on concerns in the Middle East after Saudi Arabian troops moved into Bahrain as part of a regional force. Spot oil prices ended the day up 3 cents to $101.19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Investors are still trying to assess the impact of the disaster in Japan. Economists said it would probably deal a short-term blow to the Japanese economy. Barclays estimated it could ultimately cost the country $183 billion.
By contrast, any impact on American companies would probably be muted, experts said. Morgan Stanley estimated that exports to Japan accounted for less than 0.5 percent of the United States gross domestic product.
''Given this relatively small weighting, we expect no noticeable direct impact on the U.S. economy,'' the Morgan Stanley team wrote in a research note.
Analysts also rushed to calculate the ''repatriation risk'' as Japanese investors with money abroad rushed to bring it home -- for reconstruction or to have readier access to their savings.
With interest rates at home near zero, Japanese investors have looked elsewhere for higher yields. Japan is the second largest holder of United States Treasury bonds, after China, and any withdrawal on a large scale could put some upward pressure on interest rates in the United States.
Guy Lebas, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said there was some evidence of that kind of capital flow late last week immediately after the earthquake and tsunami.
But on Monday, as fears about nuclear reactors increased, this was offset by investors around the world pouring money back into Treasuries as they sought a haven, causing yields to fall.
In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32 to 102 8/32. The yield fell to 3.36 percent, from 3.4o percent late Friday.
In Europe, where economies like those of Britain, Ireland and Greece are still weak, stock markets slipped back.
In London, the FTSE 100 ended down 53.43 points, or 0.9 percent, at 5,775.24. In Frankfurt, the DAX index lost 1.7 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.3 percent.
Despite the concerns about Japan, European stock markets appeared to be bolstered by an agreement that European leaders struck early Saturday on measures intended to end the euro zone debt crisis, in part by injecting more flexibility into the way a bailout fund for the euro can be used. The deal bolstered government bond prices in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

HEADLINE: The Sport Needs To Change

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Dave Duerson was once a world-class athlete, a perfect physical specimen whose pro football career included Super Bowl championships with the Chicago Bears and New York Giants. Friends and former teammates would tell you that he was also a bright guy -- a graduate of Notre Dame with a degree in economics and, at least for awhile, a successful businessman.
When he shot himself to death in his South Florida home last month, the despondent Duerson, who was 50, fired the bullet into his chest rather than into his head. He did not want to further damage his brain. As he explained in text messages and a handwritten note, the former all-pro safety wanted his brain tissue studied, presumably to determine whether he had been suffering from a devastating degenerative disease that is taking a terrible toll on what appears to be an increasing number of pro football players and other athletes. 
As The Times has reported, Duerson wrote, ''Please, see that my brain is given to the N.F.L.'s brain bank.''
Professional football has a big, big problem on its hands, and I'm not talking about the lockout that is jeopardizing the 2011 season. The game is chewing up players like a meat grinder. The evidence is emerging of an extraordinary number of players struggling with lifelong physical debilitation, depression, dementia and many other serious problems linked to their playing days.
Duerson's concern was believed to have been centered on chronic traumatic encephalopathy, an incurable disease associated with depression and dementia in athletes who played violent sports like football and boxing. A number of retired football players, including some who took their own lives, were found to have had the disease, which can only be diagnosed post-mortem.
Pro football, the nation's most popular sport, had been ratcheting up its violence quotient for years. Fans loved it. But a backlash has developed as more and more stories come to light about the awful price retired players are paying for a sport that increasingly resembles Colosseum-like combat. Few players escape unscathed after years of brain-rattling, joint-crippling, bone-breaking, consciousness-altering collisions. Many live out their lives in chronic pain, varying degrees of paralysis, and all manner of cognitive and emotional distress.
The N.F.L. has taken some remedial steps, especially in the area of head injuries. But pro football, always violent, is now violent in the extreme, and there is some question as to whether that violent style of play -- and the consequences that flow from it -- can really be changed. Paul Tagliabue, a former N.F.L. commissioner, told The New Yorker about the comments of a group of former players who had looked closely at the way defensive play has changed. ''They raised the idea,'' said Tagliabue, ''that it was no longer tackle football. It was becoming collision football. The players looked like bionic men.''
I am an enormous fan of football, but I get a queasy feeling when I see one of those tremendous hits that leaves the opposing player lying as if lifeless on the turf. Or when I read about players like Andre Waters, formerly of the Philadelphia Eagles and Arizona Cardinals, who shot himself to death in 2006 at the age of 44. A forensic pathologist said Waters's brain tissue looked like that of an 85-year-old man. It turned out that he had been suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the disease that Duerson may have feared.
This is an enormous tragedy. So many players are suffering in the shadows. They need much more help from the N.F.L., the players' union and the myriad others cashing in on a sport that has become a multibillion-dollar phenomenon. And big changes are needed in the rules, equipment and culture of the sport to cut down on the carnage inflicted on current and future players.
I once was a big fan of boxing. I marveled at the breathless, elaborately detailed stories my parents' generation told about Joe Louis and the unparalleled Sugar Ray Robinson. I followed Muhammad Ali's career from beginning to end. I read biographies of the great boxers of the 20th century.
But I also saw the televised fight in March 1962 in which Emile Griffith beat Benny (Kid) Paret so savagely that Paret died 10 days later. Robinson also killed a man in the ring, Jimmy Doyle, in a fight in 1947. And it's no secret that even the greatest fighters tended to end up in bad shape, demented or enfeebled from the punishment of their trade -- Louis, Robinson, Ali, so many others. I haven't been able to watch the sport in years.
It's a very bad sign that chronic traumatic encephalopathy, long associated with boxing, is now linked to football. With the carnage increasingly emerging from the shadows, there is no guarantee that football's magical hold on the public will last. Players are not just suffering, some are dying. The sport needs to change.

HEADLINE: Saudis' Show of Force Spotlights Their Anxiety

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even before Saudi Arabiasent troops into Bahrain on Monday to quell an uprising it fears might spill across its own borders, American officials were increasingly concerned that the kingdom's stability could ultimately be threatened by regional unrest, succession politics and its resistance to reform.
So far, oil-rich Saudi Arabia has successfully stifled public protests with a combination of billions of dollars in new jobs programs and an overwhelming police presence, backed by warnings last week from the foreign minister to ''cut any finger that crosses into the kingdom.''
Monday's action, in which more than 2,000 Saudi-led troops from gulf states crossed the narrow causeway into Bahrain, demonstrated that the Saudis were willing to back their threats with firepower.
The move created another quandary for the Obama administration, which obliquely criticized the Saudi action without explicitly condemning the kingdom, its most important Arab ally. The criticism was another sign of strains in the historically close relationship with Riyadh, as the United States pushes the country to make greater reforms to avert unrest. 
Other symptoms of stress seem to be cropping up everywhere.
Saudi officials have made no secret of their deep displeasure with how President Obama handled the ouster of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, charging Washington with abandoning a longtime ally. They show little patience with American messages about embracing what Mr. Obama calls ''universal values,'' including peaceful protests.
When Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were forced to cancel visits to the kingdom in recent days, American officials were left wondering whether the cause was King Abdullah's frail health -- or his pique at the United States.
''They're not in a mode for listening,'' said one senior administration official, referring to the American exchanges with Saudi officials over the past two months about the need to get ahead of the protests that have engulfed other Arab states, including two of Saudi Arabia's neighbors, Bahrain and Yemen. In recent days, Washington has tried to focus on the areas where its strategic interests and those of Saudi Arabia intersect most crucially: counterterrorism, containing Iran and keeping oil flowing.
The Americans fear that the unrest sweeping the Middle East is coming at a bad time for the Saudis, and their concerns have increased in recent weeks, partly because of the continued tumult in Bahrain. Many of the issues driving the protests elsewhere are similar to those in Riyadh: an autocratic ruling family resistant to sharing power, surrounded by countries in the midst of upheaval. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's leadership is in question. King Abdullah, 87, is, by all accounts, quite ill, as is the crown prince.
The latest tensions between Washington and Riyadh began early in the crisis when King Abdullah told President Obama that it was vital for the United States to support Mr. Mubarak, even if he began shooting protesters. Mr. Obama ignored that counsel. ''They've taken it personally,'' said one senior American familiar with the conversations, ''because they question what we'd do if they are next.''
Since then, the American message to the Saudis, the official said, is that ''no one can be immune,'' and that the glacial pace of reforms that Saudi Arabia has been engaged in since 2003 must speed up.
But the Saudi effort to defuse serious protests appears to take a different approach: a huge police presence, which smothered relatively small demonstrations in Riyadh and the Eastern Province last Friday; an appeal to the innate religious conservatism of the country; and an effort to throw more cash at Saudi citizens, who have become accustomed to the ultimate welfare state.
This month, Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, the interior minister and No. 2 in the line of succession, publicly underscored the kingdom's ban on demonstrations. The government called in top Saudi newspaper editors to dictate how to report on protests foreign and domestic. The country's senior religious clerics condemned public protests for not conforming to Islamic law. These steps built on $36 billion in pay raises, housing support, unemployment benefits and other subsidies that King Abdullah promised to keep the peace.
''All this is about social control in Saudi Arabia,'' said Christopher Boucek, who studies the Middle East at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''People have been forecasting the fall of Saudi for a long time, and they've always been proved wrong. It's a pretty resilient place.''
One of President Obama's top advisers described the moves as more in a series of ''safety valves'' the Saudis open when pressure builds; another called the subsidies ''stimulus funds motivated by self-preservation.''
Saudi officials, who declined to comment for this article to avoid fueling talk of divisions between the allies, said that the tensions had been exaggerated and that Americans who criticized the pace of reforms did not fully appreciate the challenges of working in the kingdom's ultraconservative society.
Even as Libya has occupied much of the public debate, White House officials have said they have been focused most intently on the two Arab allies whose fates are most tied to American strategic interests: Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In a briefing for reporters last Thursday, Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, said that ''the success of the democratic transformation under way in Egypt is absolutely critical,'' and described his own conversations with its interim leadership. Mrs. Clinton will be visiting Cairo this week.
But Mr. Donilon, like other administration officials, said very little about the conversations they have held with Saudi leaders. Those have been strained in part by the slow-motion transition of power: King Abdullah, a popular monarch who just returned to the country after months of medical treatment in New York and Morocco, has been described by Saudi specialists as reform-minded but constrained by more conservative family members; the country's next in line, Crown Prince Sultan, is also severely ill.
''We've focused on Nayef and a next generation, who seem to understand a lot better what's got to happen,'' said one American official, referring to the Saudi interior minister, whom some Saudi experts view as a conservative who would take the kingdom backward, while others say that is a misreading and that he is more aligned with members of the next generation of Saudi princes who favor reforms.
In a relationship where the United States hardly has the upper hand, so far the discussions have largely steered clear of democratization and focused on safer subjects: energy and foreign threats.
Saudi Arabia has helped stabilize world energy prices by increasing its crude-oil production to make up for the loss of Libya's oil.
In the case of Bahrain, the senior official said, the administration's goal has been to enlist the Saudis' help to open up the Bahraini political system without overthrowing the government. Instead, the arrival of the Saudi-led troops underscored the approach advocated by Riyadh: Crack down and allow no room for dissent.
At a press briefing on Monday, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, carefully avoided direct criticism of the Saudi-led entry of gulf forces into Bahrain, telling reporters that, in the view of the White House, ''this is not an invasion of the a country.'' But he added: ''We're calling on the Saudis, the other members of the G.C.C. countries, as well as the Bahraini government, to show restraint. And we believe that political dialogue is the way to address the unrest that has occurred in the region in Bahrain and in other countries, and not to, in any way, suppress it.''
Some officials say that in some ways the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia may grow closer, particularly on security and counterterrorism issues, where there has been increased cooperation in the months before the protests began in the Middle East.
John O. Brennan, President Obama's counterterrorism adviser, speaks regularly with Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, his Saudi counterpart and the son of the interior minister, most recently last week about the political tumult in Yemen and the threat from Al Qaeda, an administration official said.
In the past several months, the Saudis have played a pivotal role in helping to thwart several terrorist plots. Prince Nayef alerted the Obama administration last October that bombs might be on cargo flights bound for the United States. A frantic search turned up two shipments containing printer cartridges packed with explosives, sent from Yemen by a Qaeda affiliate, and addressed to synagogues in Chicago.
The American military's longstanding ties to the Saudi armed forces have also weathered the recent diplomatic tempest. More than 4,100 Saudi and American soldiers conducted a training exercise in northwestern Saudi Arabia last week.
Demonstrating to Iran that the Saudi-American alliance remains strong has emerged as a critical objective of the Obama administration. King Abdullah, who was widely quoted in the State Department cables released by WikiLeaks as warning that the United States had to ''cut off the head of the snake'' in Iran, has led the effort to contain Iran's ambitions to become a major regional power. In the view of White House officials, any weakness or chaos inside Saudi Arabia would be exploited by Iran.
For that reason, several current and former senior American intelligence and regional experts warned that in the months ahead, the administration must proceed delicately when confronting the Saudis about social and political reforms.
''Over the years, the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been fraught with periods of tension over the strategic partnership,'' said Ellen Laipson, president of the Stimson Center, a public policy organization. ''Post-September 11 was one period, and the departure of Mubarak may be another, when they question whether we are fair-weather friends.''

HEADLINE: Administration Invites N.R.A. to Meeting on Gun Policies, but It Declines

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- More than two months after the Tucson shootings, the administration is calling together both the gun lobby and gun safety groups to find common ground. But President Obama has no plans to take the lead in proposing further gun control legislation, aides say, and the nation's major gun rights group is snubbing the invitation.
On Tuesday, officials at the Justice Department will meet with gun control advocates in the first of what will be a series of meetings over the next two weeks with people on different sides of the issue, including law enforcement, retailers and manufacturers, to seek agreement on possible legislative or administrative actions. 
The effort follows Mr. Obama's call, in a column on Sunday in a Tucson newspaper, to put aside ''stale policy debates'' and begin ''a new discussion'' on ways to better enforce and strengthen existing laws to keep mentally unstable, violent and criminal people from getting guns.
But the National Rifle Association, for decades the most formidable force against proposals to limit gun sales or ownership, is refusing to join the discussion -- possibly dooming it from the start, given the lobby's clout with both parties in Congress. Administration officials had indicated they expected that the group would be represented at a meeting, perhaps on Friday.
''Why should I or the N.R.A. go sit down with a group of people that have spent a lifetime trying to destroy the Second Amendment in the United States?'' said Wayne LaPierre, the longtime chief executive of the National Rifle Association.
He named Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has almost no role in gun-related policies, and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.
''It shouldn't be a dialogue about guns; it really should be a dialogue about dangerous people,'' Mr. LaPierre said, adding that his group has supported proposals to prevent gun sales to the mentally ill, strengthen a national system of background checks and spur states to provide needed data.
Despite his opposition to joining the administration's table, by his comments in an interview Mr. LaPierre sounded at times like the White House.
For example, a White House adviser on Monday said Mr. Obama wanted to redefine the gun debate to ''focus on the people, not the guns.'' The president, in his column, cited the same policy areas Mr. LaPierre mentioned as fertile ground for consensus. And Mr. Obama emphasized, ''First, we should begin by enforcing laws that are already on the books'' -- a line long used by the gun lobby.
Mr. Obama's column in The Arizona Daily Star reflected his continued political caution toward an issue that for decades has polarized the country. In past weeks, aides had suggested he might give a public address expanding on his views about gun safety -- an option that has now been put aside.
Mr. Obama spoke at a memorial service in Tucson four days after a gunman on Jan. 8 killed six people and wounded 13, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords. But gun safety advocates, including a group of mayors headed by Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, called on Mr. Obama to do more, including endorsing legislation to ban high-capacity magazines like those used in the Arizona attack.
Several factors have inhibited him. With Republicans now a majority in the House, legislation restricting guns has little chance of passage. And many Democrats, including Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, are opposed to stirring controversy and provoking the N.R.A.'s membership to oppose them.
Also, the White House is focused on its economic message -- when it is not consumed by events abroad -- and likewise has little interest in distracting from that before the 2012 election season, aides say.
In the op-ed article, Mr. Obama did not recommend particular legislative remedies, including proposals that he had backed as a presidential candidate to reinstate a ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004 and to close a loophole for gun-show sales in the federal law requiring background checks of purchasers.
Instead, he emphasized his belief that the Constitution guarantees individuals' right to bear arms and boasted that ''my administration has not curtailed the rights of gun owners -- it has expanded them, including allowing people to carry their guns in national parks and wildlife refuges.''
Mr. Obama is trying on many issues, including deficit reduction, to stake out a middle ground that appeals to independent voters. Aides said polls showed that the gun issue was not a big one for independents, but that they did abhor political fights and favored politicians who compromise. The president played to that sentiment in his op-ed article -- and anticipated the rifle association's rebuff.
''Some will say nothing short of the most sweeping antigun legislation is a capitulation to the gun lobby,'' he wrote. ''Others will predictably cast any discussion as the opening salvo in a wild-eyed scheme to take away everybody's guns.''
''But,'' he added, ''I have more faith in the American people than that.''

HEADLINE: Will Cheating Hurt a German Politician? It Depends on the Kind

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- While Americans have been obsessing lately about Charlie Sheen and his live-in porn film stars, Germany has been consumed by improprieties over a doctoral thesis.
All the German talk shows, the front pages of the country's newspapers and magazines, its political pundits and comedians, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets or to the pages of Facebook, have had a field day indulging in very German-style hand-wringing and paroxysms of self-loathing over the moral, political and social ramifications of the case.
A German author, Peter Schneider, even gravely linked the whole mess to Bill Clinton's impeachment drama, since they both entailed what he called ''the same question of honesty.'' Leave it to a German intellectual to discern a deep connection between an American president dissembling about oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office and a doctoral student at Bayreuth University cribbing passages in a 475-page dissertation about contrasting constitutional developments.
Then again, Mr. Schneider has a point. 
The trouble started last month when this country's most popular cabinet minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a handsome, media-savvy, conspicuously pomaded 39-year-old baron widely presumed to be a leading candidate to succeed Angela Merkel someday as chancellor, tried to brush off charges that he had plagiarized parts of his 2006 thesis.
''Absurd,'' was his initial response. And many Germans wanted to believe him. ''Well-born, well-spoken and well-groomed,'' as The Economist observed about the baron, he had ''seemed blunt where others prevaricated, principled where they plotted. Alone among German leaders,'' the magazine went on, referring to the gray, proficient bureaucrats who tend to run the country, he made ''voters' hearts quicken.''
Ms. Merkel backed him up, even as German graduate students and others, by the tens of thousands, began to organize, signing an open letter of protest that heaped scorn on her. Several hundred protesters hung their shoes on the iron fence outside the Defense Ministry in Berlin in a sly (again, typically German) multivalent allusion both to the now familiar Arab insult of displaying the soles of one's shoes and also to the missing footnotes in Mr. Guttenberg's dissertation. Yet more outraged detractors organized rallies and brandished placards with wry slogans like ''No More Playing Doctor'' and ''Hair Gel Is Not a Crime!''
Ms. Merkel, a former academic married to a professor, was being accused of belittling intellectual property theft and, by implication, the value of an advanced degree, which is not a purely academic matter in this country. Many jobs require such degrees in Germany, where, as is not the case in America, calling oneself doctor for having completed a thesis in, say, political science or art history, is not embarrassing but normal, even when filling out Lufthansa's online booking forms. (The airline generously provides three levels of academic achievement for its overachieving countrymen: doctor, professor and professor doctor, skipping the extremely rare but not unheard-of German mouthful Herr Professor Doctor Doctor).
At the same time, however, Mr. Guttenberg's troubles thrust into embarrassing national relief the dirty secret that to gain such credentials, many Germans, well-connected ones anyway, apparently cut corners or worse, and universities often look the other way. The minister couldn't admit to having farmed out his dissertation, because that's literally a crime here, but he was generally suspected of having hired someone to write the work for him (how else to explain why he seemed so blithely oblivious to the contents of his own thesis?). And to add insult to injury, his advisers had even awarded him a rank of ''summa cum laude'' (''Summa cum fraude'' was another of those protesters' placards), notwithstanding that the thesis seems to have poached material from one of those very advisers.
Eventually, Mr. Guttenberg had no choice. He admitted to ''grave mistakes,'' whatever that meant, and on March 1 resigned. ''I was appointed not to be self-defense minister but defense minister,'' he said, as he tried to finesse the crisis. As a dashing stroke of noblesse oblige before retreating, not to his castle in Franconia, but to his apartment in Berlin, he then promised to donate salary still owed to him in office to families of German soldiers fallen in Afghanistan.
Academic protesters and many on the left declared the resignation a victory for people power, intellectual standards and national honor. The Peter Lorre-like smile that video cameras captured on Ms. Merkel's face when she got the news suggested more than relief. With significant state elections coming up, the flap gave her an occasion to appear both loyal to an ally more popular than herself with many conservatives and at the same time to get rid of the various political challenges the glamorous Mr. Guttenberg posed. But that was when the scandal really blew up.
The resignation became an excuse for daily installments of distinctly German navel-gazing, exposing social rifts not just between left and right and young and old, but also between the buttoned-down old-school German culture of probity and prideful integrity on the one hand, and a dawning celebrity culture, laced with irony and skepticism, on the other.
Many young Germans, it turns out, revere Mr. Guttenberg, partly, perhaps, because he pushed for a major overhaul of the military that would swap obligatory service for a volunteer force. But more, it seems, because, at a time when popular television shows like ''Germany's Next Top Model'' and ''Germany's Search for a Superstar'' have spread ''American Idol''-style hunger for fame to a country previously allergic to such things, he is a politician who has embraced the limelight.
That he is a rich aristocrat who dresses in jeans and says he rocks to AC/DC has only enhanced his youthful popularity. Germans are endearingly diehard democrats, egalitarians to a fault, but, like the rest of Europe, they take guilty pleasure in devouring gossip magazines about dissolute nobles and philandering princes.
Besides, Mr. Guttenberg's crime doesn't seem so bad to many in a generation of samplers and aggregators. Last year a teenage German author, Helene Hegemann, published a novel that became a finalist for the Leipzig Book Fair prize, despite plagiarism charges against her. The old German literary establishment, steeped in Goethe and Schiller, was appalled, but the book was about Berlin youth culture, where D.J.'s and artists sample all the time.
Ulf Poschardt, the editor of the German edition of Rolling Stone and one of the country's most contentious columnists, for the conservative Welt am Sonntag newspaper, finds the ouster of Mr. Guttenberg a classic and ''ridiculous example of German hypocrisy and ultra-moralistic Protestantism.''
''It's a sad thing,'' he lamented on the phone the other day. ''The worst thing you can say about him is that he was desperate to be a superstar, which was not very clever, but he also created an exciting atmosphere. He said no state money for General Motors and Opel if the market couldn't solve their economic problems, which was the opposite of what the German system has always said, and he called the war in Afghanistan a war, not a social engagement, like other politicians.''
Mr. Poschardt fumed in Welt Online recently that when news broke some years ago about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s plagiarizing parts of his dissertation, Americans hardly reacted. For Germans the nonchalance may seem as odd as it is for many Americans to hear that Horst Seehofer, the married chairman of Mr. Guttenberg's Christian Social Union, the Bavarian partner to Ms. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union, was elected to his post after it was reported that his mistress had given birth to a child. Germans debated his improprieties, but in the end overlooked them.
And this gets back to the author Mr. Schneider and the Clinton impeachment scandal.
Despite the cultural gulf, both incidents, the president's and the minister's, which were incited by peripheral, if not actually private, affairs, prompted fits of national anguish: for Americans about sex, for Germans about integrity.
But hypocrisy was the common thread. Rubber-necking was, too, of course, along with that universal German vice, schadenfreude.
The widespread expectation now is that Mr. Guttenberg, whose popularity has not dimmed but increased, according to the latest polls, will retreat for a while, and, like Mr. Clinton, after an obligatory period of remorse, come back. First he will have to contend with prosecutors, who the other day announced they had opened an investigation. Plagiarism entails breach of copyright crimes here. Meanwhile, Mr. Guttenberg formally transferred power to a new defense minister on Thursday evening in a slightly weird torch-lit military ceremony in which the outgoing minister traditionally chooses the music.
Mr. Guttenberg picked AC/DC.
The head conductor of the military band said that request ''just totally breaks the mold of our music styles,'' and substituted Deep Purple instead.
The song was ''Smoke on the Water.''

HEADLINE: A Possible '12 Candidate Starts Testing Themes

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
CHICAGO - Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi may not yet be a Republican presidential candidate, but his travel itinerary suggests that may be simply a formality, as he visited President Obama's hometown on Monday before flying to Iowa to begin testing themes of a probable campaign.-In a luncheon speech to the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Barbour delivered a sweeping indictment of the president's economic and energy policies, saying that expanding the size of government would not lead to the creation of more jobs in the United States.-''Let's look at their record,'' he said. ''In the last two years, the federal government spent $7 trillion and our economy lost seven million jobs. I guess we ought to be glad they didn't spend $12 trillion. 
We might have lost 12 million jobs.''-Mr. Barbour is among the wide field of Republicans who are considering entering the fight for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. He has said that he intends to make a decision after the Mississippi legislative session ends next month.-In a 30-minute address to business leaders, Mr. Barbour offered a preview to the message of his potential candidacy, with a heavy emphasis on traditional Republican themes of economic growth, job creation and increasing oil production through expanding drilling. He delivered more criticism than specific policy proposals. -''In fairness, the Obama administration arrived in office facing some of the worst economic conditions in decades,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''But for more than two years, this administration and its Congress has pursued policy after policy that created economic uncertainty or directly hurt the economy.''-As the country's energy policy takes on heightened importance with the turmoil in the Middle East and the nuclear disaster in the wake of the earthquake in Japan, he said: ''The Obama energy policy basically boils down to this: increase the price of energy so Americans will use less of it. That's an environmental policy, not an energy policy.''
He stopped well short of declaring his intentions. In a question following the speech, a man in the audience asked if Mr. Barbour was ready to announce his presidential bid.
''No,'' Mr. Barbour said, not pausing for even a moment. As laughter broke out in the room, he added: ''That was easy.''

HEADLINE: Main Witness Questioned In Galleon Trading Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Eric Piermont/Agence France-Presse - Getty ImagesRajat K. Gupta8:51 p.m. Updated
A Goldman Sachs director disclosed to Raj Rajaratnam in 2008 that the investment bank was weighing an acquisition of either Wachovia or American International Group, according to a wiretapped telephone conversation that was played in court on Tuesday.
Mr. Rajaratnam, co-founder of the hedge fund Galleon Group, is on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on insider trading charges. On Tuesday, a defense lawyer began his cross-examination of a main government witness who has pleaded guilty to passing illegal stock tips to Mr. Rajaratnam. 
But the most striking testimony came when prosecutors played a recording of a July 25, 2008, call between Mr. Rajaratnam and Rajat K. Gupta, then a Goldman director.
Mr. Rajaratnam, working from his Greenwich, Conn., home that day, told Mr. Gupta that he was meeting with Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman, later in the week. He asked Mr. Gupta about a rumor that Goldman might look to buy a commercial bank.

''This was a big discussion at a board meeting,'' Mr. Gupta said. He explained that the Goldman board was divided over whether buying a commercial bank made sense because it was a low-return business. Goldman was bearish on commercial banks, he said, but the board was ''opportunistic'' and if Wachovia ''was a good deal they'd go and buy Wachovia.''
Mr. Gupta also said that the board was weighing the acquisition of an insurance business, including A.I.G. ''Yes, A.I.G. was in the discussion mix,'' he said. Ultimately, Mr. Gupta concluded, ''I would be extremely surprised'' if there was ''anything imminent.''
The detailed discussion of Goldman's board meeting is the first time the government has disclosed specific comments made by Mr. Gupta to Mr. Rajaratnam about the bank's internal dealings while a director. The exchange also reveals the thinking of Goldman's board at a time when the bank was struggling as the financial crisis grew.
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.
The Securities and Exchange Commission brought a civil action this month against Mr. Gupta, who once ran the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, accusing him of passing illegal tips to Mr. Rajaratnam about Goldman and Procter & Gamble, where he also served as a director. The case recounted phone calls between the two men, but provided no detail of their content.
Mr. Gupta has not been charged criminally. Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, has said that the S.E.C.'s accusations are baseless.
The government concluded its direct examination Tuesday morning of Anil Kumar, a former senior executive at McKinsey, who has pleaded guilty to giving Mr. Rajaratnam confidential information about his clients.
Mr. Kumar testified that Mr. Gupta had numerous business dealings with Mr. Rajaratnam, including a partnership in a fund managed by Mr. Rajaratnam called Voyager that was unrelated to Galleon and that collapsed during the financial crisis.
During the cross-examination, John Dowd, Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer, attacked Mr. Kumar's credibility, depicting him as a cooperating witness in the government's back pocket and a cheat who did not pay his taxes.
''When you got caught, you pinned it all on Raj, didn't you?'' Mr. Dowd said.
Mr. Kumar, who spoke in a soft, scholarly tone during the direct examination, became combative. He raised his voice several octaves and repeatedly sparred with Mr. Dowd, shooting back clipped, rapid-fire retorts and mocking his questions with derisive laughter.
Mr. Dowd focused on the plan Mr. Kumar had set up in 2003 to receive secret payments from Mr. Rajaratnam and then invest them in Galleon. To avoid detection by McKinsey, Mr. Kumar established a shell company and opened a Swiss bank account in the company's name. Those payments were then redirected to an offshore Galleon account controlled by Mr. Kumar but opened in the name of his housekeeper.
Mr. Kumar told the jury that he did all this at the direction of Mr. Rajaratnam, who paid him more than $2 million.
On Monday, Mr. Dowd called Mr. Kumar's maneuvers ''a monstrous lie.''
''I'm not sure what you mean by 'monstrous,' '' Mr. Kumar said. ''I obeyed the instructions of Raj Rajaratnam, the managing partner of Galleon.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Import Prices Rise as Oil Surges

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- United States import prices rose for the fifth consecutive month in February as political turmoil in the Middle East helped push oil prices higher, a Labor Department report showed on Tuesday.
Import prices jumped 1.4 percent, significantly more than the consensus forecast of 0.9 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
Fuel import prices accounted for most of the increase, rising 4 percent. Nonfuel prices rose 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Japan's Crisis and Nuclear Power

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Japan's Multiple Calamities'' (editorial, March 15):
What kind of a shock would it take to jolt Americans into facing the fact that we are living beyond our environmental means? How about multiple meltdowns of plutonium-fueled reactors spewing death far and wide? Not even that, apparently.
Our politicians are telling us not to make any rash decisions about the viability of a nuclear future. After all, renewable sources, though safe, have only a comparatively puny output of power. 
Could we ourselves actually be the problem?
Houses that used to get along just fine on 60 amps of power have become obese and now need 400 amps to feed our ''essential'' luxuries. And we appear to be completely impotent to rein in a world population growth that is now about seven billion souls, each of whom will ''need'' more power.
None of the small stuff will matter if we do not address these larger questions. Carl Mezoff Stamford, Conn., March 15, 2011
The writer is an architect.
To the Editor:
I welcome your comment that while you think nuclear power remains a valuable tool, ''the public needs to know that it is a safe one.''
Reading and watching the horrifying news coming out of Japan, I have wondered whether my fellow Americans might better understand why we Nevadans have been so leery of and often angry at the proposal to locate the nation's first high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in our state.
Your newspaper has supported consideration of Yucca as a waste site and belittled our questions about its safety. Perhaps now you will rethink that.
Just as many Japanese have memories of the destruction at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some Nevadans recall being told that the mushroom clouds floating above the desert after aboveground atomic tests in the 1950s and 1960s were no threat at all; death and disease resulted from believing those claims.
Michael Green Las Vegas, March 15, 2011
The writer is a professor of history at the College of Southern Nevada.
To the Editor:
In a poignantly tragic twist of history, an accidental toxic catastrophe involving the peaceful use of nuclear energy is visited upon the only nation to have ever borne the brunt of intentionally inflicted nuclear explosions used as weapons of war.
Lest the Japanese reactor crisis serve to undermine the acceptance of expanding the use of nuclear power in our nation, consider the staggering costs in health, quality of life and loss of life experienced in the pursuit of fossil fuels.
These include coal miners who suffer or succumb to the effects of their exposure or who are trapped in their mines; wildlife and workers along America's Gulf Coast; and soldiers and civilians whose lives are cut short or forever damaged by conflict in the Middle East.
Without some proper perspective in our national discourse on energy policy, the strident rhetoric of those who would have us eternally reliant upon fossil fuels might drown out the more judicious voices. Lester R. Schwartz Weatogue, Conn., March 15, 2011
To the Editor:
The recent argument for nuclear power has been that it is the only large-scale energy source that is economically competitive with fossil fuels and that won't contribute to global warming. But as the horrible disaster in Japan is making clear, nuclear energy comes with many hidden costs.
These are already manifest in the government insurance that is necessary to raise capital to build reactors and in the government responsibility for nuclear waste disposal. Add to this the government responsibility for the costs of disaster management and recovery and for decommissioning ruined reactors, not to mention whatever dollar amount you want to assign to the lives lost or ruined in disasters, and the real costs soar.
Fossil fuels also have the hidden costs of climate change, which will likely dwarf those of nuclear power, as well as the costs of oil spills and other disasters and myriad government subsidies.
If all of these hidden costs were factored in, we might find that renewables are by far the cheapest source of energy. Kenneth Miller New York, March 15, 2011

HEADLINE: Feel Locked Out? Nothing to Tackle? Well, Try Opera

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
Lawrence Harris, an opera singer, poked the ballroom's faded carpet with the toe of his black alligator boot and said it reminded him of another arena he once performed in.
''It's like the Orange Bowl,'' he said, ''when we played the Miami Dolphins.''
Before Harris became a booming baritone, he was a brawny lineman with the N.F.L.'s Houston Oilers. Transitioning from audibles to arias would seem the most disharmonic of bridge passages, with the barbarity of football and the elegance of opera at opposite ends of the entertainment spectrum.
But Harris is not alone in making the switch. Opera singers with a football past include Ta'u Pupu'a, a lineman drafted by the Cleveland Browns; Keith Miller, a former Arena League fullback who appeared in two bowl games with Colorado; the former Harvard players Ray Hornblower and Noah Van Niel; and Morrison Robinson, who played on the offensive line for the Citadel. 
Maybe they were not as accomplished as the almost 1,700 professional players in the game today, but they hold one clear advantage over many of them that looms larger by the day: a viable career option outside football. Locked out by owners and with the 2011 season in jeopardy, some N.F.L. players may soon find themselves standing in the unemployment line, with few prospects for satisfying work performed before passionate admirers. Harris and company have found a way to stay in the spotlight.
Harris sang recently at a fund-raiser in New Rochelle, N.Y., headlined by the Italian tenor Marcello Giordani. After the concert, at V.I.P. Country Club, a woman approached Harris, who sang Tosti's ''Ridonami la Calma.''
''You have a beautiful voice,'' she said. ''No one would have expected that from you. How tall are you?''
Harris is 6 feet 5 inches and weighs considerably less than the 317 pounds he carried as a player. After the surprise wears off from a giant reed producing a glorious sound, what resonates is the role football played in his development as an artist.
Physical training, breath control, stamina, discipline, focus, teamwork, a sense of the dramatic -- all part of the sport -- translate well to opera, he said.
''My job is to communicate what the composer and the librettist had in mind,'' Harris said. ''Just like in football, your job is to run the play the way the coach drew it up.''
He added: ''When the makeup goes on and the costume goes on, it's like putting on your helmet and shoulder pads. You become a character with a role to play, and it's so intense.''
Miller, a bass-baritone who was in Washington recently preparing for ''Madama Butterfly,'' said the intensity of football made opera a natural second act.
''When you stand in front of a man, jaw to jaw and toe to toe, and you have to determine how you can break this man's spirit and do it again and again despite physical exhaustion and mental anguish, that requires a spirit that aligns itself to the opera,'' Miller said by telephone during a break in rehearsals.
Pupu'a was more fatigued last month than during any two-a-days in football. He rushed to an audition for the Savonlinna Opera Festival in Finland after a full day of classes at Juilliard, where he is finishing an advanced opera-studies program.
Battling a cold and nerves, Pupu'a cleared his throat and made a sound like a threatened animal. Alongside him in the narrow, poorly lighted hall of Nola Studios in Midtown Manhattan, other singers warmed up their voices.
''It's like the scouting combine,'' he said, referring to the N.F.L.'s predraft player testing. ''You have to show what you can do on cue.''
In the studio, Pupu'a could hear the voice of Bill Belichick, his coach in Cleveland in 1995, saying that ''energy comes from the ground up.'' He planted his feet and took a few deep breaths, then performed two arias.
''It wasn't my best,'' Pupu'a said, assessing his performance. ''When I am in good voice, the high note, I will hold that and milk it for all it's worth. It's like when you run in and see the quarterback all by himself. The people are on the edge of their seats, and then you make the sack and the roar is deafening. That's what it's like when you finish a high note.''
Pupu'a was born in Tonga, the son of a Methodist minister who moved his family to Utah. In church, Pupu'a turned heads with his singing, but he was also encouraged to play football.
He earned an athletic scholarship to Weber State, where he juggled football and musical theater. He spent two years in the N.F.L., with Cleveland and Baltimore, but never played. He turned to his first love, music, after a foot injury ended his football career.
At Juilliard, Pupu'a, a tenor, has fought the feeling that he is trying to make a furious fourth-quarter comeback.
''While I was running around hitting people, the other students were learning to read music,'' he said. ''I remember telling someone, I don't know if I can do this because it's so hard. And the person told me, 'If it was easier, everybody would be doing it.' It's the same thing with football. You're performing in front of people and giving joy to those who can't do it.''
Like Pupu'a, Harris, who grew up in Texas, developed an early affection for music. He said he would listen to live radio broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera while sitting in his bedroom closet.
''The stories were so spellbinding,'' he said, ''I didn't want to be interrupted by anyone.''
Harris played on the defensive line at Oklahoma State and was drafted in the seventh round by the Oilers in 1976. As part of rookie hazing, he was ordered to sing during a meal. When he responded with an Italian aria, he said, his teammates' mouths dropped.
''I knew right then I'd gone too far,'' he said.
The coach of the Oilers, Bum Phillips, moved Harris from defense to the offensive line, where he opened holes in practice for Earl Campbell, who led the N.F.L. in rushing. Harris said he got into a game against the Dolphins at the Orange Bowl in 1977 but spent most of his seven-and-a-half-year career on and off injured reserve, depending on what was better for the team.
''It's sad, but it is a cold truth about this league,'' Harris said. ''In the opera industry, things can be even more competitive and heartless, but you don't live every moment of your life in pain because of it.''
Harris, who retired in 1982, was able to draw on his football experience when, early in his opera career, he was asked to shift from baritone to heldentenor, suited to Wagnerian roles.
''Truly I was not a tenor,'' Harris said. ''I needed to be in a place vocally where I could intimidate people because I knew I had that talent inside me. I went along with it because that's what football taught me.''
As a baritone, Harris sings with a clarity and a carrying power that projects throughout the room. This quality, which the Italians call squillo, evoked yet another football analogy.
''When you're down in your stance and you're waiting for the ball to snap, you have to have all kinds of squillo,'' Harris said. ''It's a matter of focusing your energy so you get it going in one direction, at the guy across from you.''
Harris has an adult son from his first marriage and two children, 14 and 10, with his second wife, Renee Guerrero-Harris, a pianist. He once took Guerrero-Harris to a Giants game to give her a glimpse of his previous life.
''Twenty minutes later, I looked over and Larry was snoring,'' she said.
The New Rochelle audience included a man with snowy hair who nodded off during Harris's performance. The occasional snorer in the audience notwithstanding, Harris said he was mystified by the perception that opera is beyond the comprehension of the average person. His goal, he said, is to broaden opera's audience so people will buy tickets for the Mets, the Jets and the Met.
''Football is a lot more complicated,'' Harris said, adding, ''Opera, I believe, is probably perceived as more difficult to approach because of its deeper emotional content and because for most English-speaking audience members and English-speaking singers, it is, of course, foreign.''
But what's not to understand?
''It's like you're playing a football game,'' Miller said, ''and the winner gets the cheerleader. And then she dies. That's opera.''

HEADLINE: Police Increase Fees Charged to Race Officials

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; Al Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The New York Police Department will be charging organizers of the New York City Marathon and dozens of other races that use the city streets for traffic control costs and other services incurred for shutting down the roads. But the mayor's office has said the rule will not go in effect until Jan. 1, 2012, allowing race organizers time to plan for the extra fees.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced the timing of the rule's implementation at a City Council Public Safety Committee budget hearing. The New York Times first reported last month that the police department was planning to charge traffic control fees, and that race directors were concerned about the immediate timing and the procedure for determining those costs. 
Kelly was at the hearing outlining ways the police department had cut costs and increased revenue in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed budget for 2012. Speaking after the session, Kelly said that the New York City Marathon, which since 1996 has been run on the first Sunday of November, ''averages about $3 million in overtime'' for the department.
''It's always on Sunday, that's our most expensive day, and I think it's reasonable to ask the organizers who make a significant amount of money on events like the marathon to pay for some of the city costs,'' he said.
Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of the New York Road Runners, which directs the marathon and 57 other races in the city, was relieved that the added costs would not be instituted immediately, but still sought clarity about the fee structure.
''We are pleased that the city is listening and working to delay this rule until 2012,'' she said in a statement Tuesday.
The statement continued, ''We understand the need to partner through a tough budget period to ensure we can keep running races in communities in all five boroughs that promote healthy lives, provide programs for schoolchildren, bring millions of visitors and generate hundreds of millions a year in economic impact.''
Wittenberg added, ''We're simply looking for certainty and fairness in the rule.''
The Road Runners, like other race organizers, had already set the fees for most of their races in 2011, so increasing those fees to cover the police department's costs would have been challenging financially and logistically, the race organizers argued in February.
Kelly said the amount of the fees had not been determined.
''City Hall is involved in negotiations with organizers of several events, so we're going to let them handle the details,'' Kelly said after the session.
In his prepared remarks to the city council subcommittee, Kelly said that originally the department had proposed implementing the fees as early as this year, which he projected would generate $600,000 in additional revenue in 2011 and $3.5 million in fiscal year 2012.
Kelly estimated that the department spends ''$15 million, $20 on overtime'' for events that fall under the heading of ''noncharitable athletic parades,'' and include the Five-Boro Bike Tour and the New York City Triathlon.
The New York Road Runners, the nonprofit organization that directs the marathon, said that last year it paid more than $850,000 to city agencies, including $107,000 to the police.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Falls as Investors Dump Commodities

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The price of oil fell below $100 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time in two weeks as investors dumped commodities for safer assets amid worries that the widening disaster in Japan could lead to a global economic slowdown.
But the slide in the price of energy may be short-lived. A variety of factors could increase fuel costs in the next few months, even as supplies remain tight because of the continuing unrest in the Middle East. 
''Uncertainty and volatility remain key features of the oil market in the short term,'' J. P. Morgan's commodity analysts wrote on Tuesday. The benchmark American crude spot oil price fell nearly 4 percent, to $97.18 a barrel, in New York after spending the previous nine trading sessions above $100. If the lower price persists, it will probably slow the increase in gas prices at the pump, which averaged $3.56 a gallon nationwide on Tuesday, according to AAA.
Countervailing forces are at work in the energy markets. The combination of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accidents in Japan could reduce energy demand by Japanese consumers and industries in coming months. Some investors worry that the toll could drive the global economy back into a recession.
But some forecasters say they expect that Japan's oil consumption will actually rebound to meet its reconstruction needs, particularly of products such as diesel fuel used in small power generators. Japan, the world's third-largest consumer of oil, will also need new supplies of natural gas to make up for the loss of its nuclear reactors that were damaged by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Meanwhile, the continuing political unrest in the Middle East is likely to constrain oil supplies.
In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi appears to have gained some momentum in battling a rebellion that took over much of the eastern part of the country.
Still, whatever the outcome of the fighting, many specialists contend that there is little chance for a quick resumption of Libyan oil exports, which have been interrupted for a month.
Even if Colonel Qaddafi's forces were to prevail, it might be a year before the government exports oil again, and even then it will most likely face the prospect of international sanctions.
Tensions also flared again in the Persian Gulf as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sent troops into Bahrain on Monday in an unprecedented move to suppress protests led by the Shiite majority against the Sunni monarchy. The sudden militarization of the crisis in Bahrain is likely to stoke fears about stability in the Persian Gulf at a time of rising Sunni-Shiite tensions throughout the Muslim world.
With Libyan exports suspended, the world is down to an increasingly slim cushion of spare capacity, estimated at four million barrels a day, to make up for supply shortfalls or meet rising demand. Much of that spare capacity is in Saudi Arabia.
Jan Stuart, an economist at Macquarie Securities, has raised his forecast for oil prices for the rest of the year and now predicts they will average $110 a barrel this year, up from a previous forecast of $95 a barrel. ''Talk about looking through the fog of war,'' Mr. Stuart said.
The supply pressures have been less of a problem in February and March because those are weak months for oil consumption and a time when refineries traditionally perform lengthy maintenance operations in anticipation of the surge in demand that starts before summer.
In April, global oil demand is expected to increase by a million barrels a day as refineries come back online. The International Energy Agency, an energy adviser to developed nations, acknowledged that the market was headed into more turbulent waters.
''Market insouciance may change abruptly as April approaches,'' the agency said in its monthly report released Tuesday.
The energy agency said developed nations could tap into their strategic reserves if the market tightened more significantly. ''But the fact that this is now being seriously considered shows how far we have come from earlier, more comforting days when a tranquil early 2011 oil market looked more likely,'' the agency said.
Natural gas supplies could also come under pressure. In the United States, natural gas futures have remained relatively stable, at $3.97 per thousand cubic feet. But demand from Japan for the liquefied natural gas needed to make up for its lost nuclear capacity might drive up prices around the world.
Japan has shut down 11 nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 9.7 gigawatts -- the equivalent of 200,000 barrels of oil a day, or 4.5 percent of Japan's consumption.
''It's a little too early to say how the market will be affected, but there's likely going to be a tightening of the liquefied natural gas market,'' said Simon Henry, Royal Dutch Shell's chief financial officer, at the company's strategy day in London. ''Especially Europe is likely to be affected.''
Shell said that one shipment of liquefied natural gas arrived Monday night in the Tokyo Bay area. But the resupplying operations face complications because of the extent of the damage in northern Japan, according to Shell's chief executive, Peter Voser.
In the longer run, safety concerns about a nuclear accident might curtail the resurgence of the nuclear industry in the United States and Europe. Germany said it would take off line seven of its oldest reactors, or about a quarter of its nuclear capacity, for safety checks.

HEADLINE: Fed Staying on Current Path, With Job Creation as Top Priority

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Tuesday reiterated that the economy was improving but said it would continue measures to stimulate growth because it remained more concerned about persistent unemployment than the risk of increased inflation.
The central bank affirmed its plans to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities by the end of June, and also left unchanged its two-year-old commitment to hold a benchmark interest rate near zero ''for an extended period.''
The Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously to maintain both policies, intended to make money available at lower cost despite concern about the rising price of oil and new worries about the Japanese economy. 
''The economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be improving gradually,'' the Fed said in a statement explaining its decision.
The announcement was widely expected, but some investors said they were pleased by the rosier economic outlook. On a day when events in Japan drove most indexes lower, markets regained some ground after the midafternoon announcement.
However, while the statement on Tuesday reflected greater optimism about the economy than the central bank's last communique in January, recovering from a recession is not the same thing as being in good health. Fed officials say they still are not convinced that the economy will continue to grow without federal support.
The Fed said that the unemployment rate remained well above historic norms, and the construction industry -- a pillar of the economy -- was still in the doldrums.
Moreover, the Fed acknowledged that the increased price of oil and other commodities ''are currently putting upward pressure on inflation,'' and the Fed said it was keeping a close eye on that trend. But it said that surge was likely to subside without causing a rise in the prices of a broader range of goods and services.
The Fed has struggled to explain why it is not worried about inflation at a time when consumers are paying more to buy food and fill their gasoline tanks.
The nation's senior economic officials view broader measurements of prices as more reliable predictors of future increases in the price of all goods and services.
The Fed said that inflation remained below the level that it considered normal, about 2 percent a year, and would most likely remain low for the next several years.
When Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, was asked during Congressional testimony earlier this month about the rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, he said, ''The most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation.''
The combination of concern about the economic recovery and equanimity about inflation is the driving force in the Fed's continued, extraordinary stimulus campaign.
The Fed aims to control the rate that banks charge each other for loans, known as the federal funds target rate. Raising and lowering that rate works like a floodgate controlling how much money flows into the economy. For the last two years, the Fed has removed the gate entirely, holding the interest near zero.
To further stimulate growth, the Fed also embarked on an unprecedented policy of buying vast quantities of securities, which creates reserves that banks can draw to make loans. That effectively increases the amount of money that can flow into the economy.
The central bank has invested more than $2 trillion in buying mortgage and Treasury securities since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. Since November, the Fed has bought securities at a rate of about $75 billion a month.
The current round of purchases is scheduled to end in June, and close watchers of the Fed said Tuesday that the latest statement contained no suggestion that the economy was weak enough to require a continued program of purchases.
''The tone is much less worried about growth being too weak and inflation being too low than it was earlier,'' said James O'Sullivan, chief economist at the brokerage MF Global. ''That seems to signal that there's no need for a third round of asset purchases.''
Mr. Bernanke has said that Fed would judge its next steps based on the state of the economy in the coming months. He has specifically said that he wanted to see evidence of a ''self-sustaining'' recovery in the form of strong increases private sector employment.
''Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established,'' Mr. Bernanke told Congress earlier this month.
Some members of the Fed's policy-making committee have suggested in recent months that the Fed should consider ending the purchases before June, but none have yet broken ranks with Mr. Bernanke.
Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who is a Bush appointee and has said that he would resign at the end of the month, did not attend the meeting.

HEADLINE: Tallying the Financial Aftermath: Investors Remain Nervous After Global Stock Slump

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Reporting was contributed by Tom Zeller Jr., Julie Creswell, Eric Dash and Nick Bunkley.

 BODY:
The financial aftershocks from the earthquake in Japan gathered force on Tuesday as investors fled from riskier assets like stocks, oil and gold amid growing worries that the crisis could slow a global economy that only recently seemed to be getting back on its feet.
Unnerved by a 16 percent drop in Japanese shares in the first two trading days of the week, stock markets slumped as investors sought havens like United States dollars and Treasury bonds, pushing interest rates lower. By the close of trading in New York, however, shares of United States companies recovered some of their losses after the Federal Reserve said it would keep its accommodative monetary policy in place to stimulate the United States economy.
The Fed's announcement brought calm on a day of market turmoil that raised painful memories for some of 2008, when the financial crisis froze capital markets and precipitated a similar rush for safety. ''This was a very scary day for global stock markets,'' said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. 
After the roller-coaster session, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which at one point had been down 35 points, closed down 14.52 points, or 1.12 percent, at 1,281.87. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 137.74 points, or 1.15 percent, to 11,855.42. The Nasdaq fell 33.64 points, or 1.25 percent, to 2,667.33.
On Wednesday in Tokyo, markets regained some lost ground, with the Nikkei 225 rising 3.97 percent in afternoon trading. But on Tuesday, the uncertainty extended to energy markets, as analysts warned that diminished growth in Japan could prompt a sharp decrease in oil demand.
''We don't know the extent to which the post-tsunami Japan is going to grow, and whether or not there will be consequences for other countries as well,'' said Chris Lafakis, an energy economist for Moody's Analytics.
Amid the flight to safety, oil prices fell $4.01 to settle at $97.18 a barrel, while gold dropped $30.70 to $1,395.70 an ounce. The 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, rose 14/32, to 102 22/32. The yield fell to 3.30 percent, from 3.36 percent late Monday.
The central fear is that the disaster -- especially the danger of increased radiation exposure from stricken Japanese nuclear reactors -- could rip a big hole in the supply lines of the world's third largest economy and set back the global recovery.
Some of the first ripples reached the United States on Tuesday as Subaru said it was canceling all overtime at its plant in Lafayette, Ind., which builds the Outback, Legacy and Tribeca models, to reduce the chance that it will run out of some parts from Japan.
''The main economic shock is not the direct loss of business, but spillover effects in terms of damage to the power and transportation industries and disruptions to the supply chain,'' said Ethan S. Harris, an economist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. ''Specifically, many auto and electronics firms rely on the affected region for parts.''
As a result of the volatility, several debt offerings were postponed, while Toys ''R'' Us was forced to delay a planned syndicated loan.
The ultimate impact on world growth is likely to be small, however. ''The quake-ravaged economy, the world's third largest, could lower economic activity in Japan as much as one percentage point, and shave off worldwide growth 0.2 percentage point in 2011,'' said Bernard Baumohl, an economist at the Economic Outlook Group.
The region affected by the quake accounts for only about 6 percent of Japanese gross domestic product, and economists calculate that the short-term effects might be eventually offset as Japan spends hundreds of billions to rebuild.
Closer to home, a temporary reduction in American exports to Japan might trim 0.1 to 0.2 of a percentage point from United States economic growth in 2011, according to Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC.
One major exporter, General Electric, which designed the reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant, fell for the second day in a row, closing down 1.6 percent at $19.61. G.E. has either built or licensed 92 nuclear reactors now operating worldwide -- about 20 percent of the global total, according to Michael Tetuan, a spokesman for General Electric.
But nuclear power development remains a small part of the company's overall operation; it produces reactors in partnership with Hitachi. The business accounted for just $1 billion in revenues in 2010 -- a tiny fraction of the $85 billion generated by its industrial supply business.
''Nuclear is not a major piece of the puzzle for G.E.,'' said Daniel Holland, an analyst with the investment research firm Morningstar. ''This doesn't move the needle a whole bunch.''
Despite the problems in Japan, the Japanese yen strengthened, as speculation increased that big Japanese investors like pension funds and banks -- Japan is the second-largest holder of United States Treasuries -- would dump their overseas holdings and buy yen to return cash home.
At the same time, there were signs that investors were unwinding other trading positions. With interest rates near zero at home, Japanese investors used yen to buy Australian and Canadian dollars, as well as the Brazilian real, to invest in higher-yielding assets there. Other foreign investors placed similar bets, bullish on those countries' growth prospects.
But as demand for the yen picks up, those currencies have weakened. The Canadian dollar fell 1.5 percent on Tuesday morning, while the Australian dollar fell around 2 percent. The Brazilian real has fallen nearly 4 percent since Friday.
Across Wall Street, traders said the initial reaction among many hedge funds and institutional investors to the Japanese crisis was to sell first and ask questions later.
''It's definitely been risk-off since Friday,'' said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist with Wall Street investment bank Jefferies & Company. ''Uncertainty tends to breed a desire for safety. As it becomes easier to assess what all of the ramifications are, I suspect that will recede.''
For instance, Robin Thorn, who oversees the $1.3 billion PineBridge Global Equities mutual fund, decided on Sunday evening to cut the fund's 9 percent position in Japanese stocks in half.
With the help of his team of more than two dozen analysts in Tokyo -- many who have been sleeping in their offices -- Mr. Thorn sold off companies that had exposure to nuclear-plant construction. ''That turned out to be the right thing in the shorter term,'' Mr. Thorn said.
But Mr. Thorn said he and his team were also looking for buying opportunities, saying he had increased the fund's stake in companies that will play a role in Japan's rebuilding.
And on Tuesday afternoon as Japanese American Depositary Receipts and exchange-traded funds rebounded sharply from early lows, Mr. Thorn said he expected Japanese markets to rally.
''We feel a lot of the emotional selling has been done,'' Mr. Thorn said. ''And it's clear through the action of U.S.-based investors today that people are now trying to look for bargains.''

HEADLINE: Ohio Town Sees Public Job As Only Route To Middle Class

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
GALLIPOLIS, Ohio -- Jodi and Ralph Taylor are public workers whose jobs as a janitor and a sewer manager cover life's basics. They have moved out of a trailer into a house, do not have to rely on food stamps and sometimes even splurge for the spicy wing specials at the Courtside Bar and Grill.
While that might not seem like much, jobs like theirs, with benefits and higher-than-minimum wages, are considered plum in this depressed corner of southern Ohio. Decades of industrial decline have eroded private-sector jobs here, leaving a thin crust of low-paying service work that makes public-sector jobs look great in comparison.
Now, as Ohio's legislature moves toward final approval of a bill that would chip away at public-sector unions, those workers say they see it as the opening bell in a race to the bottom. At stake, they say, is what little they have that makes them middle class. 
''These jobs let you put good food on the table and send your kids on school trips,'' said Monty Blanton, a retired electrician and union worker. ''The gap between low and middle is collapsing.''
Gallipolis (pronounced gal-uh-POLICE) is a faded town on the Ohio River, one whose fortunes fell with the decline in industries like steel in bigger cities along the river. That erased a swath of middle-income jobs in the area, said Bob Walton, who, as a commissioner for the Southern Ohio Port Authority, an economic development agency, has tracked the economic history of the area for decades.
''It's a real big change,'' Mr. Walton said. ''It has changed the complexion of our community.''
Today, storefronts are mostly dark. About one in three people live in poverty. Billboards advertise oxygen tanks and motorized wheelchairs. Old photographs in a local diner look like an exhibit from a town obituary. The region has some of the highest rates of prescription drug abuse in the state, with more people dying from overdoses than car crashes, according to Ed Hughes, executive director of the Counseling Center in Portsmouth, about 55 miles west of here.
David Beaver, 65, a barber, said that when he got out of high school, ''you could go anywhere you wanted to and pick your job.''
''Now, it's depressing,'' Mr. Beaver said. ''I hear the boys talking. They can't find anything.''
It is not that there are no jobs, but rather that the jobs available pay too little and have no benefits, resulting in, as Mr. Beaver put it, ''just scraping by.'' A private hospital and two power plants do offer good jobs, but they are highly competitive and many require some higher education, something that fewer than one in five people here have, according to 2009 census data.
So most people scrape by, as Ms. Taylor did before landing her state job in 1996. At the time, she was living in a trailer and working in low-wage jobs at Wendy's, Dairy Queen and a Big Lots discount store. Her hourly wage jumped to $9 when she started at the Gallipolis Developmental Center, a state home for mentally retarded people, up from $5.25 at a private nursing home.
''If I wasn't working at the G.D.C., I'd have to work around the clock,'' said Chris Smith, Ms. Taylor's colleague, referring to the center, where she has worked for 20 years. ''I'd have to work two or three jobs to keep at this level.''
The Taylors are not college educated, but their public-sector jobs have made them middle class. Together they earn about $63,000 a year, a sum that puts them squarely at the middle point of earnings for American families, and higher than the $50,000 earned by the typical Gallipolis family.
Money is still tight. When their washing machine broke in November, they had to put the new one on a credit card. They could not afford college for either of their sons. One is in the Marines, and the other, a high school senior, just enlisted.
''We're not living in any rich, high-income way,'' said Ms. Taylor, 37, who, together with her husband, protested the public-sector bill in Columbus this month.
''What are they wanting?'' she said of the bill. ''For everyone to be making minimum wage?''
Wages at the bottom of the labor market have stagnated since 1970, with inflation gobbling up gains made over the years. The federal minimum wage buys a lot less today; it represented just 38 percent of the average hourly wage for private, nonsupervisory workers in 2010, down from 47 percent in 1970, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
''The wage story is incredibly bleak for everyone from the middle on down,'' said Jacob S. Hacker, a political science professor at Yale University and co-author of ''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer -- And Turned Its Back on the Middle Class.'' ''We've gotten dramatically richer as a society, but if you're a wage earner below the median, you've seen your wages stagnate or shrink.''
Retirement is less secure for private workers. Jeanie Norton, 49, ended up earning less than minimum wage when her job as an airlines reservation agent was eliminated in 2008. At the time, she and her husband, a carpenter who is now unemployed, were building their dream house. She lost her health insurance and had to break into her 401(k) to keep them afloat. Now she drives an hour each way to work as a waitress in Gallipolis.
''I thought I had it all figured out,'' Ms. Norton said, ''but now I'm just making it. I'm going on faith in God.''
Pensions have shriveled. In 1985, medium- and large-size companies paid full pensions to four out of five workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 2010, that number was down to one in three. Four out of five public workers still receive the full benefit.
For those on the lowest rungs of the income ladder, wages are so skimpy that the state sometimes picks up the slack. Jeremy Bostic, 27, who supports several relatives on his small salary as a manager at Kmart, has to supplement his earnings with food stamps.
Dim prospects push young people here toward another government solution. Brynna Frazier, 30, said the most popular choice among her friends was the military, which, at $1,600 a month with health insurance, was the best job around. Ms. Frazier, a waitress, has not had health insurance in any job she has ever worked, including Wal-Mart, Taco Bell and a telemarketing firm.
A third of all private-sector workers under 30 have no health insurance, up from 15 percent in 1988, according to the census data.
''Around here, you either choose drugs or the military,'' said Kandi Marcum, a cashier at a dollar store, whose 19-year-old daughter, a McDonald's worker, is leaving for basic training this month. ''I want to get her away from this,'' Ms. Marcum said, waving her arm angrily. ''I hate that she's here.''
Ms. Taylor was washing dishes when the State Senate passed the labor bill this month. She sat down and cried when she heard the news. It does away with seniority and leaves out any job protection for workers with longer service, putting public workers -- most of whom are not eligible for Social Security -- at risk of losing their retirement income.
''I'm scared,'' Ms. Taylor said. ''You just start to think, what about this, what about that? This is going to hurt a lot of people.''

LIMITED PROSPECTS: High school students in Gallipolis, Ohio, face a tough job market after graduation. The decline of industries like steel in bigger cities along the Ohio River erased a swath of middle-income jobs in the area.

HEADLINE: General Sees Joint Bases For Afghans After 2014

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The American commander in Afghanistan and the Pentagon's top policy officer on Tuesday described the value of sustaining a long-term relationship with Kabul, and raised the possibility of operating joint military bases with local forces long after foreign troops are scheduled to withdraw in 2014. 
Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of American and coalition forces, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that ''it's very important to stay engaged in a region in which we have such vital interests.''
He cited his tenure as the senior commander in Iraq as an example of the benefits of the American military ''providing enablers'' -- troops that train, advise and support local forces -- in countries where the United States has important national security interests.
''I think the concept of joint basing, the concept of providing enablers for Afghan operations and so forth -- frankly, similar to what we have done in Iraq since the mission changed there -- would also be appropriate in Afghanistan,'' General Petraeus said.
He and Michele A. Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy, noted that any continuing military relationship with Afghanistan would require negotiations with the government there.
''The president's been also very clear from the beginning that we do not seek any permanent bases in Afghanistan -- that we don't seek to have a presence that any other country in the region would see as a threat,'' Ms. Flournoy said.
She said negotiations with the Afghan government for American assistance beyond 2014 likely would include opportunities to help develop the country's economy and system of governance.
While the focus of the hearing was the war in Afghanistan, a central theme was the threat of ungoverned areas of Pakistan serving as havens for terrorists and insurgents. Senators from both parties pressed to find out what could be done to assist -- and even compel -- Pakistan to do more to rout insurgents from those areas.
''The Pakistanis are the first to note that more needs to be done,'' General Petraeus said. ''There is, I think, a growing recognition that you cannot allow poisonous snakes to have a nest in your backyard even if they just bite the neighbor's kids, because sooner or later they're going to turn around and cause problems in your backyard.''
General Petraeus made clear that Al Qaeda continues to maintain a small presence inside Afghanistan, which under Taliban rule provided haven for Osama bin Laden to organize the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
He said Al Qaeda has under 100 operatives or fighters inside Afghanistan today. He also said efforts to woo Taliban foot soldiers away from the insurgency were showing progress: About 700 former Taliban fighters had officially reintegrated with Afghan authorities and another 2,000 were now in early stages of the reintegration process.
General Petraeus said that while Afghan and coalition forces had turned back the Taliban's initiative on the battlefield, he warned that progress remained ''fragile and reversible.''
Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for adding up to 70,000 Afghan troops and police, and he said the United States and its allies should press Afghan leaders to improve governance and public services, and fight corruption.

HEADLINE: Miami-Dade County Mayor Is Removed

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
HIALEAH, Fla. -- Mayor Carlos Alvarez of Miami-Dade County was removed in a recall election on Tuesday as voters punished him for raising property taxes and increasing the salaries of his closest aides at the height of the recession.
Walking out of polling stations, irate voters said Mr. Alvarez's greatest offense was his effrontery: Two years ago, with Miami sinking under foreclosures and a housing bust, he called on residents and county workers in a speech to brace themselves for ''tough times.'' But he gave his own top aides hefty raises, including his former chief of staff whose salary climbed to $206,783 from $185,484. 
Last year, he pushed through a budget that raised property taxes for 40 percent of homeowners, despite plummeting property values, to avoid laying off firefighters and other public employees. Yet, most county workers are getting raises this year.
And then there is the car. The mayor shuttles around Miami in a sleek BMW 500i Gran Turismo, which taxpayers help subsidize. None of this sits well with voters, most of whom voted for Mr. Alvarez in the past, including in a 2007 election to give the county mayor more power. They now say he did not uphold a promise to clean up government.
''I saw him on TV with a car from here to there,'' said Edelmira Triana, 73, a Hialeah resident who recently arrived from Cuba. ''And he's giving money to his own staff and raising taxes and he's got that enormous car. He's living the good life.''
Mr. Alvarez, a Republican, has defended the tax increase, saying it was the only way to preserve vital services and make up a $444 million budget gap. Without it, the county would have had to close fire stations and parks and lay off workers. The raises given to workers this year, Mr. Alvarez said, are part of a three-year-old collective-bargaining agreement that also entailed pay cuts. He defended the raises for his aides, saying their workload increased greatly when voters granted him more power in 2007.
After conceding defeat, Mr. Alvarez said: ''No matter which side of the recall issue, one thing is certain: we all care very deeply about this community. A professional management team remains in place in Miami-Dade County government, and I know they will work hard to ensure the smoothest transition possible in the coming days.''
The recall campaign was spearheaded by Norman Braman, a billionaire car dealer, philanthropist and onetime owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, who said he was outraged by the property tax increase and the ''erosion in the quality of life'' in Miami. Mr. Braman spent more than $1 million hiring consultants to collect signatures to call for the recall election. He collected 114,000, more than double the required number. A frequent guest on Spanish-language radio here, Mr. Braman, who does not speak Spanish, succeeded in energizing Hispanics who said they felt betrayed by their county mayor.
Voters favored removing the mayor by 88 percent to 12 percent. The county commission has 30 days from the election's certification to appoint a new mayor or call a special election that would have to be held within 45 days. Candidates are already lining up to replace Mr. Alvarez, including the mayor of Hialeah, Julio Robaina.
''This was about empowering the citizens of the community,'' Mr. Braman said. ''It's not just a recall of the mayor but a referendum for change.''
A county commissioner, Natacha Seijas, was also recalled in a separate campaign organized by Miami Voice, a political action committee. The scandal-plagued county commission had voted to approve the mayor's budget and Ms. Seijas, a longtime commissioner, was viewed as particularly vulnerable.
Kenneth W. Goodman, co-director of the University of Miami's ethics program, said that in better economic times, the decisions made by the mayor would not have led to such extreme action. He fell victim in large part to the surge of antitax sentiment around the country but then mishandled the situation, Mr. Goodman said. ''A reasonable person would say there is a kind of radioactive crankiness in the air,'' he said. Also, he said, ''In times of duress, you want to be careful about what kind of car you drive.''
Walking out of a polling station in this onetime Alvarez stronghold, Luis Diaz, a 56-year-old airport worker who like most voters here had supported Mr. Alvarez in past elections, said he was angry. ''It's a farce what he has done,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''He needed to raise taxes to keep the county running, but he also had to give raises to his friends.''
''Let him leave office tomorrow,'' Mr. Diaz added.

HEADLINE: G-8 Ministers Fail to Agree on Libya No-Flight Zone

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The eight most powerful industrialized nations failed to agree Tuesday on a no-flight zone or any other military operation to help the Libyan opposition, instead passing the problem to the United Nations Security Council by urging an undefined increase of pressure on the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
France and Britain pressed for agreement on a no-flight zone, while Germany and Russia opposed the measure and the United States was cautious, officials said, speaking anonymously following diplomatic protocol. 
Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, read a statement after talks among foreign ministers of the Group of 8 nations concluded here on Tuesday, saying that they called on Colonel Qaddafi ''to respect the legitimate claim of the Libyan people to fundamental rights, freedom of expression and a representative form of government.''
The group also agreed ''as a matter of urgency,'' Mr. Juppe said, that ''the U.N. Security Council should increase the pressure, including economic measures, for Muammar Qaddafi to leave.'' He said he hoped for a United Nations resolution by the end of the week.
Mr. Juppe later told the French Parliament that a no-flight zone was no longer useful. ''It's past, and it is not what today will stop the advance of Qaddafi.'' Mr. Juppe blamed the lack of Security Council action so far on China, Russia and an American position that he called undefined.
''If today we are stuck, it's not only because Europe is impotent, it's because at the Security Council, for now, China doesn't want any mention of a resolution leading to the international community's interference in a country's affairs,'' he said. ''Never mind that there's European impotence, but what about American power? What about Russian power? What's China's power over Libya?'' he said to the Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
''Russia is evolving and the Americans haven't yet defined their position on Libya,'' Mr. Juppe said.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who left early on Tuesday for talks with Egyptian political and military leaders in Cairo, had met Monday evening with a senior representative of the Libyan opposition, Mahmoud Jibril, who reportedly asked for arms and a no-flight zone.
But she was reported by American officials to be noncommittal, as well as eager to have Arab countries join in any such zone should the United Nations authorize one. The Arab League called for a no-flight zone, but did not specify that its members would participate in implementing one.
The French have been vocal in support of the anti-Qaddafi forces, recognizing them as the legitimate government of Libya. But French statements have not been supported by any unilateral action. Speaking Tuesday morning on Europe 1 radio, Mr. Juppe said that the world had missed an opportunity to act when it might have mattered more.
''If we had used military force last week to neutralize some airstrips and the several dozen planes that they have, perhaps the reversal taking place to the detriment of the opposition wouldn't have happened,'' he said.
It has never been clear what role France expected to play in any no-flight zone, since Mr. Juppe had also ruled out using NATO as an instrument in Libya, saying that the alliance had an ''aggressive'' image in the Arab world.
Mr. Juppe later cited a sea embargo among possible alternative means of applying pressure, and an American official said there was a discussion of providing ''safe zones'' for civilians and enacting more economic sanctions.
''Military intervention is not the solution,'' said the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle . ''We do not want to get sucked into a war in North Africa and we would not like to step on a slippery slope where we all are, at the end, in a war.''
Franco Frattini, the foreign minister of Italy, which has the closest oil and economic ties with Libya of any European country, said Russia had argued that a no-flight zone would be ineffective and even counterproductive.
China, which has a veto at the Security Council, also opposes a no-flight zone, but it is not a member of the G-8.
Meanwhile, in an interview with the German television station RTL on Tuesday, Colonel Qaddafi praised the position of Germany and said Libya would trade with it in the future for oil, but that otherwise, ''the West is to be forgotten.'' He said Libyan oil contracts would go ''to Russian, Chinese and Indian firms.''

HEADLINE: Germany Shuts 7 Nuclear Plants as Europe Plans to Hold Safety Tests in 27 Countries

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and JUDY DEMPSEY; Judy Dempsey reported from Berlin and James Kanter from Brussels. Alexei Barrionuevo reported from Sao Paulo and Pascale Bonnefoy from Santiago, Chile.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Germany on Tuesday became the first European country to shut nuclear plants in the wake of the crisis in Japan as the European Union made plans to test all 143 nuclear power plants in its 27 countries.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said seven plants that went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier adoption of renewable energy. All of the plants were built by German contractors. 
While Mrs. Merkel asserted that safety was her main concern, opposition politicians accused her of pandering to fear about nuclear power ahead of a regional election this month. She has, in effect, suspended a decision last autumn to keep older plants operating beyond their previously designated life span.
The tests across the European Union are intended to ensure preparedness for emergencies like floods and tsunamis, as well as terrorist attacks, the European energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, said after meeting with representatives of the nuclear industry, electricity companies and governments.
''This is a reassessment, if you like, of all potential risks in the wake of what has happened in Japan,'' Mr. Oettinger said.
The Japanese disaster has led officials in Europe and the United States to think twice about nuclear expansion. But for now, developing countries, while acknowledging the need for safety, say their energy needs give them little choice but to continue investing in nuclear power.
A crucial element, Mr. Oettinger said, would be to determine whether the plants had enough backup power to cool the reactors if electricity was lost. The loss of backup power after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to overheating and explosions at the Fukushima plant.
Mr. Oettinger, who became energy commissioner with Mrs. Merkel's support, appeared Tuesday to shift his attitude toward nuclear energy. ''We must also raise the question if we in Europe, in the foreseeable future, can secure our energy needs without nuclear energy,'' he told the German TV station ARD.
In his native state of Baden-Wurttemberg, where Mrs. Merkel's party risks losing power in March 27 elections, Mr. Oettinger was known as a proponent of nuclear power. The state has two plants, one of which is among the seven to be shut down. On Saturday, about 50,000 protesters formed a human chain from the state capital, Stuttgart, to that reactor. On Monday, an estimated 110,000 people demonstrated in 450 towns across Germany against extending nuclear power.
Both Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Oettinger said President Nicolas Sarkozy of France would raise nuclear safety at the next Group of 20 nations summit meeting.
Mr. Oettinger said the tests should include as many plants in the European Union as possible. Nuclear power produces around a third of the electricity and 15 percent of the energy consumed in the European Union.
The chief executive of the German power giant E.On, Johannes Teyssen, said he would welcome more common standards for European nuclear safety. He declined, however, to rule out power cutoffs as a result of Mrs. Merkel's decision, noting that ''obviously depends on several factors of demand and supply, on availability of transmission grids, on a lot of issues.''
''With this new unbalance in the system, minor accidents can have major implications,'' Mr. Teyssen said in Brussels. ''We will try our best to live up to the situation, but the risk of the system has definitely increased.''
The industry made a similar threat almost a year ago when Mrs. Merkel agreed to extend the life of the power plants if the utilities paid a special tax. The utilities said the tax would hinder investment. Germany has 17 nuclear plants. They provide 26 percent of the country's electricity; the seven older reactors produce about a third of that percentage.
European operators already face narrowing choices over where to locate reactors. In France, which relies on nuclear energy for more than 75 percent of its electricity, hot water discharged by power stations can combine with rising air temperatures to warm rivers enough in the summer to threaten fish and plant life. But building plants on seafronts, where cold water is abundant, may be less attractive because of storms and rising sea levels linked to climate change.
A total of 17 reactors in the European Union use technology similar to those affected in Japan, which are known as boiling water reactors, according to the European Commission. Of those 17, nine in Finland and Sweden are on coastlines, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency, part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
About 40 percent of the reactors in the union's member states are on coastlines, according to the commission.
The Continent has comparatively weak earthquakes. Even so, nature can pose a threat. During a storm in 1999, rising water levels in the Gironde River led to severe flooding at the French plant Blayais, shutting down some safety systems.
Since then, Electricite de France, which runs the plant, has improved protections at Blayais.
Stress tests would have common standards, Mr. Oettinger said, but ''if you have a plant which is on the coast, well then obviously flooding and tsunamis will be tested for perhaps more thoroughly than plants situated at much greater altitude.''
The nuclear crisis in Japan is also complicating the debate over whether to pursue nuclear energy in Chile, which only last year suffered an 8.8-magnitude earthquake that caused devastation, officials said this week.
Next week, Chile and the United States are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation when President Obama visits Santiago. But given the disaster in Japan, Chile's energy and mining minister, Laurence Golborne, told reporters the government needed to study the situation.
''We may decide we don't want this type of energy and we will have to analyze other sources,'' he said. ''The country needs energy, and to say no to something means saying yes to other things.''

HEADLINE: Study: U.S. Must Raise Status of Its Teachers

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
To improve its public schools, the United States should raise the status of the teaching profession by recruiting more qualified candidates, training them better and paying them more, according to a new report on comparative educational systems.
Andreas Schleicher, who oversees the international achievement test known by its acronym Pisa, says in his report that top-scoring countries like Korea, Singapore and Finland recruit only high-performing college graduates for teaching positions, support them with mentoring and other help in the classroom, and take steps to raise respect for the profession.
''Teaching in the U.S. is unfortunately no longer a high-status occupation,'' Mr. Schleicher says in the report, prepared in advance of an educational conference that opens in New York on Wednesday. ''Despite the characterization of some that teaching is an easy job, with short hours and summers off, the fact is that successful, dedicated teachers in the U.S. work long hours for little pay and, in many cases, insufficient support from their leadership.'' 
The conference, convened by the federal Department of Education, was expected to bring together education ministers and leaders of teachers' unions from 16 countries as well as state superintendents from nine American states. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that he hoped educational leaders would use the conference to share strategies for raising student achievement.
''We're all facing similar challenges,'' Mr. Duncan said in an interview.
The meeting occurs at a time when teachers' rights, roles and responsibilities are being widely debated in the United States.
Republicans in Wisconsin and several other states have been pushing legislation to limit teachers' collective bargaining rights and reduce taxpayer contributions to their pensions.
President Obama has been trying to promote a different view.
''In South Korea, teachers are known as 'nation builders,' and I think it's time we treated our teachers with the same level of respect,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech on education on Monday.
Mr. Schleicher is a senior official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or O.E.C.D., a Paris group that includes the world's major industrial powers. He wrote the new report, ''What the U.S. Can Learn from the World's Most Successful Education Reform Efforts,'' with Steven L. Paine, a CTB/McGraw-Hill vice president who is a former West Virginia schools superintendent, for the McGraw-Hill Research Foundation.
It draws on data from the Program for International Student Assessment, which periodically tests 15-year-old students in more than 50 countries in math, reading or science.
On the most recent Pisa, the top-scoring countries were Finland and Singapore in science, Korea and Finland in reading and Singapore and Korea in math. On average, American teenagers came in 15th in reading and 19th in science. American students placed 27th in math. Only 2 percent of American students scored at the highest proficiency level, compared with 8 percent in Korea and 5 percent in Finland.
The ''five things U.S. education reformers could learn'' from the high-performing countries, the report says, include adopting common academic standards -- an effort well under way here, led by state governors -- developing better tests for use by teachers in diagnosing students' day-to-day learning needs and training more effective school leaders.
''Make a concerted effort to raise the status of the teaching profession'' was the top recommendation.
University teaching programs in the high-scoring countries admit only the best students, and ''teaching education programs in the U.S. must become more selective and more rigorous,'' the report says.
Raising teachers' status is not mainly about raising salaries, the report says, but pay is a factor.
According to O.E.C.D. data, the average salary of a veteran elementary teacher here was $44,172 in 2008, higher than the average of $39,426 across all O.E.C.D countries (the figures were converted to compare the purchasing power of each currency).
But that salary level was 40 percent below the average salary of other American college graduates. In Finland, by comparison, the veteran teacher's salary was 13 percent less than that of the average college graduate's.
In an interview, Mr. Schleicher said the point was not that the United States spends too little on public education -- only Luxembourg among the O.E.C.D. countries spends more per elementary student -- but rather that American schools spend disproportionately on other areas, like bus transportation and sports facilities.
''You can spend a lot of money on education, but if you don't spend it wisely, on improving the quality of instruction, you won't get higher student outcomes,'' Mr. Schleicher said.

HEADLINE: Panel Votes To Limit E.P.A. Power

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Moving on a central tenet of the Republican energy and environment platform, a House committee on Tuesday approved a measure to halt the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Republican leaders promised a floor vote on the bill before the Easter recess. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee passed the bill, known as the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, by a vote of 34 to 19. Three Democrats, Representatives John Barrow of Georgia, Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike Ross of Arkansas, voted with the unanimous Republican majority.
The bill would repeal the E.P.A.'s finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are a threat to human health and the environment and would bar the agency from imposing new rules to control them. Its Republican sponsors argue that new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from refineries, power plants and other major sources would drive up energy prices, depress the economy and hamper job creation.
Before approving the measure, the committee rejected three Democratic amendments intended to put the panel's Republican majority on record rejecting the scientific basis of climate change, the role of human activity in contributing to it and the urgency of acting on the problem. The amendments failed.
As the House climate measure was moving toward seemingly inevitable passage, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, attached an amendment with virtually identical language to a small-business bill now before the Senate.
''They're attempting to do through regulation what they couldn't do through legislation -- regardless of whether the American people want it or not,'' Mr. McConnell said in a statement. ''This is an insult to the millions of Americans who are already struggling to make ends meet or find a job.''
A vote on the McConnell amendment will be a test of anti-E.P.A. sentiment in the Senate, where a bill similar to the House measure has the support of most Republicans and one Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.
President Obama has promised to veto any measure to limit E.P.A. authority.

HEADLINE: For 2012, Obama Tries to Draw G.O.P. Adversaries Nearer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
As they prepare to wage political war against President Obama, the potential 2012 Republican candidates are doing everything they can to draw sharp distinctions with him.
But Mr. Obama isn't cooperating.
Rather than emphasize his differences with potential Oval Office rivals or Republican adversaries on Capitol Hill, the president is taking every opportunity he can to embrace members of the other party as co-conspirators in his efforts to confront the country's challenges.
According to Mr. Obama, the two parties have cooperated - or are showing signs of being willing to work together - on education reform, tax cuts, energy security, economic growth and potential changes to an entitlement system that has become a drain on the nation's budget. 
''I am proud of the commitment by Democrats and Republicans in Congress to fix No Child Left Behind,'' Mr. Obama said Monday at a Virginia middle school.
Two weeks ago, at a fund-raiser in Miami, he noted that ''I'm proud that Democrats and Republicans joined forces in December to cut taxes for every American.''
And at a meeting of the National Governor's Association, he spoke optimistically about confronting the rising costs of Medicare and Medicaid, saying that ''I think that's something that Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on.''
He's also heaped special praise - tinged with just a bit of sarcasm - on Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts (for his health care plan) and Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, for serving as Mr. Obama's ambassador to China. Both men are considering a bid for president in 2012.
The logic behind Mr. Obama's approach appears to be rooted in the belief that voters - and especially independents - are looking for evidence that politicians in Washington are working together on problems rather than content to live with an unending stalemate.
In a cabinet meeting the day after the midterm elections in November, Mr. Obama said that that was the message he had received from the drubbing his party took. Voters, he said, are ''concerned about making sure that taxpayer money is not wasted, and they want to change the tone here in Washington, where the two parties are coming together and focusing on the people's business as opposed to scoring political points.''
The change in the president's rhetoric since then has been striking.
In the weeks before the election, Mr. Obama hardly missed an opportunity to suggest that it was Republicans who had driven the American economy into a ditch. ''Have you noticed when you want to go forward, what do you do with your car?'' he would repeatedly ask. ''You put it in D. When you want to go backwards, what do you do? You put it in R. That's not a coincidence.''
Except for one fund-raiser on Nov. 5, Mr. Obama has not said the word ''ditch'' in public since then.
In addition to appealing to some voters, the bipartisan rhetoric from Mr. Obama may be an attempt to disarm his potential 2012 rivals and Republicans on Capitol Hill. In Miami this month, Mr. Obama stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, to promote education reforms.
''it's time we came together - just like Jeb and I are doing today - coming from different parties but we come together not as Democrats or Republicans, as Americans, to lift up all of our schools,'' he said.
Not everything is sweetness and light, of course. Mr. Obama and the Capitol Hill Republicans remain at loggerheads over the current year's budget. And there's no clear indication of how the two sides are going to reach agreement on raising the nation's debt ceiling later this year.
The president will also need to shift into a more adversarial mode as the election grows closer. Even as his campaign preached hope and optimism in 2008, Mr. Obama's victory against Senator John McCain of Arizona was built on drawing a clear contrast between the two men.
It may be that Mr. Obama can put off that kind of sharp-edged campaign rhetoric for several months. It seems unlikely he will have a serious primary challenger, and that will allow him to appear somewhat above the fray while the Republicans battle among themselves.
But already, his campaign operatives are beginning to travel the country, hat-in-hand, looking for donations from wealthy supporters. And his finance operation will soon be asking for donations from the millions of less-wealthy supporters who contributed a few dollars in 2008.
Both groups will be looking for contrasts, not just mushy expressions of cooperation.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Northrop To Spin Off Shipyards

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW. 
David Leonhardt, whose Economic Scene column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
Northrop Grumman's board approved the spinoff of its struggling shipyards to stockholders after making changes to ease Navy concerns about the deal, Pentagon and industry officials said on Tuesday.
But the deal still carries substantial risk for taxpayers. The new company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, will start with so much debt -- $1.8 billion -- that the three largest rating agencies classified much of it as noninvestment grade, or junk.
And without Northrop's deep pockets to turn to, the new company could run into more trouble if it cannot cut costs in building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, submarines and other ships, analysts cautioned. 
The spinoff comes as the Pentagon spending is tightening and its shipbuilding budget is becoming less certain. Northrop is the world's largest military shipbuilder, and General Dynamics is its only American rival in building large warships. There is also a glut of capacity, and some of Northrop's yards are the least efficient and have had serious quality problems.
The spinoff, which is subject to approval by securities regulators, is expected to take place on March 31. Northrop, based in Los Angeles, said its stockholders would receive one share of the new company, in a tax-free distribution, for every six shares of Northrop they hold.
Northrop's chief executive, Wesley G. Bush, has been refocusing the company on more profitable businesses like electronics, robotic systems and cybersecurity. The shipyards accounted for only about one-fifth of Northrop's $35 billion in sales last year, and the profit margins from the operations were as low as 4 to 5 percent.
Analysts at Standard & Poor's wrote recently that Northrop would receive $1.5 billion from Huntington Ingalls when the spinoff took effect. The new company sold $1.2 billion in notes to institutional investors earlier this month, and was expected to take on at least $600 million in additional debt to pay Northrop and provide $300 million in working capital.
But while the spinoff makes sense for Northrop, the Pentagon could have less leverage over the operations if the new company performs poorly. Analysts said the Navy would have to think twice about withdrawing contracts from Huntington Ingalls if that would result in a weakening of the company's finances.
Navy officials said they spent several months in negotiations with Northrop before deciding to support the spinoff.
Sean J. Stackley, the assistant secretary for acquisitions, said the Navy reviewed the financial assumptions, including proprietary business projections, and reached an agreement with Northrop that included ''appropriate adjustments.''
The changes enabled Navy officials ''to resolve our concerns about the risk involved to this important segment of our shipbuilding industrial base,'' he said, adding that the Navy was confident that the new company was ''well postured to build affordable ships into the future.''
Capt. Cate T. Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman, said Northrop had agreed not to seek any types of payments from the $300 million in working capital at the new company. She said Northrop had also agreed that Huntington Ingalls would receive any performance bonuses or other Navy payments relating to ship contracts it transferred to the new company.
Mr. Stackley said the Navy would now finish negotiating contracts for the new company to build an amphibious transport ship and a destroyer.
Northrop, one of the nation's largest military contractors, announced last summer that it was studying whether to sell or spin off the shipbuilding business, which includes sprawling yards in Virginia, Mississippi and Louisiana, with more than 30,000 workers. But the talks with the Navy heated up after Northrop settled on the spinoff late last year.
The debate over the proposal also coincided with concerns by Pentagon officials about how to promote more competition for military contracts.
Ashton B. Carter, the Pentagon's top acquisition official, warned in February that the largest military contractors would not be allowed to merge. In the same speech, he also appeared to caution Northrop about the spinoff, saying that transparency from contractors was essential ''as we review proposals that may result in the creation of weaker stand-alone firms less likely to thrive without the necessary capital structure that their larger parent company is able to provide.''
Northrop has said that its top shipbuilding executives will run the new company, which will be based in Newport News, Va. The corporation's Newport News shipbuilding unit is the only company that builds the Navy's aircraft carriers, and it splits the work on nuclear submarines with General Dynamics.
David Petu, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said Tuesday that it could be an advantage for the new company to have its executives focusing only on shipbuilding. Other analysts said it would be easier for them to reinvest the company's cash in shipbuilding since they would not have more profitable alternatives, as Northrop does.
Northrop's Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina, and Mr. Petu said the new company could get in trouble if a similar disaster struck.
Fitch assigned an overall BB default rating to the company, just below the lowest investment grade ratings. Moody's Investors Service gave it a similar Ba2 rating, and S.& P classified it as BB-minus.
The ratings mean that Huntington Ingalls will pay higher interest rates than Northrop would have. The new company recently sold $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes at interest rates of 6.875 percent and 7.125 percent.
Northrop had said it planned to eventually close its shipyard in Avondale, La., and transfer the work to Ingalls. The Navy has sharply criticized the mistakes made on a series of amphibious ships built at the Gulf Coast yards.
The company's most critical work takes place in Newport News, and it also has had problems there. Just last week, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against a former Northrop Grumman shipyard inspector, accusing him of falsifying weld certifications on a submarine.
Analysts said that to succeed, the new company will have to cut costs -- and probably more jobs -- at the Gulf Coast shipyards. And an even bigger test will be how it manages construction of a new class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The first one, being built now, is projected to cost $11.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Ex-Chief Of Freddie May Face Civil Action

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
The former chief executive of Freddie Mac may face a civil action as the government ramps up an investigation of disclosure practices at the mortgage finance giant and its sister company, Fannie Mae, people briefed on the investigation said.
The executive, Richard F. Syron, a former president of the American Stock Exchange and now an adjunct professor and trustee at Boston College, has received a so-called Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission, an indication the agency is considering an enforcement action against him.
Mr. Syron, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, is the latest executive mentioned in the government's sweeping examination of the two government-controlled companies. Three others have already been sent Wells notices, and at least two others are thought to have received them, the people briefed on the investigation said. Last week, Daniel H. Mudd, the former chief executive of Fannie Mae, received a Wells notice, and another former Fannie executive is expected to receive one as well, these people said. 
The S.E.C.'s long-running investigation is now zeroing in on how Freddie and Fannie publicly disclosed their exposure to risky loans and whether those depictions were too rosy, according to the people briefed on the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry is not complete. Although the companies offered detailed snapshots of their mortgage portfolios, the S.E.C. is exploring whether they underreported their ownership of subprime loans and mortgages that required few documents from borrowers.
The government continues to examine the potential culpability of people and agencies involved in the mortgage mess and the subsequent financial crisis.
The Justice Department has investigated Fannie and Freddie but no charges have been brought.
The S.E.C., which has faced intense criticism for bringing few prominent cases stemming from the crisis, has now spent two years interviewing former and current employees at the two companies. If the case against Fannie and Freddie officials proceeds, it may shape up to be one of the most significant actions brought by the agency in recent years.
The S.E.C., however, could decline to file suit against any of those who received Wells notices. Recipients of such a notice can choose to challenge the allegations against them in hopes of heading off any civil action. After receiving his notice in mid-January, Mr. Syron offered a rebuttal to the possible accusations on Feb. 22, according to his lawyer, Mark D. Hopson.
''We have made a submission to the commission which demonstrates that Mr. Syron, as C.E.O., oversaw a very rigorous and fulsome disclosure process and that the company's disclosures were in fact wholly accurate and complete,'' Mr. Hopson, a partner at Sidley Austin, said in a statement. ''Any proposed charges against our client are completely without merit.''
Mr. Mudd, now the chief executive at the publicly traded hedge fund Fortress Investment Group, is also planning to contest any allegations against him. Donald J. Bisenius, an executive vice president at Freddie Mac, and Anthony S. Piszel, the former chief financial officer at Freddie, both received notices as well and are also challenging them. Mr. Bisenius plans to leave Freddie Mac, while Mr. Piszel has resigned as chief financial officer of CoreLogic. Mr. Mudd, however, so far has the support of Fortress.
The S.E.C. investigation centers around Fannie's and Freddie's disclosures from 2006 to 2008. Regulators are focusing on the way both companies reported their subprime mortgage portfolios and concentrations of loans extended to borrowers who offered little documentation, also known as Alt-A loans.
The issues relate to how the two companies defined subprime. While there is no universal definition, it is often identified with characteristics that include borrowers with low credit scores and poor payment histories. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, however, categorized loans as prime or subprime based on the lender rather than on the loan itself. At Fannie, the company adopted lenders' differing definitions of what constituted Alt-A loans, causing the company to underreport its exposure.
During that period, however, both companies did disclose to investors breakdowns of their loan portfolios by slicing data according to borrowers' credit scores and how much equity they had in their homes, among other things, filings show.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were public companies that operated with a Congressional mandate to foster homeownership. They do not offer loans, but instead buy up thousands of mortgages from lenders, package them and sell them as securities to investors. The lenders, for their part, use the money to offer new loans to consumers.
By 2005, lawmakers and lenders began to push the companies to delve deeper into the risky subprime markets, to enhance business and offer the chance at homeownership to a segment of the population often ignored by lenders. The companies, meanwhile, sought to regain market share that they had ceded to Wall Street.
But the billions of dollars in risky mortgages acquired at the height of the real estate bubble ultimately sank the once-mighty mortgage financiers. The Bush administration rescued Fannie and Freddie from the brink of collapse in September 2008, effectively making them wards of the federal government. The companies have since tapped more than $100 billion from their government lifelines. Fannie recently requested an additional $2.6 billion from the Treasury Department while Freddie requested $500 million.
Last month, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner called for the slow wind-down of the two companies.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Meacham Signs Gore for Random House

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Now certainly feels like one of those moments when the world needs to be explained to us, and Random House believes it has found just the writer to do it: Al Gore, the former vice president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, will write a new book about what he calls ''the drivers of global change,'' that connects the dots among social, economic and political forces shaping our times, Random House said on Tuesday. The book, which is planned for release next year and does not yet have a title, is the first acquisition for the publishing house by Jon Meacham, the author and former Newsweek editor, who was named an executive vice president at the Random House Publishing Group in January.
Mr. Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winner for his Andrew Jackson biography ''American Lion,'' and, like Mr. Gore a Tennessean, said in a telephone interview that the former vice president's best-selling books ''An Inconvenient Truth'' and ''The Assault on Reason'' had established him as an author who ''has been early and right'' on anticipating global trends. 
''He's proven over the last decade or more that he's a man worth listening to,'' Mr. Meacham said. ''And he's bringing now decades, plural, of thinking and experience to this book, to take his arguments beyond climate change and really look at the global future.''
In a statement, Mr. Gore said he intended for the book to ''start a conversation about the large-scale drivers of change that are defining and shaping our future - from the rapid development and integration of radically new technologies to the planet-changing impact of the climate crisis, to poverty, globalization and the democratization of knowledge accompanying the emergence of a ubiquitous Internet linking ever-more-intelligent devices.''
Despite the history-altering events that have sprung up in a matter of weeks, from the revolutions sweeping the Middle East to the natural and nuclear catastrophes afflicting Japan, Mr. Meacham argued that Mr. Gore's book would not be a relic by the time it is released.
''The news cycle is not going to affect the population questions in the Arab world,'' Mr. Meacham said. ''The news cycle is not going to affect the rise of extremism. The news cycle is not going to affect the trend toward the incredible intimacy of economic relationships. This is above and beyond the news cycle. It's of what's going on, but not about it.''
In his own recent history, Mr. Meacham came to the Random House Publishing Group from Newsweek, where he became editor in 2006 and published an excerpt of Mr. Gore's book ''Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis'' in 2009. He stepped down at Newsweek after it was sold by the Washington Post Company to Sidney Harman. The magazine has since been merged with The Daily Beast Web site and is now edited by Tina Brown.
Of the new print incarnation of Newsweek, which was introduced earlier this month, Mr. Meacham said, ''I think everything looks great, and the magazine has a terrific future. I wish it extremely well.''
Asked if he had his eye on any other possible acquisitions for Random House, Mr. Meacham said only, ''Stay tuned.''

HEADLINE: Economic Downturn Holds Fierce Grip On Border Town

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
EL CENTRO, Calif. -- This is the desert, not meant for lush fields and tight cul-de-sacs. But here they are, a few miles from the Mexican border. For a time, this was a thriving place that represented the promise of a new middle-class life, full of hope and optimism.
Now, some of that hope, too, is drying out in the sun.
For two years, El Centro has struggled with the highest unemployment rate in the country. The latest official figures put it at 28 percent, an improvement from the peak of 32 percent last summer. At unemployment centers, often the most bustling places in town, it is something of a competition to talk about how long a job search has lasted. 
Eleven months hardly raises an eyebrow. Two years might draw a little sympathy.
The job losses here began as fewer workers were needed to pluck asparagus and lettuce from the fields. Then the housing boom collapsed, devastating thousands who once had steady construction work. The same two forces have pummeled other cities around the country. But El Centro has taken a third, crippling hit: with tighter security making lines at the border longer each day, restaurants and shops that once relied on Mexican tourists are struggling.
Visitors still come from the other side, from the metropolis of Mexicali to the strip malls and small towns that make up the Imperial Valley, about 100 miles east of San Diego and less than a mile from the border. But there are fewer of them.
Now, many come to collect unemployment checks. After working legally in the United States, they are eligible for the same benefits as any resident, a situation that some say drives up the unemployment rate. It is impossible to know how much, because California does not track those figures. But each month, their checks are delivered to relatives or post office boxes near the border.
''People don't understand what we learn to live with here,'' said Sam Couchman, the director of the Imperial County Workforce Development Office here. Mr. Couchman has spent more than three decades guiding work training programs in the county and said he does not expect the unemployment rate drop to below 20 percent in the next decade. ''We have all kinds of up and downs, but it doesn't send us into a panic. This is the way life is here.''
California's agricultural heartland has been hit particularly hard in the downturn -- 8 of the 10 metro areas with the highest jobless rates are in the state, in central inland cities like Fresno, Modesto and Merced. But the only area that comes close to El Centro's unemployment rate is Yuma, Ariz., another border town about 55 miles east of here.
''You have someone who is considered a local resident but lives in another country,'' Mr. Couchman said. ''We don't have that problem in Fresno. But it also means that we have tens of thousands of people a day visiting us to make purchases and go shopping.''
The county has grown over the last decade, but still has fewer than 200,000 residents. And the local economy has long depended on the other side of the border -- ''If Mexicali sneezes, we get pneumonia,'' people around here like to say. So when tougher security measures at the border came after threats related to terrorism and Mexico's drug war, businesses here almost immediately felt the pinch. A decade ago, crossing the border was a 20-minute inconvenience. Now the wait in the morning can stretch into a two- or three-hour ordeal.
Carlton Hargrave, the owner of the Family Buffet restaurant in Calexico, the town that hugs the Mexican border, said that since he opened in 1993, the vast majority of customers travel from the other side.
In the last year or so, Mr. Hargrave has laid off more than half of his roughly 40 employees. Most of them live in Mexicali, he said, and few return. ''People used to say they were coming to take your jobs,'' he said. ''Now, we know that's not true. They are coming to make your jobs.''
Some El Centro neighborhoods look like a ghost town. Downtown is pockmarked with shuttered storefronts and broken signs. But in other areas, the city is more like quintessential suburbia, with cookie-cutter housing tracts and huge parking lots outside big box stores. Border Patrol agents are just as likely to roam the streets as city police officers.
The year-round sun and the affordability make the city an attractive place to live. The cost of living is much less than in Los Angeles or San Diego, yet it is possible to get to either place within hours. Some young people can hardly wait to escape, but for many, staying in the town their grandparents helped create nearly a century ago is a point of pride. When the annual county fair comes along, neighbors routinely pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for animals raised by local schoolchildren.
''That unemployment rate is a black eye, but it's a real misnomer,'' said Timothy E. Kelly, president of the Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation, who considers marketing the area a personal mission. ''You don't come here seeing people on the streets. We've got a ready and eager work force.''
For some people, the unemployment numbers are more of a nuisance than anything. Some relatively well-heeled residents say they do not know anyone without a job. If anyone is not working, they say, it must be because they are not really looking. They point to the large hiring banner in front of the International House of Pancakes.
There has long been a promise that the heat and sunshine will provide work. Local leaders speak excitedly about geothermal plants and solar projects bringing more jobs. Several training programs offer courses to develop skills for that kind of work. But Jesse Aguilar, who completed such a class last year, said that of the 30 in his class, only two have found jobs. Both of them are at fast food outlets.
''People tell us to be hopeful, but that's pretty hard sometimes,'' Mr. Aguilar said. These days, he visits the local unemployment center about once a week, combing through job listings. His wife has a steady income, working at one of the centers helping people like him try to find jobs. ''Every night I pray for it -- to be able to take care of everybody again.''
Mr. Aguilar moved from San Jose in 2003, knowing there would be construction work. And there was. He made as much as $960 a week, plus a bit on side jobs and landscaping. Now there are no construction crews here, so Mr. Aguilar takes his resume to Home Depot and Costco.
There are no hard numbers, but unemployment seems to have hit men here particularly hard. They were more likely to work in construction and other jobs hurt by the economy, while women took more stable jobs in government, which remains the largest employer in the region.
Edward Castenon has kept careful notes about every job posting he has responded to. With each application, he marks a note in red on his computer calendar. Entire months are filled with red, going back to when he first lost his job as a technician for Starbucks in 2009. Because he is a military veteran, Mr. Castenon, 43, is eligible for a program that would pay half his salary in any job he receives. He sends a letter explaining the program to every potential employer. But they rarely respond.
''I'm not even overqualified,'' he said one recent afternoon, sitting at his dining room table with his wife. They married two years ago, each with two teenage daughters from first marriages. As a technician, repairing coffee machines all over the area, he earned about $23 an hour. Now he applies for jobs that would pay far less.
''Before I have to work at McDonald's or a Jack in the Box, I need to pursue every other option,'' he said. ''There is honor in every job, but I have a family to be loyal to.''

HEADLINE: Headlines From Mideast And Japan Spook Investors

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Reporting was contributed by Eric Dash, Matthew Saltmarsh and Bettina Wassener.

 BODY:
There was no respite for weary investors Wednesday as deepening worries about the nuclear crisis in Japan prompted another sharp sell-off, leaving stocks in negative territory for the year.
The anxiety was heightened by increasing volatility as stocks, bonds and currencies alike swung sharply through the course of a trading day punctuated by worsening news reports about Japan as well as word that police and riot troops had clashed again with protesters in Bahrain.
''There is so much uncertainty about the Japanese situation and the Middle East that people are just struggling to quantify them,'' said Barry Knapp, head of American equity strategy at Barclays Capital. 
Japanese stocks seemed set for another volatile trading day Thursday, amid reports that foreign financial firms are pushing Japanese stock market officials to halt trading. The Nikkei 225 index was down 1.5 percent in afternoon trading.
The Japanese yen strengthened further Wednesday, striking a 16-year high, on speculation that Japanese investors may be selling their overseas holdings of assets like American Treasuries to bring capital home to help pay for reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami.
Investors have been hit by one hard-to-foresee event after another in the last year, leaving them bewildered, Mr. Knapp said. From the European sovereign debt crisis to the protests across the Middle East and now the Japanese earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, the risks to the world economy seem to be multiplying.
Wednesday started on a calmer note, with investors seemingly reassured by a 5 percent recovery in Japanese shares. But stocks slumped shortly after 11 a.m. when traders focused on a warning from a European Union official in Brussels that a catastrophic event at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant might be imminent.
Treasury bond prices spiked at the same time, forcing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to cancel a bond-buying operation for the first time.
Stocks recovered slightly around midday, only to fall sharply again.
By the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 242.12 points, or 2.04 percent, to 11,613.30. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 24.99 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,256.88. The Nasdaq declined 50.51 points, or 1.89 percent, to 2,616.82, hurt by a 4 percent fall in Apple after a rare downgrade by an analyst.
All three major indexes have fallen more than 3.5 percent so far this week, putting the benchmark S.& P. 500 index down about 0.1 percent for the year.
Oil prices climbed back above $98 a barrel as violence intensified in North Africa and the Middle East.
The VIX, a measure of volatility in the Standard & Poor's stock market index, rose to its highest level in more than six months, and market participants reported unusually large sales in the S.& P. 500 e-mini future, the instrument that was one of the triggers of last May's flash crash, and big sales of some exchange-traded funds linked to Treasury bond yields, adding to the feverish atmosphere.
Treasuries rose, continuing their ascent of recent days. Since Japan's earthquake and tsunami on March 11, the prices of risky assets like stocks and commodities have plummeted while safe-haven investments like Treasuries have risen. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose a full percentage point late Thursday to 103 22/32, and the yield fell to 3.19 percent, from 3.30 percent.
With the uncertainty around the world rising, government officials and central bankers signaled that they were prepared to act.
The Bank of Japan continued to pump liquidity into the financial system on Wednesday, and Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, raised the possibility that Japan could receive financial assistance from other countries. Ms. Lagarde announced that she was arranging a discussion for as early as Thursday among finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 countries to assess the economic impact of the crisis in Japan and a possible response.
In particular, officials in Paris think that the European Central Bank still has room to maneuver -- certainly compared with the American Federal Reserve -- in terms of using monetary tools to bolster liquidity in markets.
Still, global central bankers have plenty of options to choose from if the situation in Japan and the global markets deteriorate. One initial plan could center on opening lines of credit from major central banks. Similar facilities were opened by some central banks after the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 and during the financial panic of 2008-9.
In this case, the Bank of Japan would provide a steady stream of yen to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, ensuring that private banks would have easy access to the Japanese currency. Demand for yen has been rising in recent days, as Japanese insurers and other financial firms sell their most liquid assets, like stocks and commodities, to generate cash to use at home for rebuilding efforts.
With sensitivity so high, it took only a comment by the European Union energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, to unnerve traders Wednesday. He told lawmakers in Brussels that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was ''effectively out of control.''
''In the coming hours, there could be further catastrophic events,'' he said, according to Bloomberg News. That assessment was based on information from the European Union, the union's mission in Tokyo, the International Atomic Energy Agency and media reports, he said.
''This spooked the markets,'' an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, Marc Chandler, said.
Even though a spokesman was reported as quickly qualifying the commissioner's statements, saying Mr. Oettinger had no special information beyond what was public, the damage was done. ''Having witnessed a fall of such magnitude and so fast, the skittishness remained,'' said Guy Lebas of Janney Montgomery Scott.

HEADLINE: Heads Bowed In Grateful Memory

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
There is a bit of Owsley in me.
You see, my father, a strait-laced middle-class Jewish kid from Los Angeles, enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1964.
That same year, in that same town, a brilliant renegade named Augustus Owsley Stanley III spent three weeks in the university library's organic chemistry stacks learning the secrets of synthesizing lysergic acid diethylamide, also known as LSD. Before long, Owsley was creating mass quantities of the purest acid the world had ever known, just in time for the seismic cultural and generational transformation of the era. By the time my father graduated from Berkeley in 1969 with degrees in sociology and economics, the world had changed and my dad along with it.
My very existence is a direct product of that moment, when old cultural systems gave way, for better or for worse. I was born just a few years later after my father, by then a politically active hippie, moved to New York and married a young working-class black woman from Bridgeport, Conn.
It should almost go without saying that such a story would have been quite literally unthinkable before the social upheaval of that time engulfed America. And Owsley connected some of the dots. 
Owsley Stanley died last weekend in a car crash in Australia, where he lived. It was Owsley who made Ken Kesey's parties the Acid Tests. It was Owsley who made 300,000 hits for the Human Be-In. It was Owsley who gave acid to Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend and Brian Jones (among many others) at the legendary Monterey Pop Festival of 1967. It was Owsley who agreed to deliver a lifetime supply of LSD to John Lennon. And certainly not least, it was Owsley who originally financed, inspired, amplified and dosed the great American rock band, the Grateful Dead (more about that in a bit).
On Tuesday evening my father, Jonathan, sent me an e-mail about Owsley and what it was like to be present at the epicenter of a cultural revolution.
''Owsley Stanley,'' my dad wrote. ''Didn't know his first name was Owsley. Just knew that the first few hits of acid were called Owsley. Went with friends to the Fillmore West to see Janis Joplin and the Holding Company, or so I was told. They laughed when I told them that I didn't know who she was. Had just started U.C. Berkeley and had taken an Alternative Course in creative writing and another course on Gandhi. Dropped the Acid and well what is time and space anyway. The second hit of Owsley was back in Santa Monica where I walked a stairway to the clouds above, or was in the process of doing that when gentle hands pulled me back from the cliff. Rainbow Bubbles streaming across the room from the sounds of the Grateful Dead.''
There was certainly a dark side to the 1960s drug culture. But many people, including my father, considered LSD positively transforming.
''Before Acid, my neck was so strong from carrying the concrete and bars that made up my skull and with the drug coursing through me the concrete chipped off and WOW, I could see and hear and feel so much. Just a reflection of pre-acid American culture chipping off; one chip for repression, another chip for anxiety, another chip for ignorance, another chip floating away carrying my image of short hair, plaid shorts, tennis shoes and high ankle socks. What remains is the sculpture revealed, the New Age of liberation and caring so deeply that it was impossible to remain hidden in classrooms of agonizing dogma. Take to the streets. Let Love be heard. Let Love be seen. Let Love be felt.''
Given the family history, it may seem a surprise that I actually didn't learn about Owsley, LSD and the Grateful Dead from my father, or even while I was growing up in Woodstock, N.Y., the renowned hippie town.
For that I had to wait until I met the other kids at one of the nation's most exclusive elite boarding schools, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
By the time I showed up as a 14-year-old in 1987, Andover, as the school is known, had been a Grateful Dead hotbed for at least a decade. Not coincidentally, LSD was readily available on campus.
When I got there I was a serious Led Zeppelin fan, but of course by then you couldn't actually go see Led Zeppelin anymore. The Grateful Dead, on the other hand, was this mythic creature that was actually alive and more popular than ever. (In 1987 the Dead released the popular album ''In The Dark'' and the band's biggest hit single, ''Touch of Grey.'')
That fall one of my 10th-grade classmates, Liza Ryan, received a new teddy bear from her father. She named it Owsley. (Owsley's nickname, known wide and far, was Bear.) Before long she and I and many of our schoolmates were on our way to becoming the last, final generation of true Deadheads.
Soon I learned about how Owsley designed some of the first modern rock amplification systems for the Grateful Dead, culminating in the over-the-top (literally) ''Wall of Sound'' in 1974. As I started collecting tapes of Dead performances, I learned about how Owsley was probably the first sound engineer in the world regularly to record and archive every performance by a band straight from the soundboard. (Rolling Stones fans wish they had had one of those in the early days.) Naturally, the first Dead album I ever bought is known as ''Bear's Choice.''
''I think growing up in the early 1980s it was kind of a dark time, and it felt like minds were contracting rather than expanding,'' Liza said on the phone from the Bay Area on Tuesday, speaking eloquently for our cohort. ''Everyone was worried about nuclear war and the arms race and the Cold War and that movie 'The Day After' about a nuclear holocaust. It was a scary time. And it seemed like the '60s were a time when people were embracing civil rights and crossing social boundaries and of course the music was great. So I guess I was trying to connect with aspects of the '60s that seemed to have been lost.
''I called my teddy bear Owsley because he always seemed to be this fascinating character, this magician in the corner making everything happen, not just with the acid and the sound systems but in pushing the band out to different audiences.''
I attended my second Grateful Dead concert, on July 9, 1989, at Giants Stadium, in the company of a famous New York City acid dealer named Mountain. I was 16. Mountain, who was probably in his 50s, told me that he had known Owsley back in the day, and that he was one of the most extraordinary people on the planet. I believed him.
By the end of that show I was on the bus, as they say. And by the time Jerry Garcia died in 1995, when I was 22, I had seen the Dead more than 90 times.
So there is a bit of Owsley in me. And if modern popular music means anything to you, there is a bit of Owsley in you too.

HEADLINE: Atlantic Yards Plans to Build Tallest Prefab

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In a bid to cut costs at his star-crossed Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, the developer Bruce C. Ratner is pursuing plans to erect the world's tallest prefabricated steel structure, a 34-story tower that would fulfill his obligation to start building affordable housing at the site.
The prefabricated, or modular, method he would use, which is untested at that height, could cut construction costs in half by saving time and requiring substantially fewer and cheaper workers. And the large number of buildings planned for the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards -- 16 in all, not including the Nets arena now under construction -- could also make it economical for the company to run its own modular factory, where walls, ceilings, floors, plumbing and even bathrooms and kitchens could be installed in prefabricated steel-frame boxes.
The 34-story building, with roughly 400 apartments, would comprise more than 900 modules that would be hauled to Atlantic Yards, lifted into place by crane and bolted together at the corner of Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street, next to the arena. 
Mr. Ratner's development company, Forest City Ratner, has been investigating modular construction for a year, but has kept its plans secret. MaryAnne Gilmartin, executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, confirmed Wednesday that the company was seriously considering the modular method, although, she added, no final decision had been made.
The company has also continued to design a conventional tower. Forest City hired Ove Arup & Partners, a prominent engineering firm, for the modular work, while SHoP Architects is working on designs for both types of buildings. The developer has also recently directed real estate brokers to scout for sites in Long Island City, Queens, that would be large enough to accommodate the modular factory.
''The company is interested in modular, high-rise construction in an urban setting,'' Ms. Gilmartin said. ''It's driven by cost and efficiencies.''
But it would also infuriate the construction workers who were Mr. Ratner's most ardent supporters during years of stormy community meetings, where they drowned out neighborhood opponents with chants of, ''Jobs, jobs, jobs.''
''This is something that could be of great consequence to the building trades,'' said Gary La Barbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella group for the construction unions. ''We have never been supportive of prefab buildings, for obvious reasons.'' After several years of delays, Forest City is under considerable pressure because of the difficulty in obtaining financing for the building and the weak real estate market. Work on the arena began a year ago. The developer has delayed the start date for the 34-story building, the first of the 16 planned for Atlantic Yards, several times. He now says he hopes to begin by the end of the year.
Under an agreement with the state, Forest City must begin excavation by May 2013, or pay up to $5 million in penalties for every year it falls behind.
Affordable-housing advocates, who supported Atlantic Yards because at least 30 percent of the more than 6,000 apartments would be reserved for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants, have been pressuring the company to start building. But Rafael E. Cestero, the city's commissioner of housing preservation and development, who had already set aside $14 million to subsidize 150 units in the first building, declined Mr. Ratner's recent request for an additional $10 million in subsidies.
In pursuit of cutting construction costs, Mr. Ratner and Ms. Gilmartin recently traveled to Europe to talk to builders involved with what is currently the world's tallest modular building: a 25-story dormitory in Wolverhampton, England, that was built last year in less than 12 months.
Mr. Ratner has also become captivated by a YouTube video depicting the assembly of the 15-story Ark Hotel in China in a matter of days.
Modular buildings are not new to New York City. The School Construction Authority has used the technology to build classrooms. Capsys, a modular builder at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has built steel-frame, prefabricated housing up to seven stories tall in Clinton Hill and East New York, Brooklyn, and on Long Island.
Whether taller modular buildings can be built to withstand intense wind shear and seismic forces, while retaining cost savings, is another question, because the higher a structure is built, the more bracing it would require.
''At a smaller scale, prefab buildings have proven to be more efficient, more sustainable and less expensive,'' said Thomas Hanrahan, dean of Pratt Institute's School of Architecture. ''The taller the building, the logistical and structural issues become much more complex.''
Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, said city rules did not prohibit Forest City Ratner from using modular construction on the building. ''There's nothing standing in the way of a prefab building as long as they follow our regulations,'' he said.
If it is feasible, Mr. Hanrahan and Ms. Gilmartin of Forest City said that Atlantic Yards is an ideal site because it is large enough for cranes to maneuver. ''Industrialized and modular construction is an idea whose time has come,'' said the architect James Garrison, who worked briefly on the project.
Modular construction saves time because the building components can be put together at the same time the foundation is being dug, and because the factory is indoors, weather is not a problem. Materials can be bought in greater bulk and stored on-site. More of the work is done horizontally, on the factory floor, rather than vertically, saving the time it would normally take for all the plumbers, carpenters, electricians and others to move up and down the structure every day.
But it is the labor savings that are suddenly worrying some union officials, who were repeatedly asked by Forest City to mobilize their members for years of raucous community meetings.
The state and the city agreed to provide $300 million in direct subsidies for Atlantic Yards, in part, because Forest City insisted that the project would generate ''upwards of 17,000 union construction jobs.''
Not to worry, Ms. Gilmartin said, ''We're a union shop, and we build union.''
But under current wage scales, union workers earn less in a factory than they do on-site. A carpenter earns $85 an hour in wages and benefits on-site, but only $35 an hour in a factory.
And while modular construction employs a large number of carpenters, iron workers, who earn as much as $93.88 an hour in pay and benefits, could lose a lot of jobs.
One construction professional, who was familiar with Forest City Ratner's plans but requested anonymity because he did not want to anger the company, said, ''The incentive is to move as much work as possible to the factory from the field.''

HEADLINE: Insurer To Forgo Rate Rise

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Blue Shield of California, a nonprofit insurer, on Wednesday withdrew its request to seek higher rates this year for individual policies amid stiff criticism from regulators and consumers.
Some people would have experienced rate increases as high as 87 percent if Blue Shield had gone ahead with all of its planned increases. Blue Shield's retreat echoed moves last year by WellPoint, the large commercial insurer whose proposed premium increases were met with stiff resistance that spread across the country and even evoked denunciations from President Obama.
In making its announcement, Blue Shield emphasized its role as a nonprofit organization in seeking to provide insurance to as many people as possible. ''By agreeing not to raise rates this year, we are helping to make coverage more affordable for our members during tough economic times,'' said Bruce Bodaken, Blue Shield's chairman and chief executive, in a statement. 
But the reversal could also make it more difficult for other insurers in California, as well as other states, to raise premiums sharply, according to some analysts and advocates, even if companies offer evidence that justifies the increases because of the higher cost of providing medical care to their customers.
Under the one-year-old federal health care law, state regulators are required to play closer attention to what insurers are charging for policies, and some advocates say the reversal is early proof that the law will help keep premiums reasonable. ''What it shows is that scrutiny matters,'' said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group that is in favor of greater oversight of the health insurers.
Blue Shield, however, asserted that an independent review of the proposed increases supported the higher rates. Like other insurers in the state, Blue Shield says it loses money on selling individual coverage. It estimated its decision to keep premiums steady would save policy holders $35 million to $40 million this year, although some customers will still see an increase in their rates.
The company acknowledged that it abandoned its quest for higher rates after encountering such fierce opposition. ''We were very frustrated by the negative attention we were getting,'' said Tom Epstein, a spokesman for the insurer, which has been a vocal proponent of many of the changes required by the federal health care law. The law will succeed only if people can afford to buy coverage under the new system, he said.
Blue Shield's decision also illustrates how the insurers are able to absorb the losses associated with selling individual coverage because they are generating profits in other markets, like selling coverage for employers. ''It's a reflection of how well Blue Shield and the industry are doing in their overall business,'' said Carl McDonald, an industry analyst for Citigroup.
The question is whether state regulators reviewing the rate requests by other insurers will look beyond the economics of selling individual coverage to determine whether to approve sharp increases. In Connecticut, for example, WellPoint had sought a double-digit increase but was rebuffed by state regulators.
Still, the fact that Blue Shield initially asked for higher rates may make other increases more palatable, according to Roger Collier, an industry consultant. ''If Blue Shield had simply not raised rates or requested a small increase, that would have made life difficult for everyone else,'' he said.
While both state and federal regulators praised the insurer's decision, they also signaled that they continued to favor heavy oversight of the rates insurers can charge. The federal law allows review of proposed rates, but only some states have gone further to give regulators the authority to deny any increases they view as excessive or unreasonable. California, for example, is currently weighing proposed legislation to expand regulators' powers.
Blue Shield's decision, which was made while California regulators were still reviewing its proposal, ''is very welcome news,'' said Dave Jones, the state insurance commissioner, ''but it underscores the need here in California to give the insurance commissioner the authority to reject excessive rate hikes.''
While Blue Shield had agreed to his request to delay the increases, insurers can go ahead and raise rates, regardless of whether they are justified. ''At the end of the day the health insurers hold all of the cards. They get to decide,'' he said.
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services also emphasized the need for states to grant their regulators the power to deny rate requests, in a statement responding to Blue Shield's announcement. ''We believe that insurance commissioners should have rate approval authority and will continue to support states' efforts to review premium increases and protect consumers,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Dish That's Always in Fashion

BYLINE: By BEE-SHYUAN CHANG

 BODY:
ONE fashion favorite appeared at the Chanel SoHo reopening party last September, popped up again at the Calvin Klein spring 2011 dinner a week later and was renewed for a second act at the C.F.D.A./Vogue Fashion Fund Awards in November and L'Wren Scott's fall 2011 collection luncheon in February.
No, it wasn't Blake Lively, though the ''Gossip Girl'' actress made her rounds at two of the aforementioned four. It was the humble potpie. 
As trends go, chicken potpie has been making headway on menus since the beginning of the recession in late 2007. The pastry-topped dish was served at comfort-food stations at black tie galas, and along with its other substantial brethren (macaroni and cheese and meatloaf) was a sign of austerity at fund-raisers in the city. And lately it has gained a particularly strong following among the city's high fashion set.
''I was surprised as anyone that it's done so well with my fashion guests,'' the chef John DeLucie said at the Lion, his restaurant in the West Village. ''It's a ton of flour and butter. It's not really for a calorie-counter or carb-avoider. We don't try to make it light, just really good.''
Arguably, Mr. DeLucie, who was born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, can be credited with taking the homely entree to fashionable heights. In late 2006 at the reimagined Waverly Inn, he introduced the potpie because of an old menu he had discovered jammed into the restaurant's floorboards. There, amid a celebrity-cloistered crowd that included Demi Moore, Jennifer Connelly and Ms. Lively, the chicken potpie became one of the restaurant's best sellers.
When Mr. DeLucie left to start the Lion early last year, he brought the dish with him, this time gussied up with lobster filling. A stylish flock followed suit, including Francisco Costa, the Calvin Klein women's wear designer, who ordered lobster potpies for his celebratory dinner at the Lion after showing his spring 2011 collection last September.
''Back at the Waverly, it was almost this novelty,'' said Mr. DeLucie, who also made 2,000 miniature chicken potpies for the MTV Movie Awards last year. ''But private dinner parties continue to order it because it's not challenging food. It's like my uncle's old Rambler: a car they don't make anymore. It's very nostalgic and very dependable.''
The dish has done a number on the fashion crowd. The model Coco Rocha, Vera Wang and Lily Kwong (a cousin of the designer Joseph Altuzarra) each mentioned chicken potpie on their respective blogs. Ms. Rocha wrote: ''We were treated to what we all agreed was probably the best chicken potpie anyone had ever tasted. Of course, none of the fashion people at the table dared to be the one to finish the whole thing.''
Something about the humble dish also inspired Twitter updates, including posts from Barneys and the fashion photographer Sophie Elgort, and often accompanied by a camera-phone snapshot. Ms. Elgort, whose father is the photographer Arthur Elgort, was particularly pleased with the celery-root version at the Fat Radish, a British-leaning Lower East Side restaurant that opened in October and is popular with young fashion editors. A month after the opening, Barneys and the model Tori Praver hosted a dinner there for the Surfrider Foundation. Naturally, the house potpie was on the family-style menu.
If the dish is having a high-flying moment, there's a practical sensibility that's appealing. ''It's Anna Wintour's favorite dish because it's quick to serve and moves things right along,'' said her private chef, Hank Tomashevski. ''It's got everything you need in there, vegetables and a meat for meat-eaters, in one course.'' Mr. Tomashevski catered the Vogue awards in 2009 and last year at Skylight Soho, where Ms. Wintour requested chicken potpie as the single offering. ''It's funny because people keep on requesting them,'' he said. ''I also make them for the fashion P.R. agency KCD for their holiday party and other events. It's a real crowd pleaser.''
Most recently, Mr. Tomashevski served potpie on March 15 at the dinner party to toast Katie Holmes's fall collection for Holmes & Yang, a fashion line the actress founded with Jeanne Yang.
Ms. Wintour isn't the only repeat fan. At L'Wren Scott's fall 2011 show plus luncheon in February, the guests (who included Ms. Wren's boyfriend, Mick Jagger) had chicken or vegetarian potpies and Pouilly-Fuisse. The designer had previously ordered potpies for her fall 2010 showing. ''We presented some options to L'Wren such as a salade nicoise and a bento box, but she went back to the potpie,'' said Franck Cursat, managing director of Olivier Cheng Catering and Events. ''Her fashion presentation was about eight to ten minutes and for service we only had about four minutes. The potpie is one dish and it's easy to serve. Because it's already prepared, it's also more likely to be consistent, which is something we always consider.''
The fashion photographer Bruce Weber and his longtime partner, Nan Bush, order the dish for their annual December holiday party in the city from the catering chef Janet O'Brien, but also for their Long Island summer home in Montauk. ''They absolutely love it,'' said Ms. O'Brien, whose main office is in Sag Harbor, N.Y. ''Nan will drop by in June and maybe order four and freeze two.''
In fact, June is one of her busiest months for chicken potpie. ''It's when many of the magazines plan photo shoots by the beach and especially Montauk,'' said Ms O'Brien, who counts the fashion photographers Steven Klein and Patrick Demarchelier as clients. ''Shoot days are usually very long and the water in June is still cold. I'll send out pot pie and shepherd's pie. They're soothing and the crust means they keep warm longer. It keeps everyone cheerful.''

HEADLINE: On Long Island, Local Inspiration, Global Ambition

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.
HOW do you transform a sleepy local museum into a regional powerhouse? Many institutions have tried by raising a wondrous building. And at first glance, the Parrish Art Museum, in one of America's richest resort areas, appears to be doing just that.
Its new building, a 615-foot-long, lean barnlike structure designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, is expected to transform the Parrish into a destination -- not to mention a fantastic summer party space -- when it opens in summer 2012 northeast of Southampton in Water Mill, just off Highway 27.
Driving around the construction site one snowy day last month, Terrie Sultan, the museum's director, seemed barely able to contain her excitement as she pointed out the north-facing skylights and the concrete benches that will line the building's outer walls.
But later, in her office in the museum's longtime site, a fusty Italianate building on Jobs Lane in Southampton, Ms. Sultan made it clear that her enthusiasm went far beyond the new building. ''You have to remember that the building is in service of the program,'' she said. 
That program, as she has reconceived it during her three-year tenure, is now structured firmly around something more enduring than real estate or parties: the East End's artistic legacy, and its effect upon the larger art world.
Once home to Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Roy Lichtenstein, among many others, the area has been an artists' colony since the 19th century, when William Merritt Chase founded the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art here. Today's residents, full time or seasonal, include Chuck Close, April Gornik, Eric Fischl, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, and Donald Sultan (Ms. Sultan's older brother), as well as many more lesser-known names.
''There are no other places where there's such a huge conglomeration of artists,'' said Ms. Sultan. ''It is what makes the Parrish Art Museum different from all other museums in the country.''
To reinforce that point, she has mounted a mix of exhibitions drawn from the museum's little-known permanent collection, as well as others organized around personalities, or genres and styles like Pop or plein air painting, that are somehow related to the East End.
The current show, ''Esteban Vicente: Portrait of the Artist'' (through April 10), curated by the longtime chief curator, Alicia Longwell, focuses on the expansive creative circle of Mr. Vicente, a New York School painter who lived in Bridgehampton and mixed with artists like Lee Krasner, Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Motherwell.
It was organized in conjunction with the Grey Art Gallery at New York University, whose holdings include many of the same artists as the Parrish, and which lent work to the show. (The Grey's own exhibition of Vicente's collages, some of which came from the Parrish, runs through March 26.)
Ms. Sultan has also made a point of involving prominent local artists. ''She's trying to make it a more dynamic environment and one that invites participation,'' said Ms. Gornik, who participated in last summer's ''Artists Choose Artists,'' a juried show for which nine prominent East Enders chose the finalists.
Ms. Gornik's sentiments were echoed by Ross Bleckner, a Sagaponack part-timer who said he had no relationship with the museum until Ms. Sultan approached him to discuss its future. ''Her ideas about programming,'' said Mr. Bleckner, who recently helped the museum acquire one of his paintings at a reduced price, ''are making it less provincial and more regional.''
The approach has also resounded with the other group that makes the East End distinctive: come summertime, it is a watering hole for some of the most powerful players in the international art market, including the dealer Larry Gagosian, who in 2009 hosted a fund-raising party for the museum, and the collector and hedge fund manager Adam Sender, who became a trustee after delaying his own plans for a public museum. ''I think it will draw the same crowd as MoMA,'' said Mr. Sender, one of six to join the board since last fall. ''The goal is to build it into a world-class museum.''
The board's co-chairman, another contemporary collector, Douglas Polley, put it more diplomatically: ''We have a whole new group of people on the board who feel pieces are in place to do quite a bit,'' he said. In the new building, ''we're envisioning a broader, more progressive future, but we're not really reconceiving the museum's long rich history.''
Born in 1897 as the Art Museum at Southampton, it was established by a New York lawyer, Samuel Longstreth Parrish, to house his holdings of Italian Renaissance paintings and 19th-century plaster casts; both the building and the collection were given to the Village of Southampton after his death. But it didn't take shape as an institution until the 1950s, when another local philanthropist, Rebecca Bolling Littlejohn, chartered the museum as an independent entity, named it for Mr. Parrish, and endowed it with her own collection of American painting, rich in work by Impressionists like Chase and Childe Hassam, as well as local artists of the era, like Fairfield Porter and Larry Rivers.
Over the years, that collection grew to encompass 2,600 objects, by artists as disparate as the portraitist Elizabeth Peyton and the abstract painter Dorothea Rockburne. But because the galleries were so small, most pieces were rarely shown.
In 2005, the board decided to open things up with an $80 million new building, a group of 30 interlocking pavilions by Herzog & de Meuron that would triple the 4,500-square-foot exhibition space. When Ms. Sultan arrived in April 2008, after eight years at the University of Houston's museum when it was called the Blaffer Gallery, the retiring director, Trudy C. Kramer, had raised enough to buy the land and start on the original project.
Ms. Sultan had barely set to work finding the rest when the world economy stumbled -- a turn of events that forced her to cut nearly a quarter of her employees, and to ask the architects to come up with a less expensive plan. Though the building now under construction will have nearly as much gallery space as the previous plan, the cost has been brought down to $25 million -- 80 percent of which has been raised. It will also be easier to maintain than the original design.
''Terrie didn't really let it stop her for a second,'' said Dorothy Lichtenstein, the widow of Roy Lichtenstein and a longtime board member. ''She continued to look for new board members, which she's done pretty successfully, and she really just kind of kept at it.''
For her part, Ms. Sultan said that having to find new solutions with a skeleton staff made for ''a wonderful time,'' adding, ''It felt like everybody was back in graduate school.''
One of her first steps was to make cannier use of the permanent collection. She secured a $100,000 grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to create exhibitions that could tour to make the collection better known, while also raising funds. The first, ''American Landscapes,'' also organized by Ms. Longwell, opened at the Parrish in September 2009 and is now on the road.
Ms. Sultan also began hiring adjunct curators, starting with Klaus Ottmann, the organizer of the 2006 SITE Santa Fe Biennial, whom she advised to delve into the permanent collection. Mr. Ottmann was surprised to find that the Parrish owned the entire contents of the studio of Porter, a midcentury figurative painter who had worked only blocks from the museum, including many canvases and sketches that were unfinished when he died. ''That's when I had the idea to do a show on the creative process,'' Mr. Ottmann said. The result was last spring's ''Fairfield Porter: Raw,'' which drew strong attendance and critical attention.
Mr. Ottmann, who was recently hired by the Phillips Collection in Washington, also organized last summer's first retrospective for Rackstraw Downes, a realist painter known for cityscapes, whose East End connection is that he paints plein air and had edited Porter's critical writings. David Pagel of Los Angeles, another adjunct curator, contributed last fall's ''Underground Pop,'' a show of 10 young artists who are mining that vein today. And Ms. Sultan has also just hired Andrea Grover, the founder of Aurora Picture Show, an experimental movie house in Houston, to dream up more connections between the art history of the area and the art of today.
Other projects in the works include a spring show from the Portuguese multimedia artist Juliao Sarmento, who often incorporates book jackets and literary quotes in his paintings -- an homage to the region's many artist-writer friendships -- and a June retrospective for Rockburne, a product of the legendary Black Mountain Studio School who later studied with Mr. Vicente.
''People think having boundaries is hard,'' Ms. Sultan said, ''but I've always thrived in a museum that has them. These smaller, more regional institutions present some of the best opportunities for creativity.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 22, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the special Museums section on Thursday about the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, N.Y., misspelled the surname of an adjunct curator. He is Klaus Ottmann, not Ottman. The article also misstated the date of the SITE Santa Fe Biennial that Mr. Ottmann organized. It was in 2006, not 2007.

HEADLINE: In Keeping Power Under Sanctions, Leader Goes by the Book

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Signs of economic collapse, big and small, are obvious: a once booming port is as peaceful as a country road; lines of civil servants hoping for pay snake around downtown banks for days; factories, shops and restaurants are shuttered until further notice; eggs are impossible to find in the supermarket.
On the surface, tough international sanctions appear to be succeeding against Laurent Gbagbo, the strongman who refuses to concede office after losing an election last year. And yet beneath it, a different reality continues to assert itself.
Mr. Gbagbo is still in power, more than three months after the vote he lost. He is still coming up with rubber-band fixes for his battered economy, declaring last week that his government would take over the purchase and export of cocoa, the country's signature crop. He is still brutally snuffing out dissent. And he is still, night after night on state television, blaming the United Nations, France and the United States for his country's problems -- to potent effect among the populace. 
It's a school for autocrats under siege: cut back, cut down, lash out. No diplomat, political analyst or average citizen here can predict with confidence how long Mr. Gbagbo will last, even though his revenues are a fraction of what they were. Customs duties at the port are down more than 96 percent, according to some diplomats, and he faces almost total diplomatic isolation. But there is good reason for the reluctance in forecasting his fall.
''It will be a shadow of the economy it was, but it doesn't take a thriving economy to stay in power,'' said a diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''He can wreck the economy and stay in power. If he makes it through the month of March, I think he could be here 20 years.''
For Mr. Gbagbo to remain in the presidential palace, Ivory Coast, richer in agricultural resources than any West African neighbor, does not need to continue being responsible for 40 percent of the region's gross domestic product.
The Ivorian ruler is following a textbook survival course for autocrats, with ample precedent on the continent: President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is still in office years into the destruction of his country's economy, and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya is hanging tough in the face of a far more active armed opposition than is currently under way in Ivory Coast.
One of the last peaceful, sustained expressions of public dissent here -- women protesting with branches symbolizing peace -- has been mown down in volleys of machine-gun fire from Mr. Gbagbo's security forces. Human Rights Watchsaid Tuesday that such repression against civilians ''gives every indication of amounting to crimes against humanity.''
The topsy-turvy, up-is-down world portrayed nightly on the state broadcaster, RTI, may not be so far from the realities on the ground. Mr. Gbagbo is always introduced ceremoniously as ''His Excellency the President of the Republic, Laurent Gbagbo,'' which he effectively is, even though he has almost no recognition abroad. New ''laws,'' with elaborate numerical designations, in the French manner, are solemnly read out by his government, which most Ivorians voted against but which still retains control.
On the street, the civil servants who were massed around the government-owned banks, waiting to be paid -- foreign banks closed after the regional central bank cut Mr. Gbagbo off, instantly blocking about 93 percent of bank accounts, diplomats and bankers said -- were restive last week, but not rioting.
''They are going to pay everybody,'' said Yao Kouame, a teacher, waiting in the central Plateau district of Abidjan.
''We haven't stopped working,'' another state worker said. ''We are not going to die of hunger.''
Others were ready with a stream of invective against President Obama. America is held nearly as responsible as France in the Gbagbo discourse, and the previous night's anti-Western talking points on the state broadcaster come readily to the lips of government workers and Mr. Gbagbo's soldiers alike, a tribute to the effectiveness of the government's propaganda machine.
Even the United Nations peacekeeping force here, one of the few protections for civilians against Mr. Gbagbo's security services, albeit a limited one, is portrayed as supporting ''terrorists'' and, as in a recent broadcast, ''no longer hiding its determination to destabilize Ivory Coast.''
Diplomats here estimate that Mr. Gbagbo's government was able to pay 50 to 80 percent of the 144,000 civil servants in February, enough to keep some cash in circulation, in what has largely been a cash economy anyway. ''They found a way to put cash in some people's hands,'' the diplomat said. ''You haven't seen any protests about government workers' not getting paid.''
The bank shutdown has mostly hurt the tiny middle class, and the elite around Mr. Gbagbo. ''An attack on human rights,'' Mr. Gbagbo's foreign minister, Alcide Djedje, called it last week, adding angrily that it was ''one of the greatest scandals of the century.''
Few Ivorians had bank accounts before the crisis, perhaps no more than 7 percent, so while some commerce has shut down, fruit and vegetable stalls, meat vendors and small shops continue to do business in many parts of this commercial capital.
''The economic operators, they are adapting themselves quite well,'' a senior local banker said. ''We have become a cash economy.''
Ivory Coast is the world's leading producer of cocoa, and Mr. Gbagbo's move to take over purchasing and export of the beans allows him to enter a sector accounting for perhaps 20 percent of the country's gross domestic product, diplomats said. Next, in the view of some businessmen in the cocoa sector, could be a government seizure of the huge cocoa bean stock, worth as much as $1.5 billion, sitting in warehouses.
The government denied that it was contemplating this, but warned of ''sanctions'' against private businesses if the beans were not exported by a March 31 deadline. ''If he sells the cocoa, he'll have the cash,'' a businessman in the sector warned, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. ''Everything is possible.''
But European Union sanctions prohibit trade with entities tied to Mr. Gbagbo's government, including ports. The internationally recognized winner of last year's election, Alassane Ouattara, has also called for a halt in exports, which the major cocoa companies have largely respected. So groups of unemployed dock hands sit around glumly, waiting.
''Every day we come, and there's nothing,'' said one, Ouma Diarra. ''There are no boats coming in. We come in the morning and wait. Now, there's no work.''
Traffic is ever thinner on Abidjan's highways, though the motorcades of top officials still barrel down them at top speed, sirens blaring.
Some analysts say Mr. Gbagbo will not last past May. A rise in the price of fuel could stoke large-scale popular discontent, others maintain. Still others say that every day Mr. Gbagbo remains in power is a victory for him.
''He's losing ground, but he still has the upper hand,'' another diplomat said. ''I don't see the endgame here.''

PERSON: Victor Blanco 

HEADLINE: Victor Blanco, Stargazer, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Victor Blanco, a Puerto Rican astronomer who helped build a major outpost for American science, the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, and shepherded it through 14 years of revolution, counterrevolution and economic turmoil, died on March 8. He was 92 and lived in Vero Beach, Fla.
His death, near Vero Beach, was confirmed by his stepdaughter, Elizabeth Vitell. 
Astronomers said Dr. Blanco would be remembered for his scientific, political and managerial skills as the observatory's director in opening up the Southern sky as a new frontier of cosmic research.
When American astronomers worried that the election of a Marxist government under Salvador Allende in 1970 might threaten plans to build what would be the largest telescope in the Southern Hemisphere at the time -- 158 inches in diameter -- it was Dr. Blanco who was dispatched to explain to President Allende what the Americans were doing on his mountaintop.
And when President Allende was overthrown by a military junta and replaced by General Augusto Pinochet three years later amid death squads and disappearances, strikes and food shortages, Dr. Blanco was dispatched to General Pinochet, who decided that he wanted to visit the observatory and asked for a list of Chilean staff members and their political affiliations. Dr. Blanco demurred, saying that that would be an inappropriate intrusion into Chilean politics.
''General Pinochet visited Cerro Tololo anyway,'' Dr. Blanco wrote in a summary of his life in The Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 2001, ''and we kept those Chilean staff members we knew to have been pro-Allende away.''
Through all the tumult, the observatory stayed open. The Southern sky offers many of the most exciting sights in the universe, like the center of our own Milky Way galaxy and its attendant star clouds and clusters. But historically most astronomers lived in the North and had little access to those Southern wonders.
By the late 1950s and early '60s, astronomers had their eyes on the dark dry mountains of Chile. Cerro Tololo, founded in 1961 in northern Chile, was a collaboration of the National Science Foundation, a consortium of colleges called Associated Universities for Research in Astronomy and the University of Chile.
No small part of Dr. Blanco's job was to keep these disparate elements working together while getting roads and buildings built. ''Victor had a very delicate sense of diplomacy and customs,'' said Robert Kirshner, an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who said that Dr. Blanco and his wife Betty, also an astronomer, kept a list of all the marriages they had helped arrange.
Dr. Blanco's other major accomplishment was building the 158-inch (4-meter) telescope, a twin of one already built and installed at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, also run by the National Science Foundation. It was completed in 1975, with Dr. Blanco helping to align and test the telescope. South American astronomy took off.
The Cerro Tololo investment paid off in 1987 when a star erupted in a bright supernova explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud, practically right overhead. Astronomers flocked to Chile, obtaining a trove of data that is still being mined for clues to the violent death of at least one star.
A decade later, the observatory played a key role in the discovery that the expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating under the influence of a mysterious dark energy, a discovery that has shaken physics and astronomy.
Victor Manuel Blanco was born March 10, 1918, in Guayama, P.R., one of nine children of a policeman, Felipe Blanco, and a housewife, Adelfa Pagan de Blanco. As a boy in San Juan with astronomical dreams, he raised pigs that he named after asteroids and built a backyard telescope. He nevertheless entered a local college intending to study medicine, until an acquaintance of a University of Chicago graduate student reawakened his love of the stars.
He transferred to the University of Chicago, but before he could finish he was drafted into the Army in World War II and spent six years repairing and tuning radar detectors and studying atmospheric effects on radar waves. Granted college credit for his wartime work, he returned briefly to Chicago and then entered the University of California, Berkeley. He received a Ph.D. in 1949.
After six years at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Dr. Blanco joined the Naval Observatory as the director of a program to measure star positions. He left after two years, in 1967, to become the second director of Cerro Tololo.
Dr. Blanco stepped down in 1981 after 14 years, but remained at Cerro Tololo to continue research.
His marriage, to Cicely Woods during the war, ended in divorce. He is survived by a his son from that marriage, Daniel; his second wife, Betty; two stepchildren, David Mintz and Ms. Vitell, from his second marriage; and three grandchildren. Although the 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo is no longer the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, it is still at the forefront of research. Equipped with a special digital ''dark energy camera'' built at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, the telescope will embark this year on a survey of some 300 million galaxies in an effort to discern the effect of dark energy on the evolution of the universe.
In a mountaintop ceremony in 1995, the telescope was named the Victor M. Blanco telescope.

HEADLINE: Long Pause for Japanese Industry Raises Concerns About Supply Chain

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY; Reporting was contributed by Ken Belson in Tokyo, Martin Fackler in Ofunato, Japan, Liz Alderman in Paris, Mark Getzfred in New York, Nick Bunkley in Detroit, and Miguel Helft and Verne G. Kopytoff in San Francisco.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's vaunted ''just in time'' approach to business has become ''wait and see.''
Much of Japan's industry seemed to remain in a state of suspension Wednesday, as the devastation from an earthquake and tsunami, combined with fear and uncertainty over the nuclear calamity, made it difficult for corporate Japan to think about business as usual.
And that has left many overseas customers and trading partners in something of an information vacuum, unsure how soon the effects of any supply-chain disruptions would make themselves felt -- and how long they might last.
Even General Motors, a company that might seem to benefit from disruptions to Japan's auto industry, finds itself in a period of watchful waiting. For one thing, the new Chevrolet Volt plug-in-hybrid from G.M. -- whose sales could conceivably benefit from any production snags in Toyota's popular made-in-Japan Prius -- depends on a transmission from Japan. 
Mark L. Reuss, G.M.'s president for North American operations, said Wednesday that he did not yet know whether his company could count on an uninterrupted flow of that Volt component from Japan.
''We just don't know from a supply standpoint; there's so many great things that come out of Japan for the whole industry,'' he said, speaking to reporters after a speech at the University of Detroit Mercy.
Here in Tokyo, Japan's business capital, many companies -- whether Japanese or foreign -- were distracted Wednesday by plans for removing their employees from the potential path of radiation from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant 140 miles north. Telephone calls and e-mails to many corporate headquarters in Tokyo simply went unanswered.
Air Liquide, a French company that is the world's biggest producer of industrial gases, has closed its head office in Tokyo and moved its operations 250 miles south to Osaka.
The German auto giant BMW, which has 800 employees in Tokyo, is sending its few dozen German employees home and offering local workers safer locations within Japan.
Even the America unit of the Japanese auto company Nissan has ordered any employees traveling in Japan on business to return home.
Within Japan, Nissan has suspended many of its manufacturing operations at least through the weekend because ''it is still taking time to arrange delivery of parts from our suppliers,'' the company said in a statement. Nissan's engine plant in Iwaki, near the coast in the earthquake-stricken region, remained out of action, the company said.
Meanwhile, many American electronics companies remain uncertain -- or decline to say -- whether supplies of crucial components from Japan will hit air pockets. But Dallas-based Texas Instruments acknowledged that one of its Japanese factories would be at least partially out of action until July and would not resume shipping at full capacity until September.
The plant, in Miho, 40 miles north of Tokyo, suffered extensive damage from the quake. It primarily makes chips that convert analog and digital signals, which are used in a wide range of products, including cellphones, digital televisions, computer peripherals and medical equipment -- and accounts for about 10 percent of Texas Instruments global output, by revenue. Kimberly Morgan, a company spokeswoman, declined to name any of the plant's customers.
Technology analysts say the most persistent worry for digital device makers is the supply from Japan of so-called NAND flash -- the lightweight storage chips used in smartphones, tablet computers, digital cameras and a variety of other components. Toshiba, the world's second-largest maker of the chips behind Samsung of South Korea, has closed some production lines.
SanDisk, the third-largest maker of NAND flash, which owns two factories in Japan jointly with Toshiba, said those factories were operating. But the company, based in Milpitas, Calif., said it was concerned about the reliability of Japan's transportation and electricity networks.
''It will probably be many days or perhaps many weeks before we can assess the entire situation,'' said Mike Wong, a SanDisk spokesman.
The tsunami caused extensive damage to seaports along the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. And while only one -- Sendai-Shiogama -- ranks among the country's largest ports, all play a role in receiving goods from abroad and serving as feeders to the nation's major seaports farther south.
''The situation is quite bad'' for the northeastern ports, said Yoshiaki Higuchi, director of planning for the Japan Port and Harbor Association, ''but at the moment we aren't even certain about the extent of the damage.''
A reporter who visited two other small port towns, Minamisanriku and Ofunato, found that the docks and port facilities were almost completely destroyed. In Ofunato, many of the materials that had been stacked on the docks, like lumber, were carried by the waves into the town, where they crashed into homes and added to the destruction, residents said.
Sendai-Shiogama has particular importance for some companies, including the electronics makers Sony, Canon and Pioneer and the brewer Kirin. It ranks about 13th among Japanese ports in container shipments, Mr. Higuchi said. Together, the 10 most affected ports make up about 10 percent of Japan's container trade, he said.
Mr. Higuchi said it would probably be six months to a year before the Sendai port was again functioning fully, because a gantry crane that handles containers had fallen and the sea wall appeared to have been damaged.
Mario Moreno, an economist who analyzes seaborne trade data for Piers Global Intelligence Solutions, said it was too early to tell how the crisis in Japan would effect trade with the United States long term. Short term, however, ''trade is going to weaken in the months ahead,'' he said.
Air freight companies, too, have experienced disruptions because of damage to airports in the northeast and the cascading effect on traffic to and from other airports farther south. The American giant FedEx, for example, shut service to much of eastern Japan, including Tokyo, after the quake.
FedEx said Tuesday that it hoped soon to resume its pickup and delivery in eastern Japan, excluding Fukushima, Miyagi and parts of Ibaraki prefectures, but it warned that delays could continue.
Various companies trying to ship their products into Japan are also facing problems.
All last weekend, Brian Terasawa, the regional director of Asia-Pacific operations for Commodity Forwarders, a freight-forwarding company based in Los Angeles that specializes in perishable products, and his colleagues worked on the telephone with air carriers to get their customers' shipments through to Japan.
Air transport has resumed, but only at a fraction of the normal pace. Before, his company was shipping 80 tons a day to Japan, including radicchio, Mexican asparagus, tomatoes and chilled or frozen pork. On Wednesday, only about 10 to 20 tons went through.
The problem, Mr. Terasawa said, is the embargo airlines are putting on goods flown to Japan, particularly Narita International Airport near Tokyo. Mainly, only mail and relief supplies are making it through, with a little room left over.
''Domestically, they don't have food and vegetables in Japan -- they don't have enough and they are afraid about keeping the shelves stocked,'' he said.
''We've been trying to explain to the airlines that the perishables that we are trying to send through them are relief items. But that's not clicking with them.''

HEADLINE: For Queries on Coverage, Radiation and Meltdowns, Some Answers

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
5:17 p.m. Updated New York Times reporters answered questions from readers about the continuing nuclear crisis in Japan. Readers asked about media coverage of the crisis, health risks from radiation exposure, problems with the reactors and nuclear waste, the workers at the plant, comparisons to Chernobyl and the danger of building nuclear power plants in earthquake-prone regions.
About the Reporters
Keith Bradsher is covering the crisis from Hong Kong, where he is the bureau chief. 
Henry Fountain is a science reporter covering the science and engineering of nuclear reactors.
Denise Grady, a health reporter, is covering the impact of the crisis on public health.
David E. Sanger is chief Washington correspondent and a former Tokyo bureau chief.
Matthew L. Wald reports on national energy developments from Washington and is a regular contributor to the Green blog.
Media Hysteria?Q.Why is the media giving such hysteric coverage to an issue which at its absolute worst might cause some people to relocate away from the immediate vicinity of the power station and leave an expensive cleanup mess... all while there are tens of thousands dead and dying from the effects of the tsunami and a vast swath of devastation to infrastructure which poses a far more immediate and ongoing hazard to both individuals and the greater economy?
- ddblack1, Austin, Tex.
A.From the moment that the earthquake and tsunami hit, The Times recognized this would be a multidimensional crisis, and we began deploying our reporters to cover all aspects of it. There is the heartbreaking human story, as the bodies of thousands are uncovered, as parents go searching for their children, as the residents of the northeast coast - an area many of us who covered Japan have often visited - try to rebuild their lives. Those stories have been told with great compassion through in articles by Martin Fackler, our Tokyo bureau chief, as well as Michael Wines and other reporters who made their way into the devastation zone. And then, of course, there are the broader issues - for Japan as it struggles its way out of two decades of economic stagnation, and for the world economic markets.
But we also quickly realized that the nuclear crisis unfolding at the Fukushima plant was unlike any we have seen in history: multiple failures, fires and radiation leaks from at least four separate reactors. While damage from the earthquake and tsunami was instantly visible, the nuclear impact, we suspected, would take days to unfold, and could affect far larger swaths of Japan and neighboring countries. Unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening. The challenge for us now is to cover both stories vigorously, with the depth, compassion, expertise and investigative zeal that Times readers expect.
- David E. Sanger
Health RisksQ.I live in Oakland and can't seem to get clear information about when and if radioactive materials will arrive here from the jet stream. And if so, what dosage or for how many days we should take potassium iodide to protect our thyroids?
- EastBay, Oakland, Calif.A.This is frustrating for all, because the answer depends in part on the prevailing winds, which can change. However, experts I've interviewed strongly doubt that there will be any significant risk on the West Coast, and say there is no reason to take the potassium iodide unless high levels of radioactive iodine develop. But again, scientists consider high levels unlikely in the United States. In addition, about 98 percent of a person's dose comes from drinking contaminated milk, and if fallout were to reach here (again, unlikely) most people could protect themselves by not drinking milk or eating dairy products. Children are much more vulnerable than adults.
- Denise GradyQ.Is there a danger in interacting with people who have been exposed to radiation from this disaster? Particularly for young children? Would radiation be left behind in an apartment if someone from Tokyo were to come right now to stay as a guest?
- Concerned, New York CityA.The only risk I'm aware of would be if someone contaminated at the site came into your home wearing clothing full of radioactive fallout. Otherwise, you are O.K. If you are worried that someone who ingested radioactive material could be harmful, that seems unlikely.
- Denise GradyQ.Like many expats here in Japan I get my news from both Japanese and overseas services. But genuine nuclear experts are so inconsistent in their reactions to this crisis, and so much panic is spreading in Tokyo and throughout Japan in relation to this. With us in mind and the practicalities of our daily living, could you please give some realistic feedback as to how/whether this crisis is going to irradiate us 260 kilometers away in Tokyo, poison our food supply and create long-term serious health risks beyond that 30-kilometer radius around the plant? People here really want solid information about how radioactivity works in layman's terms, and what we need is solid information that is not laden with fear-mongering doomsday scenarios but real, practical advice.
- Greg, TokyoA.In an article in Wednesday's paper, Denise Grady reported that the Japanese government has ''taken precautions that should prevent the accident from becoming another Chernobyl, even if additional radiation is released.''The Japanese government has evacuated people closest to the plant, told others to stay indoors and distributed the drug potassium iodide to protect the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine.
The great tragedy of Chernobyl was an epidemic of thyroid cancer among people exposed to the radiation as children - more than 6,000 cases so far, with more expected for many years to come. There is no reason for it to be repeated in Japan.
The epidemic in Chernobyl was preventable and would probably not have happened if people had been told to stop drinking locally produced milk, which was by far the most important source of radiation. Cows ate grass contaminated by fallout from the reactors and secreted radioactive iodine in their milk.Read the full article, ''Precautions Should Limit Health Problems From Nuclear Plant's Radiation.''
- The EditorsQ.Folks in the vicinity of the power plant have been asked to stay indoors to protect themselves from the radiation. Is that really sufficient? How does this kind of radiation differ from an X-ray?
- Callie, East Lansing, Mich.A.People near the plant have been evacuated. The ones being warned to stay inside are actually miles and miles away. Given that there is some dispersion of the cloud, levels at a distance should diminish, so the risk diminishes, too, and staying inside, though imperfect, seems like a reasonable precaution. The Environmental Protection Agency Web site offers good information about different types of radiation and the effects of various doses.
- Denise Grady
Crisis at the ReactorsQ.How is water currently being pumped into the reactors? Are fire hoses the sole method being used? Reports have indicated that backup diesel generators were brought to the site but were not able to be used to drive the pumps. There have also been reports of pump failures. Have detailed descriptions of the status of each reactor (including cooling methods and equipment failures) been made public? Given the contamination of site, it would seem that finding a way to supply coolant with minimal human presence is essential.
- Rob, AtlantaA.The Japanese authorities have provided few details of how they are pumping sea water into the three stricken reactors. Nuclear engineers and executives with experience at other reactors say that the Japanese are most likely using several pumper engine firetrucks in a row, with each increasing the pressure of the water and pushing it through a hose to the next truck. This technique is sometimes used in high-rise firefighting and bomb disposal, when the goal is to maximize the flow and pressure of the water actually reaching the target. At the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, maximum pressure is needed to force water into overheated reactors in which a significant proportion of the water has turned into very hot steam at very high pressure.
The pumping process has been fraught with problems - at least one engine ran out of fuel at Reactor No. 2 on Monday night for several hours, interrupting the pumping of sea water during this time, because no tanker truck was immediately available to refuel it. Temperature and pressure climbed in the reactor as a result, and may have contributed to damage to the fuel rods and to an explosion at the base of the primary containment building.
Japanese officials have looked for alternatives. One idea under consideration has been to use helicopters to drop water. But helicopter crews who participated in the response to the Chernobyl accident received heavy doses of radiation from the smoke. The United States Navy has already reported that several helicopter crews involved in post-tsunami rescue work over the past several days have shown low-level exposure to radiation; decontamination under these circumstances mainly involves a lot of soap and water to remove radioactive particles.
- Keith BradsherQ.Where is the sea water that is being pumped in to cool the reactors going, and is this water contaminated?
- T. Lowen, MinneapolisA.To the best of our understanding, the sea water is turning to steam. The reactor is still so hot that the sea water they are pumping in is just intended to replace the amount that boils off. In other words, in the best of situations, they are just managing to keep the reactor covered with water.
In the reactors that have had fuel rod exposure (at least three of them, apparently), the steam would be contaminated with radioactive elements from the fuel, which has been exposed because of cracking of the zirconium cladding around it. The contaminated steam leaves the reactor vessel and enters the containment structure. To avoid a pressure buildup, the containment structure must be vented intermittently, resulting in the release of radioactivity to the environment. (In at least one of the reactors, the containment structure is reported to be damaged; if that's the case then the radiation release could be continuous.)
- Henry FountainQ.I keep seeing the phrase ''shut down'' in reference to the nuclear reactors at Fukushima, but clearly they are not shut down as they are still generating tremendous energy in the form of heat. How is a nuclear reactor ''turned off''?
They can't keep using firetrucks to pump seawater through the reactor cores indefinitely. Since it is apparently not possible to turn off the reactors, what is the long term plan for preventing a meltdown?
- A.J., San FranciscoA.The reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant are shut down, meaning that the nuclear chain reaction (which generated heat to turn water to steam for the turbines that make electricity) has been halted. That happened automatically when the earthquake struck - in such an emergency, the reactors are designed to insert special rods into the core that absorb neutrons and stop the chain reaction.
The reactors were very hot, though (they operate at about 550 degrees Fahrenheit) and it takes a while to remove that heat. In addition - and this is the real problem - even though the chain reaction is stopped, heat is still generated in the fuel by the natural decay of the radioactive elements present. This heat is why they need to keep pumping water into the reactor core - it stays so hot that the water can boil off, exposing the fuel rods. And if the fuel rods are exposed, even for a short time (as happened at at least two of the reactors), they become damaged and radioactivity is released.
Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the reactors, has not discussed its long-term plans, but it's probably safe to say that their goal is to restore regular electric service to the plant so that normal pumping operations can resume (although at this point, given the explosions, pump and plumbing repairs will likely have to be made, too).
- Henry Fountain
Related: Interactive Feature: How a Reactor Shuts Down and What Happens in a MeltdownQ.In the case of a full core meltdown, would the entry/exit ports in the primary containment vessel used for adding cooling water and for venting steam be the first location of release of radioactive materials? Or would a full core meltdown be an explosive event that would destroy the entire containment vessel?
- Dan Baker, San DiegoA.Experts differ on the impact of a full meltdown of the nuclear fuel at any of the reactors. Some say that the molten fuel would be unlikely to burn through the walls of the reactor vessel, which are thick steel. (At the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, molten fuel burned only partly through the steel.) Others say that a burn-through would happen, with the molten fuel then falling to the floor of the containment structure. What would happen next is a subject of debate as well. Some experts think the fuel would not progress very far before it started to cool. Others say that it could reach the walls of the containment structure, which are made of thick concrete with a thin steel liner, and damage it, perhaps through cracking. Some experts are worried that steam explosions might completely destroy the containment structure. (A steam explosion is really an oxygen-hydrogen explosion - the fuel is so hot that if it hits water, it splits the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, a highly combustible mix.)
Even if molten fuel remains in the reactor vessel, radiation will escape through vents into the containment structure. And even without further damage, the containment structures in at least two of the reactor buildings appear to have been damaged, allowing uncontrolled release of radioactivity.
- Henry FountainQ.The Onagawa nuclear plant is much closer to the earthquake and tsunami zone than the Fukushima plant but appears to have shut down safely while Fukushima has not. Can you explain the differences in what happened and is happening at the two nuclear locations?
- R.J.W., Dunkirk, N.Y.A.We're still trying to figure it out completely, but the answer appears to lie in the backup cooling systems. At Fukushima, the plants appeared to survive the earthquake without major damage, but the backup cooling was wiped out by the tsunami. The question of why one plant survived so well and another did not will be the focus of many of our questions as we try to reconstruct events.
- David E. SangerQ.If the reactors are still so hot, why can't they turn the turbines back on to generate electricity just for the plant and get the cooling pumps running?
- L. Littlefield, BrooklynA.The reactors are damaged to the point where there would be no way to control them enough to restore the steam supply to the turbines. And even if the operators could somehow get one of the turbines spinning, the electricity has to flow through transformers, switches and other equipment, some of which has no doubt been damaged or destroyed. It's not as simple as just hooking up a few wires from a generator to a pump.
- Henry Fountain
Workers at the PlantQ.How were the 50 people remaining at the plant chosen? Did they volunteer? What are their genders? Is a medical team included? How are they being supplied with food and other necessities?
- Alan, HawaiiA.In an article in Wednesday's paper, Keith Bradsher and Hiroko Tabuchi reported on the technicians who stayed behind at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and were ''perhaps Japan's last chance of preventing a broader nuclear catastrophe.''They crawl through labyrinths of equipment in utter darkness pierced only by their flashlights, listening for periodic explosions as hydrogen gas escaping from crippled reactors ignites on contact with air.
They breathe through uncomfortable respirators or carry heavy oxygen tanks on their backs. They wear white, full-body jumpsuits with snug-fitting hoods that provide scant protection from the invisible radiation sleeting through their bodies.
They are the faceless 50, the unnamed operators who stayed behind. They have volunteered, or been assigned, to pump seawater on dangerously exposed nuclear fuel, already thought to be partly melting and spewing radioactive material, to prevent full meltdowns that could throw thousands of tons of radioactive dust high into the air and imperil millions of their compatriots.For more details, read the full article, ''Last Defense at Troubled Reactors: 50 Japanese Workers.''
- The EditorsQ.Has human error contributed to the severity of the situation? I've seen reports of a critical generator running out of fuel, a valve that was improperly left closed, and I suspect that preventive actions could have avoided the hydrogen buildup that led to at least two explosions.
- Greg Ebert, Hillsboro, OregonA.When a fire pump ran out of fuel and shut down outside Reactor No. 2 on Monday night, that was human error. But it is not clear that the rest of the difficulties are related to human error.
I have not seen confirmation that a valve was improperly left closed, and the valves have been under a lot of strain on these overheated reactors. Similarly, some Western nuclear engineers have wondered if the Japanese waited too long to begin pumping in seawater and boric acid, which temporarily cool the reactors and slow the formation of hydrogen gas. But the Japanese technicians faced a tough dilemma in figuring out how much boric acid to use and how to move the seawater after the tsunami disrupted so many of their backup systems.
- Keith Bradsher
Chernobyl and Three Mile IslandQ.The apparent solution to containing the ''mess'' in Chernobyl was to build a giant concrete sarcophagus around the reactor. Hindsight has shown that to be an error. When all is said and done here, what is the best way to deal with the toxic remnants of the reactors and nuclear waste?
- Marklemagne, OhioA.The international consensus is that eventually, reactor wastes will have to be buried. The United States plans to do that with all spent reactor fuel, and that includes the rubble from the core at Three Mile Island, which suffered a partial melt-down in 1979. It is sitting in containers at the Idaho National Laboratory, near Idaho Falls.
In the shorter term, the cores from Fukushima are also likely to go into containers, steel cylinders filled with inert gas and then sealed and placed into concrete silos. Such ''dry cask storage'' can keep reactor wastes isolated for decades, with minimal requirements for inspection, and no moving parts.
The Japanese ''recycle'' some of their fuel, chopping it up, dissolving it in acid, and then using a chemical separation process to leach out the plutonium that was created by the reactor's operation. The plutonium is then formed into new fuel. The remaining materials can be embedded in glass. That could also happen to the reactor core rubble from Fukushima. But those wastes, too, will probably eventually be buried.- Matthew L. Wald
(Correction: An earlier version of this answer misstated the location of the Idaho National Laboratory. It is near Idaho Falls, Idaho -- not Idaho Springs, which is in Colorado.)Q.In the event that the damaged reactors in Japan cool sufficiently to ''entomb'' their contents, then what? We know they will not be used again, but how can they be managed; and how long can they sustain an entombing integrity, especially considering that there may be multiple structural breaches within various components of each of these reactors? What should we expect from them in the event of future natural disasters in the same area?
- Leha, Santa Rosa, Calif.A.At Three Mile Island, the fuel was cleaned out and shipped off site (see answer above) and the reactor vessel, empty, was left to sit until a companion plant was ready for retirement. At that point, probably both will be torn down just as other old reactors have been ''decommissioned.'' The Fukushima accident is not over, but unless it gets a lot worse, defueling is more likely than entombment, because eventually, someone is likely to want to reuse the site.
- Matthew L. WaldQ.The Chernobyl plant used a graphite moderator that burned and distributed radioactive fallout over a wide area. The Japanese plant doesn't use graphite. What, if anything, is the mechanism by which radioactive materials could be distributed over a wide area?
- Matthew, Salem, Mass.A.There are two potential mechanisms. One is that the only form of cooling now available is to pump in cold water and wait for it to boil off, and then release the steam. The steam propels wastes into the atmosphere. The other is that the spent fuel pools are heating up. If they boil dry, there is a theory that the fuel could get hot enough so that its metal cladding, made of an alloy of zirconium, could catch fire. (The clad in the fuel in the reactors has already produced hydrogen, causing explosions.) A fire would produce enough energy to lift radioactive contaminants into the air.
At Chernobyl, the graphite burned and provided enough energy to lift the radioactive material into the jet stream at high altitude. It is not clear whether a significant portion of the wastes from Fukushima could rise that high. With a little luck, much of the material could stay in the lower atmosphere and be washed out by rainstorms over the Pacific.
- Matthew L. Wald
Nuclear PolicyQ.I read that Japan has 55 nuclear reactors on an island country about the size of California. How did the Japanese government justify this when the region is a hotbed for earthquakes? Were these plants pitched as being earthquake safe? How is it that with the threat of tsunamis that nuclear plants were built right on the beach?
- K.T., MinneapolisA.Reactors are attractive to Japan because the country has barely any fossil fuels, neither coal nor natural gas, which together make up 70 percent of American power generation, or any significant oil supply.
Almost all of Japan's civil infrastructure is built with earthquakes and tsunamis in mind. That includes big buildings, bridges and power stations. The country is ringed with tsunami barriers. But this earthquake was the largest in recorded history, and the tsunami was higher than the planners assumed. And along with killing thousands of people, it swamped the reactors.
- Matthew L. WaldQ.I understand that the Japanese government stated that all prefectures in Japan should start reporting twice a day on any signs of elevated radiation levels and that these reports should be made public. Will The New York Times be providing (translated) access to this information? Have you inquired of the U.S. government, e.g. NARAC, as to the size, direction and radiation intensity of the radioactive plume arising from the Fukushima plant? At what point should radiation monitoring reports in the U.S., particularly in counties on the Pacific Coast, be made publicly available? Have you looked into this?
- Lyndon Comstock, Bolinas, Calif.A.So far the reporting on radiation levels available from Japanese authorities has been spotty, at best. We have been pursuing more comprehensive data, not only from the Japanese government, but from the United States Navy, whose ships have been offshore from the nuclear site, and more than 40 American experts from the Department of Energy who have now landed in Japan. They brought some sophisticated measuring gear with them, and we expect to soon see new measurements. My colleague Bill Broad wrote about the plume in Monday's paper. N.O.A.A., the Air Force and others are also tracking the plume, and we will be reporting more of that information once we have vetted it.
- David E. SangerQ.It seems that too much is at stake to allow private companies to operate nuclear reactors. They can't even insure themselves, so of course they will keep operating even if they shouldn't. If we are to rely on nuclear power, why not have a federal agency analogous to NASA run them?
- R.J.M. Hudson, Champaign, Ill.A.You raise an interesting policy question that came up, in different form, during last year's oil spill as well. Nuclear power plants are subject to federal regulation, of course; the question you are raising is whether safety would be better if they were state-owned. The answer to that question is far from clear. And of course, NASA no longer has a monopoly on space flight: One key element of the Obama administration's space strategy is to encourage more private firms to enter the fray.

HEADLINE: Smithsonian Uses Social Media to Expand Its Mission

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
THE Smithsonian Institution is shaking off its image as ''the nation's attic'' brimming with arcane treasures and using Web and mobile projects to enlist the public in delving into its collections, expanding its research and, sometimes, just adding interesting postscripts to history.
Best known for its stately museums on the National Mall, the 164-year-old Smithsonian also conducts wide-ranging scientific research, part of its original mission to increase and spread knowledge. But instead of relying on its small cadre of experts, the institution is embracing social media to involve the public.
''We are more than museums,'' said Michael Edson, the Smithsonian's director of Web and new-media strategy. No more than 1 percent of the huge complex's 137 million items are on public display at any time.
''We're operating telescopes in space, preserving ancient languages, studying biodiversity, evolution and history -- a vast distributed network of scholars and researchers active in over 100 countries,'' he said. 
In addition to bolstering scholarship, social media also is helping the Smithsonian solve puzzles like identifying an early 20th-century woman whose illustrations humorously conveyed economic data to the public, or the purpose of the ''perforating paddle'' used by early postal workers.
Also, the Smithsonian has been able to uncover new information about historic events like the trial of John T. Scopes for teaching evolution, and assemble a worldwide network to capture wild animal behavior and another to map American tree species.
''What we are doing is more lively and accessible than developing an exhibit and providing a catalog,'' said Mr. Edson.
Crowd-sourcing and user-generated content are not new to the Smithsonian, said Pamela Henson, the institution's historian, pointing to the creation in the 1850s of what later became the National Weather Service. The Smithsonian's first secretary, Joseph Henry, enlisted volunteers around the country to gather observations about storms and other weather occurrences and to mail or telegraph them to Washington.
''The volunteers helped us establish weather patterns,'' she said, ''Also, a source of our earliest collections were trappers, explorers and others who collected plants and animals and gave them to the Smithsonian.''
Even so, the 21st-century Smithsonian was somewhat slower to embrace unfettered public involvement, fearing it would undercut the institution's scientific credibility. After debate, the Smithsonian began moving ahead in the social media realm in early 2009, encouraged by its new secretary, G. Wayne Clough, who had served as president of the Georgia Institute of Technology.
''We're now broadcasters of knowledge,'' Mr. Edson said of the Smithsonian's efforts. ''It's invigorating, and a real collaboration.''
The use of social media led to identification of a photograph that had been on the Smithsonian ''Portraits of Scientists'' since 2003. The Smithsonian added the image to its photo-sharing Web site,. Flickr users began contributing clues, like a wedding announcement, to pinpoint the woman in the picture as 21-year-old Ida Elizabeth Sabin Goodwin, an artist hired in the 1920s at a science news service.
Her granddaughter, Linda Sabin Eisenstadt, recognized the Flickr photo and contributed details of her grandmother's life and some of her drawings -- noting that she had found two unknown cousins as a result.
Ms. Goodwin's ''cartoonographs'' amusingly depicted rising commodity prices, political campaign spending, spending on oil and the impact of new communications technologies, all still timely topics, said Effie Kapsalis, head of Web and new media for the Smithsonian Archives.
Previously unpublished photos of the Scopes trial in Tennessee posted on Flickr resulted in a donation of 10 black-and-white photographs from Henrietta S. Jenrette, who said they had been taken by her father, who attended the trial with his former high school biology teacher. She wanted them to be online for anyone to see.
With more than six million objects, and only four curators, the National Postal Museum created an online database called Arago for those who want to study particular objects, said Marshall Emery, the museum's internal affairs manager. While the postal museum is small compared with other Smithsonian museums, its Web site, named after Francois Arago, a French scientist and friend of the Smithsonian's founder, James Smithson, drew 26.4 million page views from 158 countries in fiscal 2010.
Philatelic experts around the world can research -- and sometimes pinpoint inaccuracies in -- the museum's collection, which includes every United States postage stamp, Amelia Earhart's flight suit and unusual objects like an 1899 perforating paddle that was used to stab holes in mail envelopes so it could be fumigated inside railway mail cars. The purpose was to prevent letters from carrying yellow fever, then thought to be spread by such contact.
A recently introduced Smithsonian digital endeavor to discover what environmental factors most influence the size of wildlife populations relies on a broad network of volunteers, rather than specialists. In late February, its Museum of the Natural History introduced ''Smithsonian Wild,'', with links on Facebook, Flickr and Twitter. It can ''can only be accomplished using citizen scientists -- not unlike the annual bird counts -- only this is for mammals, which are mostly nocturnal,'' said Robert Costello, the museum's outreach program manager.
The site brings together 202,000 wildlife photos from various Smithsonian and other research projects where motion-sensitive cameras were installed to capture close-range images of elusive species like the jaguar.
This gives the public ''a better sense not only of the diversity of wildlife, but also of the diversity of the Smithsonian's wildlife research,'' said Mr. Costello.
On the heels of that project, the Smithsonian began broadening its mobile offerings with a free new app, called Leafsnap, to identify tree species by their leaves. Smartphone apps typically help users to navigate their visit -- the Smithsonian has them for its popular National Air and Space Museum as well as the Postal and Natural History -- and to complement specific exhibitions.
Leafsnap is the first of a series of electronic field guides that researchers from the Smithsonian, Columbia University and the University of Maryland have developed to help identify species from photographs. The Web site field guide currently includes the trees of New York City and Washington and will expand to include trees across the continental United States.
The app can also be used to map tree diversity and location by sending global positioning data back to scientists. Other apps to raise awareness of biodiversity will be introduced in the future.
''A few years ago, it was unusual for a museum to have social media,'' said Mr. Edson. ''Now it's just assumed to be part of what museums offer -- like the heat.''

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Proposes Limits On Coal Power Plants

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODERand JOHN COLLINS RUDOLF; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and John Collins Rudolf from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed the first national standard for emissions of mercury and other pollutants from coal-burning power plants, a rule that could lead to the early closing of a number of older plants and one that is certain to be challenged by the some utilities and Republicans in Congress.
Lisa P. Jackson, the agency's administrator, said control of dozens of poisonous substances emitted by power plants was long overdue and would prevent thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of cases of disease a year. 
Ms. Jackson pointedly included the head of the American Lung Association and two prominent doctors in her announcement to make the point that the regulations were designed to protect public health and not to penalize the utility industry.
She estimated the total annual cost of compliance at about $10 billion, in line with some industry estimates (although some are much higher), and the health and environmental benefits at more than $100 billion a year. She said that households could expect to see their electric bills rise by $3 to $4 a month when the regulation was fully in force after 2015.
Ms. Jackson was acting under a court-ordered deadline to produce a draft rule by Wednesday.
''Today's announcement is 20 years in the making and is a significant milestone in the Clean Air Act's already unprecedented record of ensuring our children are protected from the damaging effects of toxic air pollution,'' she said.
Ms. Jackson said that mercury and the other emissions covered by the rule damaged the nervous systems of fetuses and children, aggravated asthma and caused lifelong health damage for hundreds of thousands of Americans.
She said that installing and maintaining smokestack scrubbers and other control technology would create 31,000 short-term construction jobs and 9,000 permanent utility sector jobs.
Even before the formal unveiling of the rule, some utilities, business groups and Congressional Republicans cast it as the latest salvo in a regulatory war on American industry. They cited a number of recently issued E.P.A. rules, including one on industrial boilers and the first of a series of regulations covering greenhouse gases, which they argue will impose huge costs on businesses and choke off economic recovery.
''E.P.A. admits the pending proposal will cost at least $10 billion, making it one of the most expensive rules in the history of the agency,'' a group of utilities, the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said in a report this week. ''Adaptation to all the proposed rules constitutes an extraordinary threat to the power sector -- particularly the half of U.S. electricity derived from coal-fired generation.''
The group questioned Ms. Jackson's assertion that the technology needed to reduce emissions of mercury, lead, arsenic, chromium and other airborne pollutants was readily available and reasonably inexpensive. The need to retrofit scores of plants in the same short period of time will tax resources and lead to delays, it said.
A spokesman for the utility industry's largest trade group, the Edison Electric Institute, said it would be easier for some utilities to comply than others, particularly those that rely more heavily on nuclear power and those that have switched to natural gas for part of their generating capacity.
One utility executive said compliance would not be unduly burdensome.
''We know from experience that constructing this technology can be done in a reasonable time frame, especially with good advance planning,'' said Paul Allen, senior vice president and chief environmental officer of Constellation Energy. ''And there is meaningful job creation associated with the projects.''
Public health advocates said utilities had delayed the rules for more than two decades with court challenges and lobbying campaigns.
''If you think it's expensive to put a scrubber on a smokestack, you should see how much it costs to treat a child over a lifetime with a birth defect,'' said Dr. O. Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who stood with Ms. Jackson in announcing the rule.
Roughly half of the nation's more than 400 coal-burning plants have some form of control technology installed, and about a third of states have set their own standards for mercury emissions. But the proposed rule issued Wednesday is the first national standard and will require all plants to come up to the standard of the cleanest of current plants.
The new rules bring to a close a bitter legal and regulatory battle dating back to the passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act, which first directed the E.P.A. to identify and control major industrial sources of hazardous emissions.
By 1990, however, federal regulators had still not set standards for toxic emissions from power plants, and Congress, in the face of stiff resistance from utilities and coal interests, passed legislation directing the E.P.A. to study the health effects of mercury and other emissions, and to detail the cost and effectiveness of control technologies.
In 1998, the agency finally complied, delivering a comprehensive report to Congress detailing the health impact of numerous pollutants, including mercury, which by then had been linked conclusively in multiple studies to serious cognitive harm to fetuses.
In December 2000, in the last days of the Clinton administration, the E.P.A. finally listed power plants as a source of hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
The Bush administration E.P.A. faced its own deadlines to devise and put into effect controls for power plant pollution. But rather than issue emissions standards in line with federal law, in 2005, top agency officials instituted a controversial cap-and-trade program for mercury, despite a warning from agency lawyers that the move would throw the issue back into the courts and almost certainly be reversed.
As predicted, a coalition of states and environmentalists sued the agency, arguing that the cap-and-trade program would not limit other toxic emissions like arsenic and would allow the dirtiest power plants to pay for the right to pollute, putting nearby communities at risk. In 2008 a federal judge ruled against the E.P.A., giving the agency three years to develop standards for mercury and other pollutants.
The long delay has meant that emissions of some major pollutants have grown in recent years. The E.P.A.'s most recent data shows that from 1999 to 2005, mercury emissions from power plants increased more than 8 percent, to 53 tons from 49 tons. Arsenic emissions grew even more, rising 31 percent, to 210 tons from 160 tons.
The E.P.A. will take public comment on the proposed regulations for the next several months. It anticipates publishing a final rule at the end of this year or early next year. The rule would take effect fully three or four years later.

HEADLINE: At Met, New Leadership (and Direction) for Asian Art

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Asian art galleries are some of the most reposeful spaces in New York City. It's hard to imagine that they were banged into place, room by room, from practically nothing over the last 40 years, though they were. Or that they continue to mirror changing times, a changing museum and a changing Asia, though they do.
A few months from now they'll be the scene of another change, a shift in stewardship, when the museum's longtime curator of Chinese art, Maxwell K. Hearn, replaces James C. Y. Watt as head of the Asian art department.
Mr. Watt, 74, who was raised in Hong Kong and had a classical Chinese scholar's at-home education, came to the Met as a curator from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1985 and has led the department for the last 10 years. 
Mr. Hearn -- everyone calls him Mike -- is 61 and a native of Salt Lake City. He arrived at the Met fresh out of college in 1971, when there barely was an Asian department and the Asian collection consisted of a room of Buddhist sculptures and a bunch of ceramic pots.
Both men, but Mr. Hearn in particular, witnessed and participated in an astonishing phenomenon: a catch-up act of acquisition, construction and exhibition-making on a grand scale.
From the early 1970s to the late '90s, under the direction of the art historian Wen Fong, who was Mr. Hearn's mentor, a room of sculpture gradually and laboriously turned into 50 galleries. Thanks to the beneficence of a generation of gift-giving New York collectors, a bunch of pots became many thousands of objects representing every major Asian culture. And thanks to the prestige its new Asian wing brought, the Met got some huge Asian loan shows.
Both Mr. Hearn and Mr. Watt refer to the period as a golden age. And both acknowledge that it is over.
Private collections of the kind that came to the Met can no longer be assembled in the West. China and India, now economic colossi, have a corner on the market. Museum loans from Asia are increasingly tricky to negotiate, and to pay for, now that the Met, like most museums, is economically pinched. And while Asia is constantly in the news, Asian art remains a hard sell. Foot traffic in the Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Southeast Asian galleries remains light.
Clearly, Mr. Hearn, in his new job as curator in charge of the Asian department, has confounding issues to contemplate when he takes over in July.
But at least he will hit the ground running. He knows his department inside out. The Met is home; he grew up in it. And he came to it through a kind of on-the-road Kerouacian saga of timing and luck that brought him into early contact with some of the top art historians of the day, and that left him both open to newness and optimistic of the future.
His introduction to Asian art was entirely accidental. He entered Yale in 1967, intending to study business. On a semester break he visited an aunt in Kansas City, Mo., and went with her to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. They wandered around and ended up in the Chinese collection. Something clicked.
''I don't remember an individual piece I saw,'' he said in a recent interview. ''But I came out thinking, 'I know nothing about this world.' ''And he wanted to know more.
Back at Yale he took courses in Chinese art with the scholar Richard Barnhart. In his junior year he switched his major to art history and wrote an honors paper on Chinese scholar gardens. Driving back to Utah after graduation he stopped at the Nelson-Atkins, which had become a place of pilgrimage in his mind. He arrived on a Monday; the museum was closed. He figured he'd sleep overnight in his car, but on a whim walked around to the back of the museum and knocked on a door.
''What's your business?'' a voice from inside asked. He said he was a student and wanted to look at Chinese art. The door opened. Not only was he admitted, but he was also escorted to the office of the museum's director, Laurence Sickman, a Chinese art historian who had written the textbook Mr. Hearn had used at Yale. Mr. Sickman took him on a tour of the Asian galleries and storage, invited him back to his house to see his scholar's garden, and advised him to go to Taiwan and learn Chinese.
Around this time, on the advice of his Yale teacher, Mr. Hearn wrote to Mr. Fong, who was at Princeton, asking for career advice on museum work. When an invitation to meet came, he drove back East from Indiana, where he had a summer job on a farm. Mr. Fong, dressed in tennis whites, talked with him for half an hour, then asked, ''How would you like to work at the Metropolitan Museum?'' He had just been hired by the Met with the title of special consultant, and a mandate to revivify a tiny Asian art department that had been languishing for decades.
Mr. Hearn drove the long drive back to Salt Lake City, packed his things, and headed to New York. He had no place to live yet, so Mr. Fong arranged for him to crash for a night or two with a friend in the West Village. Mr. Fong's friend was John B. Elliott, a major collector of Chinese art, who was at that point amassing fabulous examples of painting and calligraphy.
A night or two at Mr. Elliott's turned into a six-month stay. And a full-time Met job as curatorial assistant to Mr. Fong -- who was there just one day a week and teaching at Princeton the rest -- plunged Mr. Hearn into the museum world head-first.
To assert a new Asian presence in the museum and to attract donors, Mr. Fong presented a calligraphy show, and managed to get prime placement for it in what was then the Met's single special exhibition gallery, referred to in-house as ''the bowling alley'' or ''the airplane hanger.'' (South and Southeast Asian galleries occupy the space now.)
There was competition for the space. Mr. Hearn recalled that ''one curator tried to have the calligraphy shunted off to the Great Balcony.'' But the show went on. Cleanly installed but with decorative touches (bamboo, Ming furniture) and a supplementary display of Islamic and Western calligraphy put together by Mr. Hearn, it was a quiet hit. A group of patron-collectors took notice. The golden age began. Mr. Hearn was part of its history.
The collectors were an extraordinary generational ensemble, led by C. Douglas Dillon, who was president of the museum's board of trustees at the time. Mr. Dillon took it as a personal brief to support Asia at the Met. He bought art in bulk for the collection, starting, in 1973, with 25 pieces sold by the renowned connoisseur C. C. Wang. And he gave money to build new galleries to show it.
New galleries prompted more donations. John M. Crawford Jr., who in the 1950s had formed what Mr. Hearn called the most important private ensemble of Chinese painting and calligraphy in the West, lived virtually across the street from the museum, but had never exhibited his art there.
''When the Crawford collection was shown in New York in 1962,'' Mr. Hearn said, ''it was at the Morgan Library. That's how out of it the Met was.''
When the museum's Chinese painting galleries were finally finished in 1991, Mr. Crawford was invited to take a look. ''At last you have a space big enough to hold my collection,'' he said, and gave the Met everything.
Mr. Hearn speaks with a still-astonished delight about such acts of largess, and he played a part in some of them. In the late '70s, he and Mr. Fong conceived the idea of creating an indoor version of a Chinese scholar's garden as a centerpiece for the expanding Asian galleries. Mr. Hearn clambered up into a crawl space and discovered a covered-up skylight. That was what they needed, and the garden plans seemed set until Thomas Hoving, the museum's director, said no: the museum had just installed a million dollars worth of air-conditioning ducts up there. Nothing could be changed.
At that point, Mr. Fong deployed a secret weapon: Brooke Astor, a Met trustee, who as a child spent time in Beijing. When Mr. Hoving explained to her the impossibility of moving the ducts, her reply was simple: ''Well, how much would it cost?'' The skylight was soon exposed, and 26 Chinese craftsmen, accompanied by a personal cook, were imported from the garden city of Suzhou to create the Astor Court.
One by one, the galleries that now form the Asian wing -- China, Japan, India and Southeast Asia, Korea -- were carved out and built in what Mr. Watt refers to as ''the last major event in the development of the museum.'' Mr. Hearn, despite time out for language and graduate school, was there for every step.
''It took 27 years,'' he said. ''Now we have the most comprehensive collection of Asian art anywhere.''
The flush moment has passed. Collection-building is done. Prices are out of sight. ''Until the early 1980s no Chinese painting had sold on the auction market for more than $100,000,'' Mr. Hearn said. ''Before that, in the 1960s, you could buy paintings for a couple of thousand dollars.'' He remembered Mr. Dillon exclaiming that for the price of one Impressionist landscape he could build a whole Chinese collection.
Today, Mr. Hearn said, even if something important were to come up for sale, ''it's unlikely we'll be able to afford it.'' But he sees the problem as a general one. ''I think of the Getty. How can they ever match what East Coast museums have in European painting? It's the wrong time.'' There may never again by a right one.
One still-viable buying area is contemporary art, and it's very much on Mr. Hearn's mind. ''China, Japan, Korea, India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam -- all these places are creating wonderful things, and at the Met we have the opportunity to give this work an historical context.'' He already introduced contemporary photography into the Chinese painting galleries a couple of years ago; now he plans to add video.
Within the still deeply conservative field of Chinese art history, these are radical steps. But they are of a piece with the impression he gives of wanting to alter audience expectations of what exhibitions can be. ''The big blockbusters aren't going to go away,'' he said. But what they buy in box-office figures, they cost in time, cash and nerves. The Met's big Chinese offering last year, ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty,'' organized by Mr. Watt, was a cliffhanger, with the delivery of some items coming right down to the wire.
The general rule is that if you want to borrow from more than two Chinese museums for a show, all the loans have to be negotiated through that government's Cultural Relics Bureau. In the past, that bureau could demand whatever it wanted from provincial museums, without necessarily sharing paid loan fees, and sometimes without returning objects.
With the economic boom of recent years, however, provincial museums have become powerful entities, largely independent of central authority. Many treat their art as a meal ticket and drive tough bargains to extract money, and for fringe benefits like courier trips abroad, in exchange for loans.
One way to finesse the difficulties is to deal with only one Chinese museum at a time. China Institute Gallery in Manhattan bases most of its shows on single museum collections, as in its current exhibition of bronzes from the Hunan Provincial Museum. By contrast, the Met's Yuan exhibition had objects from 27 Chinese lenders, some of whom held back while asking, ''What's in it for me?''
One common way for all museums to manage expenses is through quid pro quo exchanges of loans: you send your Picasso, I'll send my van Gogh. But at this point, most provincial museums in China, while impressive-looking, are ill-equipped with protective resources like climate control, making reciprocal loans inadvisable.
Mr. Hearn expects that continuing archaeological discoveries in China will still give the West spectacular scholarly shows, focused on individual sites. But, like many curators and administrators now, he's beating the drum for small permanent collection shows that may or may not incorporate some choice loans. And he envisions those shows changing frequently.
''In Asian art, we're used to rotating our collections of Chinese and Japanese paintings and Indian miniatures all the time,'' he said. With wall space at a premium -- the Met is pretty much maxed out -- and acquisitions still coming in, he suspects that the European painting galleries will want to start regularly changing what's on view, perhaps taking the Chinese painting gallery rotations, which for years Mr. Hearn has turned into unfailingly interesting theme shows, as a model.
Of course, the major rotation in the Asian department at the moment is its leadership. As of this summer, Mr. Watt, with a series of superb historical shows at the Met behind him, will settle down to a long-planned stretch of reading and research. For Mr. Hearn, the heat is already on. A top priority will be to hire some new staff members, including a curator to replace himself, though this will take time as, he said, there aren't a lot of candidates around.
''There's been a real shift in the field, and I think it is across the board in art history. We're all seeing that young students are more and more interested exclusively in contemporary. Anything that's old is a hard sell.'' For non-Westerners, languages are a barrier. And he says that people are interested in the kind of high-paying jobs available in areas of contemporary art. ''Art history is not known for its big salaries,'' he said.
And despite the anticipated effects of the multicultural surge of the '80s and '90s, and of the global presence of Asia now, for many Westerners, Asian art is still an arcane subject to pursue.
''How many places can you study Indian art? Or Korean art?,'' Mr. Hearn asked. ''There are more programs for Chinese art, but my colleagues are telling me that although there's an uptick in Chinese-born applicants, over all there are fewer and fewer graduate students. The number of talented people who are in the field for the future is diminishing.''
What has not diminished -- though surely it has been tested -- is the optimism and embrace of the excitements of newness that he brought to the field 40 years ago. Both he and Mr. Watt speak of art history as a process of connecting, over time and space, people and cultures who would otherwise never know that they were related, were family. A universalist institution like the Met gives those links visual form. It's also a place where happenstance is destiny.
''I discovered Asian art by walking through a museum,'' Mr. Hearn said. ''I think people go to Asian museum because they want to see Asian art. But I'm counting on someone coming into the Met because he wants to see Greek or Egyptian sculpture, and getting lost, and finding himself in the Indian painting gallery and thinking, 'What's this?' '' Connection made. Big change.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art column in the special Museums section on Thursday about Maxwell K. Hearn, the new head of the Asian art department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misidentified the 2010 exhibition in which the delivery of some items came ''right down to the wire.'' It was ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty'' -- not ''The Yuan Revolution: Art and Dynastic Change.'' (That exhibition was held in conjunction with ''The World of Khubilai Khan.'')

HEADLINE: Year-Old Nascar Museum Wants a Restart

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
THE $200 million Nascar Hall of Fame, a four-level museum filled with exhibits, displays and simulators that approximate real stock-car racing, opened last May in Charlotte, N.C., with no lack of fanfare. Richard Petty and Junior Johnson, two of the first inductees, even rumbled up to the opening ceremonies in replicas of their old cars.
''We needed a unique destination attraction here that would set Charlotte apart,'' Tim Newman, the chief executive of the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, which operates the museum, said recently. ''We still had a lot of people who didn't think of Charlotte as a destination.'' 
Even though Charlotte has been the de facto capital of stock-car racing since Bill France founded Nascar in 1947, the 150,000-square-foot museum with the gleaming round steel facade, built by the city on Martin Luther King Boulevard, has proved to be a harder sell than it was supposed to be.
A research company told Mr. Newman and other civic officials that the hall could draw 800,000 visitors in its first year, even though the building opened during an economic downturn that has reduced attendance at Nascar races.
The projections turned out to be so far off -- fewer than 200,000 had visited by the end of December -- that officials found themselves fielding questions about the hall's disappointing first year, even though almost everything had gone smoothly.
''It was an easy number to run with, and I don't think it was scrutinized,'' Max Muhleman, who runs a national sports marketing company in Charlotte, said of the 800,000 figure.
Mr. Muhleman, who has lived in Charlotte for decades, said he thought he knew what had happened. ''The fuse is easily lit,'' he said. ''When a cause for recognition and achievement presents itself, there's never a lack of enthusiasm -- sometimes an overabundance of enthusiasm.''
Hall of Fame officials tempered the enthusiasm late last year by saying the hall could draw close to 300,000 in its first full year, about the same number the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., drew in 2009. The hall, they say, is on the right track. Winston Kelley, the museum's executive director, said in a recent interview, ''There's a tremendous amount of success that didn't make the headlines.''
But there have been cutbacks. Kimberly Meesters, a museum spokeswoman, said last month that it had trimmed $4 million from its $15 million annual budget, which comes from the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority. There were no staff cuts, she said, but the hours for part-time employees were reduced.
The poor economy had something to do with the lack of enthusiasm, officials said. The hall is open every day but Easter, Christmas and New Year's Day, and hall officials said they had discovered that potential customers, especially local people, were apparently postponing their visits.
Nascar does not exactly have the stock-car museum market cornered, either. Many race teams in the area have their own extensive displays of memorabilia, including Richard Childress Racing, whose museum in Welcome, N.C., includes several black Chevrolets raced by the late Dale Earnhardt, the seven-time series champion.
Just like any other hall of fame, Nascar's is incomplete, with just five members: Petty, Johnson, Earnhardt, Bill France and his son, also named Bill. A second class of five inductees -- the drivers Bobby Allison, Ned Jarrett, David Pearson and Lee Petty, and the owner Bud Moore -- will join the hall on May 23, with a third class to be elected in October.
But there have been positive developments. The museum has received positive reviews from visitors on Web sites like Yelp and Trip Advisor. The admission prices are $19.95 for adults, $17.95 for seniors and military and $12.95 for children ages 5 to 12.
The Hall of Fame has displays of old and new race cars, trophies and memorabilia from drivers' collections, video and photo displays of memorable moments in Nascar history, and several interactive exhibits, like a pit-stop challenge and a flag stand.
Surveys taken by the Hall of Fame show that customers have come from all 50 states and have been highly satisfied with their visits, and the hall is continuing to attract a number of events and conventions -- more than 70 -- that have used or reserved the museum. Ms. Meesters said prices range from about $500 to $6,000 to reserve space.
''From Nascar's point of view, we don't think the first year was disappointing at all,'' said Blake Davidson, the vice president for licensing and consumer products for Nascar. ''Attendance is the metric everybody looks at. But everything makes it work. The hospitality industry is something that's gotten behind this in a big way.''
The city scored a major coup on Feb. 1, when the Democratic Party announced it would hold its 2012 national convention in Charlotte, which was picked over three other cities. The hall, which includes television studios, was one of the civic assets that helped Charlotte's winning bid, Mr. Newman said.
Naturally, the museum is already a bump in visitors during the convention from Sept. 3 to 6, 2012. Hall officials will not sit idle until then, but will stuff the 2011 calendar with special events and promotions.
''We have a great product,'' Mr. Newman said. ''If we had a bad product, then we'd have trouble on our hands.''
Mr. Newman said local residents were less likely to visit the Hall of Fame when there was a Nascar event in town that would bring in thousands of visitors -- among them the Coca-Cola 600, the Sprint Cup race held Memorial Day weekend at Charlotte Motor Speedway. But the residents will come, in part because they already appreciate how much stock-car racing has meant to Charlotte itself.
Mr. Muhleman, who wrote about stock-car racing for a couple of newspapers, including The Charlotte News, is confident that the Hall of Fame will shrug off what has been perceived as a disappointing start and become an enduring landmark.
''It's going to grow,'' he said. ''It's going to do nothing but get better. It's not going to be torn down. It's not going to go away.''

HEADLINE: Classroom and Playground, All Rolled Into One

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
GARDEN CITY, N.Y.
ANNABELLE AND JULIA ROSES are having a great big noisy day. Here at the Long Island Children's Museum, the sisters have gotten soapy making giant bubbles and banged on musical instruments, hammered nails into blocks of wood and tried communicating through Morse code and American Sign Language. They have climbed around in a two-story maze and scrutinized, in a nature exhibit, a display of droppings left by different animals.
Annabelle, 8, asks if what she is seeing is real. It is, though coated with plastic to preserve it in all of its yucky glory.
Julia, 6, notes with surprise that geese feces are green. 
They are among the 255,000 people who will visit the 18-year-old Long Island museum this year, and among the 30 million who visit children's museums worldwide. They are, clearly, mixing learning and fun -- a neat trick that the best of the museums pull off seemingly without effort.
Which is partly why, even in a difficult economy, many of these institutions are booming.
The nation had just 38 museums for children in 1975, but today there are some 250, with another 80 being planned. Only a handful have closed, said Janet Rice Elman, executive director of the Association of Children's Museums, and many are expanding.
''People go to cities like Indianapolis and Boston and see those museums that are such an integral part of the learning lives of children and their families, and they want to bring that back to their own communities,'' she said.
The Stepping Stones Museum for Children, in Norwalk, Conn., reopened late last year after an ambitious expansion that roughly doubled the building's interior space to 42,000 square feet. In Rock Hill, S.C., the new Main Street Children's Museum opened in December as part of a broader downtown revitalization project. Aimed at children 6 and younger, the museum gives visitors a chance to play on a ship, in a store and in other settings that, in the words of Owen Glendening, a museum official, allow them ''to explore the world on their own terms, through creative play.''
But can't children simply play, anywhere, without parents having to buy a ticket? That's not so common these days, Mr. Glendening said. ''There's too much organized activity for these kids,'' he said, adding that unstructured play is more valuable than ever.
So one of the biggest trends in children's museums is getting children outdoors, something that, to earlier generations, would hardly have seemed necessary. Recalling her own childhood, Ms. Elman said, ''When I wasn't in school, my mom didn't see us.'' But with parental fears of everything from skin cancer and germs to stranger danger, ''children today spend far less time outside than our generation did,'' she said.
According to the association, 35 percent of children's museums have outdoor exhibitions and gardens, and are reintroducing children and families to the notion of exploring the world beyond the den and countering what Richard Louv, an author who has written about connecting children with nature, has called ''nature deficit disorder.''
At the Long Island Children's Museum, the outdoor play area, ''Our Backyard,'' opens each spring. ''Our Backyard,'' which the museum hopes to expand to 40,000 feet from its current 3,600 feet, has become the most popular part of the institution and includes vegetable gardens where visitors can harvest carrots, cucumbers and other vegetables, and eat them right out of the ground -- well, after washing them.
''Parents say, 'Oh, my God, my kid is eating vegetables!' '' said Erik Schurink, the museum's exhibits director.
That's another key to the children's museum experience: learning can be sneaky.
At the Long Island Children's Museum, Annabelle and Julia find a weird contraption: a wacky kind of player piano that looks like a long table with a thick plastic sheet running down the middle. The sheet has a grid of depressions, and wooden balls can be placed in the hollows. Once a series of balls have been set, Julia turns a crank: the sheet moves forward, dropping the balls onto xylophone bars, playing notes. With a little prompting, they recreate a pattern from a nearby instruction sheet, following directions and placing balls in certain spaces on the grid. When Julia turns the crank, the dropping balls play ''Happy Birthday.'' They turn to another page of the instructions and play ''Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.''
And then Annabelle says, ''Let's make up our own song'' and loads the balls at random.
David Ucko, the president of Museums and More, a consulting firm, said ''You don't have to be in a classroom to learn.'' A former official with the National Science Foundation and a proponent of ''informal learning,'' he said museums were uniquely situated to provide that kind of learning and to influence schools to expand the way they see education as well.
Museums are applying recent neuroscience research to their offerings, said Andy Ackerman, director of the Children's Museum of Manhattan. Instead of the lessons that generally come in a classroom through drills and testing, he said, the institutions can spread behavioral messages about topics like the value of health, exercise and nutrition at an early age through ''the 'aha!' experience'' -- and ''most of these 'aha!' experiences' do happen outside of school,'' he said.
''Knowledge in and of itself doesn't change behavior,'' he said. ''If it did, nobody would be smoking, right?''
The nation's largest children's museum, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, is finding that it can take on difficult issues as well. Its gallery, ''The Power of Children: Making a Difference,'' tells the stories of Anne Frank, Ryan White and Ruby Bridges, one of the first children to integrate the New Orleans school system in 1960. With five floors and 500,000 square feet, this 86-year-old museum can provide noise and flash, and also the serious ideas, said Jeffrey Patchen, the chief executive. ''Museums can embrace topics that matter,'' he said.
Museums, increasingly, are also reaching out to their communities. Tammie Kahn, executive director of the Children's Museum of Houston, notes that her institution serves a city whose population has a 50 percent rate of ''functional adult illiteracy,'' and 45 percent of its residents don't speak English at home. Half of the people who visit the museum enter with free or reduced-price tickets, she said.
Museums like hers, she said, can also help teach parents, showing them by example how to talk with their children in ways that encourage exploration and thinking. The staff is trained to work with children but also to encourage the parents to, say, help the child stack blocks and to discuss what happens when the stack gets too high to be stable.
''It's not the flash cards, it's not propping them up in front of a screen,'' she said. ''It's the real human interaction that encourages them and lays a foundation for learning.''
And, let's not forget, fun.
After a busy afternoon, Annabelle and Julia are ready to head home. And while the commotion of a children's museum can wear on a grown-up's nerves, the children leave on a happy note. They discuss their favorite parts: the sign language, sitting at two working telephones and having an extended conversation (Julia pretended to order a pizza from Annabelle), clowning with videophones and, of course, the droppings. Annabelle, however, made her favorite known when she grabbed a reporter's notebook and wrote, in an even hand, ''It was very cool to hear balls making songs.''

HEADLINE: A Grand Mansion Flaunts Its Parade of Weddings

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
FEW families have been as expert at wedding planning as Marjorie Merriweather Post and her daughters. The Post cereal heiress, who once owned a spate of mansions including Palm Beach's Mar-a-Lago and Topridge in the Adirondacks, had almost as many husbands -- four -- as she had homes.
Like mother, like daughters. Orchestras played the wedding march a dozen times for the three Post girls. The eldest, Adelaide, had three husbands; Eleanor, the middle sister, had six; and Nedenia, best known as the actress Dina Merrill, three.
In June, the Hillwood Estate, Museum and Gardens, Mrs. Post's Georgian-style estate, in Washington, is mounting ''Wedding Belles: Bridal Fashions From the Marjorie Merriweather Post Family: 1874-1958,'' an exhibit of wedding dresses and bridesmaid dresses worn by family members, including all four of Mrs. Post's wedding gowns and one gown from each of her three daughters' weddings. Among the wedding paraphernalia is the ''Hapsburg veil'' worn by Adelaide at one of her marriages but made for Princess Stephanie of Belgium when she married Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria in 1881. 
The exhibit is a bid by the museum's new director, Kate Markert, who took over in August, to introduce Hillwood, five miles from the tourist center of Washington, to a broader audience.
Certainly, the Hillwood collections are a feast for the eye. Houses, husbands or porcelains, Mrs. Post had a great appetite for the good life and loved buying beautiful objects. She could afford them. Born in 1887, she was the daughter of C. W. Post, the founder of the Postum Cereal Company. She and her second husband, the financier Edward Francis Hutton, expanded the company, buying the General Seafoods Corporation from Clarence Birdseye and renaming it General Foods.
In the 1950s, Mrs. Post, already one of the wealthiest people in the country, acquired Hillwood. While it is not one of the gilded-age mansions like those in Newport, R.I., or the Frick museum and the Morgan Library in New York, the collection it houses is lavish, reflecting Mrs. Post's fascination and connoisseurship, particularly of Russian decorative arts: icons, porcelains, enamels and jewelry.
''It has a Russian collection that is considered the best outside of Russia and it has an impressive research library, particularly on Russian subjects, and they have been inheriting collections of rare Russian books,'' said Susan Weber, director of the Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture.
Even so, the museum has a low profile, Ms. Markert said. ''Even among cultural consumers, we are not well known,'' said Ms. Markert, the former associate director of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. ''We get about 55,000 visitors a year and we could use more.''
Like those of many cultural institutions, Hillwood's endowment was hurt in the economic downturn. Since Hillwood suggests -- but does not require -- that visitors pay $15 admission, the estate is dependent on its endowment to meet nearly 90 percent of its annual $10 million budget.
''We want to diversify the income streams,'' said Ms. Markert. ''When the endowment falls as precipitously as it did, you begin to understand you need more sources of income, more exhibits, more contributions. People recognize that the amazing growth of endowments until 2008 is not expected to repeat.''
When Mrs. Post died in 1973, she left her home to the Smithsonian complete with a $10 million endowment, but the Smithsonian returned it to the then-named Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation several years later, determining that the house was too expensive to keep up.
Over the decades, the endowment received $8 million in proceeds from the sale of Mar-a-Lago to Donald Trump. Managed by a committee of the board of directors, the endowment grew to a total of $248 million by October 2007, but since the financial meltdown has declined in value to $190 million.
Mrs. Post's appetite for the Russian arts was whetted in 1937 when she moved to Russia with her third husband, Ambassador Joseph E. Davies. It was at a time when the Russians were raising currency by selling objects from the Imperial collections to help finance the revolution. Mrs. Post began buying and kept right on for decades.
The collection at Hillwood includes Faberge eggs, an important I. W. Buch chalice and a crown decorated with diamonds worn by Alexandra at her wedding to Czar Nicholas II. ''It is the only piece of imperial regalia outside of Russia,'' said Scott Ruby, Hillwood's curator of Russian art. ''It was in the imperial Treasury until 1917. It was then transferred to the Kremlin armory and finally sold at Christie's in 1927. Mrs. Post bought it in the mid 1960s.''
She was also an avid collector of Russian porcelains, when they were still considered derivative of European work. In 1937, while taking a cure at Vichy, France, she bought about 20 pieces from the Orlov service.
Hillwood is also a trove of rococo blue and pink Sevres porcelains, including almost the entire service sold at the J. P. Morgan sale in 1944.
As John Murdoch, director of art collections at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, described it, the classic recipe for elegance in the gilded age included French furniture, Oriental carpets and English portraits. Mrs. Post amassed a collection of French furniture, but despite advice from Joseph Duveen, the art expert, she did not have the same enthusiasm for paintings.
Objects at Hillwood are impeccably maintained. Every year the museum, which has a staff of 80 including 10 gardeners, closes for a month for cleaning. Its grand chandelier, which came from a Russian palace and reputedly once belonged to Catherine the Great, is lowered on a winch, the floors are waxed and the furniture dusted.
Increasing attendance at Hillwood is a challenge, particularly because it miles from the tourist attractions are in the city center. Starting with the coming exhibit, Ms. Markert plans to mine Hillwood's holdings more aggressively. ''This is going to be the benchmark for what we are going to do,'' she said of the wedding belles exhibit.
There have been other efforts to draw attendance. Last spring, Hillwood joined with Dandies and Quaintrelles, a group that organizes retro social events. Nearly 500 visitors, dressed in seersucker-inspired outfits, arrived at Hillwood on bicycles and cheerfully celebrated with cocktails. ''The turnout was amazing,'' said Ms. Markert over lunch in the Hillwood cafeteria, which once served as the estate's stables.
To increase attendance over the longer term, though, she is working on a three- to five-year plan.
''We have fantastic holdings that have never been mined,'' she said. Next, Ms. Markert seems to be eyeing the Russian collections. ''Mrs. Post was only in Russia a year and a half, but she was collecting when others were selling.''

HEADLINE: A Growing Use Of Private Art In Public Spaces

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
THE exhibition that opens at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on May 21 is certain to be a dazzler: ''The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso and the Parisian Avant-Garde'' will have 40 works by Picasso, 60 by Matisse and many by favorites like Bonnard and Cezanne. Picasso's ''Gertrude Stein'' will be there, with his ''Boy Leading a Horse.'' So will Matisse's wildly colorful ''Woman With a Hat,'' which was derided by critics when revealed in 1905 but was soon purchased by the Steins for what would become their pioneering collection of modern art.
In all, the show reunites 200 paintings, sculptures and works on paper once owned by Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo and Michael, and Michael's wife, Sarah, but long since dispersed among museums and private collections around the world. It will provide a panoramic view of the revolutionary artists who worked in early 20th-century Paris.
Museum officials are likely to appreciate the show for all that and an additional reason. To many, ''The Steins Collect'' will be persuasive evidence that organizing an exhibition around the collector's eye is a legitimate and valuable practice. 
Every now and then, a furor erupts over just such exhibitions, which, when the collectors are alive, are rife with potential conflicts of interest. It happened in 2009, when the New Museum in New York exhibited works from the collection of Dakis Joannou, a trustee, and in 2010, when the Los Angeles County Museum of Art displayed 100 works owned by the trustee Lynda Resnick and her husband, Stewart. And it happened in 1999, when the Brooklyn Museum displayed works owned by the British advertising magnate Charles Saatchi.
The circumstances always vary, but what single-collector exhibitions share are aspects that challenge their legitimacy. When the collectors are trustees or provide financing for an exhibition, it looks as if the museum is selling out to vanity shows or renting its galleries. If museums show a collection without the promise of a gift, they are seen as endorsing the art and elevating its value. If museums display art that comes with a gift, they seem -- unless it is the entire collection -- to be using a questionable fund-raising tool at best, or exacting a quid pro quo at worst. The question always arises as to who is making the curatorial decisions, museum or collector? And when collectors sell art after the exhibition, the museum looks as if it has been used.
But rather than avoid these shows, museums around the country are embracing them. Last summer, the Metropolitan Museum of Art displayed Italian drawings from the collection of the honorary trustee David M. Tobey and his wife, Julie; this spring, the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester County is showing works on paper from the Sally and Wynn Kramarsky Collection; and on Saturday, the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh will open ''30 Americans,'' highlighting works by African-Americans in the Rubell Family Collection in Miami.
Since the start of 2010, the Art Institute of Chicago has mounted five single-collector exhibitions: contemporary works owned by the life trustee Judith Neisser and by Donna and Howard Stone, another life trustee; ''Seven Centuries of Art'' from the life trustee Richard Gray; Japanese prints from the Jack D. Beem Collection, and ancient Chinese bronzes from the Katherine and George Fan Collection. In November, it will open a show of contemporary drawings from the collection of the life trustee Irving Stenn Jr.
Meanwhile, exhibitions including ''Beauty and Power: Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes from the Peter Marino Collection'' and ''Golden: Dutch and Flemish Masterworks from the Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo Collection,'' are traveling the country.
Why are they all risking criticism? Borrowing a collection from a patron is an easy way to show material a museum does not have. The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, for example, aspires to be an encyclopedic museum but owns almost no Native American art; to fill that gap, it is displaying pieces from the collection of two longtime donors, Robert and Nancy Nooter. ''Museums exist to educate the public and delight them; it makes sense to feature these collections if you can,'' said John Ravenal, curator of contemporary and modern art at the Virginia museum.
Searching to provide the pubilc new reasons to come, museums in these tight times are also turning to single-collector exhibits for economic reasons. Compared with exhibitions drawn from many sources, they are ''always cheaper,'' says James Cuno, director of the Art Institute of Chicago. Budget items like shipping costs are lower.
Yet museums prefer to emphasize the value of looking at art through the eye of a collector. Because collectors are free to indulge their vision, venturing into new or unfashionable areas, they can lead taste. They can also collect an artist or a period in depth. The van Otterloo collection is an example: its 70 Dutch and Flemish paintings were purchased over the last few decades by the couple to illustrate every genre by master painters of Holland's 17th-century Golden Age. It is worth $250 million or more, and no museum today could afford to assemble it.
Purchases by museums tend to be more conventional, reflecting taste and covering the bases, rather than specializing. That is due, in part, to a lack of money. Also, Mr. Ravenal explains, ''for museums to acquire, it's a laborious, multistage process, and sometimes a dealer won't hold on to a work through it.'' Typically, museum purchases must pass muster with trustees.
Not every collector has had as much foresight as the Steins or as much focus as the van Otterloos, of course. But Mr. Cuno notes similar ''moments'' of collector boldness in Chicago. ''There was one around Monet, who was alive when our collectors collected him, and the richness of our Impressionist collection is a result,'' he says. ''And there was one around surrealism,'' when the Art Institute patrons Lindy and Edwin Bergman in particular bought works by Dali, Tanguy and others, which were given to the museum.
Chicago has been having another moment, Mr. Cuno says, and with his current series of single-collector exhibitions, he is simply ''documenting the taste of Chicago collectors'' in recent years. He wanted to do so now because in 2009 the Art Institute opened a wing for modern and contemporary art that he said had created ''tremendous pride'' and prompted many gifts of art. Of the 100 works in the Neisser show -- by minimalist and conceptual artists of the 1960s, and later artists with similar themes -- 33 are promised gifts. The Stones are donating 50 works that were in last fall's exhibition.
In presenting ''Conversations With Wood: Selections From the Waterbury Collection'' this summer, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts has many motives. Jennifer Komar Olivarez, an associate curator, is choosing what to display from the collection owned by David and Ruth Waterbury, longtime museum patrons. ''This is an exhibition to honor and engage with this couple because they have been so supportive to us,'' she says. ''I want to show the best of the collection; whether they come to us is a separate issue.'' Still, she knows that ''they are thinking about the dispersal of the collection'' and that other museums are interested in it.
At the same time, Ms. Olivarez said that showcasing the Waterbury collection provided a different opportunity.
''Wood is an area where you can buy without much money and get involved with the artists,'' she said. ''This exhibit will get people to think about outside-the-box collecting areas, and museums are interested in fostering collecting.''
As expected, curators play down collectors' challenges to their curatorial decisions. ''You have to navigate the wishes and whims of the collector, but they can be managed,'' says Mr. Ravenal, who is president of the Association of Art Museum Curators. Ms. Olivarez said, ''It's an educational process on both sides and finding mutual respect.'' Curators also point out that today many collectors, as museum patrons and trustees, buy art with donations in mind, consulting with curators as they buy.
Fair enough, says Nicholas Fox Weber, the author of several books on collectors, but he raises a pertinent point, made more so by art market trends. ''One great problem today is that we have rich people who buy indiscriminately,'' he says. ''They are not showing a vision.'' Mr. Weber tells of a recent forum of collectors where, he says, ''they could have been saying 'we have one Prada, one Louis Vuitton, one Gucci.' It troubles me when they have one Warhol, one Jasper Johns and so on. What's interesting is if you have an original collection.''
Mr. Weber says he does not want to restrict single-collector exhibitions, but he urges museums to be more discriminating about them. ''It's up to the museum director only to show a collection if there is a vision,'' he says.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rise at Fast Clip; Housing Starts Decline

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Producer prices surged in February at their fastest pace in about 18 months, lifted by high food and energy prices, according to a government report on Wednesday that pointed to a buildup in inflation pressures.
In a second report, the government said housing starts declined the most in 27 years in February while building permits dropped to their lowest level on record, a sign that the beleaguered real estate sector has yet to rebound from its deep slump. 
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate jumped 1.6 percent, the largest increase since June 2009, after rising 0.8 percent in January.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent increase in producer prices last month. In the 12 months to February, producer prices increased 5.6 percent.
The report came a day after the Federal Reserve said it expected the upward inflation pressure from energy and other commodities to prove transitory but that it would keep a close eye on inflation and inflation expectations.
The increase in wholesale prices last month was broad-based, with energy prices surging 3.3 percent -- the biggest increase since January 2010, after 1.8 percent the previous month. Gasoline prices, which rose 3.7 percent, accounted for over 40 percent of the increase in the energy index. Food prices jumped 3.9 percent, the biggest increase since 1974.
Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, core producer prices rose 0.2 percent last month, matching expectations, and retreating from a 0.5 percent rise in January.
Last month, the core index was lifted by 1.0 percent increase in apparel, which was the biggest rise since 1990, while passenger cars rose 0.6 percent, the Labor Department said.
In the 12 months to February, the core Producer Price Index rose 1.8 percent, in line with expectations. It was the largest increase since August 2009 and followed a 1.6 percent increase in January.
In the housing report, the Commerce Department said that groundbreaking on new construction dropped 22.5 percent in February to an annual rate of 479,000 units. This was just above a record low set in April 2009 and way below the estimates of economists, who had been looking for a smaller drop to 570,000.
January's figure was revised up to 618,000 units from 596,000. But that did not change the tenor of the report, which confirmed that the sector was failing to recover despite interest rates near record lows.
Building permits, a hint of future construction demand, fell to a record low of 517,000 units from a revised 563,000, and were down by about 20 percent from levels seen in February 2010.
One impediment to the sector's recovery is a vast backlog of unsold inventory, while a shaky job market has also made consumers reluctant to embark on any major new financial commitments. A glut of foreclosures, stalled in recent months by revelations of improper loan documentation, is further depressing the market.
The Commerce Department also reported that the country's current-account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, snapping five quarters of gains as export growth outweighed increases in imported goods.
The deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments in and out of the United States, shrank to $113.3 billion -- or 3.1 percent of gross domestic product -- in the last quarter of 2010. That was down from a revised third-quarter deficit of $125.5 billion, and the lowest since the first quarter of 2010.

HEADLINE: Bahrain Violently Ousts Protesters From Square, Placing Ally, U.S., in a Bind

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Nadim Audi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MANAMA, Bahrain -- Popular protests here modeled on the hopeful events in Egypt took on the darkness of those in Libya on Wednesday as hundreds of Bahraini troops, backed by helicopters and tanks, forcefully cleared the capital's central square of demonstrators clamoring for reform. Three protesters and two security officers were killed.
Two days after the king of Bahrain called in 2,000 troops from Saudi Arabia and other neighboring allies, and the day after he declared martial law, his forces roared through downtown Manama, wresting it from the protesters who had in recent days taken charge of neighborhoods and nearby villages. As skirmishes continued into the evening, a curfew was announced for the center of the city.
''They broke everything, they shot at kids, there was no humanity, no respect,'' said Hassan Ali Ibrahim, 35, a gardener, who had spent the night in the plaza, known as Pearl Square, a protest tent camp over the past month like Tahrir Square in Cairo. ''When we saw the tanks and the cars, about a hundred of us went towards them, and started chanting, 'Peacefully! Peacefully!' This is when they started shooting, from the ground and from the bridge, from everywhere.'' 
The crackdown placed the United States in an awkward bind. The United States, which bases its Fifth Fleet here, has struggled to balance its strategic interest in placating Bahrain and its ally, Saudi Arabia, its fears that Iran is exploiting the anger of Bahrain's majority Shiite protesters, and American democratic principles. American officials have held off backing the protesters while urging Bahrain's leaders to exercise restraint. That advice was ignored.
President Obama on Tuesday telephoned both King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain to stress ''the need for maximum restraint,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.
He added that Mr. Obama ''also stressed the importance of a political process as the only way to peacefully address the legitimate grievances of Bahrainis and to lead to a Bahrain that is stable, just, more unified and responsive to its people.''
Plumes of black smoke choked the city landscape as troops repeatedly fired tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and what sounded like live ammunition in their dawn assault. Telephone and Internet service were cut. Tents, trees and brush burned quickly in the desert wind. Security forces extinguished the fires with water cannons normally used to break up crowds. ''This was not an attack aimed at just dispersing the people in the square, it was meant to hurt us, and the way they were advancing, with the helicopters above them, and the tanks, and the machine guns -- it really felt like a war, not a police operation,'' said Hussein Ali Eid, 32, a demonstrator.
Simultaneously, troops and tanks surrounded and invaded Salmaniya Hospital, an opposition stronghold. The crackdown continued in villages outside Manama, the capital, and opposition leaders reported scores of people sent to local clinics and hospitals.
''The hospital was controlled by terrorists, and we liberated it,'' an army commander at Salmaniya who declined to provide his name or rank said at the complex's entrance. Like nearly all the troops on duty, he covered his face with a mask to prevent identification. It remained unclear whether the foreign troops had participated directly in the assault on Pearl Square or other actions during the day, though officials had said they were there only to protect strategically important ministries and institutions, like the monarchy itself.
A government announcement said it had lost two soldiers to demonstrators who had repeatedly run them over. It also asserted that the forces had not moved on the demonstrators at first but responded to their gunfire and that the fires were set by the demonstrators themselves.
The pro-democracy movement of Bahrain, a tiny island off the Saudi coast, is like many in the Arab world, seeking to wrest total power from the hands of the royal family and set up a government of accountability, especially in light of rising economic difficulty. It has been fed by a bulging youth population and access to social media. But it is more fraught, because 70 percent of the country, especially its poorest citizens, is Shiite Muslim while the king and the elite are Sunni.
This means that the dispute is over ethnicity and class as well as over governance, but also that outside forces have a keen interest. Iran, the center of Shiism, and which sometimes refers to Bahrain as one of its provinces, supports the majority population here. It has condemned the actions of the king, and labeled the Saudi military intervention an occupation. Saudi Arabia, which has a Shiite minority of its own to contend with, firmly backs the government and fears growing Iranian influence.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Cairo on Wednesday that the military move here was ''alarming.'' She added, ''It is unfortunately diverting attention and effort away from the political and economic track that is the only way forward to resolve the legitimate differences of the Bahrainis themselves. We have made that clear time and time again. We have deplored the use of force. We have said not only to the Bahrainis but to our gulf partners that we do not think security is the answer to what is going on.''
Opposition politicians said that a number of Bahraini officials, all Shiite, had resigned as a result of Wednesday' s crackdown. They said they included the ministers of health and housing, four members of the Shura, or advisory council, and perhaps some judges. It was not possible to confirm the resignations, however.
The early morning attack on Pearl Square -- named to honor pearl fishing in Bahraini culture -- was observed from a neighboring building. By the time the first light came to the waters of the Persian Gulf, scores of jeeps and tanks were drawn up along the coastal area. As the attack unfolded, the hundreds of protesters there were forced into side streets and fled as security vehicles rolled through.
Participants said they had expected the attack after they heard that Saudi troops had been brought in on Monday and then that martial law had been declared. ''So we were looking out for signs, we were watching out,'' Mr. Eid said. ''We went to pray at a mosque nearby, and on the way back to the square, we looked at our phones and realized the network was out. It was about 6. At that point, we knew what was going to happen. So we took the women to a place on the safer side of the square.''
He said that a group headed toward the soldiers, and then he heard dozens of explosions.
After the square had been cleared of people, with military helicopters still hovering, uniformed police officers accompanied by men in civilian clothes could be seen smashing windshields of parked cars. Meanwhile, tanks rolled toward the financial district. It was last Sunday's action by the protesters, taking over the streets leading to the financial district, that set the king on the path of smashing the movement. Bahrain calls itself ''business friendly'' and viewed that move as beyond the pale.
Mr. Eid added that Wednesday's action would not end the protests: ''I'm unemployed. What do they want from me? They think I'm going to sit at home? With two kids? I need to ask for my rights, for my dignity. This is not going to go away, until we get all our rights.''

HEADLINE: In Proposed Mortgage Fraud Settlement, a Gift to Big Banks

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Email: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Luis Alvarez/Associated PressTom Miller, attorney general of Iowa.
Lurking in a proposed mortgage fraud settlement with the state attorneys general is a clause that could be worth billions for the big banks.
Yes, I mean the settlement that might extract the supposedly large sum of $20 billion from the banks to settle foreclosure fraud. The one denounced as a ''shakedown'' by Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama.
Despite such rhetoric, the settlement might let the banks avoid tens of billions of write-downs, thanks to a clause with a biblical flavor: the last shall be first. 
The proposed agreement - which is preliminary and subject to intense negotiations being led by Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa - would allow banks to treat second mortgages, like home equity lines of credit, just like the first mortgages. Under the proposal, when a bank writes the principal down on the first mortgage, the second should be written down ''at least proportionately to the first.''
Suddenly, the banks would be given license to subvert the rules of payment hierarchy, as Gretchen Morgenson pointed out in The New York Times on Sunday. Yes, the clause says the other alternative is to wipe out the second's value entirely, but given a choice, the banks would be extremely unlikely to do that.
So how is this a gift? Because when the principal on the first mortgage is reduced, the second lien is typically wiped out. The first lien holder has the first right to any money recovered, and the second lien holder has to wait its turn.
The proposal ''seems astonishingly generous to the second-lien holders,'' said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University. ''And who are those? Of course, they are the big mortgage servicers.''
And who owns the big mortgage servicers? The biggest banks.
Throughout the financial crisis, we have heard plenty of intoning about the sanctity of contracts. But this suggests that the banks, with the authorities' tacit approval, think contracts are for thee and not for me. The price to get the banks to do the right thing contractually with mortgage modifications and foreclosure is to allow them to not do the right thing elsewhere.
To understand the significance of this issue, cast your mind back to the height of the housing bubble. People used their homes as A.T.M.'s, withdrawing billions from their equity to finance motorboats and meals at Applebee's.
The top four banks now have about $408 billion worth of second liens on their balance sheets, according to Portales Partners, an independent research firm specializing in financial companies. Wells Fargo, for instance, has more money in second liens than it has tangible common equity, or the most solid form of capital. If banks had to write these loans down substantially, acknowledging the true extent of their losses, they would have to raise capital - and might even teeter on the brink of insolvency.
The performance of second liens is among the biggest puzzles in banking today: why are they doing better than the firsts? When Wells Fargo disclosed its earnings, for instance, it classified 5.3 percent of its first mortgages as nonperforming, but put only 2.4 percent of its second liens in that category. That seems very odd because it's much easier to lose your home if you don't pay your mortgage than if you don't pay your home equity line.
Investors are deeply skeptical about the value in these loans, bidding about 50 cents on the dollar for them these days. Even allowing that banks probably hawk the least attractive loans and that investors bid low to generate a high return for the risk, many of these loans are still probably not worth 100 cents on the dollar.
Yet banks have taken relatively few write-downs on second loans so far. In fact, even when the first clearly is in trouble, sometimes the banks appear to resist writing loans down. Bill Frey, who runs Greenwich Financial Services, has instigated lawsuits to try to recoup the value of mortgage securities by getting the banks to buy back faulty mortgages that were in the pools he examined. He analyzed mortgage securities made up of loans by Countrywide Financial, which is now owned by Bank of America, looking for instances when the second lien was still extant, even though the first lien attached to the same property had been modified. Such a situation would suggest that a bank was not marking down a second lien even when the underlying, more senior first lien was impaired. He says he found multiple instances in every one of the 200 pools he examined.
Mr. Frey argues that the banks should charge off those seconds. ''That's the concept of subordination,'' he said. ''It's been around since the Magna Carta. Maybe we should get on the bandwagon.''
This is not simply a fight between hedge funds, which own the securities that contain the first liens, and banks that house the seconds. Many mortgage securities are held by small banks, life insurance companies and pension funds. ''I can see little reason why a pensioner should take the loss instead of Bank of America, when it's Bank of America's bad loan,'' Mr. Frey said.
A Bank of America spokesman said that it charges off second loans when borrowers haven't made payments for 180 days. The bank doesn't, nor is it required to, charge them off just because the first lien has been modified, he says. But if a first mortgage is modified, the bank will increase its reserve because it's more likely that the second will sour.
Since the fall, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been examining how banks across the industry are treating their second liens, according to two people familiar with the review. The O.C.C. declined to comment.
But so far, the agency has evinced a rather blase attitude about the potential problem on banks' balance sheet. Don't expect forceful action any time soon.
In this case, making the last first may mean that weak banks continue to inherit the earth.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Afghanistan Sets Timetable for Phasing Out Most Private Security Companies

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA; Taimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan, and an Afghan employee of The New York Times from Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Afghan government is planning to phase out most private security companies and replace them with its own forces over the next 12 months, according to Afghan and international officials.
The timeline appears to end months of turmoil over how quickly the companies would be pushed out, and it should clear the way for projects that had been delayed by security concerns to resume development.
The plan allows foreign embassies and organizations with diplomatic missions to continue using private security companies at their discretion. Other entities, including the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and the United States Agency for International Development, could continue to contract with the companies over the next 12 months. 
At the end of that period, the Afghan Public Protection Force and the Ministry of Defense would take responsibility for securing NATO supply convoys and protecting international development projects, according to details of the plan released late Tuesday.
Whether 12 months is long enough to meet that goal is an open question, said Stan Soloway, president of the Professional Services Council, a group that represents companies doing business with the American government around the world, including Afghanistan. ''But at least this now gives us some time to work toward that goal without some arbitrary, short-term deadline,'' he said.
The extensive use of private security companies by the United States and other foreign entities has been a source of tension in Afghanistan and Iraq for years, fueled by high-profile episodes involving civilian deaths, excessive use of force and corruption.
In August, President Hamid Karzai issued a decree banning most private security companies, with the Afghan Public Protection Force replacing them. NATO welcomed the move, but how quickly the companies would be ushered out was unclear. Many development groups that rely on the companies worried that the government would replace them before Afghan forces were trained or numerous enough to take on the work.
The government appeared to back off in December when it agreed that the companies would be gradually replaced when enough government guards were recruited and trained to take their place. But Mr. Karzai ordered a secret investigation into the companies. It concluded that more than 80 percent of the 52 licensed companies had committed some offense, including 16 cited for ''major offenses.''
The serious offenses included such violations as the illegal use of weapons, illegal hiring, vehicle offenses and tax evasion. The investigation raised concerns among Western officials that Mr. Karzai was trying to hasten the departure of the companies, while the companies privately fretted that the list was a kind of shakedown by the government, which the government denied.
The Ministry of Interior said that all but 7 of the 52 companies would be allowed to continue operating in the country, but urged them to settle their ''security and legal violations'' within 90 days. The remaining seven, mostly local companies, were ordered disbanded for having ties to government officials.
Lt. Gen. James Bucknall, deputy commander of the NATO-led force, said in a statement that the ''one-year bridging strategy'' ensured that the transition to Afghan security forces would ''take place in an orderly and measured way without prejudice to security of the agencies involved.''
The plan also should allow new development projects that had been threatened to move forward, including the construction of military bases and police stations for Afghan forces over the next two years at a cost of more than $10 billion.
In another area that has raised tensions with the Afghan government, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of American and allied forces in Afghanistan, ordered an investigation on Wednesday into a NATO airstrike that killed two children in Kunar Province on Monday. Local officials said the children -- two brothers, ages 11 and 17 -- were watering their family's field when a helicopter fired on them.
It was the latest in a string of cases involving civilian casualties this month that have aggravated relations between NATO forces and Mr. Karzai. Last week, a cousin of Mr. Karzai was killed in a night raid in Kandahar Province. And on March 1, NATO helicopter gunners mistakenly killed nine boys collecting firewood in Kunar Province, believing that they were insurgents. Both episodes are under investigation.
NATO suspended the ground force commander and grounded the helicopter crew involved in Monday's killings while the investigation into them continues.
''I cannot overstate how seriously we take all instances of civilian casualties,'' General Petraeus, who was in Washington testifying before Congress, said in a statement. ''We will take all necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. We know we cannot succeed if we harm the people.''
Also on Wednesday, 12 oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO bases were destroyed in a fiery blast after a motorcycle loaded with explosives detonated while it was parked next to them in Tarin-Kot, the capital of Oruzgan Province, local officials said. Two men believed to be drivers were killed and six others were wounded, said Ahmad Milad Mudasir, a provincial spokesman.

HEADLINE: Dividends Will Enrich Bank Chiefs

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Even as ordinary investors look forward to the prospect of larger dividend payouts by the big banks, another group is poised for a rich payday: bank chief executives. In the next few days, the Federal Reserve is expected to give a handful of institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, permission to pay higher dividends, another sign of the remarkable comeback of banks since the depths of the financial crisis.
Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, stands to eventually reap nearly $6 million a year in dividend payments from the stock he owns, an amount that equals almost a third of his total pay in 2010. Capital One's chief executive, Richard D. Fairbank, could earn nearly $3 million a year as the credit card giant weighs a similar move. 
These figures are based on the number of shares the executives own and estimates from the banks about the percentage of earnings they plan to earmark for dividend payments. The increase in dividends is likely to occur in stages, so it may take until 2012 for the executives to collect the entire amount.
A JPMorgan spokesman said the payouts were on shares Mr. Dimon accumulated while at the bank, including 2.6 million he bought with his own money. A Capital One spokeswoman said Mr. Fairbank had been paid entirely in stock during his tenure.
To some extent, the expected windfall comes because banks have been paying executives a greater portion of their compensation in stock instead of salaries or bonuses.
Regulators hoped that if banks handed out more shares and other forms of deferred pay, executives would avoid the type of excessive risk-taking that contributed to the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.
At that time, regulators also pressured lenders to cut dividends and shore up their finances as loan losses mounted. Even some of the strongest institutions halted their stock repurchase programs and cut their quarterly dividend to a mere nickel or penny a share. As part of the financial bailout in 2008, banks need federal approval before they could increase the dividends. Dividends for financial companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell to $19 billion in 2010, from $51 billion in 2007. JPMorgan Chase, for example, now has an annual dividend of 20 cents a share, compared to $1.52 before the crisis.
The larger dividends will also put billions of dollars into the pockets of big investors, like pension and hedge funds, as well as retirees who rely on the quarterly payouts as a steady source of income. JPMorgan has said it plans to pay roughly 30 percent of earnings as dividends. With analysts projecting the company to earn over $19 billion in 2011, that would translate to an annual dividend of $1.13 a share.
Several other banks have said they plan to pay a similar percentage of earnings to shareholders. So chief executives stand to reap especially large gains because they are traditionally among the biggest holders of company stock.
Corporate governance experts do not typically fret about such payouts since they help align the interests of management with those of investors more equally than other compensation practices. However, the dividends collected by chief executives will not be broken out in the compensation tables found in corporate filings. Investors must crunch the numbers themselves.
''Even a small dividend can add up to a pretty substantial amount of money,'' said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at GovernanceMetrics International. ''It could be just another bonus for some C.E.O.'s. For others, it is a huge windfall.''
The likely approval on dividends comes as the Federal Reserve completes a second round of stress tests for the nation's 19 largest banks. Regulators are gauging whether they have stockpiled enough capital to weather a still-anemic economic recovery and meet the higher requirements put in place by new international accords.
The top banks will learn the results of the examinations by Monday, including whether they can raise dividends and buy back shares. With the Fed's expected blessing in hand, financial stocks could get a lift in the coming days, as one bank after another announces their plans.
''Allowing some dividends to go up is a big vote of confidence in our banks,'' said Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill.
In addition to JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, other institutions hoping for dividend increases include BB&T, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial and Wells Fargo.
If Wells Fargo pays 30 percent of earnings to shareholders, its chief executive, John G. Stumpf, would reap nearly $400,000 a year in dividends, based on the bank's expected profit in 2011. Using similar assumptions, PNC Financial's chief executive, James E. Rohr, stands to earn close to $1 million a year.
Other chief executives, like Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America and Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, may have to wait until the second half of 2011 or even into 2012 for a modest dividend increase, because their companies are recovering more slowly.
American Express, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have told investors they may eschew dividend increases in favor of things like investing in their businesses or buying back stock. Goldman expects to use some of the money to repurchase the preferred shares it sold Warren E. Buffett at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.
Some regional banks, like SunTrust Banks and KeyCorp, are forbidden by the federal government to raise dividends because they have yet to return the billions in federal bailout money they received in 2008. Depending on how those banks fare in the stress tests, the Fed may let them start repaying the government in the coming weeks.

HEADLINE: In Europe and China, Japan's Crisis Renews Fears About Nuclear Power

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEYand SHARON LaFRANIERE; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Japan's nuclear crisis intensified Wednesday, governments across Europe remained at odds over whether to scale back nuclear power programs or continue plans to expand, while China announced that it was suspending new plant approvals until it could strengthen safety standards.
While the German public has been the most vocal against nuclear power -- pushing Chancellor Angela Merkel's government this week to close temporarily seven of the country's 17 plants -- it is a different story in other parts of Europe. 
France, the second-largest producer of nuclear power in the world behind the United States, said it would continue to rely on nuclear energy.
President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday that the accident in Japan had ''provoked across the world a number of questions about the safety of nuclear power stations and the energy mix.''
But he added: ''France has chosen nuclear energy, which is an essential element of its energy independence and the struggle against greenhouse gases.''
He added: ''I remain convinced of the relevance today of those choices.''
Nonetheless, critics voiced their opposition to the government's stance.
Francois Mativet, a spokesman for Sortir du Nucleaire, a network of 875 antinuclear groups, described Mr. Sarkozy's comments as ''scandalous'' and called for the immediate closing of 16 reactors in France that have been in service for more than 30 years, as well as a longer-term plan to abandon nuclear power.
Elsewhere on the Continent, Russia and several Eastern European countries were playing down the risk of nuclear power.
So confident was Russia that it signed an agreement with Belarus this week to finance and build Belarus's first nuclear power plant, a 4.3 billion euro, or $6 billion, project near the Lithuanian border.
As if to make a point that Russia had no intention of backing away from its own ambitious nuclear energy policy, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin flew to Minsk for the signing ceremony on Tuesday.
''We now have a whole arsenal of progressive technological means to ensure the stable accident-free work of nuclear power stations,'' Mr. Putin said.
The Belarusian plant will have two reactors. They are expected to begin operating by 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich of Belarus said at the ceremony.
Belarus's neighbors in the European Union -- Lithuania, Latvia and Poland -- expressed concern about the accord, not only because it would increase Belarus's dependence on Russia for its energy but also because of safety concerns. The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, contaminated parts of these countries, as well as Belarus.
Despite such fears, Lithuania and Poland seem determined to go ahead with their own nuclear programs, if they can afford it.
The Lithuanian government has said it wants to replace the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was partly closed in 2004 for safety reasons at the insistence of the European Union, which required it as a condition for joining.
Still, Dalia Grybauskaite, Lithuania's president, said this week that the government might have to rethink its nuclear energy plans, not because of Japan's disasters but because of costs.
''Lithuania should have no illusions that it may be able to build something in the near future; we have no investor,'' Mrs. Grybauskaite told The Associated Press. ''We have no technologies. It would be very naive nurturing expectations, especially given the current situation and the economic crisis, which isn't over yet.''
In Poland, which is considering building its own nuclear power plants, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also played down the crisis in Japan. ''Plants will be built to provide maximum security,'' he told reporters last weekend.
A similar attitude can be seen in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania, where public opinion, with few exceptions, has not questioned such a strategy.
All those countries intend to build more nuclear plants, despite the costs -- and despite the increased dependence on Russia for the construction of these plants or for uranium.
In China, the government announced stepped-up inspections at its existing plants in addition to the suspension of new approvals.
China, the world's leader in construction of nuclear plants, plans to add more than 25 reactors, but most are already under construction, and it was unclear how many would be affected by the new order.
The announcement came after Premier Wen Jiabao discussed Japan's nuclear crisis with the State Council, a body roughly equivalent to the White House cabinet.
''We must fully grasp the importance and urgency of nuclear safety, and development of nuclear power must make safety the top priority,'' the government said on its Web site. ''Any hazards must be thoroughly dealt with, and those that do not conform to safety standards must immediately cease construction.''
Although the statement said ''all new power plants'' should be suspended until safety standards are revised, an industry expert said Thursday morning that the government intends to continue work on those plants already under construction and halt construction only if it identifies safety problems. In that case, China's expansion of nuclear power might not slow significantly, he said.
Officials have portrayed nuclear energy as a way for China to reduce its reliance on coal and cut its carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time meeting surging demand for electricity. The country has never had a serious nuclear accident, though the speed of its construction program has raised safety concerns.
Some specialists also worried that China was building plants too close to urban areas or earthquake fault lines. In late February, just a few weeks before the crisis at Japan's Daiichi nuclear complex began to unfold, China's ministry of environmental protection announced regulations prohibiting nuclear construction near earthquake zones or major cities.
As recently as Saturday, before the gravity of the nuclear disaster in Japan was clear, a top Chinese official restated China's commitment to nuclear power.
''Some lessons we learn from Japan will be considered in the making of China's nuclear power plans,'' Zhang Lijun, vice minister for environmental protection, said then. ''But China will not change its determination and plan for developing nuclear power.''
He also said that China used a more modern design than those of Japan's stricken reactors.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Appears Firm on Interest Rate Increase

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; Raphael Minder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Is this really such a good time to raise interest rates?
This month, the European Central Bank all but promised a rate increase when its governing council meets on April 7. There is no sign, however, that the earthquake in Japan and its aftermath have dissuaded policy makers from their view that rates must rise to pre-empt inflation.
Economists say that the direct economic effects of Japan's disaster on Europe are not huge. But they warn that the prospect of a nuclear crisis, along with continued fighting in Libya and high fuel prices, could further unsettle consumers. 
''We see from consumer surveys that people don't think things are getting better,'' said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. ''People feel threatened.''
Analysts expect a rise of a quarter of a percentage point next month, which would be the first of several increases toward as much as 2 percent by the end of this year or early in 2012. The benchmark rate is now 1 percent.
Even before the crisis in Japan, many economists regarded a rate increase as ill-advised when growth in much of Europe was still slow and Spain, Ireland and other countries on the periphery of the euro zone were struggling with debt crises.
A rate increase would raise borrowing costs for those countries when they already have trouble selling debt at rates they can afford. It would also increase monthly payments for many homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages.
''An already-too-tight E.C.B. monetary policy is about to get even tighter, with potentially devastating consequences,'' Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Stamford, Conn., said in a note last week. ''We do not believe the periphery can withstand what appears to be an imminent series of E.C.B. rate hikes.''
The president of the central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has left his options open. A rate increase ''is not certain, but it is possible,'' Mr. Trichet said after the governing council's meeting on March 3.
Some analysts worry that the bank is poised to repeat the mistake it made in July 2008, when it raised the benchmark rate a quarter point, to 4.25 percent, amid a growing financial crisis. In October of that year, after the implosion of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the money markets, the central bank swiftly reversed course. By May 2009, it had lowered the rate to 1 percent, where it has remained ever since.
''They reacted in 2008 at a point where cooling was already in the pipeline,'' said Michael Heise, chief economist at the German insurer Allianz. ''That is evidence that the E.C.B. shouldn't react too aggressively.''
The bank could postpone action if the economic aftershocks from Japan worsen. But it is also possible that the central bank, with its relentless focus on inflation, could decide that it needs to act decisively to prevent shortages of energy or Japanese-made components from driving up prices.
''If anything, the effect on global commodity markets could put upward pressure on inflation as the demand for raw materials is increased by the reconstruction efforts,'' Peter Westaway, chief economist for Europe at Nomura in London, said in an e-mail. ''That could put pressure on central banks to raise rates more quickly, not less.''
It is unusual for the European Central Bank to move on rates ahead of the Federal Reserve, which on Tuesday left its benchmark rate near zero. The central bank is also ahead of the Bank of England, which has kept rates steady even though inflation is higher in Britain than in the euro zone.
More than for its counterparts, the central bank's prime directive is to protect price stability. So while most of the world is riveted by Japan, the bank's policy makers may focus more on the news Wednesday that inflation in the euro zone was at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in February, above the official target of around 2 percent.
''The E.C.B. will be very aware that the European Commission's latest survey shows rising consumer inflation expectations and rising company pricing expectations,'' said Howard Archer, chief European and British economist at IHS Global Insight in London. ''We doubt that the horrific and tragic events in Japan will deter the E.C.B. from acting.''
Members of the governing council may also believe that their credibility is on the line. During the last two years the central bank has supported banks by providing unlimited short-term loans at 1 percent interest, and it has prevented a meltdown in the sovereign debt market by buying bonds from troubled euro zone members on the open market.
Mr. Trichet has made it clear that the central bank wants political leaders to carry more of the burden of safeguarding the euro. He expressed disappointment on Tuesday at their efforts so far: After European Union finance ministers agreed to toughen fiscal rules for euro zone governments, he dismissed the proposals as ''insufficient.''
Whether intentional or not, a rate increase would be a signal to European leaders that the central bank has its own priorities. Elected officials cannot expect the bank to always take the lead in dealing with the sovereign debt crisis.
''Inflationary pressure are on the horizon,'' said Dennis J. Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, ''The problem is that the E.C.B. has been very much engaged in the stability of financial markets and didn't have to worry about inflation, and now there is a conflict of interest between these two goals.''
He added, ''If the E.C.B. wants to defend its inflation-fighting credentials, it needs to send a signal.''
The central bank's critics say the bank does not need to act against inflation that is caused largely by rising oil prices, especially when European factories are still not running at capacity. Even Germany, Europe's powerhouse, has yet to recover the economic output it lost during the steep recession of 2009.
A rate increase could be particularly tough on Spain, where unemployment has soared to 20 percent and many people already struggle to meet their mortgage payments.

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Cairo's Tahrir Square, Embraces a Revolt She Once Discouraged

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
CAIRO -- The motorcade -- armored, but not overly conspicuous in the snarled traffic -- stopped at the edge of Tahrir Square on Wednesday morning, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton emerged for a stroll through the symbolic heart of an uprising that toppled an autocratic government the United States had long supported.
''To see where this revolution happened, and all that it has meant to the world, is extraordinary for me,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a scrum of security guards, journalists and curious passers-by who ambled with her for 10 minutes through the square, which was cleared of the last protesters a week ago by the army.
Mrs. Clinton's walk -- symbolic and scripted, though not announced -- reflected the fine diplomatic line that the Obama administration has had to walk as the democratic aspirations that have upturned the Arab world have given way here to wariness, in Bahrain to foreign intervention and in Libya to a merciless military suppression. 
Mrs. Clinton is the highest-ranking American official to visit Egypt since the wave of popular revolt began in Tunisia in January. That wave has eroded the pillars of American diplomacy in the region, which Mrs. Clinton, as the top American diplomat, must now try to rebuild.
Even as she embraces the changes in Egypt and in Tunisia, which she will also visit this week, the popular uprisings in Libya, Yemen and Bahrain have been met with force -- violently and, so far, successfully.
In Bahrain, the Obama administration encouraged King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa to negotiate with the protesters, but it has stood by ineffectually as the king instead invited two American allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to send troops to back up the brutal assault his security forces carried out on protesters in the capital, Manama, on Wednesday.
When Mrs. Clinton met with Egypt's interim prime minister, Essam Abdel-Aziz Sharif, who was appointed only two weeks ago, she described the challenges facing Egypt in a way that could apply equally to the Obama administration as it scrambles to cope with the region's tumult.
''I was just saying to one of the ministers that we have an expression: It's like drinking from a fire hose,'' she said on Wednesday. ''There is so much to be done.''
Mrs. Clinton, like President Obama, hesitated at first when President Hosni Mubarak's rule was threatened by the protests in Tahrir Square, but she now fully embraces the transformation in Egypt. Mrs. Clinton used her two-day visit here to praise the changes, while avoiding taking sides in the internal debate over the pace of constitutional amendments and elections.
''We don't have an opinion,'' she said on Tuesday night about the specifics of the transition. ''We have a clear message of support for what the Egyptians decide is in their own best interest.''
Egyptians will vote on Saturday in a referendum that will shape the country's post-Mubarak government. Leaders of the youth movements that forced Mr. Mubarak to step down say they are worried that the referendum is being held too soon, and some American officials privately agree. Their fear is that it will work to the advantage of the most established political organizations: the Muslim Brotherhood and the remnants of Mr. Mubarak's National Democratic Party.
Not having an opinion, though, arguably amounts to siding with the interim military government's plans for a quick transition, which some here worry could cripple democracy in its infancy. ''There's no question this is very fast,'' said a senior aide traveling with Mrs. Clinton, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe her private discussions.
The Obama administration, however, has calculated that the United States can best use its influence by expressing broad support for democracy here and elsewhere, while avoiding the details of how to achieve it. ''We have to be much more careful how much we inject ourselves,'' another senior aide said before the trip.
By design, Mrs. Clinton arrived with an announcement of millions of dollars in American economic assistance.
Mrs. Clinton herself received a stark reminder of the American legacy here -- and the work she has to do to overcome it -- when she met for two hours on Tuesday night with a group of democracy and human rights advocates in her hotel on the Nile. Gamila Ismail, a prominent politician who joined the protest movement, opened the meeting with a pointed critique of American support for Mr. Mubarak, which continued until the eve of his departure.
As much as the administration eventually pushed for Mr. Mubarak to step aside, many Egyptians remember more vividly Mrs. Clinton's remarks on Jan. 25, as street protests boiled over into an uprising. ''Our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people,'' she said then.
Hossam Bahgat, executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, who also attended the meeting with Mrs. Clinton, said Wednesday that those remarks were ''a cause for widespread disappointment and criticism in Egypt.'' At the meeting here, he said, she spoke of the ''difficult balance'' of the American role as a result of decades of diplomacy.
''She acknowledged the legitimacy of this concern,'' he added, referring to the support for Mr. Mubarak, ''but she stressed that the U.S. has done more to promote democracy in Egypt than any other country.''
Those in the meeting also raised the subjects of American support for other autocratic rulers in the region, the violence in Libya and Bahrain and the perception that the United States had failed to press for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr. Bahgat said he urged Mrs. Clinton to use the United States' ''unparalleled access'' to Egyptian military leaders to bring an end to military tribunals and the torture of detainees in the country.
He also presented her with a dossier on the last Egyptian being held at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Tariq Mahmoud al-Sawah, and told her that he should either be tried or released. ''It is an important symbolic message that the U.S. does not condone indefinite detention -- either by the Egyptian government or their own,'' he said.
Mrs. Clinton, highly visible in a bright red blazer and ever the campaigner, appeared to relish her visit to Tahrir Square. Two Egyptian employees of the American Embassy escorted her, pointing out the places where the pivotal events of January and February occurred. Many people who happened upon her entourage in the square pressed close to take pictures with cellphones. ''Wonderful to be here,'' she said, waving and shaking hands.
As she ended her stroll, a man clambered onto a planter close enough to ask her if she knew the tale of Omar, the second caliph of Islam, and the Persian assassin who was sent to kill him as he slept under a tree. When the assassin admitted his intentions and repented, Omar let him live, ''because he was just,'' the man said as her guards ushered her back to her armored Cadillac.
He then shouted, ''Thank you for walking the streets of Tahrir.''

HEADLINE: For Time Warner, A Rival to Watch

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Netflix is looking less like Web TV and more like HBO. The plans of the $11.5 billion DVD rental and online video service to branch out into original content encroach on the territory staked out by the pioneering Time Warner cable network. Given this turn of events, could Time Warner be better off acquiring its emerging rival?
That is not the obvious takeaway from the high-profile trash talk dished out by Jeffrey Bewkes, the Time Warner chief executive. He has been publicly assaulting the Netflix business model. He may be right, up to a point. Mr. Bewkes wonders how Netflix can keep charging so little when he and a few other media giants control most of the programming the service needs to acquire. 
But Netflix, run by its co-founder, Reed Hastings, has a record of defying the skeptics. It overcame those who said it wouldn't survive challenges from Blockbuster and Wal-Mart. Netflix powered through the recession, adding nearly eight million subscribers last year alone, taking it to 20 million. Time Warner's HBO meanwhile lost about 1.5 million customers, dropping its total to about 28 million.
Broadcasting exclusive programming is a natural next step. It is, after all, how HBO made its mark, with the likes of ''Sex and the City'' and ''The Sopranos.'' The dramatic series ''House of Cards,'' which Netflix is trying to buy, could be just the ticket.
To Mr. Bewkes's point, it won't be cheap. The production from Kevin Spacey and ''The Social Network'' director, David Fincher, may cost Netflix $100 million, or more than one quarter's worth of operating profit. And committing to 26 episodes of an unproven series is a big risk, though it might attract more subscribers.
It may be a necessary gamble with viewing habits changing rapidly. HBO is trying to keep up by allowing paying customers to watch on any platform they choose. But if Netflix is the next HBO -- and the distribution channel of the future -- then Time Warner might be better off owning it, too. It's a tall order given Mr. Bewkes's rhetoric and Netflix's expensive valuation of 50 times expected earnings. But it could be that Time Warner can't afford not to buy Netflix.
Junk Debt Breather
It was time for a breather anyway. Volatility is to blame for subinvestment grade companies like Toys ''R'' Us yanking more than $7 billion of debt issuance this week. But after a buoyant spell in the debt markets, the break is no disaster.
The confusion from the catastrophic events unfolding in Japan has forced investors across the globe to reassess risk. Those lending to junk-rated companies in the United States should welcome the respite from the breakneck pace experienced for most of this year. Investors already lent more than $140 billion in fresh funds to risky companies, with the once moribund leveraged loan market making up more than half the new deals.
As investors searched for extra return, the standard protections already were being sacrificed. So-called covenant-lite loans, which typified easy borrowing during the boom, accounted for 16 percent of total leveraged loan issuance this year, according to Thomson Reuters. A time-out will give enthusiastic investors a chance to reassess the balance of risk and return.
Borrowers, meanwhile, are in good shape to weather a temporary shutdown. Over the last two years, companies have taken advantage of easy money to refinance themselves. At the end of 2008, a wall of debt coming due cast a long shadow over the market. More than $800 billion was scheduled to be repaid through 2014, according to Bank of America. The bank reckons that will have shrunk to only a quarter as much by the end of this year.
Toys ''R'' Us, for one, hardly looked desperate. A $500 million outstanding bond matures this year, but not until August. Moreover, the bulk of its $1.1 billion deal reprices an existing loan that doesn't mature until 2016, according to KDP Advisors.
A forced closing of any credit market will rightly unnerve participants, who won't have forgotten the lengthy paralysis induced by the subprime financial crisis. But borrowers and lenders are both in better shape to cope with the situation now. The pause might even help cool things down and recalibrate risk expectations when activity restarts.

HEADLINE: Exodus From Tokyo

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and KEN BELSON; Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The crisis at the nuclear power plant 140 miles north of here is leading to a steady but orderly departure of business executives from Tokyo. Foreigners in particular are among those leaving, as concerns grow about the possibility of a catastrophic release of radiation and governments urge their citizens to consider seeking safety elsewhere in Japan or overseas.
Much as in 2003, when the SARS virus slowed business around Asia, a peculiar psychology has taken hold in Tokyo, where businessmen with the wherewithal are weighing whether to decamp to cities south and west of Tokyo -- or wait and see whether the nuclear emergency escalates further.
The confusion, in addition to the distraction of relocating employees, is preventing some companies from addressing urgent problems in shattered plants and facilities along the northeastern coast of the main island, Honshu, which was ravaged by the earthquake and tsunami last week. 
And the oppressive atmosphere of fear has made concentrating on even routine tasks difficult. Meetings are being canceled, salesmen have given up visiting clients and stores are cutting back hours or closing entirely. Getting a table in even the most popular restaurants has suddenly become easier.
There are no open signs of panic on the streets of Tokyo. But executives from a growing number of banks, law firms, consultants and other businesses have started to rent space in Osaka or Fukuoka or other cities farther from the badly damaged nuclear reactors.
With thousands of Japanese also fleeing the quake-stricken areas in the north, travel on domestic airlines and bullet trains headed away from northern Japan has climbed, and rooms in hotels considered out of harm's way are filling up.
In many cases, the Tokyo evacuees are expatriates, often prompted by their governments' embassies, which have recommended that their citizens seek shelter elsewhere as a precaution. The German government, for instance, advised its citizens in Tokyo and areas north either to leave the country or head to the Osaka area. The United States Embassy said it would help fly American citizens in Japan to safer places. Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Australia are among the other countries whose governments have told their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo and to refrain from traveling to Japan's northeast. France has asked Air France to mobilize extra planes for evacuations.
Two Czech military planes landed in Prague on Thursday morning after evacuating 106 people from Japan, mostly Czechs but also several nationals of Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Korea, the Associated Press reported. Also onboard were 41 members of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra that had been touring Japan since March 6, as well as 11 children.
China has already evacuated more than 3,000 nationals from Japan's north coast to Niigata in the west, Xinhua News agency reported.
Japanese authorities have responded to these various moves by urging governments not to sound alarmist. But Japanese companies, too, have started to move some of their employees -- or give them the option of working from home. The reaction is partly in response to the reduction in train service in the Tokyo region caused by rolling blackouts that are meant to conserve energy.
The French nuclear power operator Areva is one of many companies moving workers and their families away from areas affected by the disaster or the possible path of radioactive fallout. Eighteen of the firm's 100 employees, including Americans and Germans, left a mission they were on at the Fukishima nuclear plant when the earthquake hit, a spokeswoman said.
Since the weekend, Areva has been relocating the families of expatriate workers who want to leave Tokyo to the Kyushu region in the south, although employees considered most vital to operations have been asked to stay in the city.
Many other companies are responding in one of three ways: giving employees the option of leaving the area; moving some staff to Osaka while maintaining a skeleton staff in Tokyo, or shutting down operations in Tokyo and setting up elsewhere.
The law firm Jones Day, for instance, has shut its Tokyo office except to deal with urgent court filings. Chartis, the Japanese division of A.I.G., has moved some of its managers from Tokyo to its regional command center in Osaka. The bulk of companies, though, are letting workers decide for themselves whether to go or stay.
SAP, the German software giant, which has about 1,000 employees in Tokyo, has instructed all employees to work from home for now. The company has also given them the option of moving to hotel rooms in Kobe or Osaka, at company expense, if they choose, and to take their families with them.
An SAP spokeswoman, Angelika Pfahler, said the company took the measure shortly after the earthquake hit for safety reasons, although company headquarters here did not suffer any serious damage. Because it is a software company, it is possible for SAP to continue to operate almost normally even when workers are at remote locations, she said.
Martin Reilly, 43, an Irish software designer who works for the French insurance giant AXA, said his company had given employees the option to move, while keeping enough people in Tokyo to maintain operations. Though he said he was not fearful, Mr. Reilly was nevertheless taking the precaution of traveling to Osaka.
''I'm taking my work with me, and I can be back in three hours when this is cleared up,'' Mr. Reilly said at Tokyo Station before boarding a train. ''I think the chances of something happening are very small. But my parents are going ballistic. If I don't go, my mother's going to get on a plane and come take me away.''
The clothing retailer H&M has temporarily closed its nine stores in the Tokyo region because its employees had difficulty getting to work and were on edge while the nuclear crisis continued, said Mie Anton, a spokeswoman for the company. The planned opening of a store on Saturday has been postponed.
The disruption could provide an extra blow to Japan's economy because so much of the nation's business takes place in the capital, although it is too early to quantify the effect on consumer spending and business investment.
Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said some companies were clearly taking the initiative in leaving the city, particularly in the foreign community. But short of an evacuation order, most people will remain in the city because so far, ''it's hard to judge just how dangerous it is,'' he said.
Most Japanese residents, he said, ''have nowhere to hide.''
The growing number of departures, sometimes with little warning, has in some cases worsened the tensions that often divide local and expatriate staff. The International Bankers Association, which represents foreign financial institutions in Tokyo, said in a statement that its 59 member institutions were operating ''business as usual.'' But privately, spokesmen for major Western banks said that many of their employees had chosen to take vacations now until there was more clarity on the situation.
While economic activity in Tokyo has slowed, business in cities like Osaka has picked up, a welcome development -- despite the circumstances -- given the sluggish economy.
Shuhei Otsuka, 24, an employee of the railroad operator JR-East at Tokyo Station, compared the number of Japanese riders in the last few days with the New Year's holiday rush or the summer vacation travel peak.
Many of the Japanese travelers were families, or mothers with children, while the number of businessmen traveling was about normal, Mr. Otsuka said. Domestic travel agents said that reservations for flights to the islands of Kyushu and Okinawa surged starting Tuesday.
Bookings at hotels that cater to the well-heeled and to expatriates have picked up as well. Many customers who have arrived this week appeared to have left their homes in a rush, said Matsuko Akesaka, a spokeswoman for the Ritz-Carlton in Osaka. Many guests have booked rooms -- which start at 58,000 yen, or $720 -- for only a few nights until they decide whether it is safe to return.
''Business is nothing like during the bubble economy, but compared to the last few years, it's picked up'' in the last few days, she said, noting that her hotel had set up a playroom for children who had accompanied their parents.
Some companies are planning to stay in cities like Osaka and Kobe for far longer. Demand for office space at full-service backup operations providers like Regus and Servcorp has surged as companies set up or expand their remote operations outside the Tokyo area, said Brett Jensen, account manager for west Japan at the Osaka office of Colliers International, a real estate broker.
Other companies are expanding existing offices in Osaka and elsewhere, or signing new leases for office space.
''The nuclear issue is one of the main drivers, but there is also concern about the ability to have a stable supply of electricity even after the nuclear issue is resolved,'' Mr. Jensen said. Thousands of workers could temporarily relocate to Osaka, he said, and many could remain long-term as companies decide to diversify their risks.
The influx of newcomers has been noticeable in central Osaka in recent days. Ken Shimabuku, who works for a large executive search firm in Osaka, said he had been surprised Tuesday by the number of people carrying suitcases through the streets. ''It was so obvious that people were going away,'' he said. ''Not just foreigners, the ones coming to Osaka, but the Japanese.''

HEADLINE: Funds Find Opportunities In Volatility

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
For Jason Adler, it doesn't matter whether the market goes up. Or down. What matters is that it goes.
While other investors have been getting whipsawed by the roller-coaster action in global markets since the earthquake struck Japan a week ago, there are rich pickings these days for Mr. Adler, who runs a $275 million hedge fund that bets on volatility.
''Markets like these create opportunities,'' said Mr. Adler, sitting in the spartan quarters of the firm he co-founded, Alphabet Management, just off Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.
Outside his office, eight traders were hunched over their desks, some eating bananas and others guzzling coffee. Their eyes flicked rapidly between multiple computer terminals that display headlines, securities data feeds and price charts. 
Volatility funds like Alphabet look for small discrepancies in the prices of everything from stock market futures and options to equity indexes, jumping in when they think the market has misjudged the price.
And in markets like these where buy-and-sell decisions are more often driven by scary headlines or fear, traders at Alphabet say they are finding a lot of appealing bets.
''We've done well this week,'' Mr. Adler said. He declined to give any specific data about his performance over the last few days. But Alphabet surged 26 percent last year and was up 4.4 percent for the year through the end of February, according to an investor letter.
A major barometer of investor sentiment about volatility in United States equities markets, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX index, soared 46 percent to a high of 29.40 on Wednesday from just above 20 when the earthquake hit Japan. The last time volatility was this high was last June, shortly after the flash crash. Still, volatility is well below its record high in November 2008, during the height of the financial crisis.
Since the earthquake and tsunami first hit Japan's shores a week ago, the Nikkei 225 index has lost about 10 percent; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has slid 1.65 percent; and the Japanese yen had jumped 4.5 percent before intervention by the Group of 7 leading industrial nations pushed it back down.
While some hedge funds have been able to make hay out of the broad swings in the global equities, currencies and commodities markets, many others scrambled this week to limit damage on money-losing trades. For example, many funds were betting against the Japanese yen because of the country's longstanding economic problems, only to be caught short when the yen soared as Japanese companies raced to bring cash home.
But, of course, others were putting on new bets, particularly against uranium, a main ingredient in nuclear-fuel production, based on their belief that nuclear power may fall out of favor.
''It's a pretty safe bet if there's money to be made, hedge funds will be on the scene,'' said Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies hedge funds.
Before a conference call of Group of 7 leaders on Thursday evening, many traders were betting that the United States and other major industrial nations would intervene to prop up the global economy, which they did after the call. That move should bolster prices for stocks and commodities, Mr. Lo said.
Several hedge fund managers said that the trading this week reminded them of the panicked period in the fall of 2008 as well as the volatile time a year ago when anxiety about European sovereign debt soared. And in a virtual repeat of those days, investors this week sold assets that they perceived to be riskier, like stocks, and sought out safer places for their cash, like United States Treasury bills.
Patrick Welton, chief executive of the Welton Investment Corporation, a hedge fund in Carmel, Calif., that focuses on short-term trends, said the ''fear effect'' drove much of the sell-off in markets across the world all week long. ''With the fear effect,'' Mr. Welton said, ''The first move is to always reduce risk and bring money home.''
Mr. Welton said the models on one of his hedge funds that follow trends spotted price discrepancies among stocks in different industries and in different countries. Those trades, he said, paid off. On the other hand, Mr. Welton had another hedge fund that was long on commodities and lost money on that bet as those markets dropped this week.
For many volatility funds, the last couple of years have been tough -- a handful closed at the end of last year while others merged. All told, industry insiders estimate that there are about 40 dedicated funds that focus on volatility, although figures do not exist for how much they have under management.
A longtime options trader, Mr. Adler started Alphabet in October of 2007 with six people and $11 million of their own money.
Mr. Adler grimaced slightly when asked about the name, explaining that the fund was really ''AlphaBet,'' a play on a hedge-fund metric that measures return.
''Some people thought it was a bad idea to have the word 'bet' in the fund,'' said Mr. Adler, shrugging, ''but it is what we do.''
After a few wild days this week, Alphabet's chief investment officer, Nelson Saiers, said cooler heads appeared to be prevailing Thursday as volatility levels in several markets fell slightly.
''The world is a lot less scared today,'' he notes, pushing back his chair and rocking slightly. Still, Japanese markets aren't in the clear yet, he said.
By his own calculations (he got his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Virginia when he was 23), Mr. Saiers says volatility levels on Japan's Nikkei are up about 250 percent since the earthquake hit, essentially at the same level they were at in 2008, which suggests investors still expect a lot of ups and downs there.
Suddenly, he broke off the conversation to scour a list of securities that lands on his desk.
''The 16 puts on Cisco are offered at 71 cents. We should buy 1,000,'' he says to a trader sitting across the desk, referring to the options bought when investors think a stock will fall. After a brief pause, the trader responds: ''Done. 1095.''
Smiling, Mr. Saiers adds, ''It's a great environment out there.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about hedge funds that prosper during times of sharp market swings misidentified the organization that created the VIX index of market volatility. It is the Chicago Board Options Exchange, not the Chicago Board of Trade.

BUDGET REQUEST Gary Gensler, below, the top regulator of the derivatives industry, told lawmakers on Thursday that his agency needed more money to help prevent another financial crisis.
In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Gensler called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ''a good investment for the American public, overseeing vast markets with a relatively small staff.'' Although the White House agrees with Mr. Gensler, Congressional Republicans are weighing severe cuts to the agency's budget. BEN PROTESS 
TALKS DELAYED A plan to force the nation's biggest mortgage firms into helping millions of homeowners avoid foreclosure was supposed to take two months to complete. The timeline, it turns out, was overly optimistic.
The effort, endorsed by the Obama administration and an assortment of state regulators, is facing modest delays in the face of opposition from banks and Congressional Republicans. ''There haven't been any formal negotiations at this point,'' said Iowa's attorney general, Tom Miller, who is leading the effort. BEN PROTESS
OFFERING POSTPONED The Danish global services company ISS announced late Thursday that it would postpone its initial public offering -- the latest company to scuttle its stock plans amid the global uncertainty.
Despite the recent turmoil, ISS and its chief executive, Jeff Gravenhorst, above, seemed close to pulling off a deal. The offering, the company said, was oversubscribed with interest from 150 institutions worldwide and 10,000 retail investors in Denmark.
HIGHER VALUATION The social shopping site Groupon, which recently spurned a $6 billion offer from Google, has held discussions with Goldman Sachs about a possible initial public offering that could value the company at close to $25 billion, according to a person close to the matter.
At $25 billion, Groupon's valuation would top Google's $23 billion market value when it went public in August 2004. EVELYN M. RUSLI

HEADLINE: Bullets Stall Youthful Push for an Arab Spring

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nadim Audi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MANAMA, Bahrain -- These days, Muhammad al-Maskati is a prisoner in his apartment, his BlackBerry shut off by the government, the streets outside his apartment filled with tanks, the hospitals around town packed with the wounded.
Mr. Maskati is a 24-year-old human rights activist who not long ago felt so close to achieving Egypt's kind of peaceful revolution, through a dogged commitment to nonviolence. Then the Saudi tanks rolled into Bahrain, and protesters came under attack, the full might of the state hammering at unarmed civilians.
''We thought it would work,'' Mr. Maskati said, his voice soft with depression, yet edged with anger. ''But now, the aggression is too much. Now it's not about the protest anymore, it's about self-defense.''
The Arab Spring is not necessarily over, but it has run up against dictators willing to use lethal force to preserve their power. The youth-led momentum for change stalled first in Libya, where Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi unleashed troops on his people, and then in Bahrain, where King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa enlisted Saudi Arabia's help to crush demonstrations. 
Bahrain's protests were part of a transformation sweeping the Middle East, propelled by young people free of the fear that held back their parents.
At first, they seemed an unstoppable force, driven by the power of demographics -- about 60 percent of the population across the Arab world is under the age of 30. They started to reshape societies where the young defer to the old, toppling old hierarchies along with governments.
The movement is still forcing change in places like Morocco and Jordan, guiding transitions in Egypt and Tunisia, and playing out in countries like Algeria and Yemen. Young people remain out front, wielding the online tools they grew up with to mobilize protests, elude surveillance and cross class lines.
This generation's access to a life without borders through the Internet and pan-Arab television networks like Al Jazeera exposed them to other societies, fueling anger at the repressive politics and economic stagnation that deprived the region's youth of opportunity and freedom.
It was long anticipated that young people would emerge as a powerful force because the median age across the Middle East is just 26. But what surprised many was the absence of religious discourse -- and the embrace of pluralism -- from a generation that is more observant than its parents and often seeks solace from despotic rulers and blighted lives in an embrace of Islam.
This generation rejected traditional opposition leaders, like the toothless political parties that served dictators by providing a veneer of democratic legitimacy, or the Muslim Brotherhood, which many came to see as having been co-opted by the status quo.
Young people interviewed across the region echoed the same ideas, tactics and motivations that set off revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. In Morocco and Jordan, monarchs have already offered concessions, fueling excitement and hope. It is a force driven by young men like Tarek al-Naimat, 26, of Jordan, who joined Facebook a few weeks ago, saying that it was a more powerful tool than the Muslim Brotherhood.
And Oussama el-Khlifi, 23, who left the Socialist Union of Popular Forces in Morocco to found a nonideological movement -- initially organized on Facebook -- that has already rallied unmatched numbers in the streets of Morocco and pressed the king to announce plans to modify the constitution.
''We saw change would not happen through the parties, it would happen through the people,'' Mr. Khlifi said. ''We created a Facebook group called Moroccans Discuss the King, and in four or five days we had 3,000 members.''
The early victories in Tunisia and Egypt emboldened them. ''I grew up in a world where we believed we could not do anything,'' said Mariam Abu Adas, 32, an online activist in Jordan who helped create a company called Hiber to train young people to use social media.
''Generations believed we could do nothing,'' she said, ''and now, in a matter of weeks, we know that we can.''
It is a new model for the Middle East, not only because the young people are taking the lead, but because their elders have started to listen and follow.
''The youth, we were afraid of, but we have come to see the youth are moving the region,'' said Mustafa Rawashdeh, a former headmaster at a school in Karak, Jordan, who was fired after trying to form a teachers' union. ''Young people saw the winds of change and drove us.''
And then Colonel Qaddafi's forces opened fire, followed by King Hamad's crackdown. The young activists' idealism has been challenged by the bitter reality of repression, leaving them dispirited but resolute.
It is a sobering pause, as Bahrainis tend their wounded and Libya's opposition flees from the advance of pro-Qaddafi forces. The future of the Arab Spring is at stake.
''I don't believe the peaceful protests will go on,'' Mr. Maskati said. ''Now, it's about resisting the aggression.''
Jordan
The women at Ammon News stood firm when the Jordanian authorities told them to take down a daring post critical of the monarchy and, in particular, Queen Rania -- a taboo in a nation where criticizing the royal family is a crime punishable by three years in prison. The authorities promptly hijacked the Web site, and the staff's editor told them to give up and go home. Instead, the women took to the streets in protest, and the authorities backed down.
''It was the principle,'' said Ala Alyan, 22. ''Liberty is very important.''
The incident hardly registered beyond the borders of Jordan, a close American ally. But it illustrates the contagion of a movement determined not to allow its governments to treat its citizens as subjects.
Jordan's King Abdullah II is not facing the kind of popular revolt that forced out the presidents of Egypt and Tunisia. But there have been demonstrations that prompted the king to fire the cabinet, appoint a new government and promise constitutional change. The open question, as in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, is how far change will go, and whether young people will be satisfied.
''If you feel you have right on your side, you do not have fear,'' said Heba Alazari, 26, one of the Ammon News women who protested. ''If an injustice happened before, no one knew about it. Now you can deliver your voice in a different way and everyone will know.''
In the Jordanian countryside, the cyberworld and the real world intersect. The staff of Hiber, the social media training and blogging organization, recently visited the village of Tafilah, two hours south of the capital, Amman. It is a small, dry outpost of cinder-block and white-stone homes on rocky soil, with a traffic circle, a few shops and lot of young people. Every woman on the street was veiled, and fathers sternly police their daughters.
About 35 young people in the workshop run by Hiber, more than half of them women, were eager to learn more. ''The people in Egypt, who used these tools, woke up after 30 years,'' said Rasha Garabaa, 25, who wore a bright red head scarf and heavy makeup.
Ramsey Tesdell, 27, who was leading the discussion, said that social media allowed young women in the village to bypass the men -- fathers, brothers, husbands -- who circumscribed their worlds and their ability to communicate. They cannot go to the park unaccompanied and meet friends, but they can join a chat room or send instant messages.
''In a lot of ways, it has taken the power away from the traditional powerful leaders, especially older men,'' Mr. Tesdell said.
Ms. Garabaa understood, and marveled at the changes. ''Remember how they closed Ammon the other day,'' she said, almost in a whisper, to one of the other members of the group. ''Think how much the Internet can empower you. You have the world at the tip of your fingers.''
Morocco
The secret password was tsk-tsk-tsk, and the door opened into the Feb. 20th movement.
Inside a run-down apartment at the top of narrow darkened staircase, Montasser Drissi, 19, was listening to traditional Moroccan music and working on subtitles for a protest video. He was one of the young men who helped organize nationwide protests on Feb. 20 that drew tens of thousands of demonstrators in a show of opposition that has already begun to change Morocco's political landscape.
''Our goal is a new constitution that serves the people, not the elite,'' said Mr. Drissi, a slight, understated young man with a dab of a beard.
The Feb. 20th movement is the loosely knit Moroccan manifestation of the youth fever sweeping the region. Its members met on Facebook and decided that like their peers in Egypt and Tunisia, they wanted to fight for change. Their goal was not to oust the monarchy, but to reduce its near absolute authority and strengthen elected institutions.
''We are young, we study, we have jobs -- we're normal,'' said Yassine Falah, 23, who recently quit his job selling insurance and moved from Fez to Rabat to dedicate his time to the movement. ''We tried hard to not politicize the thing, we used Facebook, we came together and that's how it started. Our spontaneity is our strength.''
The government was concerned from the start. It tried to blunt the movement's impact, first by trying to demonize its young leaders as enemies of the state, and then, when that failed, taking the creative approach of announcing that the demonstration was canceled. But that did not work either. Instead, traditional opposition parties that initially shunned the upstart movement jumped in, trying to ride the wave churned up by the young.
King Mohammed VI apparently got the message and in a rare nationally televised speech announced that he intended to meet some of the group's core demands -- without ever actually acknowledging that the group existed.
The group helped break down barriers to join secular leftists with conservative Islamists in the fight for democracy. ''In Morocco, there has always been a war between the left and the Islamists, and the state wants it that way,'' said Younes Belghazi, 20, as he flopped onto a mattress on the floor. ''When the state saw we had agreed on basic things, like values, change, democracy, they just didn't know what to do.''
Over in the corner, in what passes for the group's video studio -- a white sheet taped to the tile wall and a camera on a tripod -- Mr. Drissi's new friend and collaborator, Nizar Bennamate, 23, was discussing how the movement planned another national protest on March 20. The challenge was to maintain momentum, difficult for a leaderless organization whose members often could not agree on when to meet, or even exactly what it was they were fighting for.
''The demands we talk about are the lowest common denominator, the first stage,'' Mr. Bennamate said. ''Once we get these demands, we will be at an early stage of democracy where different ideas can confront each other.''
The group's secret headquarters was discovered recently by the police, who have also visited the homes of some of the organizers in an attempt at intimidation. But that also seems to be a sign of their power and success.
''I am an activist because I want change,'' said Mr. Khlifi, an unemployed high school graduate who has become one of the leading voices in the movement. ''I want a political dialogue. I want to criticize. I want democracy. I want the people to have power.''
Bahrain
Mr. Maskati struggled to force out each painful word: ''They. Shot. The. People.'' Bahrain's army had just opened fire on demonstrators and he was trying to type out ''Urgent from Bahrain'' on his BlackBerry and post a video link of the attack to Twitter, Facebook and the extensive e-mail list of his human rights organization.
For years, Mr. Maskati was dismissed as naive for trying to convince people that peaceful protests would be more effective than violence. And then, suddenly, the protesters so embraced his view that a group walked into an army roadblock, hands in the air, chanting ''peacefully, peacefully.''
Nearly a month ago, the army opened fire, killing a young man after six were killed by the police. But the protesters clung to nonviolence, taking to the streets in remarkably large numbers, confident that international attention would force the government to stop shooting. The government did back down, offer concessions, release political prisoners, call for a national dialogue and shuffle the cabinet.
Mr. Maskati marveled at the radical change in approach after years of watching young people throw rocks and burn tires in the street, to no avail.
He founded the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, a small monitoring and training organization that is one part of a youth-led movement that has posed the most serious challenge to the monarchy since the Khalifa family took power in the 18th century. Mr. Maskati's main weapons are his phone and his BlackBerry. He does not organize protests and he does not protest himself. He sees his role as informing the world through Facebook, Twitter and his extensive e-mail list.
From Feb. 14, the start of the demonstrations, Mr. Maskati was always on the scene, dodging the police, hovering at the periphery, posting updates to the Internet. He was one of the first to notify the world that the police had shot and killed a 21-year-old man. ''Mr. Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima was killed by the riot police in Daih village.( 8:00 PM, 14 FEB. 2011 ),'' his message said. ''Ali was not involved in the demonstration, but went out of his house to see what happens in his village.''
The death galvanized the community of mainly Shiite protesters, and they turned out by the thousands for the funeral. At the cemetery, mourners did more than fume. They had a laptop computer and a wireless airstick, and as the young man's body was lowered into the ground, the image was immediately uploaded to the Internet.
''They did a big mistake,'' said Hussein Ramadan, 32, a manager in the local aluminum plant, as he stood at the edge of the grave. ''They will pay for it, peacefully. We are not thinking about any violence. People are angry. But we can control our anger. We tried violence before, now we try the other way. We are ready to give our blood. It is our country.''
Mr. Maskati is from a wealthy Shiite family, part of the Shiite majority in Bahrain that has smoldered under a repressive Sunni monarchy. He became interested in human rights work when he was 14, but he said he found his calling in 2006 after attending a training course in Jordan with Otpor, a Serbian youth movement that also inspired the Egyptian activists, and then in Washington with the Center for Nonviolence.
The next year, he founded his own group. He continues to monitor the events in Bahrain and post his observations each day. Last week, Mr. Maskati and two other human rights activists received death threats because of their work. But Mr. Maskati was undeterred and instead sent word of the death threats out on Twitter, Facebook and e-mail and to every blogger he knew.
Then the tanks rolled in, and on Thursday the police began rounding up opposition leaders. Mr. Maskati kept sending messages until Wednesday morning, when his phone number was shut off. He stayed home, using his computer, issuing updates always titled ''Urgent from Bahrain.''

 BODY:
ARRIVAL CITY
How the Largest Migration in History Is Reshaping Our World
By Doug Saunders
356 pages. Pantheon $27.95.
Doug Saunders's first book, ''Arrival City,'' reads like a special issue of The Economist, that estimable weekly, in ways that are mostly good but sometimes not. You can envision its subtitle stamped in 18-point type on the magazine's cover: ''How the Largest Migration in History Is Reshaping Our World.''
Serious, mightily researched, lofty and humane, ''Arrival City'' is packed with salient detail and could hardly be more timely. Mr. Saunders, the European bureau chief for the Toronto newspaper The Globe and Mail, visits the world's great sprawling shantytowns and slums -- he prefers the term arrival cities -- on the outskirts of places like Mumbai, Rio, London, Paris, Chongqing and Los Angeles and speaks eloquently for them. 
He presents these fringe worlds not as fetid ghettos or pots of simmering radicalism. Instead, he argues, they are kilns of reverberating energy and optimism where the world's rural downtrodden seek a foothold in the modern world. These people -- losers to too many of us, though not to themselves or to those they left behind in small villages -- wish to receive the developed world's simplest yet most grace-filled benediction: a chance, through hard work, to enter the flowing middle class. We frustrate their desires at our economic, social and moral peril.
Mr. Saunders's optimistic book, which draws on the work of economists, sociologists and urban planners, feels as important in its way as was Jane Jacobs's ''Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' published in 1961. It feels like a game changer; it should certainly be a policy changer. He makes it plain that these arrival cities need nurturing, in the form of transportation (paved roads, bus terminals) security, sewage treatment, education and, vitally, citizenship for their people. They assuredly don't need restrictive zoning laws and xenophobic stabs at urban renewal.
At its cellular level ''Arrival City'' is a first-rate taxonomy of a polyglot, under-examined slice of humanity. ''Arrival cities are known around the world by many names,'' the author writes. ''Slums, favelas, bustees, bidonvilles, ashwaiyyat, shantytowns, kampongs, urban villages, gecekondular, and barrios of the developing world, but also as the immigrant neighborhoods, ethnic districts, banlieues difficiles, Plattenbau developments, Chinatowns, Little Indias, Hispanic quarters.''
These places are slowly mopping up the world's remaining rural peasants, in a way that benefits both the cities and villages left behind. The new urban dwellers lift the economies of cities and help their villages by wiring money home. ''Each year, rural Bangladesh receives almost $11 billion in remittances from migrants and their descendants living abroad,'' Mr. Saunders writes, ''a sum equivalent to all of Bangladesh's export earnings.''
Arrival cities ''are not causing population growth; in fact, they are ending it,'' he notes. ''When villagers migrate to the city, their family size drops.''
Mr. Saunders's book has its share of piquant details. He is amusing on how, in many arrival cities, the cable-TV man -- the ''cable-wallah,'' in Mumbai -- is a man of power and influence. Running water and sewage utilities may be hard to come by. Cable television is not, if you know the man to see.
''Arrival City,'' a worthy book in so many ways, is too often flat and dully reportorial, in a manner that is wearying over the long haul. This book gets longer, for sure, though whether it gets deeper is debatable. It lacks not thesis but synthesis, and not irony with a capital I but irony with that crucial lower-case one. It lacks wit, and by that I don't mean humor -- I mean prickly, penetrating sentences, texture and insight.
This book may be as important as ''Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' but unlike it you will probably not wish to read ''Arrival City'' twice.
Mr. Saunders makes, to my mind, two crucial mistakes. The first is to include, with almost every analysis of a discrete slum or shantytown, a genial profile of one of its residents. This seems like a good idea, until you commence to read these profiles -- they're too pat, and lack edges that can't be tidied up with a few cliches about seeking a better life. Worse, he quotes his subjects at length, and every quotation sounds the same, shorn of idiomatic expression. I'm not suggesting the author made these long quotations up. But perception, in these matters, matters as much as reality. It sounds as if he made them up.
A second mistake was to avoid the vibrant body of world literature that has emerged around, and about, these great migrations. If Mr. Saunders has read Zadie Smith or Monica Ali or Gary Shteyngart, to name just the first three novelists who come to mind, he's not letting us in on that fact. He needn't engage in literary criticism. But you can open to almost any page of Ms. Smith's novel ''White Teeth'' (2000) and find lines that touch, savagely and perceptively, on the material at hand.
Here's Ms. Smith in ''White Teeth,'' for example, on the dislocation of life in an arrival city: ''Even when you arrive, you're still going back and forth; your children are going round and round. There're no proper term for it -- original sin seems too harsh; maybe original trauma would be better.'' It's impossible to blame Mr. Saunders for not being able to write sentences so searing. You can blame him for not citing some of them as electric and pertinent human evidence.

HEADLINE: Florida Attracts 2.8 Million Over Decade

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Overcoming the effects of high unemployment and a crashed housing market, Florida attracted 2.8 million new residents in the last decade, according to census data released Thursday.
The state's population growth of 17.6 percent represented the seventh straight decade of double-digit gains, far outpacing the national growth rate in the last decade of 9.7 percent, demographers said.
Florida's minority populations also surged. 
In the last decade, the state's Hispanic population jumped 57.4 percent to 4.2 million and now comprises 22.5 percent of the state's population.
The number of black residents increased by 25 percent to 2.85 million; African-Americans now comprise 15.2 percent of the state's population. Whites, who now represent 57.9 percent of the state's population, saw the lowest growth, of 4.1 percent, a dip from the 10.4 percent increase in the previous decade. However, that modest increase was higher than the national average, demographers said.
''When we look at how Florida grew, it was driven primarily by migration, particularly by domestic migration from other parts of the United States,'' said Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the Carsey Institute and professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire. ''That was an important force, although it did slow down at the end of the decade.''
Florida's census data tells the story of two distinctly different economic cycles. In the first half of the decade, the state's booming economy attracted huge numbers of new people to the state, and those gains were not erased when the economy came crashing down in 2007 and 2008 with high unemployment and a record number of foreclosures.
For example, in both 2005 and 2006, the state's population grew by residents resettling from other parts of the country by roughly 260,000. But as the recession took hold here, the migratory number reversed and 35,000 fewer people moved to Florida from 2008 to 2009. The number increased slightly in 2010.
The state's growth to 18.8 million residents is reflected in the decision to increase the size of Florida's 25-seat Congressional delegation to 27. The State Legislature's Republicans will use the data next January to redraw Congressional and state legislative districts.
But demographers say if the state's growth had not been ravaged by the economic downturn, the Congressional delegation would have grown to 28 seats.
''Florida probably lost a Congressional seat because of the recession,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''When that migration dramatically slowed -- or reversed -- there were fewer opportunities, thus Florida's migration gains came to a dramatic halt. If you live by migration, you die by migration.''
The new data also show the decade's early housing boom followed by the mortgage meltdown and pronounced spike in foreclosures that have crippled the state's economy.
In the last decade, nearly 1.7 million new housing units were built to a total of 8.9 million. But over the same period, the number of vacant houses surged by 603,760 to 1.5 million, an increase of nearly 63 percent.
The largest gains in residents occurred in central Florida, which is the region of the state that political analysts say is the most likely to benefit from redistricting.
Orange County was a large-population county with the highest spike in population over the past decade, adding 1,145,956 residents for a growth rate of 27.8 percent, the data showed.
Flagler County, north of Daytona Beach, was the fastest-growing county, with an increase of 92 percent to 95,696. Also in central Florida, Sumter County, northwest of Orlando, increased 75 percent to 93,420 and Osceola County, just south of Orlando, grew 56 percent to 268,685
Growth rates slowed in south Florida's most densely populated two counties -- Miami-Dade and Broward. The city of Miami, where rapid growth was one of the engines of the state's thriving economy in the first half of the decade, grew to 399,457 people, an increase of 10.2 percent from 2000 to 2010.

HEADLINE: S.R.O. Hotel Managers Question Their Obligations to the Police

BYLINE: By SHOSHANA WALTER. 
swalter@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
When Virgilio Candari bought the Luz Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco in 2004, he replaced the dirty mattresses, painted the walls and increased the rates.
Then he did what he knew all other S.R.O. managers did: he started helping the police.
Mr. Candari and nine other operators of single room occupancy hotels in the city told The Bay Citizen that they regularly provided the police with access to hotel registries, receipts, surveillance videos and keys.
The police say they regularly use the information (and the keys) to conduct narcotics investigations at many of the city's 530 residential hotels, about half of them packed into drug-riddled sections of the South of Market and Tenderloin neighborhoods.
Now the relationship between S.R.O. operators and the police has come under federal scrutiny. Earlier this month, Public Defender Jeff Adachi released hotel surveillance videos that he said proved that the police had systematically violated the civil rights of hotel residents. 
The videos, which appear to show officers using master keys to enter and search rooms illegally, without a warrant or consent, have prompted an F.B.I. investigation and the dismissal of nearly 70 pending criminal cases.
Eight police officers have been implicated in alleged misconduct, and the department has suspended the Southern Station plainclothes unit and transferred its members to administrative duties, pending the completion of an internal investigation. Depending on the outcome of the investigations, the officers could face criminal charges.
Managers like Mr. Candari, who often summon officers to their hotels, are now questioning their relationships with the police.
''I want to be fully cooperative with them because, after all, they're the police. They're the good people,'' Mr. Candari said. ''I guess what I want to know is, when they come into a hotel, what are we supposed to do?''
That, it turns out, is a very good question.
Rory Little, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said that police have the right to enter someone's room without consent or a warrant only if there are ''exigent'' or pressing circumstances, meaning that someone's life is in immediate danger or that evidence is in the process of being destroyed.
''When someone pays rent on a hotel room, it becomes their little house,'' said Mr. Little, a former prosecutor. ''People have a right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure in their houses.''
Jeff Godown, interim chief of the San Francisco Police Department, agreed with Mr. Little in principle. He said officers are not trained to ask for master keys, but that they are often within their legal rights to do so.
If an officer hears screams and gunfire or knows that a suspect is aware that officers are there and is flushing drugs down the toilet, Mr. Godown said, the police are allowed to announce themselves and force their way into the room. Most managers prefer officers to use master keys instead of destroying hotel doors.
''The fact that the officers didn't have a search warrant does not necessarily mean they did something wrong,'' Mr. Godown said. ''There are instances when a passkey would be appropriate.''
Still, the threshold for what would justify a warrantless search is not very clear-cut. Toilet-flushing, after all, is not necessarily a clear indicator of untoward activity.
Mr. Adachi has gone a step further, asserting that hotel managers are guilty of civil right violations if they provide keys for an illegal police search. He called illegal entries a longstanding and systematic problem and urged Mr. Godown last week to adopt a policy discouraging use of the keys. Mr. Godown declined the request but this week began a refresher course for officers on search-and-seizure laws and procedures.
Mr. Little said that unless a specific provision is written into a lease agreement, managers and owners are not allowed to enter someone's room whenever they want, even if an officer commands it. Nor are they allowed to give that power to the police. Those who work in S.R.O.'s, however, say such practices are routine.
''We try not to get in their way,'' said Amit Motawala, the manager of the Eula Hotel and co-owner of the Amit Hotel in the Mission. ''If we try to say, 'Hey, where's the warrant?' it just kind of creates a situation where it seems like we're trying to hinder them from doing their job.''
The S.R.O. hotels, which have become a significant source of low-cost housing in a city where the wait for public housing is 30,000 names long, attract a wide range of people, from working professionals to the disabled and unemployed, drug addicts and parolees. The concentration of drug offenders in particular has long attracted the police.
''Everyone knows in the city that if you want to get heroin, you go to the Mission,'' said Richard Marquez, a longtime S.R.O. tenants' rights advocate. ''If you want crack cocaine, you go to the Tenderloin.''
In two recent cases cited by Mr. Adachi, the police said they had received a tip that a woman staying at a hotel was dealing drugs there. In the videos, officers appeared to obtain a master key from the front desk before entering rooms without a warrant or permission. Additional videos from the Henry Hotel also appeared to implicate officers in the false arrest of a 29- year-old visitor on charges of cocaine possession after they used a key to enter and search a tenant's room. In another video, Officer Richard Yick covers the surveillance camera with his hand for 15 seconds while the officers approach a hotel guest. The woman testified that officers forced her to open her door; she was arrested after heroin was found in her room.
Mr. Adachi said the police department's treatment of S.R.O. residents and managers exposed a double standard, and calls by The Bay Citizen to upscale hotels in the city confirmed it.
San Francisco municipal code requires hotel operators to collect guest information and to furnish it to the police upon request. A lawyer for the Fairmont Hotel confirmed that the hotel is obliged to provide the police with guest names, room numbers and any other information disclosed on a registration form.
However, front-desk managers at the Fairmont, Hyatt, Palomar and Clift hotels all said they would need to see a subpoena before sharing such information with police officers or providing a master key.
At the Luz Hotel, on the other hand, Mr. Candari, 56, has had more than his share of interactions with the police.
On a recent weekday, Mr. Candari showed a reporter the front desk, behind a pane of plastic. There he keeps the guest registry, which includes receipts, copies of driver's licenses and room numbers. He allows any officer who visits to look through the registry and surveillance videos. Thirteen cameras monitor the hotel's hallways and exterior. Until January, he said, officers had visited and asked for keys at least seven times.
But one morning last January Mr. Candari arrived to find two police officers apparently frustrated with the desk clerk, who speaks limited English.
One officer seemed to have run out of patience. Mr. Candari said that the officer pushed him against the desk and demanded a master key before going to Room 15 and arresting Deren Dusay on charges of possession of methamphetamine.
Mr. Dusay said officers had knocked but had not announced themselves, then forced their way inside the room.
Mr. Candari said he had remained downstairs, still shaken. The next day, he had a lawyer send a letter to Capt. Ann Mannix of Northern Station, requesting an apology. The police department is investigating Mr. Candari's allegations.
Mr. Candari said he wanted to protect the privacy of residents of the Luz, but like other S.R.O. managers, he had often called the police for help and knew that maintaining a good relationship was safer for his hotel.
Now, he said, he's not so sure.

HEADLINE: Movie Review 'I Am'

BYLINE: By RACHEL SALTZ

 BODY:
What's wrong with the world? What can we do about it? You might not expect these questions to haunt the mind of the director of ''Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' and ''The Nutty Professor.'' But in the painful aftermath of a cycling accident, Tom Shadyac started to think differently about his life and success. And he started asking questions. 
He traveled around, enlisting the aid of what he calls ''significant minds'' -- journalists, scientists, spiritual leaders like Desmond Tutu, scholars like Noam Chomsky -- to understand life's essential questions. ''I Am'' is his documentary about his quest.
Self-deprecating and an eager student, Mr. Shadyac makes for a likable host in this whirlwind tour of the world of big and not-so-big ideas. (He delivers the news, for example, that money does not necessarily guarantee happiness.)
Darwinism, Western mores, loneliness, the economy, the will to war: Mr. Shadyac and his significant minds consider all this and more in what sometimes seems like an enthusiastic teacher's stream-of-consciousness lesson to a restless classroom. There are even animated sequences to illustrate complicated scientific points.
But as the ideas fly by, your patience may begin to fray. It's not just that Mr. Shadyac makes big leaps and sometimes papers over contradictions. It's also that after a while everyone starts to sound the same: a little beatific, a little high on wonder, a little platitudinous. The music becomes more saccharine and the film more like an ad for wellness as Mr. Shadyac delivers his final lessons: Do something. Believe in the power of one.
I AM
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Written and directed by Tom Shadyac; director of photography, Roko Belic; edited by Jennifer Abbott; produced by Dagan Handy; released by Paladin. At the Regal Cinemas Union Square, 1 Union Square, at 14th Street, East Village. Running time: 1 hour 16 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Federal Case and Modular Building Plan Bring New Attention to Atlantic Yards Project

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Atlantic Yards project began with much fanfare in December 2003, when the developer Bruce C. Ratner unveiled his plans at a pep rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall: an exotic basketball arena and a sprawling residential development that would provide affordable housing, jobs and community development.
The $4.9 billion project took a battering during the ensuing seven years of public review, controversy and delay. Today, the 18,000-seat basketball arena, which will be home to the Nets, is taking shape at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. But revelations in the past few days have brought renewed attention to the rest of the 22-acre project. 
Last week, a federal bribery case against State Senator Carl Kruger turned up a recording of an executive at Mr. Ratner's company, Forest City Ratner, pressing Mr. Kruger for $9 million to rebuild the Carlton Avenue Bridge at Atlantic Yards. Forest City Ratner did not get the money, and the executive was not accused of any wrongdoing, but the recording did bring unwanted attention to the company's desperate search for financing.
And this week, Forest City Ratner confirmed that it was considering erecting a 34-story prefabricated, or modular, tower, as a way of cutting its construction costs and fulfilling its obligation to start building housing.
The construction unions that Mr. Ratner had lauded last year for sticking with him were stunned by the suggestion that much of the work might take place in a factory, where wages are much lower than on-site. Forest City has put off the start date for the tower, the first of 16, until the end of the year.
Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, the organization whose lawsuits delayed the project for years, said the plan for a modular building was the latest in a long line of broken promises.
''Jobs and affordable housing accounted for nearly all of the Atlantic Yards project's promised benefits,'' said Candace Carponter, the group's legal director. ''With Ratner's selling out of the unions, shelving of any office space and the scarcity of subsidies for housing, the community is left with the arena as the primary benefit, if you believe a traffic-choking, noise-generating, taxpayer-money-losing white elephant is somehow beneficial.''
But Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president and a longtime supporter, attributed Atlantic Yards's current problems to a devastating recession and the opposition's lawsuits.
''Despite the economic realities we face today,'' Mr. Markowitz said in a statement, ''I have every confidence that Atlantic Yards will deliver what was promised, including affordable housing, much needed jobs and, of course, the new Barclays Arena for the Brooklyn Nets.''
But much has changed. Mr. Ratner sold a controlling stake in the Nets, who were losing money and many games, to the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov and replaced the flashy and expensive design for the arena by the architect Frank Gehry with a more modest one.
Instead of paying $100 million in one lump sum for the land owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the company made a $20 million down payment and has until 2031 to pay the remaining $80 million.
Forest City did build a temporary railyard to replace the one now occupied by the arena and expects to complete the permanent yard in the coming years.
It also lined up 498 Asian investors who enrolled in an obscure federal program that grants green cards in exchange for a $500,000 investment in a job-producing American project.
MaryAnne Gilmartin, executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, said that when it received final approval from the federal government, the $249 million would be used to pay down a land loan for the project and additional work on the railyard.
A new $50 million subway entrance at the front of the arena will also open in 2012, she said.
But the promised jobs for community residents and the housing -- more than 6,300 units, at least 30 percent of which would be earmarked for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants -- have been slow to come. The city, which promised to provide $14 million in subsidies for affordable units in Mr. Ratner's first building, has rebuffed his request for $10 million more, saying it would not give him more per unit than it gives any other developer.
Letitia James, the local councilwoman and longtime critic, gives the company ''a failing grade, without a doubt.''
Few neighborhood residents are among those working on Atlantic Yards right now, she said. ''They sold the team to this Russian person,'' she said. ''The affordable housing has not been built. Frank Gehry is gone. And we don't know whether they'll honor their commitment to hire local residents or provide low-cost basketball tickets to the community.''
Ms. Gilmartin said the company was ''working on multiple fronts to start the first residential building.'' She said, ''We're in tireless pursuit of moving this project forward.''

HEADLINE: Riding the Wave of Life's Indignities

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
There are actors who suffer nobly, with tragic and stoical reserve. Then there is Paul Giamatti. Squirrel cheeked and beetle browed, with rounded shoulders and a scratchy voice, he is a virtuoso of exasperation, a maestro of disappointment, an intrepid navigator through squalls of frustration and failure. Who else could have played John Adams, the most misunderestimated of the founding fathers, a great man and also a petty one, possessed of an outsize sense of grievance? Or Harvey Pekar, the Cleveland file clerk who wrung deadpan, misanthropic comic-book masterpieces from the grind of daily existence?
Mike Flaherty, the New Jersey burgher Mr. Giamatti plays in ''Win Win,'' Tom McCarthy's funny and warmhearted new film, is cut from more modest cloth. A lawyer with a struggling storefront practice who moonlights as a high school wrestling coach, Mike lives a life of suburban contentment shadowed by the usual material and moral anxieties. Married -- to Amy Ryan, as his and the audience's luck would have it -- with two young daughters, Mike is beleaguered by small indignities that threaten to add up to something big and scary. His wrestlers can't win a match. The boiler at his office is broken. Business is drying up in a grim economy. Nothing catastrophic, but if he could just catch a little break, things would sure be easier. 
The break arrives, and of course things get complicated. One of Mike's clients is an old man named Leo (Burt Young), who is slipping into senility with no family to care for him. Mike persuades a judge to name him Leo's guardian, figuring there will not be any harm done if he pockets the monthly stipend and installs his ward in a nursing home. And this initial win-win situation pays a surprising dividend when Leo's teenage grandson shows up, on the run from an unhappy domestic situation in Ohio. The boy, Kyle (Alex Shaffer), who seems a little threatening at first, turns out to be not only a nice kid but also a remarkably talented wrestler. He comes to live with Mike's family, enrolls at the high school and for a while allows Mike to bask in the kind of all-American self-satisfaction that won Sandra Bullock an Oscar for ''The Blind Side.''
Mr. McCarthy neatly sets up the elements that will bring about Mike's self-deluding rise, his near-calamitous fall and his eventual redemption. There are no real surprises, but this is not to say that ''Win Win'' is rote or formulaic. Quite the opposite. Mr. McCarthy, who has written and directed two other features -- and who is a first-rate character actor specializing in second-rate characters -- has a deep and nuanced understanding of the rules of comedy, which is at once the most rigorous and the most elastic of narrative genres. He also possesses a sharp wit and a generous spirit, mocking his characters without meanness and lampooning their social circumstances without condescension.
New Jersey, lately travestied as an inferno of vulgar hedonism on MTV, is here shown to be if not quite an earthly paradise, then at least a garden of reasonable middle-class delights. (It was also the setting of ''The Station Agent,'' Mr. McCarthy's quiet and quirky directorial debut.) The spirit of the place is not so much Bruce Springsteen -- or even Bon Jovi, name-checked by Ms. Ryan -- as Frank Bascombe, the decent and world-weary hero of Richard Ford's great ''Sportswriter'' trilogy. No melodrama, no great claims of world-historical significance: just the daily business of trying to get ahead and do what's right.
The promise of this film's title -- which can be taken both ironically and sincerely -- is that those two things can go together, that success and virtue can walk hand in hand. This is close to a definition of the American Dream, and while Mr. McCarthy treats it with a raised eyebrow, he forgoes easy cynicism or knowing satire. This means that ''Win Win'' goes a bit soft in places, protecting its characters from serious danger or tough moral reckoning. But the film's niceness is also central to its appeal, because nearly all of the characters are people you enjoy spending time with.
And they do seem like real people. Mr. McCarthy is in no hurry to push the story forward, preferring to give his cast members room to explore one another and their curious, ordinary surroundings. Some of the best scenes involve Mr. Giamatti and Bobby Cannavale, who plays Mike's best friend, Terry. Terry is not essential to the plot -- his own briefly glimpsed troubles would make for a funny-sad indie comedy in their own right -- but he does yeoman work as Mike's foil, second banana and partner in foolishness. When Jeffrey Tambor shows up (playing Mike's coaching assistant and office mate), it's like watching a master class in offbeat comic brilliance, as the three actors try to top one another at self-effacement.
Ms. Ryan has her chance as well, as does the ever-reliable Mr. Young. Mr. Shaffer, a first-time actor and an accomplished high school wrestler, is as diffident and puzzling as a real teenager. The only character denied a full measure of human complexity is Kyle's mother, Cindy (Melanie Lynskey), who shows up to add a dose of melodrama and to symbolize the bad stuff that exists just beyond the horizon of the Flahertys' comfort zone.
''Win Win'' does not leave that cozy realm, but it finds enough to work with there. It is in no way challenging or provocative, but it is never dull or obvious. It's a good movie about trying to be good.
''Win Win'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Language familiar to anyone who has driven in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise On Higher Gas and Food

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans paid more for food and energy in February, according to a government report released Thursday, but outside those volatile categories inflation was tame.
The Labor Department, in its report, said that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in February, the largest increase since June 2009. But excluding food and energy costs, core prices rose 0.2 percent, the same as in January.
Gas prices jumped 4.7 percent in February, above January's increase but below December's rise. Food costs increased 0.6 percent, the most in two and a half years. 
Food costs increased 0.6 percent, the most since September 2008. Food costs rose for almost all major grocery store groups, including meat and eggs, dairy and fruits and vegetables. The cost of cereals and baked goods was flat, the only group that did not increase.
Prices for many agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat and soybeans, have doubled since last summer because of bad weather around the globe. Those higher prices are now showing up on store shelves. Vegetable prices also soared last month because of harsh winter freezes in Southern states.
More food and gas price increases are in the pipeline. The Labor Department said that wholesale prices jumped 1.6 percent in February, the largest increase since June 2009. Wholesale food prices rose 3.9 percent, the biggest increase since November 1974.
Price increases for other goods and services are recovering from very low levels. Core consumer prices increased 1.1 percent in the last year, up from a 0.6 percent annual increase in October. Still, that was below the Fed's preferred range of 1.5 to 2 percent.
The Federal Reserve said this week that more expensive food and energy was ''currently putting upward pressure on inflation.'' But the central bank said the pressures were likely to be temporary. It also said that measures of underlying inflation had been subdued, a reference to core prices.
In a report on Thursday, the Fed said that factories produced more cars, appliances, computers and furniture in February, lifting manufacturing output for a sixth consecutive month.
Overall output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities dipped 0.1 percent last month, the central bank said. But the first decline in industrial production since October was caused by unseasonably warmer weather that cut demand for gas and electric utilities.
Industrial production has risen by nearly 12 percent since hitting its recession low in June 2009. It remains about 6 percent below its prerecession peak in September 2007.
Factory production, the biggest slice of industrial activity, rose 0.4 percent last month. Manufacturers have increased production in 17 of the 21 months since the recession ended. They are expected to keep bolstering economic growth, despite the nuclear crisis in Japan.
Stronger factory activity has been an important factor supporting job growth. As the economy gains strength, companies are reducing layoffs and increasing hiring.
As a result, fewer people are seeking unemployment benefits. The Labor Department said that applications fell to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 last week, the third decline in the last four weeks.
The four-week average for claims dropped to 386,250. That was the lowest level since July 2008, providing evidence that the job market is on a more solid footing.
Benefit applications below 425,000 signal modest job growth. But the level of applications needs to fall below 375,000 to be seen as a sign of sustained declines in the unemployment rate. Benefit applications peaked at 651,000 during the recession.
Companies are finally hiring more after months of sluggish job creation. Employers added 192,000 jobs in February, the biggest gain in nearly a year. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.9 percent, the lowest point since April 2009.
The benefits report showed that the number of people receiving regular unemployment benefits fell by 80,000, to 3.71 million. That was the lowest level since the week of Sept. 27, 2008.
An additional 4.36 million unemployed workers received benefits under the extended programs during the week of Feb. 26, an increase of 53,000 from the previous week. In total, 8.95 million people were on the benefit rolls during the last week in February.
In addition, a private research group's measure of future economic activity rose 0.8 percent in February, as the job market showed improvement and consumers were more optimistic. It is the eighth consecutive month that the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators has shown growth.
February's pace was faster than the previous month's, when the index rose just 0.1 percent. But it was lower than December's revised reading of 1.0 percent.

HEADLINE: Disaster May Deal Blow To Tourism in Hawaii

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
HONOLULU -- Even before Japan was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami, Hawaii had been struggling with a budget shortfall that seemed suffocating for a state this small: close to $1 billion over two years.
But the disaster in Japan has the potential to make what was a bad situation for the state significantly worse.
The tour and hotel cancellations began within hours, and they have been continuing -- a reminder of how dependent Hawaii is on tourists who make the nine-hour trip here from Tokyo. State officials, well aware of the history of Japanese tourism fallout after other calamities -- including the Kobe earthquake in 1995 and the swine flu epidemic in 2009 -- are now bracing for a sharp drop in tourism and the revenue it produces. 
''We are heavily dependent on Japanese visitors,'' said State Representative Marcus R. Oshiro, a Democrat from Honolulu and the chairman of the House Finance Committee. ''There is no doubt in my mind that at least in the short term, we are going to be severely impacted by the earthquake and tsunami. It may be anywhere from $15 to $20 million in state revenues lost just from that tourist market.''
Japanese tourism is not what it once was: Last year, 1.2 million Japanese visited Hawaii, down from a peak of about 2.2 million visitors in 1996. The downturn reflects the effects of the worldwide recession but also changing travel tastes of Japanese tourists. But by any measure, Japanese citizens are a critical part of the tourism industry, which is a critical part of the state's economy.
Japan ranks third in the number of visitors it sends to Hawaii, following the Western and Eastern United States mainland, but Japanese tourists are much more aggressive spenders and thus contribute disproportionately to the economy. They spend far more money per day on food, hotels and shopping, particularly luxury goods. A typical visitor from the Western United States spent $146 a day last year, while a Japanese tourist spent $274, state officials said.
Their presence still could be seen in the teeming beachfront bars and lobbies of luxury hotels this week; many Japanese tourists were stranded, awaiting flights home that had been temporarily grounded. Menus at hotel restaurants are almost invariably written in Japanese and English, and stores sell packages of nori, dried seaweed, next to potato chips.
Local officials stress that they do not want to compare their situation to the horrors that Japan is experiencing, but the impact on state revenues, they say, will be a serious blow.
This setback came as Hawaii, after suffering through a long decline in tourism, had been experiencing something of a resurgence, its beaches and hotels suddenly full of visitors escaping the brutal winter that had gripped much of the mainland. It also came as Gov. Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat who took office in January, and the Legislature have been struggling to produce a budget that would deal with steadily declining revenue.
For all the cries of alarm, there is considerable uncertainty about how bad and long lasting any tourist drop-off might be. Paul H. Brewbaker, the chairman of the State Council on Revenues, said it would probably be a month before the state could realistically gauge how Japanese travel plans had changed.
Even before the Japanese earthquake, the council had projected a decline in projected state revenues in a report to Mr. Abercrombie. The decline, the council said, would increase the projected shortfall to $964 million, from $698 million. Mr. Brewbaker said it was too soon after the disaster to try to adjust that number.
''Japan is an important market for us. And obviously a cataclysmic event has occurred,'' he said. ''The aftershocks, so to speak, are still unfolding. I've learned from the past that one week is too early, and maybe one month later is enough to calibrate these things.''
He said that Japanese tourists, while important, are not as critical as they once were here. ''We love them,'' he said. ''But there's just not as many as there used to be.''
But David Uchiyama, vice president of brand management for Hawaii Tourism Authority, said tourism officials, who have been closely monitoring developments, had already logged reports of Japanese tourists putting off trips.
''We've already seen group cancellations,'' Mr. Uchiyama said. ''We are watching our individual package tours, and we are seeing the booking pace slow for that type of business.''
He said after the Japanese earthquake of 1995, the state measured a 12 percent decrease in visitors from Japan; during the height of the swine flu, it was close to 30 percent, he said. ''Some lessons can be taken from this,'' he said. ''But the severity of the current situation is a little greater than we've seen in the past, and the extended concern over the nuclear plant is going to kick in.''
Mark B. Dunkerley, the chief executive officer of Hawaiian Airlines, which last year initiated direct flights to Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, said that his airline had noted ''a modest single-digit drop-off in bookings'' since the disaster, but that it had no idea what to expect.
''There is no template on this,'' Mr. Dunkerley said.
Leroy Laney, a professor of finance and economics at the Hawaii Pacific University, said history suggested that an event like this would produce a noticeable decline in the number of Japanese visiting. ''It will be significant,'' Professor Laney said. ''That market tends to be an all-or-nothing kind of market. I think it will be a very large percentage of them for a long time to come.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Agency Ends Accounting Firm's Afghan Contract

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and JAMES RISEN; Alissa J. Rubin reported from Kabul, and James Risen from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The American government has terminated its contract with an international accounting firm that was providing technical advice to the Afghan banking system here because of the firm's failure to report signs of trouble at Kabul Bank, the nation's largest financial institution.
The United States Agency for International Development ended the banking portion of a contract with the firm, Deloitte, which had staff members working as advisers to Afghanistan's Central Bank, according to a report released Wednesday by the inspector general for the aid agency. 
A section of the report outlines the termination of the banking portion of the Deloitte contract as well as other steps that the aid agency plans to take to remedy the situation.
The 23-page report paints a portrait of an often overwhelmed Central Bank trying to determine what was really going on at Kabul Bank and receiving little support from Deloitte and its predecessor, Bearing Point. Although a huge fraud was under way that diverted $850 million to insiders, numerous red flags were overlooked by the Deloitte team.
American and other Western advisers are embedded in a number of Afghan ministries and governmental institutions to help officials to gain technical skills and institute professional standards. U.S.A.I.D.'s effort to help the banking system started in 2003.
The report faults Deloitte for failing for two years to report evidence of fraud at Kabul Bank. The report found that, long before the run on the bank in September 2010, there were repeated opportunities ''to learn about fraudulent activities at the bank'' but that Deloitte advisers either did not inform the aid agency or did not recognize the warning signs.
The report also says that Deloitte's lead adviser at the Afghan Central Bank disclosed that he had withheld information about evidence of fraud at Kabul Bank from the aid agency because he wanted to maintain his confidential relationship with officials at the Afghan Central Bank.
The inspector general's report suggests that evidence of serious problems at Kabul Bank should have been obvious to the aid agency even before Deloitte became involved, as early as November 2008, when one Bearing Point adviser to the Central Bank received two death threats in connection with an on-site examination of Kabul Bank.
U.S.A.I.D. knew about the death threats and agreed to have Bearing Point stop further involvement in on-site bank examinations, but agency officials failed to see it as a sign of fraud at Kabul Bank.
In 2009, Bearing Point advisers also saw growing evidence of how Kabul Bank's political clout was allowing it to avoid scrutiny, according to an incident recounted in the inspector general's report.
While conducting a training exercise for bank examiners from the Afghan Central Bank, the report says, a Bearing Point adviser told the trainees that the Central Bank had the power to remove the management of Kabul Bank. The Afghan trainees were incredulous and told the Bearing Point adviser that the reverse was true. Kabul Bank management ''can remove us,'' they said, according to the report.
The audit by the inspector general also questioned Deloitte's overall effectiveness because for the past seven years the Deloitte staff members, and Bearing Point before Deloitte, had been embedded in the Central Bank to give technical advice, yet they failed to help the bank's supervisors prevent the near collapse of Kabul bank.
U.S.A.I.D. officials admitted many of the problems both in Deloitte's performance and in the agency's supervision of the contract but underscored that nothing the company could have done would have stopped the fraud.
''It should be made clear that Deloitte could not have stopped the massive fraud that occurred at Kabul Bank,'' said David McCloud, the acting assistant to the administrator of the Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs for U.S.A.I.D. in written comments on the inspector general's report.
Mr. McCloud also said that the aid agency commissioned an assessment that found that the ''massive fraud'' at Kabul Bank was ''a criminal act by the chairman of the board and the C.E.O., aided and abetted by other senior managers and board members.''
Bank officials arranged for loan documentation to be fabricated for fictitious companies, and the money from those loans was then diverted to the bank officials for their personal use.
The inspector general's report cited data from the aid agency that said that $850 million from fraudulent loans was diverted to Kabul Bank insiders, representing 94 percent of the bank's outstanding loans. In January, The New York Times reported that potential losses at Kabul Bank could be as much as $900 million.
In response to the inspector general's report, Deloitte issued a statement saying that the aid agency's inspector general did not find any evidence of fraud by Deloitte personnel, and that auditing Kabul Bank's books was never part of its contract with the agency.
''Deloitte has acted appropriately and performed consistent with its contractual obligations and we believe the management comments of U.S.A.I.D. demonstrate this,'' the company's statement said.

HEADLINE: 18 Entrants Vie to Build New Campus On City Land

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The next engineering school in New York City could be a satellite campus of a university in Finland, South Korea or California, judging by the responses city officials received to their call for ideas on how to raise New York's profile in the realm of technological innovation.
On Thursday, the city announced that it had received 18 expressions of interest in establishing a research center from universities and corporations around the world. Struggling to compete with Silicon Valley, Boston and other high-tech hubs, officials charged with developing the city's economy have identified several city-owned sites that might serve as a home for the research center for applied science and engineering that they hope to establish. 
The list of institutions that responded includes the Abo Akademi University in Finland, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, as well as schools in England, India and Switzerland. American schools as far away as California and as close by as Manhattan and Hoboken, N.J., also indicated that they were interested.
A total of 27 schools responded, some teaming up with each other or with corporations to send joint submissions. One joint submission came from New York University, Carnegie Mellon University, the City University of New York, the University of Toronto and I.B.M.
''We received a response that was certainly equal to or exceeded our expectations,'' said Robert K. Steel, the deputy mayor for economic development.
Mr. Steel said he and other city officials would study the responses, then solicit more concrete proposals in what would amount to a competition for a big -- or bigger -- presence in the city.
For sheer enthusiasm and ambition, it may prove difficult to match Stanford University, which has proposed building its first degree-granting satellite campus away from its home base in Palo Alto, Calif., said Lisa Lapin, a Stanford spokeswoman.
Stanford has suggested that it would revive the Goldwater Hospital campus on Roosevelt Island in the East River as an outpost that could eventually hold as many as 2,200 students and a few hundred faculty and staff members.
Stanford estimates that the initial phase of the campus, which could be completed by the end of 2015, would cost about $250 million. The university expects that its own spending would be supplemented by the city and philanthropists, Ms. Lapin said.
''It's not about bringing money to the home campus,'' Stanford's president, John L. Hennessy, said in a recent interview. ''It will require an investment of institutional resources to be successful.''
City officials did not reveal any more details of the responses, which they said included proposals for ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' of private investment.
So far, city officials have not said how much they would be willing to spend on the project, but they have identified four sites that the city might be willing to make available to the winning bidder. Along with the old hospital site on the southern end of Roosevelt Island, they include space on Governors Island in New York Harbor and complexes of buildings at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and on Staten Island.
Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that the respondents had expressed interest in all of the sites. Mr. Pinsky said he expected the development corporation to release a request for proposals, the second of two steps in the solicitation process, in the middle of the year. But he said officials had not decided whether bidding would be limited to the first respondents.
''We set a very ambitious goal out there,'' Mr. Pinsky said. ''And from a preliminary look, it appears that these are serious proposals with sweeping ambitions.''

The New York Times introduced a plan on Thursday to begin charging the most frequent users of its Web site $15 for a four-week subscription in a bet that readers will pay for news they are accustomed to getting free.
Beginning March 28, visitors to NYTimes.com will be able to read 20 articles a month without paying, a limit that company executives said was intended to draw in subscription revenue from the most loyal readers while not driving away the casual visitors who make up the vast majority of the site's traffic.
Once readers click on their 21st article, they will have the option of buying one of three digital news packages -- $15 every four weeks for access to the Web site and a mobile phone app (or $195 for a full year), $20 for Web access and an iPad app ($260 a year) or $35 for an all-access plan ($455 a year). All subscribers who take home delivery of the paper will have free and unlimited access across all Times digital platforms except, for now, e-readers like the AmazonKindle and the Barnes & Noble Nook. Subscribers to The International Herald Tribune, which is The Times's global edition, will also have free digital access. 
No American news organiza-tion as large as The Times has tried to put its content behind a pay wall after allowing unrestricted access. The move is being closely watched by anxious publishers, which have warily embraced the Web and struggled with how to turn online journalism into a profitable business.
''A few years ago it was almost an article of faith that people would not pay for the content they accessed via the Web,'' Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of The New York Times Company, said in his annual State of The Times remarks, which were delivered to employees Thursday morning.
''This move is an investment in our future,'' he said. ''It will allow us to develop new sources of revenue to support the continuation of our journalistic mission and digital innovation, while maintaining our large and growing audience to support our robust advertising business. And this system is our latest, and best, demonstration of where we believe the future of valued content -- be it news, music, games or more -- is going.''
Mr. Sulzberger acknowledged the hurdles The Times must overcome in the minds of many readers, saying he harbored no misconceptions.
''The challenge now is to put a price on our work without walling ourselves off from the global network, to make sure we continue to engage with the widest possible audience,'' he said.
Not all visits to NYTimes.com will count toward the 20-article limit. In an effort to reduce losses among the Web site's more than 30 million monthly readers, The Times will allow access to people who arrive at its Web site through search engines like Google and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. There will, however, be a five-article limit a day for people who visit the site from Google.
The 20-article limit begins immediately for readers accessing NYTimes.com from Canada, which allows the company time to work out any software issues before the system begins in the United States and the rest of the world.
For years, newspaper companies have been offering Web access free in hope that the online advertising market will cover their costs. But while online advertising has grown, it has not increased quickly enough to make up for the decline in traditional print advertising. Many publications have been looking at ways to make online consumers pay as they do for print.
''This is practically a do-or-die year,'' said Ken Doctor, an analyst who studies the economics of the newspaper business. ''The financial pressures on newspapers is steady or increasing. They're in an industry that is still receding. Newspapers are trying to pay down their debt, but they have fewer resources to do it.''
The debate consuming the newspaper business now centers on the question that The Times hopes to answer: Can you reverse 15 years of consumer behavior and build a business around online subscriptions?
''The nature of how we access news online, in an episodic way throughout the day, tells me people just aren't going to pay,'' said John Paton, chief executive of the Journal Register Company, which publishes papers in the Midwest, upstate New York and Connecticut. ''And of course there's the 15-year history of people not paying. We've trained them not to.''
The model The Times is putting in place represents a recognition among some newspaper owners that a successful online business model rests on a relatively small portion of highly engaged readers as opposed to a high volume of page views.
''What matters is, how can you attract a sizable group of core readers who are loyal to your news brand and get most of them -- not all of them -- to pay for access? And that's the core of the new business,'' Mr. Doctor said. ''It's a major shift in psychology.''
If enough readers balk at paying, The Times risks losing its status as the most-visited newspaper Web site in the country -- an important distinction with many advertisers. But revenue losses from any declines in traffic could be offset because advertisers were willing to pay a premium for an audience they know is highly engaged.
''Advertising is about adjacency,'' said Andrew Swinand, president of global operations for the Starcom MediaVest Group, a media-buying agency. ''I'm paying for an engaged audience, and if that audience is willing to pay, that demonstrates just how engaged they are.''
The Times estimates that 85 percent of its online readers will never reach the 20-article ceiling. The paper has also agreed to a step few publishers have been willing to make, saying that by June 30 it will abide by the terms of Apple's subscription model. That model gives Apple 30 percent of the price of any subscription sold in its App Store.
The fragile condition of the industry has left newspapers with few choices. Even as other media have recovered, newspapers have experienced little gains from the end of the recession.
Advertising revenue for American newspapers in 2010 -- including digital and print -- fell 6.3 percent, to $25.8 billion, compared with 2009, which had been the worst year on record as measured by the Newspaper Association of America. In contrast, according to Kantar Media, which tracks marketing activity in major media, overall ad spending in the United States last year increased 6.5 percent from 2009. Television media gained 10.3 percent and magazine media ticked up 2.9 percent.
At The New York Times Media Group, which includes The International Herald Tribune, ad revenue declined 2.1 percent in 2010, to $780.4 million.
Other newspapers, most of them small local papers, have adopted a metered or ''freemium'' system similar to the one The Times will be using.
Some, like The Commercial Dispatch in Mississippi and The York Daily Record in Pennsylvania, are using an approach created by Journalism Online, which is working with a variety of models that set the number of free articles readers can view from five to 20 each month. Papers have charged monthly subscription fees of around $3.95 to $10.95.
The Dallas Morning News started putting much of its content behind a less porous pay wall last week, an approach similar to The Wall Street Journal's site, where selected content is free but everything else is available only to subscribers.
The Financial Times, based in Britain, uses an approach similar to what The Times is adopting. It sells online-only subscriptions starting at $19.96 a month. Rob Grimshaw, managing director of FT.com, said the Web site has 210,000 digital subscribers -- more than half the 400,000 who subscribe to the print edition.
With passions running high, the question of whether readers will pay never fails to spark spirited discussion online.
The Times's announcement prompted more than 2,500 comments to its Web site.
A reader in Los Angeles wrote, ''The price is too high. I just cannot afford it. I will go to BBC.com or cnn.com. Sorry, NYT, you picked the wealthy again.''
That comment prompted Lori K from Boston to respond, ''The 'wealthy?' It's two lunches at McDonalds. For a month of reporting. I'm happy to support the NYT for such a low price.''
Online Correction: March 17, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the price of a subscription as $15 a month. That is the price for four weeks of full access to the Web site and a mobile phone app.

HEADLINE: Nearly Half a Million Japanese in Shelters, as Tolls Rise and Foreigners Flee

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. LYONS

 BODY:
With the world's attention riveted on the unfolding nuclear crisis in northeast Japan, the more immediate toll from the powerful earthquake and tsunami continued to mount on Thursday, as more deaths were confirmed, more foreigners prepared to leave the country and more of the disaster's wide-reaching effects came into focus.
Japanese officials said confirmed deaths had climbed on Thursday to 5,692, and that the names of 9,506 people missing and unaccounted for had been registered. But many thousands more are believed missing. 
Nearly a week after the earthquake struck, the national police agency said that more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, where supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities were running short.
In a tsunami-battered neighborhood in Sendai, the major city nearest the quake's epicenter, there is still no running water. One resident, Noriko Sawaki, told The Associated Press that just living day to day was exhausting. ''It's frustrating, because we don't have a goal, something to strive for,'' she said. ''This just keeps on going.''
In a smaller town, Kesennuma, people stood in long lines after a supermarket, picked bare over the last few days, got a delivery of supplies that included instant rice packets and diapers. The NHK broadcasting network reported that each person was limited to 10 items.
Foreign governments stepped up efforts to move their citizens out of harm's way or out of Japan entirely.
The United States, which called on Wednesday for Americans to stay at least 50 miles from the stricken nuclear plant in Fukushima Prefecture, drafted plans on Thursday for voluntary evacuations of families and dependents of military personnel and embassy employees in Japan, including those at air and naval bases 200 miles or more from the plant. Japan has ordered evacuations within 12 miles of the plant, and told those within 18 miles to remain indoors.
Capt. Eric Gardner, the commanding officer at the Atsugi Naval Air Facility, told Reuters that the military would be able to fly out about 10,000 people a day. Some would be sent to American bases in South Korea, he said in a recorded message to base personnel. In all, the American military has more than 55,000 troops and more than 43,000 dependents based in Japan, as well as thousands of civilian employees and contractors, the news agency said.
In addition, the State Department said late Wednesday that it had authorized the voluntary departure of about 600 family members of diplomatic staff in Tokyo, Nagoya and Yokohama.
Study-abroad programs in Japan have also been affected. Two American schools, the University of Kansas and Temple University, said Thursday that they would bring home their students, The A.P. said.
Commercial airlines around the world dispatched more and larger aircraft to Tokyo to help thousands of people leave the country, even as they altered or suspended service.
After 25 passengers arriving in Taiwan and 3 arriving in Seoul were found to have radiation levels slightly higher than normal, officials around the world said they would screen travelers from Japan. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that both passengers and cargo arriving in the United States from Japan were being checked out of an abundance of caution.
Trace amounts of radiation were later found on luggage, passengers and the air filtration system of a plane arriving from Japan at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, CBS News reported, citing city officials. The amounts found were not said to pose any threat.
Some foreign airlines have relocated operations to southern cities, but are continuing to operate flights with one eye on the radiation gauge.
''We can keep flying even if the situation deteriorates further,'' Christoph Franz, chief executive of Lufthansa, told Reuters in Frankfurt. ''But never say never; we don't know what will happen there over the coming days and weeks.''
Britain said it was chartering jets to fly between Tokyo and Hong Kong, and that Britons directly affected by the tsunami would not be charged for the flight. The French Embassy has arranged for special Air France flights. Air India stepped up its flight schedule and sent Boeing 747 jumbo jets, rather than the smaller aircraft it usually uses on the route.
The prime minister of Sweden, Fredrik Reinfeldt, told the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet on Thursday that his government was making plans to evacuate all of its citizens from Japan. The Czech military evacuated some of its citizens from Japan on special flights, The A.P. said.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report issued Thursday that there was no evidence that food exports from Japan posed any risk, Bloomberg News reported.
''Food safety concerns are restricted to food from the affected zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant,'' the organization said. ''Given the reported safety measures, it would be unlikely that food production or harvesting is taking place in the evacuated area.''
For their part American meat and seafood producers said they would step up shipments to Japan to replace stocks that were destroyed and production disrupted by the earthquake and tsunami , The A.P. reported. Sendai is an important processing center for Alaskan seafood catches.
Experts offered rising preliminary estimates of how much it would cost Japan to rebuild. The 3M company, an American manufacturer with extensive operations in Japan, said the bill may run to $150 billion, half again as much as the Insurance Information Institute estimated a day earlier. ''Economic activity will probably fall initially,'' the 3M report said, ''but perversely, after a lull, the necessary rebuilding work will actually create faster growth.''
The International Monetary Fund said that Japan had the financial means to recover, and that the country had not requested any help from the fund. ''The most important impact on Japan is the humanitarian one,'' Caroline Atkinson, a spokeswoman, said at a news conference, according to Bloomberg News. ''We believe that the Japanese economy is a strong and wealthy society, and the government has the full financial resources to address those needs.''
Even so, currency traders bid the Japanese yen up to near record highs against the dollar and euro on Thursday, apparently driven in part by Japanese investors and companies retrieving assets from overseas to help at home, though Japanese officials insisted that the surge in the value of the yen this week was mostly due to speculation.
