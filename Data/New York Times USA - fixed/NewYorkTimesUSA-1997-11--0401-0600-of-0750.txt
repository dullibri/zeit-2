HEADLINE: The Nation;
Washington Steps Back, and Cities Recover

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
NATIONAL political leaders used to talk about fixing up urban America. They mostly don't now. Even pretending to have a broad vision for what the cities could be, or should be, let alone having a plan to pay for it, is no longer required or expected.
Yet even as the Federal Government has retreated, many cities, and notably New York, are seeing levels of investment and development in poor and once-blighted areas that were unimaginable not all that long ago. 
 That raises some quietly insistent questions. Was this chain of events -- big government runs away, cities improve -- a matter of cause and effect, or mere coincidence? Would the blossoming of Harlem in the 1990's as a retail destination, the flow of stock market capital into shopping centers in Newark, or the renaissance of Times Square be occurring, or happening in the same way, if the heavy tread of the Department of Housing and Urban Development bureaucracy still walked the earth? Is the absence of policy, or even debate, about the nation's cities actually a blessing?
There is little doubt that the spirit of hope and enterprise that urban experts talk about in cities did arrive at the same time that the old trappings of big government were taking the last train out of town. In a kind of baton handoff of devolution, the Federal presence gave way to a mostly local presence, which in turn gave way to the market. The sidewalks of Herald Square are clean not because of the New York City Department of Sanitation, but because corporations formed their own business improvement district to pay for street cleaning and other extra services. Urban renewal is dead. Long live urban renewal.
But proving a direct link of cause and consequence is another matter. Urban planners, investors and politicians say that to attribute everything about the improving condition of cities to the Federal Government's paying less attention to them -- essentially the logic of Congressional budget hawks -- is as incorrect as saying Government played no role at all. Even to ask is to revisit some very old ideological battlefields.
It was, after all, the free market, not government, that first told cities to drop dead, beginning in the 1960's as retailers began fleeing for suburban malls. To a generation of urban politicians, including some who lined up in New York last year to oppose the expansion of suburban-style big-box retailing in the city, the market is simply not to be trusted or depended upon when it comes to poor neighborhoods. Banks discriminate, they say. Grocers overcharge.
 
Getting Lucky
Similarly, people who think there should be a national policy on the cities are loath to credit the Federal Government with any aspect of urban improvement. The Government simply created a vacuum, those critics say. If it was filled with something positive, then everybody just got lucky, nothing more.
"I don't want to let them off the hook that easily," said Thomas O'Brien, research director at the Horizon Institute for Policy Solutions, a non-partisan research organization that favors a greater government role. Mr. O'Brien said that a nation with no society-wide goal of making its urban centers livable has little to be proud of, however much some poor city residents may now be able to buy a Mickey Mouse watch or to get a prescription filled without taking a bus.
The actual evidence cuts both ways. Some pieces of the urban resurgence appear to be almost purely market driven -- meaning they would probably be happening no matter what Government had or hadn't done. Others do seem to be caused by a changing government climate. And some, like the nationwide decline in crime, are crucial but don't fit into either category.
The story of the brownfields offers a textbook case of how all those forces combined. Brownfields are former industrial sites, many of them in poor urban areas, that are vacant and polluted, but not polluted enough to qualify for clean-up money from Washington.
Beginning in 1994, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency quietly relaxed its formulas for the brownfields. A retail use, for example, would require a less rigorous, and less expensive, clean-up than a residential use. That change created a new industry, which arose to clean up and resell the properties.
At the same time, the cataloguing of brownfield sites became a function of local government, which can respond to the needs of business faster than the Federal bureaucracy. And perhaps most crucially, investors who were looking for returns greater than the 12 percent to 15 percent typical in mainstream real estate saw urban values appreciating as the crime rate declined.
"On a brownfield site, you can make 20 percent to 30 percent, if you do the numbers right," said Christopher J. Daggett, president of Chadwick Partners, an Edison, N.J., company formed 19 months ago to get into the brownfields business. "When the market is tight, people look for other alternatives."
Retailers rediscovered cities for the same reason: higher returns than the suburbs, with too many stores, could offer. Companies like Disney went to Harlem not to do economic development, but to make money.
An explosion in the number and size of Wall Street mortgage investment pools has similarly aided the cities without particular intent. The pools, which buy and sell residential and business mortgages, have grown so large that they find they can venture into urban areas, where risks and returns are both higher than in the suburbs, without significantly raising their overall risk. And the competition for the best return creates a pressure to make those new investments.
 
Nowhere Else to Invest
Real estate investment trusts have also made a contribution -- though indirectly -- by buying up so much property outside the cities. That has nudged traditional lenders like banks toward urban markets because of a shrinking universe of properties that are available.
"There's a flood of cash chasing a limited number of deals," said Anne Habiby, research director for The Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, a Boston-based group founded in 1994 by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter.
Indeed, there is some evidence that government has forgotten what little bit of urban policy it still has. A Presidential executive order, issued in the 70's and still in effect, says Federal agencies should situate new offices in urban areas whenever possible, to help boost economic activity.
But development experts say the order is ignored with impunity. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, with more than 800 employees at Kennedy International Airport, has looked for a new home for years. New York officials said downtown Jamaica, Queens, best fit the Presidential order, but this year the F.A.A. instead designed a site selection plan that specifically ruled out Jamaica. Congress promptly approved it.

HEADLINE: The World;
Global Good Times, Meet the Global Glut

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S failure last week to persuade Congress to give him freedom to negotiate trade deals reflected skepticism among Americans about the benefits of a global economy -- not only free trade, but an entire system that allows money, factories and jobs to move anywhere.
Domestic politics, of course, played a big role in the President's decision to retreat when he failed to muster enough votes for passage. But the skepticism is not limited to politicians jockeying for the next election, or union officials charging that jobs are going south. The worriers are often the very business executives and international investors who built today's global economy and now fear that it might backfire. 
 There is something to worry about. The Asian financial turmoil may be the first stage of a developing worldwide crisis driven mainly by a phenomenon called overcapacity: the tendency of the unfettered global economy to produce more cars, toys, shoes, airplanes, steel, paper, appliances, film, clothing and electronic devices than people will buy at high enough prices.
"There is excess global capacity in almost every industry," Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric, said in a recent interview in The Financial Times of London.
The problem arises because the global economy sucks businesses into building too many factories. Allied Signal, for example, a multinational corporation based in Morristown, N.J., built a polyester plant in Longlaville, France, in 1993 and expanded it last year. The polyester, used in nylon carpets and tire cords, is sold in France and shipped across open borders to customers everywhere in the region.
 
The Danger of Price Wars
But a group in South Korea, an emerging industrial nation seeking to be a big player in many major industries, opened a polyester plant in Korea recently. Taking advantage of open borders, the Koreans are shipping their polyester into Europe and other countries, grabbing away customers and market share by offering lower prices. And the customers, offered more polyester than they need, have encouraged a price war.
Price wars, up to a point, are good for consumers. The inflation rate in the United States has fallen in part because of global overcapacity, and business people everywhere complain that they can't raise prices. "That is what overcapacity means," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant.
The danger is that at some point this house of cards must tumble down. In an open-border global economy nearly every car manufacturer, for example, is trying to have a presence in every market. But when all the factories crank out more cars than people can buy, down come car prices. Down go the profits of car companies. Out go the workers. And down go the number of people who can afford to buy cars. Economies can spiral downward toward recession, or worse. That is what is beginning to happen in Asia now.
East Asia has been the main source of the world's overcapacity in recent years. Since 1991, countries like Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have accounted for half the growth in world output, primarily manufacturing, according to David Hale, chief global economist for the Zurich Insurance Group.
 
Dominoes
The financing for this new production often came from international investors moving huge sums across borders. They frequently borrowed the money at low interest rates in Japan and the United States and then invested in booming Asia in expectation of earning a high return. Money borrowed at 1 or 2 percent a year in Japan might typically pay 8 to 10 percent invested in Asia.
Chunks of this money inevitably went not into factories but into speculation. Borrowers defaulted. And as the hoped-for big returns failed to materialize, fear grew, first in Thailand, that money invested in that country's currency, the baht, would not earn enough to pay debts incurred in dollars or yen. There was a run on the baht last summer, which spread to stock prices and to other Asian financial markets.
The factories -- the new capacity -- remained intact, but the millions of Asians counted on to be customers pulled back. In their place, the energetic consumers in the world's richest country, the United States, have become the targeted buyers for much of the unsold Asian output. And as imports from the region rise (they have risen only slightly so far) there is downward pressure on prices in the United States and on the wages of workers who make products that compete with the imports. Just the threat of an Asian alternative produces this downward pressure, some economists argue.
The global economy appears, in effect, to be capable of self-destruction. That is the view of William Greider, a journalist who writes extensively on economics and whose recent book, "One World, Ready Or Not" (Simon & Schuster), has made him a principal voice among those who point to the dangers of an unregulated global economy.
"It produces more and more goods even as it suppresses wages at both ends of the world, in industrial as well as developing countries," he said. "You cannot do that forever -- producing more and cutting the wages of those who buy -- without some collapse."
That view has been attacked by several influential economists, particularly Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The American economy, he says, is still mostly self-contained; global trade has not made that much of an inroad. What's more, he says, workers will eventually share in the earnings from rising production. And finally, Mr. Krugman maintains, overcapacity is not a question of too much supply, but a faltering of demand.
The Krugman solution is to turn up the demand; central banks do this by cutting interest rates so companies and consumers can borrow money less expensively. "There is no shortage of things on which people want to spend money," Mr. Krugman said. "You would have to have a worldwide depression to shock them into not buying, into sitting on their money."
That seems unlikely, but in the end it could happen. Already central banks in Asia, instead of lowering interest rates to encourage spending, as Mr. Krugman suggests, have raised them in an effort to strengthen their currencies, among other reasons.
 
Pressure on America
 South Korea could be the next country in trouble, analysts say, hurting Japan in the process. Some of the huge sums invested in Korea were borrowed from Japanese banks. A loan default in Korea could bring down a Japanese bank already weakened by the recession in that country. And with its own consumers already balking, the fresh blow of a bank default would make Japan even more eager to export its unsold goods -- its overcapacity -- to the United States. With that in mind, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin publicly urged the Japanese Government last week to spur domestic consumption.
Mr. Rubin's concern is understandable, given that the United States is the alternative if the Japanese don't buy enough -- Americans being the world's consumers of last resort. The United States trade deficit keeps rising as imports grow, forcing American manufacturers to cut back. Just last week Eastman Kodak announced 10,000 job cuts, in part to accommodate overcapacity in film manufacturing, especially competition from Fuji of Japan.
But the American trade deficit would have to quintuple before the economy gets into trouble, said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting service.
"There is the possibility," he said, "that you can bring in so many low-priced imports that businesses in this country would have to cut back and unemployment would rise. But that sure is not happening now."

HEADLINE: Racism Is Not The Issue

BYLINE: By Orlando Patterson; Orlando Patterson, a professor of sociology at Harvard, is the author of "The Ordeal of Integration: Progress and Resentment in America's 'Racial' Crisis."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Why are we having a national argument on race? By all objective measures -- recent opinion polls, demographic data and academic studies -- race relations between blacks and whites have never been better. What is more, the majority of African-Americans are content, even optimistic, about their interactions with European-Americans, according to a close reading of a recent Gallup Poll, for example, and other surveys.
This viewpoint has also been forcefully argued by the scholars Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom in their new book, "America in Black and White." While I differ with many of their arguments, particularly with their opposition to affirmative action, their basic premise is correct -- that relations between the races are getting better, as are the conditions of most African-Americans. 
 Nonetheless, civil rights leaders insist that this belief is dangerously wrong because they think that America remains mired in racism. Social scientists like Stephen Steinberg of Queens College in New York indicts America for its retreat from policies supporting racial equality; Carl Rowan, a syndicated columnist, has just published a book called "The Coming Race War," and the journalist David K. Shipler has titled his pessimistic book about race "A Country of Strangers."
Finally, President Clinton has placed the resolution of the so-called crisis on his list of potential historical legacies.
But let's get the facts straight. According to the most recent census data, blacks have virtually closed the gap with whites not only in the percentage graduating from high school but also in the percentage graduating from junior college.
Black full-time workers have also started to close the income gap, according to census data. From 1970 to 1995, the average annual income of white men declined by 3 percent, to $34,741, while that of black men increased by 11 percent to $27,136.
Nonetheless, major problems still remain for the bottom quarter of the African-American population -- 26 percent of all black families and 41.5 percent of their children remain trapped in poverty. The situation is no longer worsening, but it is no better than conditions were a quarter century ago.
Nor have we seen the end of racism, as some conservatives like Dinesh D'Souza have absurdly announced. About 20 percent of white Americans are still at least mildly racist (meaning, among other things, that they are averse to living in neighborhoods with only a few minority families), according to my research using polls, including one in 1994 by the National Opinion Research Center. But because blacks make up only 13 percent of the population, this means that for every two blacks there are still three white racists.
We have made great progress, but there is still a long way to go. Here is what we should be asking: How does racism hurt the lives of African-Americans? For the poorest among them, is racism the real problem? Do ordinary black Americans think that race is their biggest problem?
When it comes to earnings and self-esteem, racism may be less of a problem for the poorest blacks and more of a problem for middle-class blacks who are in direct competition with whites for jobs, status and power. This is the main reason that I think we need affirmative action for another 15 years or so. Isolated from critical networks of influence and economic power, middle-class blacks badly need affirmative action to level a playing field that for 300 years favored whites.
Certainly, poor blacks are hurt by racial discrimination -- mostly in biased police behavior and draconian drug-sentencing laws that result in horrendous incarceration rates for young men. But as the sociologist William Julius Wilson emphasized more than 19 years ago, race is of secondary importance when it comes to the economic conditions of poor blacks. Poor blacks, like poor whites, are impoverished partly because they attend bad schools, come from broken families and live in broken communities. But the basic problem is that the poor, no matter how hard they work, earn too little to pull themselves out of poverty.
Indeed, in a Gallup Poll taken in June, poor blacks said that money, not racism, was their biggest problem. This poll, which measured race relations, found that three-quarters of blacks considered their own relations with whites to be good, and indeed, had a close white friend. The same poll found, however, that 53 percent of blacks were dissatisfied with their incomes. Unsurprisingly, for poorer African-Americans, the figure was much higher.
If money is the problem and not racism, why do many leaders, white and black, warn that America's racial problems are getting worse? This pessimism results from a strange collision of interests.
White liberals believe to some degree the stereotype that African-Americans are a dependent and chronically victimized group. Any problem associated with blacks is simply assumed to be racist in origin. Emphasizing failure and crisis is also an effective way to argue for more government intervention.
Black political leaders also have a vested interest in maintaining that a racial crisis exists. Their legitimacy and a good part of their livelihood depend on defending entitlement programs.
On the right, leaders and scholars exaggerate the crisis in race relations to highlight the failures of liberal programs.
The news media give all these wrong-headed beliefs their full attention. In the tabloids and on the television news, articles about urban crime and racial incidents are common. Even leading newspapers play the "racism forever" game, partly out of a misguided and patronizing liberalism. For instance, in reporting the results of the June Gallup Poll referred to earlier, most newspapers stressed the one pessimistic finding: that a majority of black respondents thought that relations between the races were generally getting worse -- an impression drawn from the press itself.
Newspapers ignored the more accurate and positive finding: the great majority of respondents reported that their own experiences with whites were good and getting better.
Martin Luther King's dream of an integrated America has not been deferred. The nation is overcoming what was once its greatest flaw, racism. Denying its persistence is naive and reactionary. But ignoring the country's extraordinary progress, while exaggerating racism's impact, is counterproductive as well. It obscures and diverts attention from what is now our greatest shame -- chronic poverty and growing income inequality -- and it plays right into the hands of those on the right and left who promote the vile dogma of racial separatism.

TRADE
'Fast Track' Hits a Wall
President Clinton conceded that trade legislation he had called crucial to the nation's global leadership was dead for this year. He asked that the measure, which would have given him authority to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or reject but not alter, be shelved. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said the legislation's chances of being passed next year, when members of Congress are seeking re-election, were even more remote. Clinton's defeat was a victory for organized labor, which saw American jobs threatened, but many business executives warned that it would prove costly to the nation's economy.
 
THE ECONOMY
Sales Off; Slowdown Ahead?
Autumn struck the economy in October, chilling it so much that some economists worried that an economic slowdown was taking hold just before the holiday shopping season. Shoppers spent a seasonally adjusted $213.7 billion last month, down 0.2 percent, the second consecutive monthly drop in retail sales, the Commerce Department reported. The Labor Department said prices paid to producers like food processing plants and factories inched 0.1 percent higher in October, meaning that the Producer Price Index has declined at a 1.2 percent annual rate during the first 10 months of the year. The productivity of American workers grew at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in five years, easing fears that labor shortages could lead to renewed inflation.
 
MARKETS
Who's Exuberant Now?
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chief often quoted as warning against irrational exuberance in the financial markets, sounded quite a different note last week. With the markets gyrating wildly, he became soothing, saying that problems in Asia and elsewhere should not threaten prosperity in the United States or the soundness of the nation's financial system. The Fed voted on Wednesday not to raise interest rates, concerned that tightening monetary policy would further destabilize global markets and betting that the American economy might slow sufficiently to avert any inflationary threat. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 7,572.48, down 8.84 points, while the Nasdaq composite was down 18.59, to 1,581.51
 
BRITAIN, THE BRAND
Embracing All Things Modern
To compete in the modern world, Britain is being "rebranded," Tony Blair's spin doctors recommend in a study, as "one of the world's pioneers rather than one of its museums." Out are scenes of village cricket, tea and scones. In are images of pulsing telecommunications, global business transactions, bold architecture, cheeky advertising and daring fashion. Even Britain's venerable red telephone boxes are being replaced by transparent glass booths. While the Labor Party goes mod, Tories say they still prefer "Rule, Britannia" to "Cool Britannia."
 
PEOPLE
Cash for Katzenberg
The Walt Disney Company settled with Jeffrey Katzenberg, its former studio chief, who had sued for at least $250 million. He contended that Disney owed him a share of the profits from hit films like "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King." What he will receive is still to be decided. . . . Warren Flick, Kmart's president and chief operating officer, who is given much credit for reviving the retailer's sagging fortunes, will retire after only two years at the company, for health reasons. . . . Mildred Robbins Leet and Glenn Leet, a Manhattan couple, have fought an 18-year battle against poverty. Since founding the Trickle Up Program, a nonprofit organization that gives modest amounts of seed money for new businesses, they have helped 65,000 entrepreneurs, mostly women like Maria Miranda, a millener in Jackson Heights, Queens, below, to start small businesses.
 
INTERNATIONAL
A Delay in Russian Bonds
Gazprom, the Russian monopoly involved in a natural-gas project in Iran, postponed a $3 billion bond offering for which Goldman, Sachs is the lead underwriter. . . . ING Groep, the expansionist-minded Dutch financial services company, is seeking to buy Banque Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium for $4.68 billion in cash and securities.
 
LAYOFFS
Kodak to Cut 10,000 Jobs
Eastman Kodak, struggling to compete with Fuji of Japan in film sales, said it would cut 10,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force. It hopes to save $1 billion in the next two years. It was the biggest layoff announcement by any American company this year and comes on top of some 40,000 Kodak job cuts since 1983. . . . Fruit of the Loom will cut 2,900 jobs, or 17 percent of its American work force. The cuts will effectively complete the company's drive to move its sewing operations to Mexico, the Caribbean and other offshore sites with cheaper labor. . . . Waste Management, responding to pressure from dissident shareholders, announced a broad reorganization that will eliminate 20 percent of its corporate and support staff and save $100 million annually.
 
AUTOMOBILES
G.M. Taking a Hit
General Motors said it would take a charge against earnings of $2 billion to $3 billion to pay for job cuts, write-downs in the value of some factories and other changes intended to streamline the company in the long term. It did not disclose details, but the bulk of the job cuts are expected to come in Europe. And G.M. lost a bid to manufacture passenger cars at a plant in southern China. The winner, Honda, will produce a model resembling its Accord at the plant, which was vacated by the French auto maker PSA Peugeot Citroen. . . .In a rare admission of a serious engineering error, Daimler-Benz halted shipments of its Mercedes A-Class subcompact, which is to be sold in Europe, while it refits the chassis to prevent the car from flipping during high-speed turns.
 
DEALS
Dial MCI for Money
Money talks. In what would be America's biggest merger ever, MCI Communications, the nation's No. 2 long-distance telephone company, agreed to be acquired by Worldcom, an industry upstart, for $36.5 billion in cash and stock. Worldcom triumphed over GTE, which offered $28 billion, and British Telecommunications, which bid $19 billion. . . . Shareholders of ITT, the once-sprawling conglomerate that has shrunk under the leadership of Rand V. Araskog, left, into what is now primarily a hotel and casino company, endorsed a $10.2 billion cash-and-stock sale to Starwood Lodging Trust, rejecting a $9.3 billion hostile takeover offer from Hilton Hotels.

HEADLINE: Free Namibia Stumps the Naysayers

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: WINDHOEK, Namibia

 BODY:
In 1990, when Namibia became an independent country under black majority rule, there were bitter jokes that goats would soon be grazing on grass in cracks in Windhoek's streets.
Seven years later, it hasn't happened. Windhoek is still probably the cleanest, safest capital in Africa. 
 What is remarkable is how little has changed. This is perhaps not surprising in a country where German is an important language 82 years after Germany lost the colony. But compared with the rapid pace of change in next-door South Africa, it is a bit of whatever the opposite of future shock is.
South Africa gave up control in 1990 after running the country for 75 years, much of the time in defiance of the United Nations, but it still dominates the economy.
All the diamonds and most of the beef and fish Namibia exports go there, and the Namibian dollar is pegged to the South African rand, which stores still accept. And as in South Africa, the white minority still controls the bulk of the land and wealth. The average white person earns 14 times as much as the average black one, and unemployment or underemployment is estimated to be 40 percent.
Despite rapid growth, the place still feels empty. The country is twice the size of California, but has only 1.7 million people, fewer than Brooklyn does.
What is not desert is dry, and water is a pressing issue. Updates on El Nino are in the paper almost daily, for fear that the long drought that ended last year will return. The biggest political battle is over whether the Kunene River can be dammed for drinking water, a move that would chase the migratory Himba people off their ancestral land and submerge the Epupa Falls, the area's sole tourist site. A proposal to build a coastal desalting plant is being debated.
And Sam Nujoma is still President, and probably will be for a while. That bothers the largest donors: Germany, the United States and the Nordic countries. They quietly told the governing party, the South-West Africa People's Organization, that they would prefer Mr. Nujoma stuck to the original plan: two terms. But the party, at its convention in May, found a loophole: it said his 1990 election did not count, since independence was not in place, so he can run again in 1999.
"We mentioned George Washington turning down a third term," said a Western diplomat. "But it's a done deal. You can keep kicking that wall, but what for? And the U.S. didn't become less of a democracy because F.D.R. got a third term."
To the relief of the donors, the party did not amend the Constitution, though it could have, since in 1994 it increased its parliamentary majority to 74 percent, from 57 percent in 1990. "The party decided that a third term should be limited to Sam," a party member said. Mr. Nujoma, 69, has groomed no successors.
The President's credibility from 23 years as a guerrilla leader is seen as balancing competing factions. Black-white relations are peaceful, but those between the Ovambo-speaking people, who dominate his party, and the Hereros and Namas are tense.
The smaller tribes accuse the Ovambo of grabbing jobs, scholarships and contracts. The head of the opposition DTA party, Mishake Muyongo, waxes almost paranoid on the topic. He says Ovambo women, famous for their beer-brewing, deliberately get Nama men too drunk to go to work, so their Ovambo husbands can take their jobs.
Ben Amathila, the Minister of Information, scoffs at the stereotype and calls it "malicious politicking."
More voters share Mr. Muyongo's more mundane complaint that the governing party is profligate. Besides the presidential limousines and helicopter, he says, Mr. Nujoma has a $22 million Falcon jet bought in 1992. Now there is talk of buying him a $45 million jet because the Falcon cannot reach Europe nonstop.
"Planes are like toys Sam Nujoma has to play with," Mr. Muyongo said. "But we are holding out our left hands to beg while our rights are digging into our pockets to pay for his jet. That money would build a lot of clinics."
The jet issue is clearly something of an embarrassment, and Mr. Amathila paused before he said: "The President is important to the stability of this country. He's an asset that might prove expensive to maintain, but he's worth it."
More popular anger is directed at the 43 members of Parliament who are Cabinet ministers or deputy ministers. They get $55,000 a year, plus allowances for housing, furniture, electricity, telephones and drivers. They also get free television satellite dishes, cellular phones, a Mercedes for weekdays, a Land Cruiser for weekends and, when they they travel overseas, $1,500 a day "pocket money" in addition to their hotels and meals.
Recently, Cabinet ministers drafted a bill giving themselves each an extra $15,000 a year "servants allowance" and generous retirement packages. When news of that leaked, the outcry was so great that the Cabinet balked. But it then drafted a law to punish members of Parliament, or reporters, who released details of legislation still being drafted. That provoked a louder outcry from the press, and the paragraph referring to reporters was removed. That, said a Western diplomat, is a good example of how governance works in Namibia. "They go to the threshold of scrapping democracy," he said. "But then they don't cross it."
 In a recent survey of seven southern Africa countries by the Helen Suzman Foundation, a nonprofit pro-democracy group, Namibia was the only one where a majority of respondents said they felt free to criticize their government and to hold public demonstrations.
Financially, diplomats say, the Government's smartest move is that a third of the $1.2 billion national budget goes to education.
The Government's weakest point is that there are still 70,000 government employees. Strong unions and the governing party's historical Marxist bent mean that attempts to shrink the bureaucracy to 40,000 have been foiled.
In a country where change comes slowly, the most unpredictable element is probably Mr. Nujoma himself. He has lambasted journalists, the "gay and lesbian conspiracy," environmentalists who oppose the annual seal slaughter and members of the opposition who dare mention that the governing party ever mistreated prisoners.
"The reactions are predictable," a diplomat said. "The donors make veiled threats, then the Prime Minister 'clarifies' what he means, and they cover it over.
"Why does he do it? That's Sam."

HEADLINE: Agency Says Gas Emissions Will Be Worse Than Thought

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases from energy use will grow faster than previously expected in the United States in the next few years, the Energy Department said this week. This would make it more difficult for the United States to live up to President Clinton's proposal to cap emissions of these gases at 1990 levels over the next 10 to 15 years.
The department said national economic growth would be slightly higher than previously estimated, competition would make electricity cheaper and fuel prices would not change much. More oil will be used because there will be more cars with more horsepower, and more people traveling by plane. 
 These factors are likely to increase emissions of greenhouse gases, produced largely through the use of fossil fuels like oil and coal, the annual energy outlook by the Energy Information Administration said.
Representatives of about 150 nations will meet in Kyoto, Japan, next month to negotiate cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, threatening to alter the climate.
Jay E. Hakes, head of the Energy Information Administation, said that carbon emissions in 1990 were 1,336 million metric tons and that analysts had assumed that if no action were taken, the number would climb to 1,722 million by 2010. "The rough idea has been that we need to reduce carbon emissions by 28 or 30 percent to get back to 1990 levels." With the new estimate, though, the 2010 figure is 1,803 tons, which would require a reduction of close to 35 percent.
The new estimate is based on annual economic growth of 2.1 percent, up from 1.9 percent, Mr. Hakes said. Stronger growth means more disposable income and more demand for energy. The estimate is based on oil prices rising less than 10 percent by 2020, and coal prices declining 1.4 percent a year through 2020, faster than was expected last year. According to the new projection, electricity prices will drop 1 percent a year as a result of competition.
If the price of energy decreases, Mr. Hakes said, consumers and businesses will have less incentive to invest in improved energy efficiency. Lower electricity prices will also make it harder for renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, to gain a foothold in the marketplace.
Mr. Hakes said that there were technologies with the potential to reduce carbon output, but that no new inventions or improvements of existing devices appeared likely to be in wide enough use by 2010 to upset the forecast much. Beyond that, he said, the prediction is less certain.
In fact, the department's track record for long predictions is poor. In the early 1980's, the Energy Information Administration predicted that crude oil prices could be nearly $300 per barrel by the turn of the century. The price of crude oil these days is around $20 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Trade Fight Was Battle of Perception Against Analysis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
In the days since Congress handed President Clinton a major defeat on trade, top White House aides have been asking themselves the same question: at a moment when the economy is booming and other nations say they are terrified by the competitive edge of American companies, why did Congress become convinced that trade was threatening the livelihoods of working Americans?
Mr. Clinton talked himself hoarse repeating the same statistical mantra: 13.5 million new jobs, many created by America's export boom over the last five years, and the lowest unemployment rate in two decades. At the same time, he repeatedly fretted in public that he had been a "complete failure" convincing Americans that their prosperity was linked to the blooming of trade. 
 In a capital where images always have a greater staying power than statistical analysis, Mr. Clinton ran headlong into headlines that members of Congress threw back at him: Kodak lays off 10,000 in Rochester, Levi Strauss shuts down 11 plants in four states, Fruit of the Loom ends its production in the United States.
Some of those layoffs were linked to foreign competition; many were not, and many no doubt would have happened whether or not the United States expands its network of trade agreements around the world.
But as many members of Congress told Mr. Clinton in the days leading up to the failure of the "fast track" trade legislation, what mattered was the continuing sense of anxiety in their districts, even in the best of boom times. After listening to Mr. Clinton's pitch, they would respond with stories about plant closings, a shrug of the shoulders, and explain that rightly or wrongly their constituents blamed Nafta, the most prominent of the more than 200 trade agreements signed in Mr. Clinton's first five years in office.
The fast track legislation would have renewed the President's authority to negotiate agreements that Congress could approve or disapprove but not amend. Traditionally, Presidents have received that authority so that other nations know that whatever deal they strike will not be reopened by Congress.
But this was not really a debate over the trade agreements themselves or whether the President should have the authority to negotiate new ones. Instead, it became a referendum on who benefits the most from trade in an era when companies clearly have fewer geographical constraints than ever.
One of Mr. Clinton's closest economic advisers, who insisted on anonymity, said this week: "This was a collision that had been building for a long time between Bill Clinton's picture of prosperity and the fears members of Congress were hearing every weekend back home. And you know what? They were both right."
Mr. Clinton has been living with this economic duality for most of his Presidency. While economists remain mired in a debate about whether trade or technology bears more responsibility for the displacement of American workers, few doubt that the overall gains to the American economy from the explosion in the last decade in foreign trade -- which has bloomed from 10 percent of the economy in 1970 to nearly a quarter today -- have been tremendous. And most agree that the gains to the gainers greatly outstrip the losses to the losers.
But that is very different from saying that a majority of workers share in those broad gains.
The losers, in fact, are often concentrated in particular industries and particular Congressional districts. They are far more likely to hold union jobs -- thus the well-organized opposition to the bill from union leaders. Workers who have not finished high school are much more vulnerable to job losses that arise from competition with lower-cost producers abroad.
In the fast track fight, for example, union leaders often cited the plight of clothing workers, who sew garments made from American or foreign fabrics. "The statistics are pretty clear: the number of these workers has declined, and their real wages have gone down, too," said Sidney Weintraub, a professor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and author of a recent study, "Nafta at Three: A Progress Report."
The automotive unions were also among the sharpest opponents, after watching many auto parts plants move abroad and seeing many foreign auto makers, especially the Japanese, open nonunion plants on American soil.
Whether trade agreements accelerated the loss of those types of jobs is a subject of heated debate: American companies have been moving factories to lower-wage nations for decades, and other countries have been investing heavily here since the early 1980's.
The political problem that the White House never confronted head-on was laid out soon before the vote in a study published by the Council on Foreign Relations. While trade enriches the nation, they concluded, "the living standard of the most typical income earner in the very middle of the income distribution may not rise." In addition, the study said, "global integration may not benefit middle-class citizens as a group." As a result, the study concluded, "further global integration, by itself, may not be democratically supportable."
Some of Mr. Clinton's aides are beginning to say that the White House, preoccupied by the Congressional politics of stitching together a majority coalition of Republicans and Democrats, erred by not acknowledging more explicitly that many Americans are losers from freer trade. They were they willing to acknowledge publicly, however, what many say privately: that the Administration wildly oversold the benefits of free trade to ordinary workers in 1993, during the Nafta debate.
"Members of Congress were listening to something very real in their districts," said Robert B. Reich, Mr. Clinton's Secretary of Labor in the first term. "A third to half of the work force has not benefited from this economic expansion. And as an Administration, we did not do enough to make sure the losers had a fair chance of becoming winners."
In fact, many of the programs Mr. Clinton initiated to secure the passage of Nafta in 1993 -- aid to workers who were displaced, even if Nafta itself was not clearly the culprit -- were never aggressively carried out.
In private, some of Mr. Clinton's advisers say they concur with Mr. Reich. But they insist that their bigger problem was one of perception: every plant closing seemed to amplify the bad news, washing over the more subtle evidence of job growth.
"It's enormously frustrating," Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, said. "Nobody gets told when they are hired: 'You owe your job to the fact that we're doing more business in China.' "
For the President and his advisers, the question now is whether it is too late to revive their arguments in Congress. Mr. Clinton insisted several times in recent days that "this isn't over yet," and his aides suggest that early next year he will be back with a narrower trade bill. That would give him specific authority to negotiate with more than 120 nations in the World Trade Organization on agreements that Congress could ratify or reject, but not amend.
The minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said he was open to a new bill, as long as it clearly addressed issues of worker rights and environmental conditions abroad. The labor unions say they are not automatically opposed to a fast track bill, as long as their members are well protected. But many Administration officials doubt that the unions will back any bill that emanates from the White House.

HEADLINE: Iraq Says Attack Would Not Alter Its Ban on U.S. Inspectors

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Iraq said today that its decision to expel American arms inspectors working for the United Nations could not be reversed even by military attack, and it warned of a new chapter in the "great and eternal mother of battles."
A day after President Clinton ordered a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf for possible military strikes, the reaction carried in Iraq's official newspapers and state-run television was starkly defiant. 
 Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf accused the United States of seeking nothing short of toppling President Saddam Hussein. A newspaper owned by President Hussein's eldest son urged Arabs to attack American and British targets in the region to show solidarity with Iraq in its standoff with Washington and the United Nations.
The Government newspaper Al Jumhuriya declared in a front-page editorial that the use of force by the United States "will cause destruction in certain parts of Iraq but it would not be able to change the current situation or change the firm facts."
The United States has said that it prefers to peacefully resolve the crisis, which began on Oct. 29 when Iraq vowed to expel American members of the United Nations weapons inspection team and to shoot down American U-2 spy planes supporting the team.
Iraq's decision on Thursday to carry out the expulsion of the Americans, who left the country on Friday, has led the United Nations to withdraw most of the rest of its inspectors and has severely undermined a nearly seven-year effort to uncover Iraq's secret program to build weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. Clinton's decision to send a second carrier to the Persian Gulf was intended to signal American willingness to use force to compel Iraq to back down in the confrontation.
The strong language from Iraq today served as a renewed declaration that it had no intention of doing so.
"One aggression, 2 or even 10 means nothing but more sacrifices," Al Jumhuriya warned in the editorial today, reminding Iraqis that they had already withstood heavy burdens under the economic sanctions that have been imposed on Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
At the same time, Iraqi officials said they intended to turn now to some of the United States' closest Arab friends in hopes of winning support that might check any American attack.
Mr. Sahaf announced in Baghdad this evening that Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz would begin an Arab tour with a visit to Cairo on Sunday and that he hoped to draw on the "disgruntlement and unhappiness" across the Arab world toward the American position.
Mr. Aziz tried and failed this week to win a compromise at the United Nations. But Mr. Sahaf said the Iraqi envoy would ask other Arab governments to echo Iraq's demand for a direct dialogue with the Security Council as a possible way out of the current crisis.
Officials from the United States and the United Nations have said that Iraq's decision to expel the American inspectors appeared to have been prompted by concern that they were closing in on crucial evidence about Iraq's secret biological weapons program.
But Mr. Sahaf, the Foreign Minister, today reiterated Iraq's insistence that those and all other weapons of mass destruction proscribed under United Nations resolutions had been destroyed long ago.
At a briefing for reporters in Baghdad, Mr. Sahaf said this evening that his country was not on a war footing.
But a very different impression was being given on state-run Iraqi television, which warned today that an American attack could come at any moment, and borrowed from the propaganda of the Persian Gulf war to forecast a reprise of "the mother of all battles."
Also for the first time since the gulf war, Iraqi television has begun to broadcast announcements ordering reservists from elite commando units to report to their bases.
The call for Arab attacks against American and British targets was published in the newspaper Babel, which is owned by President Hussein's son Uday. Its front-page editorial said that "American and British interests, embassies and naval ships" should be atacked in military and commando operations by "Arab political forces."
Hundreds of Iraqi families have moved into a presidential palace in central Baghdad in the apparent hope of deterring an American military strike. But accounts from diplomats in Baghdad and reports from Iraq's official press suggest that the Government now is beginning war preparations in earnest.

HEADLINE: OUTDOORS;
In Maine, Signs of Hope For Rivers and Anglers

BYLINE: By Pete Bodo

 BODY:
Since the early 19th century, hydroelectric power brokers and entrepreneurs eager to service industry and the needs of a budding nation freely took rivers away from the fish and other creatures that inhabited them. Now it appears that fish may be getting some rivers, or at least some critical parts of them, back.
In a decision applauded by environmentalists as well as recreational angling groups, the final environmental impact statement prepared at the behest of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has recommended that the commission deny Bangor Hydro-Electric Company the license to construct the Basin Mills project on the lower Penobscot River in Maine. 
 This extensive project would have created a new dam that would have posed serious threats to the continuing effort to restore the once-copious runs of Atlantic salmon to the Penobscot. It would also have seriously jeopardized the rights of the Penobscot Indian Nation to pursue fishing for ceremonial purposes.
In a related decision a few months ago, the commission refused to re-license a dam notorious among anglers for the role it played in the last century in destroying the salmon runs on Maine's Kennebec River, the Edwards Dam near Augusta. The repercussions of these determinations may eventually roll across the continent from the piney bogs of northern Maine to the rugged palisades of the mighty Columbia River in the Northwest, where a hot debate is also raging about the value and role of dams and hydroelectric projects.
"I'm not sure you can say that these decisions by F.E.R.C. actually set a precedent," said Bill Townsend, a director of the Atlantic Salmon Federation and an activist in the Penobscot coalition, the umbrella organization that together with the Penobscot Indian Nation led the formal opposition to Basin Mills. "But they certainly signal a real willingness by F.E.R.C. to adhere in spirit of the 1986 amendments to the Federal Power Act.
"Up until those amendments were made, the official legal attitude seemed to be, 'When you need to generate power, build a dam and everything else be damned,' " Townsend said. "But among other things, the amendments mandated that resource issues, particularly those pertaining to fish and wildlife, are entitled to equal consideration with power generation needs when it comes to issuing or renewing licenses."
Another key component in the amendments was a provision for public commentary in the licensing procedure, a change that suddenly created issues of public accountability in the commission. During the public commentary period, the Kennebec coalition filed a 7,000-page document that ultimately helped convince the preparers of the final statement that the dam should be shut down.
Mona Janopaul, a spokeswoman for Trout Unlimited, said: "If there are precedents being set here, it is in the sense that previous victories for environmental or conservation groups tended to be over small projects. You know, a small group of people getting together to save lovely local waterfalls. But the Basin Mills Project is a big one, on a large river, raising significant issues."
Supporters of the Basin Mills Project, both in the public and in industry, often cited job creation as a significant benefit of license approval. However, most of the jobs created at Basin Mills would have been during the construction phase. Hydro projects do not create much in the way of long-term, sustainable employment.
The final environmental statement for Basin Mills not only quantified the negative impact the project would have on the Atlantic salmon restoration effort, but also produced numbers showing the economic benefits salmon angling brings to the Bangor area.
According to the final statement, Atlantic salmon anglers visiting the Penobscot spent $1.65 million on travel and fishing-related expenses in 1994. The consumer surplus value of Atlantic salmon angling on the Penobscot, which is the amount of money anglers spend beyond expenses directly related to fishing, was $775,000.
These figures would rise dramatically if the salmon fishery on the Penobscot were enhanced rather than threatened, or left stasis. In evaluating the options open to the commission, the final environmental statement concluded that denying the license to build and operate Basin Mills, and removing the current Veazie Dam (the most desirable scenario for environmental and conservation groups), would potentially double the Penobscot's production of wild salmon.
Quantifying the economic value and benefits of wildlife, and habitat suitable to it, is both a fashionable and risky proposition that raises the hoary issue of living and dying by the same sword. Few opponents of the Basin Mills Project, or any other hydroelectric project, are willing to make purely economic arguments for the management of wildlife resources.
By the same token, the effort to save rivers from further degradation and corruption has been greatly aided by critical changes in the way energy is created and distributed, ranging from Federal-mandated deregulation of the industry to the development of new energy technologies. These days, power companies can import cheap energy from clients, some of whom are willing and able to degrade their own environment in ways that the Government and the public no longer deem acceptable.
The environmental frontier is global, but that is no reason not to celebrate small victories in the battle to keep our precious rivers from becoming mere energy factories.

HEADLINE: Three Lenders Begin Loan Programs for Some Foreign Students at N.Y.U.

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Japanese students attending New York University got an unusual offer in the mail recently: the chance to borrow up to $50,000 to help pay for college.
For college students, loans are as much a part of the college experience as S.A.T.'s and dormitory food. But for foreign students, borrowing is not usually an option. The big Federal loan programs are open only to Americans, which limits the ability of many foreign students to study in the United States -- and the ability of colleges to attract them. 
 But N.Y.U. recently lined up three lenders willing to make loans to its foreign students: Citibank began offering loans of up to $50,000 this month to Japanese students. Last week, American Express agreed to extend college loans to N.Y.U. students from Taiwan, and Chase Manhattan Bank agreed to make loans to students from Korea and China.
The moves are significant because foreign students make up a growing portion of the student body in the United States.
About 450,000 foreign students now attend American colleges and universities, about three times as many as 20 years ago, according to the nonprofit Institute of International Education.
The four countries involved in the loan programs account for about one-third of all foreign students at American colleges and universities and more than 42 percent of N.Y.U.'s 4,000 foreign students.
Educators say the availability of loans would probably attract students from less-wealthy families. "This should allow a broader population of foreign students to attend college in the United States," said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute.
Although foreign students must show that they can pay for college before they are granted a student visa, many underestimate the cost and run short of money, said Keith Jepsen, director of N.Y.U.'s Office of Financial Aid. It was to help those students -- and attract more -- that Mr. Jepsen began talking to lenders about offering the loans.
The terms for the Citibank loans are somewhat similar to those for American student loans, although the interest rates are lower, because rates in Japan are lower. Japanese students are allowed to borrow up to six million yen, or about $50,000, with a minimum of one million yen, or about $8,300, from Citibank in Japan. The interest rate is 3 percentage points above the Japanese prime rate (currently 1.625 percent) and will be reset annually. Borrowers pay an application fee of about $300 and an origination fee of up to 3 percent of the value of the loan. Repayment is between 2 and 10 years.
The terms for the Chase and American Express loans have not been worked out, but Mr. Jepsen expects them to be similar to those for the Citibank program. And he expects the loans to be available soon.
Japanese students at N.Y.U. said they found the loan program interesting but were not sure whether they would use it.
Yukiko Amita, a 23-year-old first-year graduate student from southern Japan, said she thought her father would find the loans appealing, because the terms were better than they were for the money he had borrowed to send her to New York.
Shin Mitsugi, a 24-year-old graduate student in public administration from Tokyo who also received an undergraduate degree from N.Y.U., said that the 4 percent interest rate was attractive but that he probably would not borrow, because he was in his final year of study.
"The new program is a good idea, but students have to be very careful," he said. "Repaying a loan is a big responsibility."

HEADLINE: Political Right's Point Man on Race

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
In many ways, Clint Bolick, a 39-year-old Washington lawyer, is the maestro of the political right on issues of race. He is increasingly setting the tone and defining the terms of the national debate, forcing civil rights groups to respond to his view, rather than enacting their own, of what Government policy on race ought to be.
As vice president of the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm, he has been the leading voice in attacks on Government programs that give breaks to minority groups and women. Over the last few years, he has rung up a series of victories and near victories that have left conservatives enthralled and his liberal adversaries fuming. 
 He led the fight -- which few initially thought could be won -- that this week blocked Bill Lann Lee, a Los Angeles lawyer, from becoming the Justice Department's top civil rights enforcer, putting President Clinton on the defensive about what to do next. Four years earlier, Mr. Bolick orchestrated the pressure that forced the withdrawal of the nomination of Lani Guinier, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor, for the same position.
He was a principal strategist in the nearly two-year fight that held up passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, bedeviling proponents of the measure, which opponents called a quota bill. And Mr. Bolick virtually wrote a bill before Congress that would end Federal affirmative action efforts.
He was a featured mover in the drive to force the Clinton Administration to ban the consideration of race in adoptions handled by public agencies. And he is a prime architect behind school voucher plans in Milwaukee and Cleveland.
"I would say that, in terms of Washington-based groups, he is the person who is most active in these legislative fights," said Linda Chavez, who was chairwoman of the Civil Rights Commission in the Reagan Administration and is active in the battle against affirmative action. "He has really been giving leadership on these issues."
Mr. Bolick, who makes $110,000 a year with the Institute of Justice, seems to relish befuddling civil rights groups as much as he enjoys his favorite pursuits of scuba diving and sipping vintage Chardonnay.
Along the way, he has earned praise from many conservatives and contempt from liberals who accuse him of engaging in distortions and mudslinging. Many liberals still fume over the characterization of Ms. Guinier as a "quota queen," in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Mr. Bolick wrote. And they suspect that Mr. Bolick was at the bottom of suggestions that Mr. Lee had acted improperly in trying to work out a consent decree involving hiring women by the Los Angeles Police Department.
"I have serious problems with Clint Bolick, not because he has differing views, but because of his tactics," said Theodore M. Shaw, deputy counsel-general of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "I think they're unprincipled and divisive."
Mr. Shaw added: "I've engaged in a lot of discourse with him. I've been on panels with him and debated him. It's only recently that I've come to the conclusion that I just don't respect him."
The life story of Mr. Bolick, a balding man with puffy cheeks and an often-used hearty laugh, places him at or near many of the major events or personalities that have been featured in the contemporary liberals vs. conservatives clashes.
He attended law school at the University of California at Davis a year after the Supreme Court ruled that it had to admit to its medical school Alan Bakke, a white man initially denied enrollment because of a racial quota program. His first job was at the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm founded by Joseph Coors, the conservative beer magnate, and run for years by James Watt, who later became the Reagan Administration's combative Interior Secretary. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court is the godfather of one of his children.
In tone, style and philosophy Mr. Bolick is more than the leader in the fight against affirmative action. He and his colleague, William (Chip) Mellor, 46, who is president of the Institute for Justice, epitomize a generation of white Republicans for whom the civil rights struggles of the 1960's and 70's are receding memories and who readily say their party was on the wrong side in the 1960's, but also say they feel no guilt about it.
"The younger generation of Republicans is too young to have been in the wrong place in the 1960's, and they have no baggage whatsoever to carry around," Mr. Bolick said in an interview at the institute's offices a short distance down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
And he says he is a rarity: a conservative Republican who cares about racial issues.
For years, Mr. Bolick has waged a frustrating battle to get his party engaged on racial matters, beyond using race as a wedge issue to appeal to white swing voters. He has contended that the party had to have a strategy to help minority groups advance. Otherwise, he argued, the field is conceded to liberal approaches.
"Sometimes a bad idea will win out over a good idea," Mr. Bolick once said in a speech. "But a bad idea will always beat no idea."
The son of a welder who died when Mr. Bolick was 12, he attended Drew University in Madison, N.J., then the University of California at Davis Law School in 1979. At the time, Davis was still reeling from the 1978 Bakke decision, which said that places could not be set aside for minority students but that race and ethnicity could be factors in admissions. It was, Mr. Bolick says, a debate dominated by liberals who brooked no challenge to their dogma.
"It was very, very hostile," Mr. Bolick said. "You either believed in the dominant ideology or people hurled names at you."
After law school he signed on as a lawyer at Mountain States Legal Foundation in Denver, a libertarian public interest law firm that aggressively fought Government regulations, especially in the area of the environment. He took to it readily.
"It was so exhilarating," he said. "I couldn't wait to come to work every day."
During his time there, a friendship developed between Mr. Bolick and Mr. Mellor, who was running the foundation. Mr. Mellor was a former campus anti-Vietnam War protester whose disillusionment with both the left and with the Government flowered after the Kent State shootings in 1970.
He and Mr. Bolick play complementary roles in the institute. Mr. Bolick acts as the front man, giving speeches, writing articles for newspaper opinion pages and doing the bulk of the interviews. Mr. Mellor does more of the litigating and handles the fund-raising.
The two started the organization in 1991 with seed money from trusts controlled by Charles G. and David H. Koch of Wichita, Kan., brothers and oil and gas executives whom Forbes magazine once described as two of the richest men in America.
Though their battle against programs that extend advantages to women and minority groups brings them the most attention, Mr. Bolick and Mr. Mellor say their main purpose is to promote a sense of economic freedom and empowerment.
As such, they have litigated on behalf of a black operator of a shoe- shine stand in Washington fighting Government regulations. They have also gone to court to fight requirements in several states that operators of African-American hair braiding salons take expensive cosmetology courses that teach beauticians how to use hair-straightening chemicals.
"I like this guy," said Ali Rasheed, owner of The Braidery in San Diego, whom Mr. Bolick has represented. "I like him as a human being. I like what he does. He was straight up and down and honest with me. He told me he doesn't believe in affirmative action and all that."
Mr. Bolick is also a strong advocate for vouchers to let poor children attend schools of their choice, public or private. He contends that competition among schools would improve education for minority students, allowing them to succeed without the need for any preferential treatment.
But Mr. Bolick's efforts these days may be only a harbinger of the torments to come for civil rights organizations. Among the programs at the Institute for Justice is an effort to train scores of young, libertarian lawyers to work all over the country to roll back Government regulations and to challenge preference programs.
If they succeed -- and even if they do not -- Mr. Bolick may have achieved what he once told an interviewer he hoped would be his last words: "I helped changed the world and had fun doing it."

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Soccer in the City: Coach Yells, Player Translates, Team Wins

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
At halftime, chilled and dispirited after playing poorly and leading by only one goal, the defending city soccer champions of Martin Luther King Jr. High School sprawled in the locker room at Riverbank State Park in Harlem. Their coach was ranting.
"I am not happy. This is not my team. You are playing without heart. Don't you realize you are this far away from being eliminated? There is no tomorrow." Coach Martin Jacobson smiled. He liked that phrase. "There is no tomorrow. There is no tomorrow. Got that?" 
 But some players just stared at him. They didn't get it. He suddenly remembered they didn't speak English. He turned to his midfield star, a year out of Senegal. "Say it in French, Mansour."
Mansour Ndiaye's two-minute translation of four words on Wednesday may or may not have inspired the team's three unanswered goals in the second half and its 35th straight victory. Tomorrow at 3 P.M. at Riverbank, it meets Midwood in a quarterfinal match of the Public Schools Athletic League tournament. But if American soccer fulfills its awakening promise as a major 21st century sport, you might add "Say it in French, Mansour," to the slogans on the nation's locker room wall.
"This wave of immigrants in the inner city are going to make the game happen here," says Jacobson, who learned his soccer forty-odd years ago on Long Island from a Holocaust refugee. "These are kids who come here at 15, 16, already accomplished as players. They'll become role models for younger, American-born kids. The future is already happening; I've had calls from both Nike and Adidas."
Jacobson's scenario may be wishful thinking, but other coaches, and officials of Major League Soccer, which signed up last year's King star, Barry Swift, see the cities as potential pools of talent. But for that talent to be successful, says Hugo Salcedo, a member of the 1972 United States Olympic team who works in development for M.L.S., there must be an integration of the inner-city immigrant player's "flair and technique" with the American-born suburban player's "strength and determination." It is not unlike basketball's complex dynamic of textbook and schoolyard styles.
At King, which with more than 3,200 students is the largest high school in Manhattan, the soccer players are almost a cult within a subculture, coming from among the 250 English as a Second Language students. The school has had its problems lately, but it also has a reputation for excellent business and law courses and is open to students from all boroughs; it became a recruiting magnet once Jacobson, who is deeply enmeshed in the metropolitan area's soccer-playing network, took over the team three years ago and turned it into a winner.
Two of the three senior captains, forward Randy Guerra and defender Kevon Isa, are Trinidadians living in Brooklyn. The third, Ndiaye, came here a year ago from Dakar, where his parents are optometrists, to live with an uncle in Harlem. He arrived speaking a Senegalese language, Wolof, French and a little German. He is ranked third in his class, and the spectrum of serious interest in him ranges from the professional soccer league to Harvard. The substance of his locker room speech in French helps explain that interest.
"I told them it was important that they understand there will be tough times," he translated for his non-Francophone listeners after scoring two goals in the eventual 5-1 victory over Franklin K. Lane. "I told them that this is the playoffs, all the teams are good, so you must be prepared for tough times. We won't always be winning, 10-0. So we have to keep going, never flag, not lose heart, play our game until the very last minutes, be organized and disciplined."
It was a speech he should have repeated the following afternoon when his old teammate, the star of last year's championship squad, unexpectedly appeared at school. Barry Swift was wearing a red MetroStars cap and a warmup jacket from Sunderland, a First Division English team. When he saw the King principal, Stephanie D'Amore, in the hall outside the coach's office, he threw his arms around her in a bear hug.
She stepped back puzzled. "What are you doing here? Why aren't you in England?"
Swift looked a little sheepish. He said he had just flown in to fill out some immigration papers. Then he added: "If I stayed there the whole three months, and then went to MetroStars spring training, I wouldn't see my family. And there's nothing to do in Sunderland. You practice, you eat, that's it. Not even movies. There was no balance in my life."
D'Amore, once a high school volleyball coach, said: "There won't always be balance in your life. Sometimes you have to sacrifice for a goal. You ever hear about delayed gratification?"
She exchanged freighted glances with Jacobson, and he said, "We still need to work on some life skills, Barry."
Officials at M.L.S., which had placed Swift in a development program that paid him $2,000 a month plus $7,500 a year toward college tuition, were not entirely surprised by his abrupt leave-taking. They admit that they need to do a better job of counseling young inner-city players before sending them off to train with foreign teams.
Social and economic problems take up more of Jacobson's time than coaching does; immigration paperwork is a constant.
Most players are undocumented, and the registration known as the green card has become a prerequisite for either a Division I scholarship or domestic player status in M.L.S. And many of the players have late-night jobs that interfere with games and practices, much less sleep and homework.
Mamadou Diap, for example, a junior defender from Senegal, won't quit his job in a quick-chicken joint in Harlem despite Jacobson's nagging. Diap has been robbed at gunpoint, and his mother keeps reminding him that they came to America so he could have a better education, not better clothes. But the heavy gold pendant on his chest makes him feel good, he says.
"Can't have Mama do everything for me," he said, flashing his sweet little smile. It widened when he was asked how many hours he worked to get the necklace. "Two weeks."
"I don't want to see that gold anymore," snapped Jacobson. "You are getting too materialistic, Mamadou, too American. Next you'll be wearing baggy pants, then you'll lose your culture and I'll throw you off the team."
This was sidewalk counseling on the way last week to practice at what the team calls Jurassic Park, a patch of land under the West Side Highway and the rising towers of Donald Trump's Riverside South. King has no outdoor sports facilities. The team shares the field with Martin Soto's sculptures of endangered animals. The 6-foot-4-inch Isa wove around a polar bear to practice a corner kick at Ronnie Lowe, the goalkeeper, who was defending an elephant.
The stink of fish rose from the Hudson River, just feet away on the other side of a chain-link fence. Jacobson bought three Nike balls at $25 each for this week of practice and playoff games. He screamed at his players to keep their passes and shots low on the ground. Already this season, nine balls have cleared the fence and gone to sleep with the fishes.
Jacobson thinks Nike should have bought the team balls, especially after it announced it was giving $120 million to the United States Soccer Federation, some of it presumably for youth development. Unlike basketball, in which high schools and colleges are the main conduits of talent, soccer is dominated by clubs. Jacobson was introduced last season to Lincoln Parker, a Nike regional marketing representative who replaced the team's eight-year-old uniforms and promised a shipment of bags, shoes and outerwear.
The players were excited at the prospect; two weeks ago, they beat the New Jersey state champion, Kearny, but couldn't forget that once the rains began, their opponents slipped on Umbro ponchos while they tore head holes in plastic garbage bags.
"We're not in the business of trying to take over high school soccer," said Parker, dismissing the notion that he was trying to brand Jacobson with the swoosh before Adidas came through with shoes and apparel. "I sent him stuff before I knew how good they were. I did it because I heard they had to sell cookies to pay for road trips."
The promised sweat suits didn't come in time for Wednesday's second-round game, which might have accounted for the team's chilled first-half play and the need for Mansour's pep talk. The clothes didn't arrive on Thursday either, but black socks, gym bags and $130 shoes did.
The players tried not to eye the boxes during the coach's blackboard diagramming of attacks and defenses punctuated by instructions for individuals to "get back" or "pull up" or "mark your man." Jacobson began pointing at the newest team member, Mansour Seck, three weeks out of Senegal and known as Baby Mansour to distinguish him from Ndiaye.
"You've got to mark your man, Baby Mansour, get on him right away," said the coach, rapping chalk on blackboard. "Got that?"
The 16-year-old Seck just stared at him. Jacobson sighed as he understood.
"Say it in French, Mansour."

HEADLINE: Albright to Consult Arab Countries on Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERN, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will make a rapid tour of Arab countries on Sunday to consult with them on how to deal with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, American officials said this evening.
Ms. Albright, who met here in Switzerland with Yasir Arafat today for talks on the peace effort with Israel that officials said produced only modest progress, will go to Bahrain, Kuwait and then Saudi Arabia, the officials said, presumably to stiffen their resolve against Iraq and its challenge to the United Nations. 
 "The reason for these stops is that those are the countries that are the front-line states, that face the greatest risk of Saddam Hussein continuing to threaten his neighbors," said the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin.
"At a time like this it's very important for the United States to consult with its friends in the gulf," he said.
 President Clinton was also active on the diplomatic front. A senior Administration official in Washington said President Clinton spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on how to maintain Security Council unity in the search for a diplomatic solution in Iraq.
Ms. Albright will start the day with a brief stop in the morning at the American-sponsored Middle Eastern Economic Summit meeting in Qatar, which most Arab countries are boycotting,
Arab governments have already said they do not want military means used against Iraq in the crisis over United Nations weapons inspections, while American officials from President Clinton on down insist that all options are available, if necessary, including military force.
American officials say that the issue of Saudi permission for American troops to use Saudi bases in case of military action or to position American equipment there is always a sensitive one, but declined to provide details.
Since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when the Saudis provided full basing permission, American, French and British pilots are allowed to use an air base in the center of Saudi Arabia to maintain a no-flight zone in southern Iraq.
American officials said that there was also a major American naval station in Bahrain, an air base in Qatar and about a battalion of American troops in Kuwait, with equipment there for a brigade-sized force.
After her talks here with Mr. Arafat today, and talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in London on Friday, Ms. Albright said that she saw some new openings in the stalled Middle East peace talks and urged both parties "to use December in a positive way."
"There have been some gaps, but we can also see some openings," she said. "And what I'd like to see in the next few weeks is a process of closing the gaps and increasing the openings."
She said that both leaders "are cognizant of the fact that it is essential to get the process moving."
"There is an understanding that 1997 has not been the best year for the peace process," she said. "But it's only November, and perhaps we can use December in a positive way."
Mr. Arafat looked very pale today, his eyes watered, and his lower lip trembled steadily. There have been rumors that he is ill. When asked about his health, he said: "I didn't have a good night's sleep. I had to work all night and I had to leave early in the morning, approximately 5 o'clock."
American officials said that Mr. Arafat was coherent in the meetings and spoke Arabic more fluently than his halting English. They acknowledged the rumors about Mr. Arafat's health, especially in the Arab world, but said he did not seem "very much different" than in the past.
But Mr. Arafat, when he saw Ms. Albright in September, did not have the involuntary tremor he displayed today, and he seemed thinner and more frail.
Mr. Arafat said he remained committed to the peace effort and was grateful for the United States attempt "to push the peace process forward and to protect it."
He said the Palestinians were willing to enter negotiations with the Israelis on a complete settlement of all the issues between them, "but it's equally important to have a full and precise implementation of the agreements already reached," he said.
He put special emphasis on an Israeli pullout from the West Bank, which was due in September but Mr. Netanyahu has delayed, citing Palestinian failures to cooperate fully with Israel on security and against terrorism.
On Sunday, the visits to Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will also allow Ms. Albright to cut the Qatar stop even shorter than planned. The meeting, which includes Israel, is being boycotted by nearly all of America's Arab friends, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain and Morocco.
The Palestinians are also boycotting. And even the Israelis are not sending their Foreign Minister, David Levy, but their Trade and Industry Minister, Natan Sharansky, instead.
American officials say that many businessmen from the region will come to the annual conference, now in its fourth year, and that a prime goal is to promote economic ties.
While in Bern, Ms. Albright also spoke to Swiss Government officials and legislators, praising their efforts now to get to the bottom of the Nazi gold issue, and urging them to continue efforts to discover why the bank deposits of Jews and others who died in the Holocaust were not returned to their heirs.
It was the first visit by a Secretary of State to the Swiss capital since 1961, and Ms. Albright, who studied in Switzerland as a young girl and learned her French here, praised the Swiss for their internationalism and efforts for peace.
"But if we are not to repeat the mistakes of the past," she said, "we cannot shrink from any aspect of the truth of the past."

HEADLINE: Deferring to 'Great Yellow Father';
Kodak Workers Say Layoffs May Be Necessary Medicine

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Bill States, a supervisor at an Eastman Kodak plant here, is searching the want ads and polishing his resume -- tasks that, at age 55, he thought were behind him. But like thousands of his colleagues, he is suddenly worried that he will be among the 10,000 people the company plans to lay off.
So it is surprising to hear Mr. States say that he does not begrudge the company even though he had figured it would employ him until his retirement in five years. 
 "Sure, I'm scared about losing my job," he said after his shift the other day, over drinks at Bathtub Billy's, a sports bar across the street from the company's five-mile-long industrial park. "But I want to see Kodak survive one way or the other, with or without me. Kodak is essential to the future of this community."
Unlike other Northeastern cities, like Buffalo and Utica, Rochester has been able to weather the decline of the region's manufacturing economy in recent decades, and the sturdiness of Kodak was in large part responsible.
But now Kodak itself is in trouble, leaving many people in this city and its booming suburbs wondering if they, too, are vulnerable to a new global economy in which brand loyalty is undercut by stiff price wars. In the case of Kodak, the battle is being waged primarily by Fuji, the Japanese film manufacturer.
The announcement of the impending layoffs has stirred a wave of conflicting emotions: even as many people express the predictable shock and fear spurred by corporate downsizing, they also grudgingly accept that the cutbacks may be the only chance for the city's major employer to manage in a cutthroat global marketplace.
Indeed, the relationship between Kodak and this city runs so deep that people here say that having a smaller Kodak is preferable to having no Kodak at all. What, they ask, would become of Rochester if it lost the "Great Yellow Father," as Kodak was once known because of its paternalistic employment practices and trademark yellow boxes of film.
For Kodak is not only Rochester's largest employer, putting about 34,000 people to work in a city of about 232,000, but it is also the largest buyer of goods and services in the city, sustaining scores of small businesses, from caterers and toolmakers to advertising agencies and printing shops. There are few other large American cities as dependent on a single company as Rochester, a conservative town on Lake Ontario in western New York.
"Kodak is the strength of the fabric of this community," said Art Aspengren, the president of the Rochester Industrial Management Council, an association of 370 companies. "It is in everything. If there is such a thing as a company town, this is a company town."
Ever since George Eastman, the company's founder, set up shop here at the turn of the century on the third floor of a building on State Street, Kodak has been regarded as an important and model corporate citizen.
The city's major institutions have long been supported by donations from the company and the Eastman family, from the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and the Eastman School of Music to the University of Rochester Medical School and its Strong Memorial Hospital.
Beyond that, people have grown up for generations in Rochester with the belief that a job at Kodak is a job for life.
But Kodak started going through profound changes beginning in the early 1980's, as a bottom-line approach supplanted the company's old paternal ways. It closed down several divisions and has reduced its work force in Rochester to 34,400, from a high of 60,406 in 1982. It is not clear how the latest work-force reduction by Kodak, announced Tuesday, will affect Rochester, because the company has not said which of its plants around the world will bear the brunt of the layoffs, though Rochester is sure to take a significant hit, given its headquarter status.
The biggest blow to date in Rochester came in 1986, when the company shed a little over 9,000 jobs here. Suddenly, the informal covenant of job security no longer seemed certain. In a sign of the times, the company tried to provide for some of them by creating a Career Resource Center, where dismissed employees could go to have resumes typed, study job listings and scan trade journals and catalogues for technical schools. Kodak also announced that year that it would make cuts in its charitable contributions.
"I think a lot of people were bitter at the beginning," said Karl King, a glass maker who was laid off in the early 1980's but was later rehired as a security guard. "But now people are more accepting of the situation and what's taking place now. The economic picture is changing, and the company is trying to survive just like the people inside the company are trying to survive."
Rochester's economy, up to now, has been able to absorb the blow. Its metropolitan region has been among the most economically robust in the state. It boasts an average unemployment rate of 4 percent, compared with 6.1 percent statewide and 4.7 percent nationwide, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
The relative prosperity in Rochester, experts agree, can be traced largely to one factor: The region has been able to retain and even create manufacturing jobs, even as the state has continued to lose them at a staggering rate. In the metropolitan area, 24 percent of the nonagricultural jobs are in manufacturing, compared with 14 percent statewide, according to the State Labor Department.
But Rochester's prosperity relies heavily on a single source: Kodak. For not only does the company provide more than a quarter of the region's manufacturing jobs; many of the remaining manufacturing jobs are provided by companies in the region that rely on business with Kodak to remain afloat.
To the degree that people here are expressing anger over the latest round of layoffs, it is directed not so much at Kodak, but rather at its executives. They complain that many of the company's current leaders did not, among other things, react quickly enough to the challenges mounted by Fuji and instead fell back on Kodak's name recognition.
Not only that, employees complain, the executives needlessly heightened anxiety among workers by announcing the layoffs, but then refusing to say who would be affected for at least the next few weeks.
Kurt, a data collector for Kodak who refused to give his surname for fear of reprisal from his bosses, said he could not imagine that George Eastman would have approved, especially around the holiday season.
"Kodak will always be Kodak, a great place to work," he said. "But we don't agree with many of the decisions that management has made. It just seems that every time they slip up, they take it out on the working men and women."
But in the end, people have come to accept the latest round of layoffs with more resignation than rancor because, they say, the future of Kodak, and thus of Rochester, is at stake. As Mayor Bill Johnson put it in a recent interview, "One of our fervent hopes is that this short-term pain will produce a long-term gain."
Mike Devries, 47, a manager in the company's maintenance department and a Kodak employee for 28 years, could not agree more. While he said he realizes that he may be out of a job come December and that he is worried about how he will pay his mortgage and provide for his family, he said he is willing to accept the layoffs if they will help Kodak become more efficient and successful.
"I would feel some remorse if I wound up being laid off," he said. "But you have to take the cards as they come." He added, "The important thing is that Rochester remains viable and Kodak stays here for the good of everyone."

HEADLINE: On California Trip, Clinton Blends Politics and Fund-Raising

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Mixing a little retail politics with his wholesale fund-raising, President Clinton came here today to show that he shares Californians' environmental concerns and to support the local Democratic Congressman, Vic Fazio, by dedicating a wet and grassy refuge for birds on their wearying migrations.
Then the President moved on to his own familiar circuit, stopping in at a $5,000-a-plate lunch with California businessmen, his third fund-raiser for the debt-stricken Democratic Party in less than 24 hours. 
 In dedicating the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area, the largest wetlands restoration project in the West, Mr. Clinton praised the partnership of Federal and local governments, duck hunters, environmentalists, farmers and others that produced it.
"You're doing the right thing and you're doing it in the right way," said Mr. Clinton, wearing a red cap and green windbreaker. "We can do anything if we roll up our sleeves and get down to work and honestly listen to people who have different experiences, different perspectives, and different genuine interests."
As Mr. Clinton spoke, a chilling drizzle and a cutting wind transformed what White House aides had hoped would be a striking photograph into a melancholy scene of black mud, brown reeds, and rippled gray water reflecting a gray sky.
Less than 100 years ago, the Yolo Basin contained almost 70,000 acres of freshwater wetlands and forest. At a cost of $12 million to the Federal Government and $5 million to California, officials prepared this wildlife area of 3,700 table-flat acres. Private, nonprofit groups contributed volunteer labor and advice.
In addition to providing a habitat for numerous species, the area is intended to serve as a stopping point for birds migrating along the route known as the Pacific Flyway. A few minutes before Mr. Clinton spoke, flocks of hundreds of ducks streamed past, far overhead.
When Air Force One arrived today at McClellan Air Force Base, which the Defense Department is closing down, Mr. Clinton delivered another message intended for the local audience. He announced that he would sign the $257 billion defense authorization bill even though members of Congress seeking to protect bases in their own districts inserted some language that could interfere with efforts to create businesses at the base. But Mr. Clinton went on to promise a series of modest initiatives to help retrain workers, support new uses of the base, and sustain the local economy.
An aide to Mr. Clinton said that that message and Mr. Clinton's trip to the wetlands were intended to provide support to Mr. Fazio, a frequent White House ally re-elected in the past with thin margins. In the wetlands, Mr. Clinton called Mr. Fazio "one of the most outstanding members of the United States Congress in either party."
For his national audience today, Mr. Clinton promoted his decision on Friday to temporarily suspend imports of modified assault weapons. In his weekly radio address, he ridiculed the notion that such firearms could be used for anything but making mayhem.
"You don't need an Uzi to go deer hunting," Mr. Clinton said, "and everyone knows it." "Assault weapons in the hands of civilians exist for no reason but to inspire fear and wreak deadly havoc on our streets."
On Friday, Mr. Clinton halted for 120 days imports of such firearms, blocking permits issued to dealers for 600,000 guns and freezing applications to import a million more. During the suspension, the Treasury Department will consider whether it can ban the guns permanently. The agency has the authority under the 1968 Gun Control Act to ban imports of such firearms if they are not used for "sporting purposes."
The National Rifle Association today attacked Mr. Clinton's announcement, and released a statement saying that the President is attempting to apply the 1994 gun ban to a whole new class of weapons.
"Everything the N.R.A. has ever said about the Clinton 1994 gun ban is coming true," the organization said.
In remarks on Friday night, Mr. Clinton boasted of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which applied to the domestic manufacture, sale and possession of 19 types of assault weapons, and also banned the domestic manufacture and sale of semiautomatic weapons with certain military characteristics. Imported weapons were already subjected to the broader "sporting purposes" test.
After lunch, Mr. Clinton flew to Los Angeles, where he planned to stay tonight at the home of the Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg.

HEADLINE: A Mature, Wealthy Israel Gives Its American Cousins a Jolt: 'Jews Are Not News'

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 15

 BODY:
American visitors to Israel these days might be forgiven for suspecting that they never left home, what with the proliferation of McDonald's arches, Blockbuster videos, football games on cable, shopping malls, epic traffic jams and the air of prosperity.
Yet for all the apparent Americanization, Jewish visitors from the United States are also often surprised to learn that the big Jewish news stories back home -- the recovery of Jewish-owned gold from Swiss banks, the revelation of Madeleine K. Albright's Jewish roots or, more recently, the fury among Reform and Conservative Jews over conversions in Israel -- are minor news in Israel. 
 The fact is, according to Israelis who follow relations with diaspora Jews, that interest in American Jewry has waned with the passage of generations, the growth of prosperity and the evolution of a national identity in Israel. "There's so many other problems here," said Matti Golan, an Israeli journalist. "I think most Israelis don't devote too much time and attention to relations with American Jews." He wrote a book critical of American Jews, "With Friends Like You: What Israelis Really Think About American Jews."
As one Israeli journalist put it when his editors played down a story he had written about American Jews, "Jews are not news."
That might startle those American Jews who believe that their financial and political support is vital to the survival of what they often still perceive as a vulnerable, struggling Jewish state. Israelis would retort that fewer than 20 percent of American Jews have visited Israel, and that American Jewish donations amount to less than 1 percent of the Israeli gross national product.
Underlying all such debates is the hard fact that American and Israeli Jews have moved far apart in the past half-century. At the founding of Israel, most new arrivals were likely to have a close relative in the United States and a common Yiddish language with American Jews.
"Once it was brothers in Israel and America," said Avraham Avi-Hai, an official of various fund-raising organizations and author of a study of relations between Israel and the Jewish diaspora. "Now it's distant cousins."
But even in the early days of the Israeli state the relationship with the United States was ambivalent.
"Basically," said Stuart Schoffman, a journalist who immigrated nine years ago from the United States, "there was a long-term pattern of mutual condescension, in which Israel was an impoverished country cousin and you sent blankets to keep them warm in winter, and America was a place of sludge-pot assimilation and stunted Judaism, for which Israel provided heroism and inspiration."
"All that is changing," he said, adding that Israel is "like the kid who was always asking Dad for the keys to the car. Now he has his own car. On the flip side, virtually every American Jew has reason to be disappointed in Israel at this moment."
A major frustration for Israelis has been with what they perceive as American Jews' efforts to push policies for which Israelis have to pay the price in blood and hardship.
The resentment is shared by right and left. Some on the right, like the legislator Benny Elon, have urged an end to Israel's dependence on $3 billion annually in American aid, believing the money gives Washington leverage to press policies that many Israelis consider deadly. And Israelis on the left erupted in fury recently when an American millionaire, Irving Moscowitz, fomented a confrontation with the Palestinians by moving Jewish settlers into a house he had bought in East Jerusalem. These decisions, Israelis argue, are for those who vote and bear arms.
"We distinguish between issues which are universal issues of Judaism, whether conversion, immigration or the moral precepts of society," said Simcha Dinitz, a former Ambassador to the United States and head of the Jewish Agency. "But on the line between us and the Palestinians, or us and Jordan, we're ready to hear opinion, but the decision has to be made, for better or for worse, by people duly elected as the Government of Israel. We'll decide whether to divide Jerusalem -- you divide New Jersey, if you want."
Such resentment is often expressed in Israeli reminders of how few American Jews immigrate to Israel. The number, about 3,200 a year, is considerably smaller than the number of Israelis who leave Israel for the United States.
Beyond the mutual pique lies the simple fact that Israeli Jews have had their own nation for nearly 50 years now. They do not share the problems of identity with Jews who still live as minorities in their own countries, no longer persecuted but still threatened with assimilation.
"The differences come from an objective situation," Mr. Golan said. "Israeli Jews are born and raised in a majority, while American Jews are born and raised as a minority. It makes a big difference in mentality. In that respect, Israelis in a way feel more at ease with majorities in other countries than with diaspora Jews."
That difference occasionally becomes evident in disputes with other countries. Thus, while American Jews pursued gold held by Swiss banks as descendants of the Jews from whom it had been stolen, some Israelis, for whom the issue had another, international-relations dimension, were uncomfortable with it.
The distinction between acceptable and unacceptable diaspora input into Israeli affairs has led some Israelis to suspect that American Jews' anger about conversion was really a channeling of rage about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line policies and his strained relations with President Clinton. "I can't help but suspect that the issue here is one of political sublimation," said Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Anti-Defamation League in Israel. "Were the diaspora Jews to be a bit more happy about where Israel is headed politically, they might be a bit more tolerant."
That bewilderment at the fury of the American Jews belonging to the Reform and Conservative movements was widespread among Israeli Jews, in part because few among them are familiar with these movements, which have only token membership in Israel, and in part because the dispute with Orthodox Jews is really nothing new.
The current argument centers on lawsuits brought by Reform and Conservative Jews to compel the Israeli Government to recognize non-Orthodox rabbis' right to perform conversions. Orthodox Jews, who hold a traditional monopoly on religious affairs in Israel, then moved to enshrine their control in legislation. Although this authority would only apply to Israel, many American Jews have taken the proposal as an affront and charged that they are being regarded as second-class Jews.
Some Israelis recognize that the conversion issue is critical to American Jews, because the Reform and Conservative movements, with their less stringent rules for religious behavior, are the main defense against assimilation into American civic culture. The more relaxed approach to conversion, for example, makes it easier for the spouse of a Jew to become Jewish.
But Israelis note that this problem does not exist in Israel. The dispute here between secular and religious Jews is over civil versus religious rights in issues like driving on the Sabbath -- not over identity.
To Orthodox Jews, the issue of conversion in Israel is part of an internal struggle with secular Jews, and many find it hard to understand why American Jews are so upset.
Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, a legislator from the United Torah Judaism, described the Orthodox opposition to the Reform and Conservative demands in terms similar to those of secular Israelis who resent American interference in security issues. "We feel very upset about them to come here and not live here and just to interfere and give orders to us how to behave and what laws we should pass," he said.
But to Rabbi Rosen, the dispute, however unpleasant now, could prove a long-term boon if it served to lower the level of mutual ignorance. "It got the Israeli Government to recognize its responsibility to seek a compromise," he said. "It led diaspora Jews to target contributions to those associations that promote its own values, and the greatest success is that more Israelis know about forms of Jewish life in diaspora than ever before."

HEADLINE: LEADING DISSIDENT IS FREED BY CHINA TO AN EXILE IN U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sunday, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Chinese Government this morning released from prison its best-known democracy advocate, Wei Jingsheng, on medical grounds and put him on a plane to the United States, according to members of Mr. Wei's family.
His exile comes just a few weeks after the visit to the United States of China's President, Jiang Zemin, which included a summit meeting with President Clinton. During the visit, disputes over human rights clouded otherwise amiable meetings. American officials had expressed disappointment that no prominent dissidents, like Mr. Wei or Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, had been released before the visit. 
 State Department and White House officials said they could not confirm the account. Late this morning, the American Embassy here said it had no comment.
"I can tell you only that during times like this, the less said the better and we're not saying anything," said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Mr. Wei's brother, Wei Xiaotao, said that the dissident was on his way to Detroit for medical treatment and that he planned to return to China one day, Reuters reported.
Mr. Wei, 47, who had spent all but six months of the last 18 years in jail, had become a symbol of China's continuing suppression of any public call to end Communist dictatorship. A former Red Guard who had worked as an electrician at the Beijing Zoo, he vaulted into prominence in 1978 with a single, piercing thought, written on a wall poster: that China could never become an advanced country without real democracy.
In the years since then, in letters smuggled out of prison and during his brief moments of freedom, he has been an unrelenting, often sassy critic of the Government, openly taunting the late Deng Xiaoping, who first had him arrested in 1979. But he suffered severe health problems and reportedly was subjected to beatings and other mistreatment in prison, and family members had made desperate pleas for his release.
Mr. Wei's release now, soon after the China-United States summit meeting, may help clear the way for President Clinton's planned return visit next year. Chinese political observers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that for Mr. Jiang to have released Mr. Wei before the recent trip would have been interpreted at home as a sign of weakness, while the release now can be portrayed as a statesman-like act.
For Mr. Jiang, exiling Mr. Wei also removes from the scene a major irritant. In prison, he was an international cause celebre, even seen as a potential Nobel Peace Prize winner. Abroad, his impact may be muted, since the Chinese Government keeps such close control over the import of information.
President Jiang, during his American trip, insisted that dissidents like Mr. Wei were criminal, not political, prisoners and said their fates were up to the judicial system. He left open, however, the release of ailing dissidents on medical grounds.
In the introduction to a book of Mr. Wei's writings published earlier this year, Andrew Nathan, a political science professor at Columbia University, wrote of Mr. Wei, "The prisoner says things that cannot be allowed to be said, but has the cheek in doing so to break no laws, to cite the Communist classics, to take the government's boasts about human rights at face value."
In 1978 and 1979, a period known as the Democracy Wall movement, Mr. Wei dared to criticize the national leader, Deng Xiaoping, openly. In an essay titled "Do We Want Democracy or New Autocracy?" Mr. Wei charged that Mr. Deng, although lauded for loosening the economy, was only strengthening the Communist Party's political control. His most famous essay was his first, written in large characters on the Democracy Wall and titled "The Fifth Modernization: Democracy." This was a play on the official campaign for "four modernizations" in agriculture, industry, science and technology, and defense. Put on trial in 1979 for "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement," he was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
In a letter he wrote to Mr. Deng from prison after the June 1989 crackdown -- no one knows if it was delivered -- Mr. Wei wrote with characteristic directness: "So, now that you've successfully carried out a military coup to deal with a group of unarmed and politically inexperienced students and citizens, how do you feel?"
In 1993 Mr. Wei, well known abroad and a hero among the cadre of democracy activists at home, was freed on parole. His release coincided with China's ultimately unsuccessful application to become host of the 2000 Olympics.
Out of jail, Mr Wei continued to speak out. In early 1994, after he had dinner with the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights who was accompanying Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Beijing, Mr. Wei was rearrested and sentenced to an additional 14 years. The American Government was humiliated.
But now, China seems bent on forging positive relations with the United States, whose trade and investment it badly needs if it is to continue with the dramatic economic progress that is transforming the country and, many political experts say, preventing more widespread political dissent.
Discussing the possibility of Mr. Wei's release recently, a Chinese person who quietly nurses pro-democracy views said that of course he and others would be gratified to see Mr. Wei's terrible suffering end. But he noted that a few thousand other dissidents languish in jail and that in any case, such high-profile releases are simply gestures that the Government can offer and rescind at will. The Government, he said, despite recent efforts to improve judicial procedures, can still on political grounds arrest anyone it wants to at any time.
Wei Shanshan, Mr. Wei's youngest sister and a resident of Germany, had lobbied American officials to continue pushing Mr. Jiang to grant a medical parole for Mr. Wei, who had been jailed for all but six months of the last 18 years.
Otherwise, she said on the basis of a recent visit to him by other family members, he might die. "I do believe this visit of Jiang offers us the very last opportunity," Ms. Wei said in an interview on Oct. 24. "If we miss it, it may be the last." She met with the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, Stanley O. Roth, and John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary for Human Rights, as well as with National Security Council officials.
In 1993, Mr. Wei was diagnosed as suffering from coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and arrhythmia, an irregularity in the heartbeat. His family has also said that he suffers from arthritis and spine and neck problems.

HEADLINE: Hold Me! Squeeze Me! Buy a 6-Pack!

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
ON a blustery evening in August, six Manhattan women gathered in the air-conditioned studios of Focus Suites, a market-research company on Lexington Avenue where hand-picked groups meet to critique consumer products like soap or perfume or cereal.
The women sat on sofas and ate miniature quiches from paper napkins while Hazel Kahan, a market-research consultant, asked them questions about a bachelor friend of theirs. He had hired Ms. Kahan to convene the focus group of single women -- all of whom had shot down his efforts to begin a relationship -- and to answer questions like "How could he make himself more appealing?" and "Should he change his wardrobe, his hair, his laugh?" 
 While the women, who ranged from their mid-20's to their mid-30's, giggled and offered mostly genial advice ("Bolster your confidence" "Change your wardrobe"), they knew that the man in question sat behind a one-way mirror, watching their reactions. He was applying the principles that any company trying to sell toothpaste or CD players uses to shape a product for the marketplace. But in his case, the marketplace was a more personal one: the brutal dating world of Manhattan.
After the session, Ms. Kahan debriefed her client, a 30-ish author, who refused to allow his name to be used, to protect his privacy. "I said, 'This is what it means, and these are the implications for your future,' " Ms. Kahan said.
Influenced by the tidal wave of marketing and advertising tossed at them each day, Americans seem to be undergoing a curious transformation: personal identities are being swapped for the attributes of consumer products, as individuals come to see themselves increasingly as brands.
Taking a cue from Michael Jordan and Martha Stewart, celebrities who have spun off many-tentacled business empires based on their identities, and armed with magazine articles and books about the power of "the personal brand," individuals are using the rules of brand management to help shape their resumes, their personal images and even their social and marital lives.
Richard Kurtz, a 59-year-old market-research consultant in Manhattan, uses brand marketing to distinguish his work from other freelance consultants in his field. "Branding is the neon in your name," he said. "You go to the store, and there are all these different brands of mustard. Tell me, Am I French's, or am I Grey Poupon? How can I make people see me differently? How can I add value to me?"
In Seattle, Will Powers employed the principles used to shape corporate identities to improve his marriage. On a sheet of paper, under the heading "The product I'm selling to my wife," Mr. Powers wrote a list of attributes like "commitment" and "shared dreams" that he hoped would impress his customer.
"I asked her to write down what she wants from the product, which would be me," said Mr. Powers, 28. "And she generated her own attribute list for the brand, which included things like 'honest,' 'funny,' 'sympathetic.' "
What is going on here? To a certain extent, average Americans are trying to jump on the bandwagon that first got rolling about the time Calvin Klein placed his name on the rumps of millions of jeans wearers and that has since zoomed onward with a Martha Stewart magazine, television show and line of towels and linens.
Jane Pratt, the former editor of Sassy magazine, who went on to have two television talk shows ("Jane" and "The Jane Pratt Show") and to found a new magazine (also named Jane), recalled that a friend once advised against naming her first television show after herself. "He said, 'You're turning yourself into a product,' " Ms. Pratt recalled.
But today, no one she knows thinks it odd that her magazine is named after her or that the spine of the November-December issue is imprinted with the tag line "Take a Dip in Lake Me."
"That's the weirdest thing of all," Ms. Pratt said. "None of my friends think there's anything strange about it at all. We sort of expect that everybody will have something named after them at a certain point."
Celebrities and civilians alike seem to have borrowed one of the business world's buzzwords of the 90's -- "branding" -- to define their most personal selves.
"What marketing and brands have taught people to do is look at things and sum them up in an instant," said Nick Shore, a partner in the NickandTom Brand Agency, a firm that creates brand identities for products like Surge, Coca-Cola's teen-oriented soft drink. "For example, you can look at a person, see chinos, a baseball cap turned backward, T-shirt, and think, 'O.K., I got it.' It is one of the most fundamental plate-tectonic shifts going on in American culture right now."
Some experts are not so sanguine. Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the current interest in personal brands is the latest example of a 20th-century trend that began in 1937 with Dale Carnegie's motivational book "How to Win Friends and Influence People," which applied the techniques of the then-nascent advertising industry to personal relations.
"It has become increasingly necessary to navigate huge market bureaucracies and to market yourself within them and among them by seeming personable," Professor Miller said. It is profoundly cynical, he added, but reflects the huge power of commercials in American lives. "You are offering yourself as a commodity, as a thing," he said. "You're not a winning personality; you're a salable item. It represents a new level of self-dehumanization."
Last summer, Fast Company, a business magazine, published a special issue devoted to "The Brand Called You," and in it, Tom Peters, the business guru and best-selling author, wrote an article outlining the steps anyone can take to make himself or herself into a brand-name product. Hundreds of readers flooded the magazine's Web site with responses, anxious to learn more.
This month, Mr. Peters's latest book, "The Circle of Innovation" (Knopf), is out with a chapter called "Tommy Hilfiger Knows" that is devoted to the personal brand. (As for Mr. Hilfiger, this month he hired the William Morris Agency to develop a talk show called "Tommy TV.")
New York City, with its Empire State Building-size egos, is the birthplace of the personal brand. Last week, the gossip columnist Cindy Adams branded herself by introducing a perfume, Gossip by Cindy Adams. Donna Karan has extended her brand to a line of Timothy's coffee, despite the fact that she herself does not drink coffee.
Meanwhile, HarperCollins recently hired its first brand manager, Carl Raymond, whose job includes refashioning the images of formerly tweedy authors. When you see an author's name, the soft-spoken Mr. Raymond wants you to have an immediate, visceral reaction. If you catch a glimpse of a book by John Gray, the author of "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus," Mr. Raymond wants you to think of one word: hope.
"John Gray owns that word," he said. "And everyone needs" -- he paused, then pushed his voice a note or two higher -- "hope." Mr. Raymond is busy developing slogans for authors: "There is hope" for Mr. Gray and "Take it personally" for Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a radio personality and marriage and family therapist. His job is to make sure the phrases appear on every piece of literature, every book jacket and every T-shirt.
"What draws consumers to brands is that there is something tangible that comes to their minds when they see Gravy Train or Crest -- or John Gray," Mr. Raymond said. "Although our aim is not to treat John Gray as if he were dog food."
Back on Earth, mere teen-agers are also conceiving of themselves as brands. Jesse Daggett, a 17-year-old college freshman who lives in Salem, Ore., started to think of himself as a brand after he read Mr. Peters's article in Fast Company. At the time, Mr. Daggett was not looking to become a corporate executive or to market a line of athletic footwear; he was a clerk in a Dairy Queen.
"I realized that the best thing to do was to establish myself as a brand," Mr. Daggett said. "Everyone in the shop was a couple of years older than me, and I had to prove myself. To establish myself as an identity, who I am."
And Mr. Daggett, true to the marketing mindset, can nail down his personal brand in a few words: "I like to think of the brand Jesse this way," he said. "Hard worker. Putting yourself in charge. If something needs to be done, Jesse can do it and get it done and be the leader of the team. That's the Jesse brand."
Part of the reason that people no longer hesitate to think of themselves as products with labels is that advertisers have persuaded consumers over the last decade that brands, and products, have human qualities. Think of the Neon, a car that rolls onto your television screen and says, "Hi," or the Apple computer, whose smiley-face computer icon tells you when your laptop is warming up or shutting down.
"The most powerful brands have human qualities," said Scott Bedbury, a senior vice president of Starbucks. "And this is why there is a buzz these days about people being seen as brands."
Mr. Bedbury signed a six-figure contract this month with Little, Brown to write a book about the power of branding. "People like Martha Stewart and Michael Jordan are great examples of people transcending flesh and becoming brand concepts," he said. Mr. Bedbury's editor has encouraged him to devote ample space in his book to the creation and maintenance of the personal brand.
Although the rhetoric in the field is often high-flown, Mr. Kurtz, the freelance market-research consultant, remains humble: "If I wake up at 4 in the morning and say to myself, 'Hey, why am I not having a great month?' I think to myself, 'I've got to contact people, I've got to get moving, I've got to think about my brand.' Because my brand is me. If people buy my brand, if they hire me, that means they like me. They love me. They accept me. And everybody wants to be on life's short list. Everybody wants to be loved."
Mr. Kurtz's feelings disturb some marketing professionals, including Ms. Kahan, who conducted the focus group for the frustrated bachelor.
"I think it's really alarming that we let a market economy dictate our human relationships," Ms. Kahan said. "I think it's much more healthy for the human model to dictate to the business world than for the business model to inform human life."

In Refinancing, Homeowners Find a Source for Saving

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
A MINI-BOOM of mortgage refinancings has occurred in recent weeks, in large part because of the recent turmoil in the stock market.
The percentage of total mortgage dollars that were devoted to refinancings rose to 43.2 percent for the week ended Nov. 6, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. In the summer, that percentage was in the teens. 
 "Whenever you see lower interest rates, there is a spurt of refinancings," said David A. Lereah, chief economist at the mortgage bankers' group.
Mortgage rates have had their most stable year in a decade, fluctuating only about one percentage point, though they have moved down about a quarter point in recent weeks. The mortgage bankers' group says the current average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage is 7.28 percent.
Mr. Lereah said the recent drop was small but noted that 7.25 percent was an important threshold; rates dipped below that mark earlier this fall. "Psychologically, that's an important point with people, especially if they are sitting on the fence," he said.
The recent decline in rates resulted from the stock market's fall late last month, which prompted many investors to seek shelter in bonds. That drove bond prices up and yields down; mortgage rates often track the rate on the 10-year Treasury note.
Moreover, the decline in stocks also makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates to stem inflation. Indeed, the Fed's policy-making committee decided last week to leave rates unchanged.
Experts are divided on the future direction of interest rates. Some say rates will keep falling as long as inflation is dormant; others believe interest rates could rise, in part because refinancings could help spark consumer spending, eventually putting upward pressure on inflation.
"Interest rates probably don't have much more space to fall in a growing economy and are likely to rise as the Fed takes hold of the economic reins sometime next year," said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a mortgage analyst. "But that little bit of an increase probably won't take us past 8 percent."
Refinancings can save borrowers significant sums. At 7.25 percent, the monthly principal and interest payment is $682.17 on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000. For a similar loan at 7.50 percent the payment is $699.21. That $17 monthly savings may not sound like much, but it adds up to more than $6,100 over 30 years.
Most refinancings have been into 30-year fixed-rate loans, Mr. Gumbinger said, especially because rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages now rise from their low first-year teaser rates, often in the 5.65 percent range, to more than 8 percent the second year because they are linked to the one-year Treasury bill rate, about 5.41 percent now, plus a 2.75 percent premium.
The spread between long-term and short-term rates is narrow these days, Mr. Gumbinger explained. He said short-term rates, like that of the one-year Treasury, were being propped up by the Fed as an anti-inflation measure. And long-term rates, like that of the 10-year Treasury note, are low because investors are confident that inflation will remain in check.
Indeed, Mr. Gumbinger said many people who are refinancing had adjustable-rate mortgages with rates now higher than those on fixed-rate loans. "One-year A.R.M.'s are not the product right now," he said.
Some borrowers, though, are also taking out "5-1" and "7-1" loans, which stay fixed at rates lower than those for 30-year fixed-rate loans for five or seven years and then adjust annually. For example, at Homerica Mortgage, a mortgage banker in Harrison, N.Y., the rate is 6.6 percent on a "5-1" loan and 6.95 percent on a "7-1" loan.
Interest rates for home-equity loans and lines of credit have not declined as much as for mortgages, largely because they are linked to the short-term prime rate plus a premium. According to the Bank Rate Monitor, which follows interest rates, the national average interest rate on a home-equity line of credit is 8.40 percent.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a recent increase in the refinancing of home mortgages referred incorrectly to a formula for figuring interest rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. After a low, teaser rate in the first year, the rate often rises to the sum of two figures: the one-year Treasury bill rate plus a premium of 2.75 percentage points, not 2.75 percent.

401(k) Fees Nibble Now, With the Bite Felt Later

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
OVER try to find out how much of your 401(k) savings is being shaved off in fees?
High expenses can, over time, seriously reduce the magic of compound interest and leave you with a smaller nest egg for your old age. And the practice of making workers pay a growing portion of fees brought the Labor Department to hold hearings on the issue last week. 
 Workers typically do not know what fees they pay because Federal law does not require disclosure on the periodic statements they receive.
The range is wide. It is not common to find a 401(k) plan that has an annual cost of 5 cents for each $100 invested for administrative fees, though they do exist. But it is easy to find a plan that charges $2 a year for each $100 invested -- a difference that amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars over time.
Most Americans have about $1 per $100 taken annually from their 401(k) account in fees, according to Olena Berg, the Assistant Labor Secretary for Pensions. Testimony at last week's hearings showed that more than 90 percent of those fees are for investment management, with the rest going to cover the costs of keeping records, issuing statements and complying with Federal regulations.
Critics of fund managers say they are taking advantage of the ignorance of the company official who sets up a plan, lining their pockets with extraordinarily high fees. The fund managers themselves say their fees are highly competitive.
Workers who invest in mutual funds can roughly calculate their investment fees from annual disclosure statements required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but banks and insurance companies are exempt from this rule. And no plan has to disclose fees paid by each worker for record-keeping, preparing statements, legal costs and other administrative expenses.
This lack of disclosure is a key reason that the divide between the highest-cost plans and the least expensive is widening.
The biggest, smartest companies are using their economic sophistication and the clout of their huge funds to negotiate low-cost deals, while smaller and less aggressive employers often unwittingly agree to high fees, which are paid out of their workers' 401(k) savings.
Leaders of the mutual fund industry and several large professional and trade organizations, as well as consultants who advise small companies on retirement plans, all urged the Labor Department to require disclosure of total fees, saying it would help hold fees down.
The 28,000 401(k) savers at the Exxon Corporation pay about a nickel a year on each $100 in their 401(k) accounts, said James E. Bayne, the company's retirement funds manager and the chairman of the pension committee of the Financial Executives Institute.
Some workers at other companies, testimony showed, pay $2 per $100.
In dollars and cents, the difference between paying a nickel and paying $2 out of every $100 may seem small, but over time those differences become enormous. After 30 years, the worker who saves $5,000 annually, invests in stocks and pays the nickel fee will have more than $1 million, assuming a 10.9 percent rate of return. That is 53 percent more than someone in the same situation who pays fees at the $2 rate.
Michael P. Barry, a managing director of Bankers Trust, which manages the seventh-largest pool of 401(k) funds in the nation, said "the large corporate sponsors and providers are reinventing this market" by forcing down fees and emphasizing low-cost index funds.
Exxon, which Mr. Barry and others said was a leader in the drive to lower costs, tells workers about its super-low fees in its corporate newsletter. It charges no fees for two of its four investment options and it absorbs all administrative costs.
While tiny, Exxon's fees are not the lowest. Workers at Eastman Kodak pay just two pennies per $100 for its Standard & Poor's 500 index fund, one-tenth what Vanguard, the mutual fund company known for its low costs, charges retail customers of its S.& P. 500 index fund.
Myra R. Drucker, the Xerox Corporation's chief investment officer, said that her company had pushed down total 401(k) fees to as little as 17 cents per $100. She said that even Xerox's most expensive investment option, an international stock fund, costs only 79 cents per $100. That is less than half the cost to a retail customer, who is more expensive to service, typically has a smaller account and is more likely to move the money elsewhere.
LOW fees are not limited to corporate giants. Gencorp, the Ohio automotive and aerospace manufacturer, is less than a tenth the size of Xerox, but its fees are about 13 cents per $100, and the company charges workers for only half of that, said David K. McNiff, Gencorp's director of investment management.
The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, operates four mutual funds, charging its own 401(k) savers about 33 cents per $100, roughly one-third what it charges retail customers of its mutual funds.
Ms. Drucker, of Xerox, said that while many big companies "are focused on costs, in the small-plan market it is not as clear that the employers have the bargaining power or the understanding that they need to have" to get the best prices.
John Bohan, the Pillsbury Company's vice president for pension investments, said that "the small- to medium-size plans are the ones where the owner has neither the background nor the time to get the information to really understand pricing, and so when somebody comes in offering to serve him and his needs he often does not get the best deal, which is unfortunate for the employees."
Stephen J. Butler, president of the Pension Dynamics Corporation in Lafayette, Calif., who advises small employers on how to reduce costs, said high fees "are a form of misappropriation of plan assets."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the effects of annual fees on the value of workers' 401(k) plans referred incorrectly to the Exxon Corporation's plan. The company, not the employee, pays nearly all of the 5 cents in costs per $100 in each employee's account.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Charges Can Be Costly"
A seeminly small difference in fees charged on retirement savings investments can have a big impact down the road. Graph shows how the final nest egg would differ solely because of fees, for a person who saves $5,000 a year and gets an annual return of 10.92 percent, the average return for stocks over the last 71 years, according to Ibbotson Associates.

What Does The Audience Want?

BYLINE: By Geoffrey O'Brien

 BODY:
Movie makers who assume they know what the audience is looking for learn, more often than not, that they have misunderstood yet again. It could hardly be otherwise, when the spectators themselves scarcely know. We scan the abbreviated titles on the marquee of the 12-screen multiplex (Edge Game Kiss Girls Ice Storm Tibet) as if a secret message were encoded there, or roam disconsolately among the aisles of a video store crammed with movies we aren't quite in the mood for. The 20th century draws to a close amid a glut of product and a pervasive loss of surprise.
 We have seen all the old images -- from the parting of the Red Sea to the arrival of intelligent extraterrestrials -- and are still waiting for film makers to show what the new ones will look like. In the short term, we know all too well what to expect: more exploding helicopters, more meet-cute romances, more gross-out sight gags, more serial killers tracked down by more odd-couple buddies, more jaded yet photogenic teen-agers committing antisocial acts, more well-appointed, mildly spiced-up adaptations of Victorian and Edwardian novels. After 100 years of movie watching, it is perhaps hardly surprising to feel that the most obvious possibilities have been played out. The century of spectatorship that arrived with the dawn of movies and crested with the triumph of television rolls toward the exit in a world so full of screens and formats that the problem of what to show on them has become almost secondary. 
 Film makers, no doubt, had it easier in the beginning. Nothing had been used up yet: there was a whole world to plunder for surfaces and anecdotes, a civilization of stories and legends to adapt. Almost anything was beguiling, especially to an audience that might have been happy just to get out of the cold and into the cozy darkness of a nickelodeon. All was novelty: waves dashing against rocks, a weight lifter flexing his muscles, a child playing a practical joke on his grandmother. A basic vocabulary of movie possibilities -- the chase, the fight, the kiss, the dance -- was pretty much in place by 1905. So was the basic cinematic thrill: the transference that lets the spectator conquer space and time, sail across dizzying expanses of ocean and desert or linger to catch (in close-up) the whispered confidences of lovers.
 For most of the century, the movies never stopped changing, adding sound and color, new faces, new subjects. By now we yearn for leaps in narrative complexity and sensual elaboration of those earlier decades. It took only 30 years to go from Griffith's two-reel melodrama "The Lonedale Operator" to "Citizen Kane." Shouldn't the 56 years since Kane have taken us further into the future than we seem to have got, or is this as futuristic as it will ever get? The collisions are more lifelike, the aliens and dinosaurs blend more seamlessly with their surroundings, but it's all in the service of the same old stories. At times things seem to have gone in reverse as we watch movies -- "Speed" or "Air Force One" -- that resemble nothing so much as state-of-the-art elaborations of the formulas of "The Lonedale Operator."
 The spectator is always torn between the desire to move forward into the unknown and the desire to go back to the comfort of home; the movies often oblige by doing both at the same time. The "Star Wars" trilogy served up the future by infusing the form of 1930's Flash Gordon serials with a more complex, and moreinsidious, understanding of "the dark side." (And now, mildly revamped with a few fresh special effects, it serves it up for another generation.)
 "L. A. Confidential" marches boldly into the past, remaking the 50's in the image of 90's retro-noir, as if the Next Big Thing were the uncanny resurrection of Lana Turner and Chet Baker. The film's labyrinthine plot makes its nostalgic trappings new by juxtaposing them with horrific images (prisoners beaten by cops at a Christmas party, rats scampering from a rotted corpse) that would never have made it to the screen in the 50's. "Boogie Nights" carves out fresh cinematic territory by circling back to the world of 70's porno chic, a forbidden world now far enough in the past to be explored not only without anxiety but in a mood of comic detachment.
 What we want to see can only be defined in terms of what we have seen; it's hard to order what isn't on the menu yet. (Hence the 'Die Hard' on a bus variety of Hollywood shorthand.) Any discussion of what audiences want tends to become, by default, a discussion of what they already have -- the century's accumulation of dance numbers and jewel heists and dream sequences. Yet there's no way to measure how far even the most successful films may have fallen short of what spectators yearned for. Quantitative analysis of box-office results only confuses the issue. Take 1949: in a year remembered for such noirish classics as "Criss Cross," "The Set-Up," "White Heat" and "They Live by Night," the biggest draw was Larry Parks in the nostalgic musical "Jolson Sings Again." In 1969, slices of the Zeitgeist like "Monterey Pop," "Easy Rider" and "The Wild Bunch" trailed behind a Disney comedy about a self-motivated Volkswagen, "The Love Bug." By the same token, you might well ask if the deepest desires of 1996 can really be measured by its greatest hits, "Independence Day," "Twister" and "Mission: Impossible."
 But when it comes to deep desires, the spectators are as much in the dark as anyone. That's the way they like it: hoping for astonishment and knowing as little as possible about the details of what's coming up. Coming attractions! The promise in that once-magic phrase persists despite all disappointments. Maybe "The Fifth Element" will actually provide a persuasive glimpse (just as the director promised in his interviews) of life in the 23d century; maybe "Austin Powers" will restore the Carnaby Street of 1967 in all its mod splendor. We end up settling for whatever minor pleasures we can get -- in one case a comical drag queen in the middle of a space-age shoot-out; in the other an unheralded turn by Burt Bacharach -- while continuing to hope for the miraculous, an alternative world we haven't yet imagined. Such a miracle doesn't have to be expensive; it can be as ordinary as a bunch of laid-off steel workers in "The Full Monty," learning to take their clothes off without embarrassment as they turn themselves into male strippers.
 "The Full Monty," compared with large Hollywood machines like "The Game" or "The Peacemaker," is positively Luddite in its poverty of means. Its premise -- a group of otherwise hapless individuals who by banding together triumph over their difficulties -- evokes a long line of British movies of various genres. "The Full Monty" makes the formula new by adapting it to the abandoned factories, the unemployment offices and the rundown houses of England's depressed industrial North -- everything associated with the kitchen sink naturalism that displaced those earlier, more heroic British films. Initiated into a scene of unrelieved drabness and despair, we watch as male striptease becomes the healing ritual that restores a lost community, and we are seduced into accepting a resolution that could happen only in the movies.
 We are seduced because we want to be, having come to need the imaginary space on the other side of the screen in the same way that apartment dwellers need mirrors to make their interiors less cramped. Our secret dream is to walk through the mirror and find that the space on the other side is just as real and that we can live there. An ever-vaster entertainment industry does everything it can to make that dream feel real, as it goes about constructing bubble domes within which we can sit for the next thousand years watching variations on all the old favorites. If the variations begin to seem increasingly homogenized, it's only because a globalized industry inevitably favors movies with simplified plots and stripped of local references that impede penetration of foreign markets.
 It won't happen quite so neatly, of course; history is never that cooperative. For a slight sense of where the new plots and the new images might be coming from, you can look (if you can find them) at some of the films that rarely, if ever, make it to the multiplex: films like "Destiny," by the Egyptian director Youssef Chahine, in which the theological disputes of 12th-century Andalusia prove uncomfortably, and violently, contemporary; "Underground," Emir Kusturica's boisterous and confetti-strewn waking dream of Yugoslavia's bloody unraveling, or Abbas Kiarostami's "Taste of Cherry," with its vision of the desolate Iranian spaces (so desolate they beckon to suicide) where urban outskirts merge with wasteland.
 What these films have in common is their acceptance of sudden, drastic change as a permanent possibility; the dangers they contemplate are not generated in special-effects labs. The moment it seems there are no new stories to tell might turn out to be precisely the moment when the world is once again preparing the unimaginable, whether the audience wants it or not.

HEADLINE: Brave New World of Competition

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN BAUMGAERTEL 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
In the display window of a little corner bookstore hangs an oversized question mark, a poster that Erika Tapp, one of the managers, put up several years ago to attract customers. But recently, this symbol has assumed a significance that Mrs. Tapp did not anticipate: She is beginning to fear for her store's survival.
Mrs. Tapp and her colleague, Irmgard Irle, run the Autorenbuchhandlung, or Authors' Bookstore, a small but well-stocked cooperative in the residential West End of Frankfurt. Their vocation is serving customers with rarified tastes -- readers of experimental poetry and prose by authors like the avant-garde poet Kurt Mautz or the novelist Peter O. Chotjewitz, whose 1968 novel "Island" put him among the pioneers of new literary forms. 
 In much of Europe, booksellers like Mrs. Tapp and Mrs. Irle are convinced that no one can stay in business selling arcane works at full price if some nearby rival offers discounted best sellers. Until now that has not happened. But Mrs. Tapp and Mrs. Irle are concerned that such competition may arise as top officials of the European Commission, under the banner of promoting free trade, take aim at one of the most venerable practices in German publishing: price fixing.
At issue is an age-old industry practice known as Buchspreisbindung, under which booksellers and publishers mutually agree not to mark book prices below the publisher's suggested retail price. The practice, which includes books sold in Austria and Switzerland as well, has been in place for 110 years, but has run afoul of free-trade advocates since the entry of Austria into the European Union in 1996.
While there are similar systems in place in most European countries, the German agreement is the only voluntary price-fixing mechanism that applies across national boundaries, which puts it within the authority of the commission, the executive arm of the European Union. European competition rules generally prohibit price-fixing across borders within the European Union, but the only analogous case so far, the Net Book Agreement in Britain and Ireland, was abandoned in 1995 before the commission could rule.
In this case, though, the industry seems set on defending its current practice as necessary to protect Germany's literary variety. "Books are not just commodities," said Eugen Emmerling, a spokesman for the German association of booksellers and publishers, in an interview. "They are also carriers of information and opinions. This is also about freedom of speech."
The agreement has helped create a large network of small and medium-sized bookstores across the country. There are 2,500 publishers listed in the agreement and more than 9,000 independent retailers.
Whereas production of new titles in the United States has remained stagnant at around 45,000 to 50,000 a year since the book market was liberalized in the 1970's, Germany has tripled its output to well over 70,000, putting it in third place behind China and Britain. And while the retailing sector as a whole suffered a downturn in the last few years, book sales actually expanded to more than 17 billion marks, or about $10 billion, in 1996, up from less than 15 billion marks in 1992.
But even with the price agreement long in place, small stores have been under pressure. Chains like Thalia in Hamburg, modeled after American giants like Barnes & Noble, are increasingly displacing small booksellers in the big cities, while on-line and mail order book businesses are augmenting their market share.
Regensburg-based ABC Bucherdienst, Germany's leading on-line bookstore, doubled its revenue to 6 million marks, or $3.5 million, last year, while Amazon.com, the American Internet bookseller, announced plans for a distribution center in Germany. And in a display of the trend toward larger bookstores, Hugendubel, a Munich-based bookstore chain, recently opened a 40,000-square-foot megastore in Berlin.
An end to the price-fixing, booksellers say, would expose them to a price war in which only big chains could survive.
Mrs. Tapp and her colleague are both shareholders in the Authors' Bookstore, a cooperative owned collectively by booksellers and writers. Founded in 1972 to counter fears of a growing trend toward mass production, the idea of this joint venture is to showcase books that have little or no advertising budget and would probably not make it into the bigger stores.
"The market for demanding literature is always very limited," said Klaus Schoffling, managing director of Schoffling & Company, a small Frankfurt publisher. "If the price-fixing falls, we would lose about one-third of our customers."
Publishers like Mr. Schoffling fear that a concentration in the book market would leave them at the mercy of a few major players who could dictate conditions.
So far, even retailers that stand to profit from a liberalization have refrained from attacking the price agreement. "In purely economic terms, we would be better off without the price-fixing," said Heinrich Hugendubel, owner and managing director of the Hugendubel chain. "But the variety of the book market would certainly suffer. It is a question of our cultural responsibility."
Privately, however, not everybody in the business is as high-minded. "Many of my colleagues are for a removal of the price agreement," said Benjamin Taschen, founder of the Cologne-based publisher Taschen-Verlag. "But if you say that in public, you are a persona non grata. The price-fixing is a sacred cow."
Andre Rettberg, managing director of Librodisk, an Austrian retailing chain that sells books, compact disks, videos and home office supplies, has vowed to bring the issue before the European courts if the commission fails to end the agreement. In the long run, Mr. Rettberg argues, the book market will benefit from competition.
The European Commission has declined to comment on the case until a final ruling is made by the end of the year. But whatever decision is made by Brussels, Mrs. Tapp has made up her mind. "I would not want to work in one of those big chains, where I have no relation to the books I am selling," she said. "For them, books are just sheets of paper."

HEADLINE: Anna's World;
In Industry of Glamour, Editor of Vogue Turns a Lot of Heads

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
It was fashion week, and there was Vogue's editor, Anna Wintour, at the Marc Jacobs show in her usual front- row seat, wearing her signature sunglasses and a Marc Jacobs gray waffle-knit cashmere sweater.
When Ms. Wintour went backstage after the show earlier this month to congratulate the designer, there was Marc Jacobs, air-kissing well-wishers in the same gray waffle-knit cashmere sweater. 
 On the cover of November's issue of Vogue, there is Stella Tennant, the model, smiling in rum raisin lipstick -- and Marc Jacobs's gray waffle-knit cashmere sweater.
This is the glamorous, cozy world of Ms. Wintour. Perhaps no other magazine editor wields as much influence over the industry the magazine covers. Perhaps no other magazine editor is as personally involved in the publication's subject matter. Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to tell where Vogue ends and Ms. Wintour begins. But between them, the editor and her magazine leave no part of the $161 billion fashion industry untouched.
Now in her 10th year as Vogue's editor in chief, Ms. Wintour has been both deified and demonized. But however people in the industry feel about Ms. Wintour personally, just about all agree she has taken Vogue to a whole new blockbuster level as the bible of fashion -- and that she has become an icon in the process.
"She has the star quality; she is a star," said the designer Oscar de la Renta. "There has never been a Vogue as important as Vogue is now."
So far this year, advertisers have spent $124 million in Vogue, according to Competitive Media Reporting, an ad research firm in New York. And Vogue's publisher, Ronald A. Galotti, said he expected to end the year with close to 2,800 ad pages, making 1997 the best financial year in Vogue's 105-year history.
When Ms. Wintour took over the magazine in July 1988 -- after an undistinguished tenure as editor of House & Garden that followed a stint as editor of British Vogue -- American Vogue had lost its edge.
"Vogue needed fixing," said S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast and its parent Advance Publications, who said moving Ms. Wintour had to do with needing her at Vogue, not removing her from what was then titled HG.
Competition in the field has intensified since Ms. Wintour joined Vogue. Elle magazine -- which had threatened to unseat Vogue just before Ms. Wintour took over -- beat out Harper's Bazaar for the No. 2 spot in 1994 and now has 34.6 percent of the market (Vogue has 41.9 percent; Harper's Bazaar 23.5 percent), according to Competitive Media Reporting.
In addition, magazines like Marie Claire and Mirabella have been nipping at Vogue's heels. And television entertainment news shows have come to treat the world of fashion as the new Hollywood.
But with a circulation of 1.1 million, Vogue for the moment seems secure in its position as the industry heavyweight. A strong economy and Vogue's aggressive ad sales have helped the magazine, but some say Ms. Wintour's visibility and mystique are integral to its success.
"She is a major player," said Fern Mallis, the executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. "Her influence is terribly important to our industry. Everybody in our business wants to have Anna on their side and to do something that pleases her."
 
Vogue: Powerhouse In Fashion Industry
Ms. Wintour's power stems in large part from her power base. As the Conde Nast flagship, Vogue is able to pay top dollar for location shoots, photographers, models, even the paper it is printed on. But because the wafer-thin, neatly groomed, meticulously appointed Ms. Wintour has become such a public figure, the industry has become as enthralled with her personal style as it is with her magazine.
"She's more than just the editor in chief of Vogue," said Arie Kopelman, the president and chief operating officer of Chanel. "She has become a persona."
Gossip columns and television entertainment news shows seem to chronicle her every public appearance. Photographers at the fashion shows flash their bulbs in Ms. Wintour's face as often as they do Madonna's. Designers look to her for ideas about materials, models and photographers. Retail executives look to her for advice on how to stock their stores. And people in the fashion business just plain look at her.
"The Red Sea parts when she walks through the room," said Andre Leon Talley, a contributing editor at Vogue who has worked with Ms. Wintour for 14 years.
Her look has been copied the world over: page-boy haircut, big Chanel dark glasses, slim-legged pants, short skirts, stiletto heels with bare legs, tight sweaters.
"The haircut and the sunglasses we use in a lot of our ads and on our models," said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director for Bloomingdale's. "We have done windows that purposely emulate her look. The fashion office looks to Anna to see what kind of accessories she's wearing. She's a taste maker."
 
Advertiser Needs, Editorial Decisions
People notice what she is wearing, how she wears a Calvin Klein outfit to the Calvin Klein show at 11 A.M. and arrives at the Donna Karan show the same day at 5 P.M. decked out in Donna Karan.
Ms. Wintour describes this as a routine gesture of respect. But when she wears a designer's clothes, it registers as considerably more than just a courtesy. "For her to have my sweater on, when she could be wearing anything in the world -- it's pretty great," Mr. Jacobs said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Seeing Ms. Wintour wear certain designers (Mr. Jacobs, Chanel, Calvin Klein) and invite them to her home for parties, some may cry favoritism. And the fashion press has long been suspected of a quid pro quo when it comes to designer's advertisements: I'll give you this many pages of ads if you feature my clothes in the magazine. But Ms. Wintour insists that none of this influences her editorial decisions.
"Most of our major advertisers are people we put in the magazine anyway," said Ms. Wintour, wearing a loden green suit with fur collar and spiked leather boots in a recent interview at her Madison Avenue office. "It's a balancing act; you can't only think about your advertisers."
That said, all other things being equal -- if, she is deciding between two beaded evening dresses of comparable quality -- Ms. Wintour said she would go with the advertiser's. "If I don't, I'll hear about it," she said.
Among fashion magazines, this seems to have become the conventional wisdom. "This is a business, and we are obligated in our business to be conscious of the people who support us," Mr. Galotti said. "If we have the same two dresses, I would hope in every instance we would choose our customer's -- and do."
Nevertheless, there are designers, like Mr. Jacobs, who do not advertise in the magazine, and have still received a generous share of coverage. "We don't have the money; our fashion show is our advertising," Mr. Jacobs said. "It does not govern what Anna shows or what she pushes."
Indeed, Vogue under Ms. Wintour has become known for championing struggling newcomers and helping them along the way, like John Galliano, who -- despite hard times -- rose to become the designer at Givenchy and, recently, Christian Dior.
"We kept putting his clothes in the magazine," Ms. Wintour said.
People in the fashion business say this apparent blurring of lines goes with the territory. Vogue cannot pretend to be an observer, they say. It has a vested interest in the health of the industry, the success of designers, the strength of retail sales.
"Just the way the staff of Variety, I suppose, live and socialize with movie people, we're involved with retailers, designers, fashionable people," Mr. Newhouse said. "Does it bother me? No. I don't think issues of great ideological substance are involved."
And Ms. Wintour makes no bones about where her loyalties lie. "Designers have become really good friends of mine," she said. "I don't apologize for who my friends are."
 
Beauty and Style Are Supreme Values
Because of Ms. Wintour's close relationship with the fashion side of her magazine, some say Vogue's features department has become something of a poor stepchild. And there has been considerable turnover among editors over the last several years. Several former editors interviewed, all of whom insisted on anonymity, said that Ms. Wintour's criteria for articles required that profile subjects be famous, rich or beautiful.
"You can't mention the middle class," one former editor said.
If an article is proposed on someone less than attractive, one former editor recalled, Ms. Wintour has been known to say, "Have you seen her? She's hideous.' "
Editors say Ms. Wintour has killed articles because the accompanying photographs showed unattractive people. They also say that she hires people based on looks. "People who work there have to look a certain way," a former editor said. "If somebody hasn't changed their appearance within six months of getting there, something isn't going right."
While Ms. Wintour said that appearance did not play a role in features content, she said it could be a consideration in hiring. "If we're talking about fashion editors, on the whole it is important to me that they have a sense of style," she said. "And on the editorial side, after a few months they will end up looking like Vogue. It just rubs off that way."
Over the years, people in the industry have become fixated on Ms. Wintour's personal life as well as on her personal fashion style. Much has been made of her potential rivalry with Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar; of her frostiness, which inspired the phrases Nuclear Wintour and Wintour of Our Discontent; of the sunglasses that render her inscrutable, inaccessible.
 
Brusque or Shy? Well, Intimidating.
To some extent, it seems Ms. Wintour's reputation for brusqueness is grounded in reality. "She's basically warmhearted and kind, but she can be the ice maiden," Mr. Ruttenstein said. "If one wants to get friendly with her, you have to wait for her to come to you."
Her colleagues and associates describe her as direct, demanding and involved in every detail. "You know what she wants; she makes it very clear," said Katherine Betts, Vogue's fashion news director. "She's very tough. She can be intimidating, if you don't understand where she's coming from."
And some say that she inspires fear, that people at the magazine and in the industry have been known to quiver in her presence. "People are always afraid of icons, and Anna has become an icon," said Patrick McCarthy, the chairman and editorial director of Fairchild Publications, which publishes Women's Wear Daily. "But I don't think she uses her power unwisely."
Much of the criticism leveled at Ms. Wintour seems to stem simply from a need to knock her off her pedestal and evades the question whether she behaves as a male executive would.
"People say that about anybody who works hard and does well," Ms. Mallis said. "Those characterizations are meaningless. People are incessantly curious about the people they can't get close to."
Moreover, while it may be difficult to imagine a woman of such coiffed control waking up with flyaway hair, talking with food in her teeth, or breaking down in tears, the London-born Ms. Wintour, 48, is allegedly human. She takes her children to school, helps them with homework (she has a daughter, 10, and a son, 11) and says she enjoys a loving relationship with her husband, David Shaffer, the chief of child psychiatry at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
Nevertheless, there is a public image to keep up. Ms. Wintour gets her hair done every morning at home. Conde Nast gives her a clothing allowance that Ms. Wintour would describe only as "generous." She shops by checking off choices in designer's "look books," which catalogue their collections. If designers refuse to accept payment for their clothes, Ms. Wintour said she made a contribution to their favorite charities. She also borrows outfits for various events and gives them back.
And while Ms. Wintour seems a bit weary of Wintour lore, it does not seem to dampen her passion for the job. From the time she dropped out of high school -- presumably a difficult thing to do as the daughter of Charles Vere Wintour, a prominent British newspaper editor, and Eleanor Trego Baker Wintour, the daughter of a Harvard law professor -- Ms. Wintour has been devoted to fashion. Even a promising career as a sprinter failed to grab her.
Part of this may have had to do with the fact that her siblings were academic stars who used to rib her with messages like, "Are you at the hairdresser or the dry cleaner?"
"I didn't feel I could compete," Ms. Wintour said. "So I went the other way."

Barclays Said to Discuss A Merger With NatWest
Barclays and National Westminster, two of Britain's largest financial institutions, are discussing a merger that would be worth more than $20 billion and would vault the merged concern to the top of the British banking industry, bank advisers say. 
 But several factors make it likely that a deal will not be completed soon, if at all. The advisers say that National Westminster has not welcomed the proposal and that British regulators may balk at the enormous size of the merged bank, which would have assets of 371 billion, or $627 billion.

HEADLINE: America's Energy Independence

 BODY:
The worldwide scramble to develop new and existing energy sources has become a driving force in contemporary foreign policy. The Clinton Administration, building on America's dual role as the world's largest energy producer and largest energy consumer, has made itself a main player in this new world energy game, promoting increased production at home and abroad. Its sensible goal is to lessen the country's vulnerability to pressures from energy exporters and protect Washington's freedom to make foreign policy based on larger American and global interests.
Global energy supplies are not tight now, but demand is rising quickly, especially in areas of robust economic growth, like the United States, China and Southeast Asia. Last year, the world consumed just over 70 million barrels of oil every day. That is projected to rise to nearly 105 million barrels by 2015. Proven worldwide reserves are now about one trillion barrels, a figure that tends to rise over time with new exploration, cheaper extraction methods and changes in price. 
 America's daily oil consumption was just over 18 million barrels last year, up nearly 10 percent from 1991. Without significant new gains in conservation and efficiency, the United States can be expected to consume more than 22 million barrels by 2015. Imports have been rising even more sharply, and now account for just over half the oil the country uses.
The Administration is right to emphasize developing new low-cost foreign sources. The United States learned the perils of overdependence on Persian Gulf supplies during the 1970's Arab oil embargo.
But there is no strategic justification for the favors, like reduced royalty payments, that the Administration and Congress have been lavishing on domestic producers. The United States can retain its energy independence while relying on foreign sources of supply, leaving much of its own untapped wealth in the ground as a strategic reserve. The Administration has also failed to focus on more efficient use of existing energy supplies and on stronger conservation efforts, whether through taxes, regulation or market-based incentives.
Diversification is not the only motive behind the race for new supplies. There is worry that prices will rise if global consumption grows as rapidly as predicted. Meanwhile, the investment climate has been transformed by political changes in oil regions, like the collapse of Communism in Russia and the Caspian Basin and Latin America's more welcoming attitude toward foreign investment.
The Administration's policies have produced good results in Venezuela, from which the United States now imports more oil than it does from Saudi Arabia. Since 1995, American companies have helped Venezuela sharply increase its production capacity. Washington has promoted business partnerships with Russia's oil and gas industry, in the hope that American technology will help Russia pump more energy at lower cost from aging wells.
Washington has also been wooing the newly independent governments of the Caspian Basin, like Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, all of which sit astride rich energy deposits or vital pipeline routes. Rightly, it has pressed the case of American companies seeking a share of Caspian energy rights, encouraged the removal of regulatory obstacles and sought consistent standards for cross-border pipeline routes.
But except for Georgia, Caspian area governments have shown scant tolerance for democracy and human rights and have tried to use their leverage with Washington to deflect American pressures on these issues. The Administration should be cautious about the tradeoffs it makes to smooth access to oil. One aim of energy independence is to gain more freedom to pursue larger national goals. Washington should not subordinate these goals to a mindless rush for new energy suppliers.

HEADLINE: Trying to Use the Saw But Spare the Forests;
80 Years Later, Logging Rebounds

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: FISHKILL, N.Y., Nov. 12

 BODY:
A half-ton log of white oak cut from a Hudson Valley tree thumped from a sorting rack into the mud. "That one's going to Spain," said Brian Arico as he pulled a lever that sent another log rolling in front of him.
Next in line on the rack were several logs of red oak, twice as thick as telephone poles, cut north of Danbury, Conn. "All this red oak's going to Japan and Indonesia," said Mr. Arico, 32, a former logger who has built a thriving company here 50 miles north of New York City, where he exports the hidden bounty of the region's rebounding forests to buyers around the world. 
 Eight decades after the last wave of clear-cutting for farmland and charcoal sheared the forests of New York and Connecticut, oak, maple, cherry, tulip poplar and other trees have matured into lofty stands that are prized on the growing world market for logs and lumber.
As a result, almost invisibly, a substantial logging industry has returned to the wooded areas ringing New York City, with chainsaw-wielding crews offering landowners thousands of dollars to extract valuable trees in areas as close to the city as Westchester and Fairfield County, Conn.
The re-emergence of logging has been driven in part by growing demand for maple and oak, partly because of changing tastes in places like Japan, where the blond wood is now favored over darker, tropical wood varieties, according to several forestry economists. New York and Connecticut have also seen a sharp rise in the harvest of softwood trees like pine, because of sharply reduced cutting on Federal lands in the Pacific Northwest.
The trade means that wooded lots in the region -- if properly managed -- can represent a bonanza for property owners, providing steady income for decades. But it has also spurred some owners to do "liquidation cuts," in which all the valuable trees are taken at once, with no thought to the ecology of the forest.
State environmental officials in New York and Connecticut have created programs to encourage logging methods that keep the forests healthy. Nonetheless, unscrupulous logging crews occasionally cruise neighborhoods to dangle offers of big money, and leave ragged, muddy messes behind. In some cases, timber theft occurs when a cutting crew strays across a property line, lured by a prime specimen of cherry or oak.
Many communities, concerned about the impact of such cutting, have enacted ordinances that limit, or even prohibit, logging. The moves to limit logging have also been driven by the widespread perception among suburbanites that all logging is akin to the destructive practices highlighted in films about the deforestation of the Amazon region or the Pacific Northwest, state environmental officials say.
But state officials and many loggers say that predatory practices are the exception, and that local laws are stifling what could be a profitable and environmentally sound business.
Unlike the clear-cutting in the rain forest, in most cases in the New York region only mature trees are taken, allowing smaller trees to soak up the sunlight flowing through the new gaps in the leafy canopy, and potentially providing another crop of wood 10 or 15 years down the line.
"People think logging is a lot of greed and mess, but if you do it right it helps the animals and the woods," said Michael Shultis, a logger who scours the Catskills for prime stands.
He and other people in the industry say that logging a standing forest is far better than having it sold off to developers, who are increasingly subdividing the land.
"That is a one-way street, and then we've lost a resource forever," said Jeffrey Wiegert, a senior forester for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Mr. Wiegert helps run a program that offers landowners tax breaks for long-term commitments to forest harvesting.
Recently, Mr. Wiegert hiked into the woods to oversee a crew completing a three-week cutting job at Camp Surprise Lake, a 638-acre summer camp near the Putnam County village of Cold Spring. Michael Ferrucci, a forester from Madison, Conn., had drawn up a decadeslong management plan for the site, leaving a mix of mature and younger trees that would provide harvests well into the next century.
"They're going to smooth the ruts, lay down mulch and seed," Mr. Ferrucci said of the cutting crew's work. "In a couple of years, you won't know they were here."
Squatting on a pile of freshly cut logs that was headed for a sawmill upstate, Mr. Ferrucci carefully counted rings, finding that almost every tree had lived 88 years. "That was probably the last clear-cut for charcoal for the foundries in Cold Spring," Mr. Ferrucci said.
Since that time, forests across New York State have rebounded. In all, the state's forest cover has more than tripled in this century, from 20 percent 100 years ago to 62 percent today.
Mr. Ferrucci said that the history of the forests -- reclaiming what had been open fields -- also helped shape the stands into the valuable resource they have become. Red oak, now prized overseas, has become a dominant species here because it is one of the first type of tree to colonize abandoned fields, he said.
Outside of areas like the Adirondacks, where trees are grown for paper pulp, just about the only clearcutting these days occurs when a forested tract is bought by a developer. Because of this kind of cutting, Westchester, Rockland and other counties near New York City are seeing a net loss of woodlands for the first time in this century, according to state forestry statistics.
Despite the demand for local lumber, the potential for a suburban homeowner to profit by cutting trees is somewhat limited. Some loggers eschew heavily populated areas to avoid hidden hazards that sometimes lurk inside tree trunks. Robert Dermer, who owns a small sawmill, Board Silly, in Ridgefield, Conn., said that suburban trees frequently held nails, screws and other metal objects that could shatter saw blades. "It can be a hook for a hammock or a swing," he said. "Last week one of those porcelain insulators tore us up for a day."
And most logging companies, averse to taking costly trucks and other large equipment into suburban areas, will not approach a landowner with a lot smaller than 10 acres or so. But some do. In eastern Connecticut, David Trowbridge, who works for a large logging company during the week, spends weekends hauling logs from small lots using a team of oxen, to limit the environmental damage from running big machines in the forest.
The bustling export business in hardwood is still largely hidden, and thus continues to take many residents of the suburbs near New York City by surprise.
A few years ago, Michael Morris, a freelance writer, prepared to build a house on his forested two-and-a-half-acre lot in the Westchester town of Ossining. A grove of old tulip poplar trees, some nearly a yard across at the base, stood on the house site, he said, so he invited two sawmills to bid on the timber.
The trees were cut and hauled away. Later, Mr. Morris said, he thought it might be nice to buy some of the milled lumber back to use in the house he was building. "I called the mill," he recalled, "but they said 'You're too late.' They'd already sold all the logs and shipped them to Japan."
Thomas Birch, who works for the United States Forest Service, said it was the Japanese who fueled the last big export boom for hard maple -- which is New York's state tree and is also called sugar maple -- in the 1960's and early 70's. "That's when the Japanese discovered bowling," he said. The wood went into bowling-alley floors and bowling pins.
While in some cases the finished product of the state's harvested wood -- furniture, flooring and the like -- comes back to consumers in the United States, much of it ends up in homes in Japan, in furniture stores in Milan or in vineyards in France.
The white oak being exported by Mr. Arico in Fishkill was slated to be cut into staves in Spain, bound into casks and shipped to a French vineyard to age wine. "They love the taste of our trees," Mr. Arico said.

Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Money Can Grow on Trees"
As the global demand for light-colored wood increases, owners of woodland property in the lower Hudson Valley, where much of this wood grows, may see significant income from their land. Not every tree is worth a fortune, however, and prices vary with wood quality. Tree value should be assessed by a professional forester.
 
Wood quality indicators
 
Bad
 MANY BRANCHES -- Indicate knots in wood grain.
 TRUNK HOLES -- May indicate that the tree is hollow.
 
Good
 HIGH BRANCHES -- Branches start at least 16 feet from the ground.
 STRAIGHT TRUNK -- At least 16 inches in diameter at chest height.
 
Valuable types
Typical pre-cut prices for average-to high-quality trees.
 WHITE OAK -- About $50-$100 per tree.
 RED OAK -- About $100-$200.
 SUGAR MAPLE -- About $100-$200.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Tame the Beast

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
It is becoming an intolerable threat to American interests and world stability. President Clinton is going to have to deal with it unilaterally, before its reckless, irresponsible, dictatorial leadership destroys us all. Things can't be allowed to continue like this, with all talk and no action. Whatever powers the President needs to meet this threat are fine with me. Whatever it takes, baby, whatever it takes. Because this out-of-control beast has got to be stopped.
I'm talking about the U.S. Congress. 
 If you just took the first 435 names in the phone book, surely, surely you could come up with a more intelligent, worldly body than the 435 narrow-minded, shortsighted, weak-kneed, navel-gazing characters now representing the American people in the House of Representatives. Thank goodness this Congress adjourned Friday for vacation. Who knows what it would have done with another week.
As it was, the Congress spent its last week barring the President from signing any more free-trade agreements, barring the President from paying America's overdue U.N. dues -- at a time when the U.S. is trying to rally the U.N. to deal with Iraq so the U.S. won't have to act unilaterally -- and barring the President from adding $3.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund so that the I.M.F. can better deal with global financial meltdowns before they hit America's shores. Both the I.M.F. and U.N. payments are being held hostage by Newt Gingrich until Mr. Clinton gives in to demands of Republican anti-abortion fanatics.
Let's look at the least understood of these issues: the money to the I.M.F. What Congress does not understand is that, geopolitically speaking, we are in a somewhat new world today. During the cold war, it was regional military conflicts -- from El Salvador to Angola to Vietnam -- that tended to get globalized and regional economic crises, such as in Brazil or the Philippines, that got ghettoized. This was because in the cold war the two superpowers took sides in every regional conflict, making each one a potential global crisis.
Today, it's just the opposite. Because of the absence of any global U.S.-Soviet competition, regional conflicts -- Albania, Algeria, Bosnia -- tend to get ghettoized. Now it is the regional economic crises that get globalized, because of the increasing interconnectedness of markets and information. The domino theory belongs to economics today, not politics.
The shakiest, most important domino out there now is South Korea. You almost wonder today whether South Korea will collapse before North Korea. South Korea is suffering through a string of large corporate bankruptcies and bank defaults. Its corporations, notorious for dubious bookkeeping practices, owe at least $150 billion to foreign banks, many of them Japanese. South Korean investment banks are also big holders of speculative Russian and Asian stocks and bonds, which have recently soured. If South Korea totters, it will hit Japan's banks. And if Japan's banks weaken, they will have to sell some of their U.S. stocks, bonds and T-bills. And if the Japanese yen weakens, it will balloon the U.S. trade deficit, and set off another bunch of dominoes. Indonesia, which owes $100 billion to foreigners, is the other shaky domino.
It would be nice to just say to the South Koreans or Indonesians: "You made your mess; you clean it up." But if they topple, it won't just hit them or Billionaire Bob on Wall Street. It will also hit Joe Sixpack on Main Street. Because Billionaire Bob's trust fund and Joe Sixpack's pension fund are in the same mutual funds.
The problems of Indonesia, Thailand and Korea are largely problems of bad governance, corruption, insider dealings and under-regulated banking systems. They are problems that can only be solved by getting into the internal wiring of these countries and repairing both their software and hardware. The U.S. can't do that -- not without triggering a real backlash. That requires an impartial international institution: one that has both the know-how to fix bad software and the financial clout to tell these countries that unless they make painful internal reforms, they will suffer badly, but that if they do the right thing, the I.M.F. will help cushion the pain.
But if the I.M.F. is disempowered or underfunded, the U.S. will have to deal with the situation itself or just let the dominoes slam into us -- and slam they will. But don't fret, the Congress will take care of us.

HEADLINE: IRAQ SENDS SIGNAL IT DOES NOT WANT TO FIGHT WITH U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 16

 BODY:
In signs that both Iraq and the United States would like to step back from another conflict in the Persian Gulf, Iraq sent signals today that it did not want a military confrontation, and the United States persuaded Russia, once Iraq's strongest ally, to press Saddam Hussein to back down in the dispute over weapons inspections.
In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that at a Cabinet meeting President Hussein "stressed that Iraq was not seeking a confrontation with the American administration." 
 And Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, in an interview with Le Figaro in Paris, said Iraq would readmit American arms inspectors if the United Nations agreed to change the makeup of the inspection teams, with equal representation given to each permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. That offer was rejected by American and United Nations officials, who said that Iraq should not dictate who is on the teams.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, speaking in Kuwait before flying here for meetings with Saudi officials, explained the American request to Russia by saying, "In our effort to build diplomatic pressure, we look to Russia and France, because of their unique ability to communicate with Saddam Hussein, to convince him that the only way out is to change course."
France, like Russia, has long ties of sympathy and commerce to Iraq, and American officials said that French leaders are also considering a separate approach to Mr. Hussein. But the French commitment to do so was "less clear" than Moscow's, a senior American official said.
"The Russians in particular and the French to some extent have had influence over Saddam Hussein in the past," said the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin. "The idea is that they would be in the best position to convey to him the steeliness of the will of the international community to resolve this problem."
The Russian intervention is another indication of American reluctance to get into a military confrontation with Mr. Hussein that could break international solidarity.
"When we feel we've exhausted all diplomatic options, you'll know it," a senior American official said. "But we're taking a deliberate, diplomatic approach. We want to see a diplomatic solution. It is the strength and unity of the international community that has the best chance of succeeding."
The latest crisis with Iraq began on Oct. 29 when Iraq vowed to expel American weapons inspectors working for the United Nations and to shoot down American U-2 spy planes. The inspectors were part of teams monitoring Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions demanding that it destroy all its weapons of mass destruction. The American inspectors were thrown out of the country on Friday, and the United Nations pulled out most of the other inspectors as well.
The Russian commitment today came in a series of telephone calls between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin and their foreign ministers, Ms. Albright and Yevgeny M. Primakov.
The Russians have come out most strongly against the use of force against Iraq, and many American officials still blame Mr. Primakov, then working for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for trying to forestall the allied attack to drive Iraq out of Kuwait six years ago. But American officials said the Russian effort may be the best chance remaining to persuade Mr. Hussein to let weapons inspectors return without warfare.
Mr. Clinton and Ms. Albright have also spoken with President Jacques Chirac of France, and his Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine. Mr. Chirac condemned Iraq today and said France was "in solidarity with the U.N. and the United States in this crisis."
The announcement of an imminent diplomatic approach to Mr. Hussein seemed in part intended to reassure nervous Arab countries that the West was not interested in rushing to war. Arab newspapers have been contrasting the American willingness to pressure Iraq with its reluctance to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to come to better, faster terms with the Palestinians.
But the announcement also provided welcome distraction from Ms. Albright's brief and embarrassing visit to Doha, Qatar, to an American-sponsored economic conference boycotted by nearly every Arab country despite intense American diplomatic pressure on them to show up.
In fact, Ms. Albright's daylong shuttling from Qatar to Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia was made necessary because their foreign ministers refused to attend the Doha conference, which Israel did attend.
Because senior Arab officials were not there, she had to go to them, to discuss the confrontation with Iraq and what moderate Arabs might be prepared to do about it.
This linkage between Arab unhappiness with Mr. Netanyahu and reluctance to support American military pressure against Mr. Hussein is acknowledged privately by American officials, who in public try to keep the issues separate.
In her speech to the business and trade officials in Doha -- their numbers limited by the boycott from countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and even Morocco -- Ms. Albright urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders to find the courage to make peace.
"Unfortunately, time is not on our side," she said. "Every week that goes by without a renewal of serious momentum towards peace creates new opportunities for the enemies of peace, and adds to the discouragement of those on all sides who urgently desire peace."
In Kuwait, Ms. Albright met Defense Minister Salaam al-Sabah, who said that Kuwait wanted a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but understood that "Iraqi intransigence opens the door to all options that might not be in the interests of Iraq."
In Bahrain, Ms. Albright met with members of the United Nations Special Commission, who were pulled out of Iraq when Mr. Hussein ordered its American members expelled. Ms. Albright received a detailed briefing, closed to the press, from commission leaders about what they had been discovering about Iraq's continuing efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.
She then spoke to a group of inspectors and nurses, to thank them "for your sacrifice for world peace." She praised them for facing "personal risk without flinching, without complaining, and, I might add, without surrounding yourselves for protection with women and children." Mr. Hussein has gathered Iraqis, including children, around palaces and other likely targets of any missile or air strikes.
"You are not the instrument of one nation or region," she said, "but instead you are the means for the enforcement of international law."
But some of the inspectors were quietly uncomfortable with the attention Ms. Albright lavished on them, cameras rolling, because it seemed to ally them more closely with Washington than with the United Nations generally, the very accusation Iraq levels against the commission.

HEADLINE: Israel's Controversy Over Religion Affects Donations by Jews in U.S.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
While American Jews are contributing record sums to Jewish causes at home and abroad, thousands of them are withholding or diverting up to $20 million in donations this year, partly to protest the religious and peace policies of Israel's conservative Government, leaders of Jewish organizations say.
Bernard C. Moscovitz, the chief operating officer of the United Jewish Appeal, the primary fund-raising vehicle for Jewish social welfare in Israel and the United States, said that Jewish giving was still 2 percent higher this year than last year but that giving had been running 8.5 percent ahead of last year's pace until some leaders urged that donations be withheld or diverted. 
 Others warned that the withholding or redirecting of contributions could turn into a major philanthropic rebellion if Orthodox Jews succeeded in cementing their control over religious life in Israel. They also said a shortfall of $15 million to $20 million in projected donations in a year of huge Wall Street profits was significant.
"Twenty million dollars is not chopped liver," said Jonathan Levine, the American Jewish Committee's regional director for the Midwest.
The dispute over Orthodox control, or "who is a Jew," as the religious pluralism controversy is known, points to deeper changes under way in Jewish philanthropy.
Experts on American Jewish giving say several factors are responsible for a growing percentage each year of Jewish giving to non-mainstream Jewish and non-Jewish institutions and causes.
These factors include an aging Jewish population and a generational shift in giving patterns, a high rate of religious intermarriage and social integration among Jews, a changing relationship to Israel and a fraying of what has been the most successful fund-raising system in history -- the United Jewish Appeal and the 189 local Federations in Jewish communities throughout North America that raise and allocate money for social welfare at home and abroad.
"We're experiencing a sea change in Jewish life which has extraordinary implications for Jewish giving," said Gary N. Tobin, the director of Brandeis University's Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies.
The change is partly obscured by the fact that it comes during a time of record giving.
American Jews, who constitute close to 2.5 percent of the United States population, raised as much as $4.4 billion in 1995, said Jack Wertheimer, the provost of the Jewish Theological Seminary and author of an article on philanthropy in the 1997 American Jewish Year Book.
The annual Federation-United Jewish Appeal campaign, the fund-raising centerpiece of local Jewish communities, will raise about $737 million this year, as opposed to $721 million last year. Including donations to its $4 billion endowment and other gifts, the Federation will raise a total of $1.6 billion.
Contributions to religious institutions, though they are not added up nationally, probably total as much as $1.4 billion a year, not including gifts to synagogue capital campaigns, Mr. Wertheimer said.
In addition, other Jewish charities will probably raise a minimum of $700 million, not including charity for Jewish education, an ever-growing $1 billion economic sector.
Altogether, Mr. Wertheimer estimates Jewish giving to Jewish causes at more than $4.5 billion this year.
But while overall Jewish giving is growing, until this year annual donations to Federation-United Jewish Appeal campaigns, when adjusted for inflation, were on the decline since 1989, along with the number of contributors to these campaigns and the percentage of their charity that is directed to Jewish causes.
Moreover, two-thirds of Jewish "megagifts" -- that is, gifts from Jews of more than $10 million -- that a generation ago went to Jewish causes now go to museums, colleges, libraries and other nonsectarian institutions, said Jeffrey R. Solomon, president of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies.
"It's a difficult time in Jewish philanthropy," concedes Richard Wexler, a Chicago real estate lawyer who is national chairman of the United Jewish Appeal.
 
The Gifts Shift To Foundations
Mr. Moscovitz argues that the annual campaign's relatively lackluster performance was caused partly by the fact that the same donors gave the Federation system an additional $1 billion from 1990 to 1995 for "Operation Exodus," the emergency campaign to help Jews leave the former Soviet Union and resettle in Israel. Still, even he agrees that there is some cause for concern.
Most Jewish giving now goes through independent family foundations or takes the form of gifts to endowments, often with strings attached. That limits the Federation system's ability to direct the donations as it once did and the collective power wielded by such communal giving.
"This weakens the ability of the Jewish community to plan, coordinate and allocate its resources," Mr. Wertheimer said.
As a result, organized Jewish giving to education and the poor in America and what Professor Tobin calls "philanthropic Zionism," that is, expressions of support for Israel through giving to the traditional vehicles of the secular Jewish community, are also under pressure.
Analysts say some of the changes reflect a deep confusion and frustration within the American Jewish community over Jewish identity at home and discontent with Israel's policies abroad. But no issue has polarized giving to Israel as much as the religious pluralism legislation now pending there, action on which has been deferred until January.
The legislation would bar non-Orthodox Jews from the country's 150 religious councils, which distribute some $70 million a year in Government funds, and would bar anyone but Orthodox rabbis from converting people to Judaism in Israel.
In the eyes of many American Jews, 85 percent of whom are unaffiliated or belong to the Reform and Conservative streams, this would effectively disenfranchise them.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who last night addressed the Council of Jewish Federations, says he understands the threat the issue poses to American Jewish-Israeli solidarity. But he also knows that political parties representing Orthodox Jews control 23 of the 66 seats in his coalition in the Israeli Parliament and thus, if not appeased, could topple his Government.
Mr. Moscovitz said Federation-United Jewish Appeal donations had been up 8.5 percent this year until an effort to forge a compromise on the religious legislation collapsed this summer.
In response, prominent American rabbis, lay leaders and Jewish commentators urged American Jews to redirect contributions to Israel from the Federation system, which works closely with the Israeli Government, to alternative charities like the New Israel Fund, the Abraham Fund, the Israel Policy Forum and others whose programs were primarily aimed at promoting tolerance, democracy and pluralism in Israel.
 
Federation Agrees To Aid Diversity
Such appeals have infuriated Federation officials, who accuse their proponents of fostering disunity among Jews and putting sectarian and political concerns ahead of the needs of disadvantaged Jews. Sixty percent of United Jewish Appeal money, they emphasized, goes to American Jewish causes.
But the Federation system has responded by agreeing to increase the $15 million it now spends on programs in Israel that promote religious diversity, tolerance and democracy to $20 million next year.
And following an agreement last month with representatives of the Reform and Conservative communities, it has also pledged to encourage Jews who favor those goals to make a supplemental contribution to the Federation campaign specifically for such programs.
Still, few think that would prevent a plunge in giving to the Federation system should the legislation in Israel be approved. Professor Tobin said his research showed that no other single issue "cuts as much to the philanthropic core," for two reasons.
First, he said, American Jews, given their high rate of intermarriage -- 52 percent in 1991 -- "don't want anyone telling them that their children are not really Jews."
Second, "Americans Jews, like all Americans, don't like extremists, and they don't like theocracy," he said. "So the notion that one branch of Judaism controls the political scene and disenfranchises them is totally at odds with their democratic, pluralistic American identity and values."
Rabbi Jerome K. Davidson, the spiritual leader of Temple Beth-el, a reform congregation in Great Neck, N.Y., said he would continue calling for a retargeting of Jewish contributions until the Orthodox Jewish hold on Israeli politics was broken.
"The Non-Orthodox American Jewish community is fed up with supporting -- through Federation and religious yeshivas -- the very groups that attack us with rocks and excrement while we pray at the Wall," he said, referring to an incident that occurred in August at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.
Mr. Moscovitz asserted that appeals for retargeting had led not to rechanneled aid, but to a modest reduction in contributions. "Some people have just used this as an excuse not to give," he said.
But interviews with spokesmen for several alternative Jewish charities report that their fund-raising is up sharply.
For example, Gil Kulick, the communications director of the New Israel Fund, which was started in 1979 with a grant of $100,000 from 10 San Francisco families, raised a record $13.5 million last year and has seen a 25 percent increase in contributions this year.
"We're up by about 50 percent in the last two years," he said, attributing the increase to Jewish fury over pluralism.
 
Impact of Youth And Cold War's End
But the changing relationship between American and Israeli Jews may eventually have an even more drastic effect on giving.
"Apart from the religious pluralism problem, the perception that Israel's economy is booming and that external threats appear to be disappearing in the wake of the cold war make these the most challenging years we've ever faced," Mr. Wexler said.
Moreover, younger Jews, comfortably integrated into American life and most of them born after the Holocaust and the creation of Israel, simply have a different relationship to the Jewish state.
"For my kids the Holocaust is ancient history, and they have no emotional relationship to Israel," said Michael Steinhardt, a leading New York philanthropist. "No wonder the proportion of dollars going Jewishly is diminishing."
Younger Jews, in fact, are far less likely to give to and through the Federation. Studies show that only a quarter of Jews age 32 to 50 give, and that only 12 percent of intermarried households, as opposed to 59 percent of all-Jewish households, give to the United Jewish Appeal.
Still another factor is growing donor demand that Jewish charity begin at home. In response, the proportion of Federation dollars going to Israel has been declining for a decade -- from an average of 60 percent to 40 percent. But donors are also demanding greater control over how their donations are spent.
That has triggered an explosion of giving through some 11,000 family foundations or funds, 3,500 of which are not under the Federation umbrella. And there are a growing number of endowments, three-quarters of which make gifts that are directed or restricted. All told, Mr. Wertheimer said, gifts to campaigns, endowments and foundations totaled more than $8 billion from 1990 to 1995, only half of which were under Federation control.
Direct gifts to Israeli and American Jewish institutions through, for example, "friends of" groups, have also soared in the last decade and now equal twice the amount of money that goes to Israel through Federation channels. Such groups and family foundations increasingly form what Mr. Wertheimer calls a "parallel philanthropic universe" to that of the Federation, drawing away resources and talent.
Mr. Moscovitz denies that this independent giving reflects, to some extent, dissatisfaction with the Federation system, which some donors call arrogant and overly bureaucratic.
The United Jewish Appeal, he said, is trying to expand its donor base of 800,000, whose average gift is $900, through new mailings four times a year, as well as through more personal contact with and greater flexibility for givers. He also points to the United Jewish Appeal's program that allows donors to specify where they want some of their money spent.
But increasingly, he said, the Federation system will evolve as an agent that marshals funds and provides choices for independent and Federation donors. He and others in the field also see philanthropic "partnerships" between federated and independent givers, as well as Jewish and non-Jewish groups, as the wave of the future.

HEADLINE: Collapse of Japan's 10th Largest Bank Sets Off Large Market Rally

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Nov. 17

 BODY:
A major Japanese bank collapsed this morning in a new reminder of the weakness in Asia's financial system, just as American and Japanese officials were discussing new ways of responding to financial emergencies in the region.
The bank that collapsed, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., is not one of the handful of leading Japanese financial institutions known around the world. But it is the nation's 10th largest bank and the first of Japan's 10 major "city" -- or commercial -- banks to require a bailout. 
 Its failure, and the intervention by the Bank of Japan, spurred a tremendous rally in stocks here, as traders apparently sensed that the Government would be getting more involved in bailing out the country's ailing financial sector.
Alarmed by the weakness of Asian countries generally and the risk that the economic crisis in Asia will spread, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka of Japan today expressed concern about the fall in the value of the yen.
The Japanese Government immediately intervened after the bank failure. It extended emergency central bank loans and arranged for another bank, North Pacific Bank, a regional institution based in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, to take over the failed bank's deposits and outstanding loans.
"Since all deposits will be protected, I strongly urge depositors not to worry and to take sensible actions," Mr. Mitsuzuka said at a news conference this morning. Mr. Mitsuzuka was clearly concerned about the possibility of bank runs that would add to the instability of Japan's banks.
Japan's action on the bank came after of week of intensive exchanges with the United States, which has expressed growing alarm at Japan's descent into another economic slowdown and at the precarious state of the nation's banks. Mr. Summers hailed the intervention on the failed bank and said that "the market's response appears to confirm the importance of decisive action."
Indeed, stocks soared on the news of the bank's failure. At the close of trading, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up a dizzying 1,200.80 points, or 7.96 percent, to 16,283.32, led by banking stocks.
Mr. Summers and Mr. Mitsuzuka also issued separate statements, clearly coordinated, warning against further depreciation of the yen.
The United States has been concerned that bank collapses and economic weakness in Asia, and especially in Japan, could ripple across the Pacific and damage the American financial system. One risk is the loans that American banks have made to Asian borrowers, and another is that Asia will buy less from the United States and export more, thus raising America's trade deficit and eroding economic growth.
The dollar traded lower on the show of support, though it later rebounded. In late afternoon trading, the dollar was quoted at 125.26 yen, down 0.14 yen.
Mr. Summers flew to Tokyo via Europe, where he had discussions with economic officials, and from Tokyo he will travel to Manila, the Philippines, for consultations with Government officials from around the region. One reason for the trip appears to be to coordinate policies that would be necessary in the event of a financial emergency in South Korea or elsewhere in the region.
Though he was vague about precisely what he talked about, Mr. Summers said he had agreed with Mr. Mitsuzuka to work for "new arrangements to promote regional cooperation and enhance prevention" of crises. Mr. Summers said the two countries had also agreed on "new initiatives to strengthen the capacity of the International Monetary Fund to respond effectively in event of financial emergencies."
One problem for American and Japanese officials alike is that they want to prepare for financial crises without undermining confidence and increasing the likelihood that there will be crises to address. South Korea, in particular, is insisting that it is in fine shape, and so it is diplomatically awkward for Western countries to make plans in case it is not.
Last week, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin wrote a letter to Mr. Mitsuzuka, expressing concern that Japan was not acting quickly enough and effectively enough to address the problems in the banking sector. Mr. Summers added to that message by expressing "concern about the outlook for the Japanese economy" and calling for "effective action to restore domestic demand growth."
The last point reflects concern Japan will try to export its way out of its financial difficulties, at the expense of the United States economy.
Earlier this year, Japan increased its national sales tax, curbing domestic demand just as it was mired in a slowdown.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu Calls for Unity In U.S. Talk

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel issued a call for unity tonight to some 3,500 leaders of American Jewish groups gathered here as word spread of diplomatic activity aimed at getting the battered Middle East peace process off its knees.
Mr. Netanyahu, who arrived from London, where he had met with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, was said by aides to be working on a possible return there on Monday night, perhaps for a meeting with King Hussein of Jordan or with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. 
 Israeli television reported that Mr. Netanyahu was cutting short his American trip to meet with Mr. Arafat in London. Palestinian leaders denied that a meeting was in the offing, but Israeli officials here declined to rule it out.
Mr. Netanyahu told the American Jews that his Government was the only one "capable of uniting the people of Israel behind a permanent peace settlement with the Palestinians and a peace treaty with Syria."
He repeated that while Israel would not compromise on security, it wanted to offer Palestinians "unfettered self-rule." Addressing the Palestinians directly, he said: "Our hand is extended in peace. Accept it and you will bring untold benefits to both our peoples, who pray and yearn for the completion of the longed-for peace between us."
Mr. Arafat met with Ms. Albright in Switzerland on Saturday. The Secretary said after that meeting -- as she had after conferring with Mr. Netanyahu on Friday -- that more decisive action was required from each if the four-year-old Israeli-Palestinian peace plan was to move ahead.
Mr. Arafat reiterated his commitment to peace but insisted, as had Mr. Netanyahu before him, that the fault for the delay lay with the other side.
Mr. Netanyahu was to go tonight to Los Angeles, where he was scheduled to address the World Affairs Council on Monday and take part in a fund-raising dinner for an Orthodox Jewish religious school movement, Aish Hatorah. The dinner is to honor the actor Kirk Douglas, who has discovered his Jewish roots and faith in recent years.
Mr. Netanyahu's original schedule had him staying in Los Angeles until midday Tuesday to urge local industrialists to invest in Israel, whose economy has grown more oriented toward high technology.
But the last portion of his trip seems open to question if one or more of the meetings being negotiated in London materializes.
A summit meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and King Hussein is not likely to produce dramatic results. Jordan remains the best friend Israel has in the Arab world, but an attempt in September by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad to kill a member of the militant Palestinian group Hamas in broad daylight on a street in the Jordanian capital heightened tensions between the Governments.
The United States would doubtless like to shore up relations between them at a time of potential military action against Jordan's eastern neighbor, Iraq. Should the Clinton Administration choose to go ahead in efforts to force the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, to allow American weapons inspectors back into his country, it would have an easier time if its allies in the area were on good terms with one another.
Tonight, Mr. Netanyahu urged all Jews to stand behind President Clinton "when he is facing down Saddam Hussein."
Across a broad range of relationships, these are not easy times for the Israeli Prime Minister.
His reception by the American Jewish community leaders here was correct but not very warm, because of widespread opposition among American Jews to a proposed bill in Israel that would write into law Orthodox rabbis' control of conversions to Judaism there. The talk in the hallways of the Indianapolis Convention Center, where the annual General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations is being held, was one of defiance to perceived Israeli Orthodox control over liturgy and Jewish identity.
Mr. Netanyahu needs the support of the Orthodox political parties in Israel to remain in power and has therefore not been willing to cross them on this issue. But he did make clear to those assembled here that affiliates of the Conservative and Reform movements need not fear that they were second-class Jews, by his lights.
"No power on earth can rob any Jew of his or her identity," he said. "Every Jew is a legitimate Jew." He also assured them that he would insist that conversions performed by non-Orthodox rabbis outside Israel continue to be recognized by the state.

HEADLINE: Grim Reckoning in Japan -- and Beyond

BYLINE: By Ron Chernow; Ron Chernow is the author of "The House of Morgan," "The Death of the Banker" and a forthcoming biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.

 BODY:
The financial whirlwind sweeping through Southeast Asia has now struck the Japanese stock market with the swirling fury of a tsunami. On Friday, the Nikkei 225 average tumbled to 15,082, its lowest close in two years. Despite sharp gains in early trading today, this downward trend portends problems of a magnitude dwarfing those emanating from the smaller East Asian countries. So long as financial instability seemed confined to Hong Kong, Thailand et al., one could blandly argue that the problem was somehow small and containable. Now that the contagion has infected Japan, the global ramifications could be profound.
The East Asian crisis can be traced to the demise of Japan's "bubble economy" in the early 1990's. After years of wildly inflated prices, Tokyo stock and property markets plunged, hobbling local banks with hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans. At the time, regulators should have goaded banks into writing off bad debt, packaging it as securities, or selling the collateral behind property loans. Instead the Government opted for a myopic policy of mystery and evasion, protecting a banking system that had become dangerously overextended. Through lower interest rates, it hoped the banks would muddle through without painful surgery on the fundamental structure of Japan Inc. 
 Flush with spare capital in a stagnant economy, the banks embarked on a manic lending spree in Southeast Asian nations rife with speculation, corruption and politically biased investment. Before long, the lending had assumed proportions that beggared description. From a mere $40 billion in early 1994, Japan's Asian lending ballooned to $265 billion, with $87 billion stored up in Hong Kong alone.
At first, the Japanese were attracted to Asia by rich loan spreads of a sort unavailable in more mature industrial economies. By last spring, however, the lending binge had taken on a feverish, desperate air. American and European bankers watched aghast as Japanese banks "dumped" loans in the region -- that is, extended credit at ridiculously thin profit margins to grab market share. By massively exporting capital to Southeast Asia, the Japanese banks re-created the bubble economy that had been punctured at home and that had sent them abroad in the first place. At the same time, Japan targeted Southeast Asia as its main arena for export growth and industrial expansion. Small wonder that stock investors have pounced on Japan as a leading casualty of the region's tribulations.
Last week's nervous selling dragged the Nikkei average down into a murky zone that threatens the very moorings of Japanese finance. Unlike American banks, Japanese banks can count as capital a portion of the paper profits held on their huge stock portfolios. Under Japan's distinctive system of cross-shareholdings, banks own big blocks of shares in their major borrowers, and vice versa. These reciprocal arrangements mean that nearly half the shares in Tokyo never really trade but are frozen in cartel-like ties that define Japan Inc., binding bankers and client companies in economic clusters known as keiretsu.
Since banks and brokers can employ unrealized stock gains as capital, the financial system has an eerily elastic quality. When the stock market soars, bank capital -- and hence lending -- expand in a self-sustaining process; conversely, when the stock market sinks, capital and lending contract. So long as banks had hidden assets from stock market gains, they had extra capital to cushion emergencies and cash hoards to shore up sagging profits.
For several years, economists have worried that the fateful intertwining of the stock market and banking system would create what the British financial analyst Andrew Smithers has termed a "doomsday machine." Such pessimists conjured up this nightmare scenario: the Tokyo market sinks to a point at which it wipes out hidden assets on banks' stock portfolios, sharply eroding their capital. This then provokes a steep recession, causing stock prices to plummet further in a downward spiral. Some analysts think that we are approaching just such a threshold, or even that we breached it last week.
The critical question is the level at which the doomsday machinery is triggered. Jesper Koll, an economist at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo, estimates that Japan's three long-term credit banks shed all their stock gains when the Nikkei sank below 16,000. The country's 10 large commercial banks, he contends, would cross the line at 15,100, a level penetrated last week. And the seven leading trust banks would exhaust their hidden gains at 14,900. As for Japanese life insurers, Neil Rogers of UBS Securities reckons that their stock profits vanished at the 16,900 level.
The Japanese banks thus face an extraordinary situation of triple jeopardy. They must grapple with hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to a troubled region -- loans mostly denominated in dollars that have become much more expensive after the currency devaluations in Southeast Asia. The banks must weather this crisis while working off at least $250 billion in home-grown problem loans. And they must accomplish this miracle amid a self-reinforcing contraction of their stock portfolios and capital. Already international creditors are demanding a special risk premium on loans to Japanese banks.
The repercussions of this swelling crisis could be grave. For seven years, the Japanese have tried to rejuvenate their sluggish economy. After glimmers of hope, the gross domestic product experienced a startling 2.9 percent drop in this year's second quarter. Since Japanese companies rely heavily on cheap bank credit, they would expire in record numbers if the falling stock market shrank the banking sector. This would tip Japan into recession, depreciate the yen, and stimulate a fresh export offensive that would worsen already tense trade relations with the United States.
In the 1980's, it seemed that Japan had evolved a humane, efficient variant of capitalism. The Government sheltered banks and brokers from failures, while banks bailed out client companies and ailing competitors. Profitability was invariably subordinated to growth and stability. By suspending the cleansing action of the marketplace, the Japanese aimed to soften the rough edges of capitalism. That strategy has now been exposed as a destructive pipe dream. By propping up failing banks or merging them with healthy banks, the Japanese simply bottled up problem loans and tempted bankers into risky credit practices.
Paradoxically, the Japanese Government recently began to allow the winnowing of bankrupt financial institutions. When Hanwa Bank perished last year, it was the first Japanese bank allowed to fail in the postwar era. Nissan Mutual Life was declared insolvent in May while Sanyo Securities collapsed this month under $3 billion of debt. Hokkaido Bank has now become the first casualty of the latest phase of the crisis. And the Liberal Democratic Party is reportedly considering a plan to buy preferred stocks from the banks, causing the Nikkei to rally sharply this morning.
In the long run, the Tokyo stock market crisis will likely dissolve the bonds uniting banks with bureaucrats and corporate clients. As the Government regulates banks instead of cosseting them, bankers will balk at serving as docile instruments of industrial policy. As credit is priced more realistically, companies will desert traditional bankers for the capital markets and jettison their bank stocks. The banks, in turn, will liquidate stock portfolios that simply obligate them to succor sick borrowers. Most important, the new owners of the liberated stock will demand profitable performance from corporate managers.
Next year, the "big bang" will initiate a period of financial deregulation in Japan. Bankers, brokers and insurers will finally compete on common turf, ending the clubby insularity of Japan Inc. Meanwhile, global investors will have to deal with the grim aftermath of the ancien regime.

HEADLINE: Working Moms Take the Blame;
Try Flexible Scheduling

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"When Waaa Turns to Why" (Business Day, Nov. 11) addresses some of the difficulties of working parents, but from an all-too-traditional perspective. You present the issue as an artificial dichotomy, suggesting that a parent must choose between career and family. 
 Work-at-home arrangements, compressed workweeks, flexible work scheduling and on-site child care all allow parents to see more of their children during regular working hours without sacrificing time at the job.
More and more companies offer these options as part of an overall family-friendly program -- among them Unicom, Colgate-Palmolive and Hewlett-Packard. The corporate culture in these companies helps to insure that parents who take advantage of such programs are not relegated to the "mommy track" with its reduced opportunities for career advancement.

HEADLINE: Dropping Barriers Can Rescue Third World Poor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is curious that you refer to the defeat of "fast track" authority as "disturbing testimony" to the power of union campaign money (editorial, Nov. 13), ignoring not only the campaigning of environmental, religious, consumer and farm organizations but also the effort that corporations have expended to sway policy makers on this and other trade issues. 
 Furthermore, while you are right that the North American Free Trade Agreement did not create the devastating economic crisis in Mexico, it is integral to the adjustment strategy that was imposed 15 years ago by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and that has impoverished millions of Mexicans and gutted national and local production.
According to the Mexican Action Network on Free Trade, since Nafta's inception, average real wages in Mexico's manufacturing sector have dropped 31 percent while productivity has risen by 32 percent. Until workers can freely organize to defend their interests, there is no reason to expect that this trend will not continue.

HEADLINE: OUT OF CHINA: ANALYSIS;
China Loses, China Wins

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 16

 BODY:
By releasing Wei Jingsheng, China's leading dissident, and sending him into exile in the United States, Chinese leaders have made a major concession to international pressure. They have also rid themselves of China's most potent political martyr.
Mr. Wei, whose eloquent writings on democracy landed him in jail 18 years ago, and whose refusal to bend kept him there, was taken from a labor camp on Saturday night and brought to Beijing to see his family before departing this morning on a flight to Detroit. 
 Mr. Wei's brother described him as buoyant, carrying the same upbeat spirit that seemed to keep him alive through years of suffering in China's gulag.
After so many years of worrying about Mr. Wei's survival, his family and supporters seemed understandably thrilled that freedom had finally come.
And yet Mr. Wei, 47, is not fully free. He is not free to live in China. In exile, his influence on Chinese affairs may dissipate, and it is unlikely that he will be allowed to return to China any time soon.
One of the biggest unanswered questions on Mr. Wei's first day of freedom was why he dropped his long-standing refusal to leave China.
Perhaps, as family members said, Mr. Wei's health has deteriorated so much that he needs medical treatment. It has been hard to gauge the seriousness of his heart disease or other ailments since he has been in custody, but it may also be that Mr. Wei was given no choice.
The timing of Mr. Wei's release is clearly entwined with United States-China relations and, specifically, with President Jiang Zemin's trip to the United States two weeks ago.
American diplomats deny that they made any concrete deal with China to exchange Mr. Wei's freedom for greater trading rights. But that swap is now one of the net results of the visit, and it is hard to imagine that the long negotiations preceding the summit meeting in Washington did not involve careful discussion about what each side wanted most.
Mr. Jiang, in addition to his craving for the international recognition of a full state visit in Washington, wanted the United States to drop restrictions on China's ability to buy nuclear technology and military helicopters. Done.
Now, with Mr. Wei's release, Beijing has reciprocated by giving the Clinton Administration what was at the top of its wish list: a human rights triumph to point to as a tangible yield from "engaging" Beijing.
Releasing a political prisoner may seem like a simple act without cost. Yet China's leadership is still so sensitive about internal critics that it generally fears that letting one go might be interpreted as a sign of political weakness.
That one man can so threaten the system, as Nelson Mandela did when he was in a South African prison, is a sign of how fragile the system remains.
For the moment, however, releasing Mr. Wei makes China's leadership look relatively confident and secure. This has been Mr. Jiang's year, emerging from the shadow of Deng Xiaoping, the political patriarch who died in February, to assert himself as China's foremost leader, presiding over the return of Hong Kong in July and dominating a Communist Party Congress in September.
Whether Mr. Wei's release is a solitary gesture, or a signal of a broader political relaxation by Mr. Jiang, remains unclear for now.
Political experts here feasted on the possibilities raised by Mr. Jiang's ambiguous remarks at Harvard University, when he used the word "mistakes" in answer to a question about the Government's relations with the people and the use of military force to suppress the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations. Whether those comments were intended only for a foreign audience, or for a domestic one as well, is still under debate.
International human rights advocates, while welcoming today's news, argued that Mr. Wei's release did not alter the basic state of human rights in China.
"What we need to see is a structural legal change that will lead to the freeing of other dissidents in China," said Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong.
The official reason given for Mr. Wei's release was medical, since the authorities needed to justify their previous refusal to let him go.
"Wei Jingsheng has been released on parole for medical treatment because of his illness," the New China News Agency reported in a short dispatch. "Wei has gone abroad for medical treatment."
Mr. Wei's release was not reported on tonight's main evening news broadcast, which instead reported on a trip to Japan by Prime Minister Li Peng and on a conference on maternal care in Beijing.
But Wei Jingsheng is not a household name in China. Although he became the hero of the Democracy Wall movement in 1979, Mr. Wei had no role in the defining political event of the current generation -- the massacre around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 -- and is not as well known as the student leaders of that year.
Yet his case has attracted great interest by those who follow the progress, and lack of it, in China's efforts to develop a rule of law. Within the leadership, Mr. Wei's piercing analysis and cogent arguments for greater democracy seem to have provoked considerable concern, and Mr. Wei's letters to top leaders are said to circulate widely.
In a culture that strongly discourages individuality, and that demands submission to authority, Mr. Wei is an extremely unusual figure.
Stubborn, patient and humorous, Mr. Wei has been unyielding in his insistence that true prosperity will come to China only with true democracy. He has rejected the counterargument that China's booming development of recent years is a sign that economic advancement can come without a political complement.
Since 1979, when Mr. Wei was first sent to prison, he has been free for only six months. He served many years in solitary confinement and has said he was subjected to repeated beatings, as well as constant psychological pressure.
Mr. Wei was released in 1993, six months before his 15-year sentence was complete, and just one week before the International Olympic Committee was to award the 2000 Olympics that Beijing was competing for. Sydney won in a close vote.
At the time, Mr. Wei ignored warnings from the authorities to keep quiet. Under China's unusual legal system, his "political rights" were still revoked, meaning, among other things, that he was not supposed to speak out publicly on political issues.
Mr. Wei argued that it was his right to speak freely, and he continued to write and publicize his political views. A meeting with John Shattuck, the American Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, in Beijing seemed to infuriate the authorities, who soon took Mr. Wei into custody again.
"There's no question that he was arrested the second time because of the meeting with Shattuck," said Tong Yi, Mr. Wei's assistant at the time, who was later jailed for 18 months before being allowed to go to the United States, where she is now a political-science student at Columbia University.
In violation of Chinese legal regulations, Mr. Wei was in custody for 18 months before he was charged with a crime. In court, in a session his family was barred from attending, he was convicted of plotting to overthrow the Government, and was sentenced to 14 more years in prison.
Having said that he had no regrets about sticking to the views that put him in prison for the first 14 1/2 years, Mr. Wei seemed destined to serve 14 more.
Conditions were extremely harsh at times. Mr. Wei's family, allowed to visit him irregularly, complained that other prisoners had been encouraged to beat him, and that he was being kept in a brightly lighted cell with a glass wall so that prison guards could observe him 24 hours a day.
Mr. Wei's brother, Wei Xiaotao, said that Mr. Wei now suffers from heart problems and high blood pressure.

Chicago Tries to Protect Children in the Crossfire
Officials in Chicago are studying ways to protect children at Jenner Elementary School in the Cabrini-Green housing project, where frequent violence forces the children to be kept inside during school hours. One plan would move the children to another school, taking them out of the path of gang gunfire. Another would create a kind of security zone, in which parents would be paid, given white arm bands and trained to stand on dangerous corners; "safe havens" would be set up at churches, marked with white flags, so that children could duck inside to safety.

Sweeping Adoption Changes
President Clinton is preparing to sign into law the most sweeping changes to the nation's adoption and foster-care system in nearly two decades. The changes, approved by Congress last week, are intended to make it easier to remove children from abusive families and speed up their adoption. A20
 
Indian Suspicions Grow
Leaders of impoverished American Indian tribes say they believe the Government will help Indians -- but only those Indians who have helped the Democratic Party, preferably in the form of six-figure campaign contributions. "If you have money, you get a meeting and you get what you want," said George Newago, the chairman of the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, whose proposal for a casino was rejected by the Interior Department in 1995.

A Deadly Quest for Money

Critics of the school say it has been a training ground for dictators and their henchmen, while its supporters say the school provides training in democratic principles and human rights. (AP)

Logging Quietly Returns To the Woods of Suburbia
A substantial logging industry has returned, almost invisibly, to the wooded areas ringing New York City, driven in part by a demand for maple and oak in Japan and elsewhere on the world market. State environmental officials in New York and Connecticut have created programs to encourage logging methods that keep the forests healthy. Nonetheless, unscrupulous logging crews occasionally cruise neighborhoods as close to the city as Westchester and Fairfield County, Conn., to dangle offers of big money to property owners, often leaving behind ragged, muddy messes.

HEADLINE: Once Upon a Time, And for Years After

BYLINE: By EDEN ROSS LIPSON 

 BODY:
At noon on a dress-down Friday a few weeks ago, the bright white offices of Simon & Schuster Children's Books were empty. The corridors, lined with colorful books and posters, were deserted. The large conference room, however, was jammed, warm and smelled of sandwiches. The entire staff, about 75 people, from editors and assistants to receptionist, casually attired, had gathered for a brown-bag lunch, to hear Margaret K. McElderry answer questions about a publishing career that spans more than half a century.
Ms. McElderry, who was not dressed down but elegant, as usual, may have found the questions familiar. But as usual, she was modest and inclusive. 
 "I was an English major, like so many of you," she recalled, "and an economics minor, though you'd never know it. It was the Depression, and when I graduated from Mount Holyoke in 1933, I told the career adviser I wanted to live in New York City and work with books."
" 'You have absolutely nothing to offer publishing,' " Ms. McElderry remembered being told. The line has drawn a big laugh for decades, along with the adviser's follow-up: "Why don't you consider library work?"
The woman who spoke so lightly is living history. At 85, she is the last of her class of editors who brought American children's books into the postwar world, the direct link between what latest estimates put as the $1.79 billion children's book industry and the handful of remarkable editors, mostly women, who created it.
This week as schools, libraries and bookstores celebrate National Children's Book Week, Ms. McElderry is celebrating a milestone of her own, the 25th anniversary of her publishing imprint, now one of six lines of children's books at Simon & Schuster.
She began her career by following the adviser's suggestion. After a year at the Carnegie Library School in her hometown, Pittsburgh, Ms. McElderry came directly to the New York Public Library. In retrospect, the library was perfect training for editing children's books, the ones that endure and are read by succeeding generations: "The Borrowers" or "Ginger Pye" or "The Dark Is Rising" or "The Changeover," all of which Ms. McElderry published.
She worked for Anne Carroll Moore, the library's first Superintendent of Children's Work, initially as the junior assistant (salary $1,320 a year), dusting the office, answering the pedestal telephone that stood on Miss Moore's desk and cataloguing and reading each book the library bought.
She spent part of the summer of 1934 in the Children's Room of the Central Harlem Branch, and after a stint in Mott Haven in the Bronx, she returned to 42d Street for nine years as Miss Moore's first assistant. She studied the special collections of picture books, the books in foreign languages and others designed to serve the wide variety of children in New York's multiracial, multinational population.
In those years, everyone in the world of children's books came to call on her boss, Miss Moore, that steely New Englander whose conviction that children deserved the best inspired and supported trade publishing of children's books.
The New York Public Library's annual list of best books, which Miss Moore initiated in the 1930's and Ms. McElderry carefully typed each year, continues to carry weight. (The 1997 list will be distributed on Thursday at the Donnell Branch in Manhattan, where the central children's collection is housed. The 31st Anne Carroll Moore lecture will be open to the public and delivered by Katherine Paterson, the distinguished Newbery-medal winner.) The list, like the other key library awards, has a measurable impact in a field where the librarian's sticker seals of approval translate into bookstore sales.
During World War II, Ms. McElderry left the library to work in the office of war intelligence in London. On her return to New York, she took over the children's department at Harcourt Brace. The children's book editors of the day -- Ms. McElderry, Ursula Nordstrom at Harper & Row, Elizabeth Reilly at Thomas Y. Crowell, Mae Massie at Viking and others -- worked with great independence. They nurtured artists and writers, building up the backlists of titles that demonstrate the development of talent over decades and continue to bring in revenues.
Editors had "their writers," but great courtesy prevailed among the publishing houses. A 1952 letter from Nordstrom to Natalie Savage Carlson, included in the forthcoming collection of Nordstrom's letters, "Dear Genius," gently turns down a manuscript and suggests that Carlson send it "to Miss McElderry," because "she does lovely books."
 
An Editorial Mind Open to the World
 At Harcourt Brace Ms. McElderry's career was marked with firsts. Alone in that generation of editors, she saw a world beyond the United States and found and published picture books as well as novels from abroad. She was the first to publish German and Japanese postwar novels for children. And she introduced young American readers to Europeans, including Lucy Boston ("The Children of Green Knowe") and Helme Heine ("Friends"), Australians like Patricia Wrightson and South Africans including Niki Daly.
By the time the Children's International Book Fair at Bologna, Italy, began in 1966, Ms. McElderry already knew the agents and publishers who traded there. She was, and still is, shown new work of many European artists and writers before any other American publisher.
She was the first editor whose books won both the Newbery and the Caldecott Medals in the same year, 1952, a feat unequaled until 1994. In 1996, with many other honors in between, two novels she edited, "Yolonda's Genius" by Carol Fenner, and "The Moorchild" by Eloise McGraw, were Newbery Honor Books.
Susan Hirschman, the editor of Greenwillow Books, clearly remembers meeting Ms. McElderry for the first time, in 1955, in circumstances somewhat similar to the recent brown-bag lunch at Simon & Schuster. Mrs. Hirschman was then an entry-level secretary at Alfred A. Knopf and a member of an informal networking group called Young Publishers. In the crowded bedroom of an apartment on the West Side, she listened, inspired, as Ms. McElderry described her work.
Years later, when Mrs. Hirschman took over the children's department at Macmillan and attended the important librarian meetings and conventions, she modeled herself on Ms. McElderry. "She stood like a figurehead next to her booth," Mrs. Hirschman said, "eager, ready, upright, bristling with energy, and people flocked to talk to her."
There was one important interruption in the story Ms. McElderry tells of her career in publishing. She had been at Harcourt Brace for 25 steadily profitable years and, like her woman colleagues at other houses, she had consciously shunned publishing adult books or entering the boardroom frays, though her list supported many adult literary whims.
 
Coping With Change In Style and Life
 At noon on the Friday before the Fourth of July weekend in 1972, she was called to a meeting by two of William Jovanovich's associates and was told to dismiss her entire staff save one and take early retirement at the end of the month.
"I asked, 'Why are you doing this? What have I done?' " she says, still baffled by the experience. "And he said, 'You've been fine, but the wave of the future has passed you by.' "
On the contrary, the wave carried her to Atheneum where she set up shop that fall with her own imprint. Neal Porter, now the publisher of DK Ink., was a marketing associate in 1982 and remembers Pat Knopf, the publisher of Atheneum, calling him in to discuss the succession when Ms. McElderry retired.
Margaret K. McElderry Books, the first children's imprint to carry the name of the editor, survives while a dozen or more eponymous imprints have appeared and disappeared in the last quarter-century. It continues, although Atheneum was bought by Macmillan and Macmillan by Robert Maxwell and the imprint is now part of Simon & Schuster which in turn is part of Viacom.
Surrounded by bureaucratic procedures and paperwork, she still publishes about 25 books a year, many of them from abroad.
Stephen Roxburgh, the publisher of Front Street Books, remembers attending his first board meeting of the Children's Book Council, the trade association, nearly 20 years ago when he was at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. "I looked around the room at the photographs of the past presidents and happened to notice that Margaret's term was the year I was born. When I mentioned it to her later she laughed merrily and then asked so politely, 'When was that?' " (It was 1950.)
"Much is for the better," she tells the junior assistants and editors. "Books for children have come to be seen in their rightful place and an important part of the development of children."
"Of course," she adds, "in the old days we used to sit and read. Now I don't read at all in the office; I do it at home on Wednesdays and on the weekends."
As for the marketing departments that have supplanted library and editorial training as the key background for editors, she says, "They get the books out, but with the emphasis on the bottom line. I doubt that anyone talks about quality anymore."
"The people upstairs," she says of the executives who run the publishing conglomerates, "don't have a clue about who we are or what we are doing."
Meanwhile Ms. McElderry, with a substantial number of successful surgical repairs behind her continues at a pace that leaves other editors breathless. Her calendar at Simon & Schuster shows one long trip to Europe in the spring, with stops in England and at the Bologna Children's Fair, at all the major children's book conferences, sales conferences and with a few speaking engagements.
Whenever possible, she accompanies her authors to their speaking engagements, a mannerly relic of protocols past. In the 1950's, for example, she regularly accompanied her authors on special Children's Book Week tours of the elaborate book fairs that were sponsored by The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Cleveland Plain Dealer and The Detroit Free Press.
On Wednesdays she reads at home in the parlor that faces the toddler playground on Washington Square in Greenwich Village, and in August she reads in her unmodern cottage on Nantucket, which is just as her parents left it. She has no plans for retirement and a full list of titles to publish next year.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 2, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 17 about the children's book editor Margaret K. McElderry misstated the time it took for someone to repeat her 1952 feat of editing books that won both the Newbery and the Caldecott Medals in the same year. Phyllis Fogelman of Dial edited both winning books in 1977; as the article indicated, the feat was repeated in 1994, by Walter Lorraine at Houghton Mifflin.
The article also misstated the number of this year's Anne Carroll Moore Lecture, delivered at the Donnell Branch of the New York Public Library for National Children's Book Week. It was the 41st in the series, not the 31st.

HEADLINE: From Under the Sea, Signs of Climate Jolts

SERIES: THE WARMING WORLD: Confronting climate change.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
AS scientists seek to improve their imperfect understanding of how and why the world's climate is changing, evidence continues to mount that most of the last 10,000 years -- long thought to be a benign era whose stability was crucial to the rise of civilization -- has in fact been typified by episodes of warmth, cold, drought and flooding more extreme than anything experienced in the 20th century.
About a thousand years ago, for instance, Europe basked in warmth that nurtured vineyards in Britain and allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland. At roughly the same time, what is now California was baking in centuries-long droughts, dwarfing the mere seven-year droughts of today. Early South American civilizations literally dried up and blew away. But only a few centuries later, in what is called the Little Ice Age, severe cold gripped much of the world, sending glaciers coursing down mountainsides, freezing European harvests and starving much of the populace. 
 Natural variations like these raise important questions in the scientific debate that underlies efforts by the nations of the world, at a conference beginning Dec. 1 in Kyoto, Japan, to cope with the prospect of climate change. How much of the global warming observed in the last century is natural, and how much has been caused by waste industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere? And how might natural climatic fluctuations modify and interact with whatever climate changes caused by people are in store for the future?
Now an important new element has been added to the emerging picture of pervasive, natural climatic change in the Holocene, the period since the vestiges of the last ice age vanished 10,000 years ago. Centuries-long cold spells much like that of the Little Ice Age have occurred more or less regularly, roughly every 1,400 to 1,500 years, report researchers, led by Dr. Gerard Bond at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, in the current issue of the journal Science. They discovered the oscillations by analyzing climatic signals in ancient ocean sediments in the North Atlantic.
The quasi-periodic swings were found to persist over the last 32,000 years, which is as far back as it was possible to date the sediments by the radiocarbon method. This means that the 1,500-year cycle also operated in the last ice age.But during that period, the cyclical cold spells were much more severe than in the Holocene. In the ice age spells, Dr. Bond said, the surface temperature of the North Atlantic where the sediment samples were taken dropped by about 9 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit. In the Holocene spells, the drop was about 2 to 3.5 degrees.
How that translated into changes in the air temperature is unclear. Scientists believe, on the basis of other evidence, that air temperature dropped by 1 to 3 degrees in the Little Ice Age.
In the late 19th and 20th centuries, the global temperature has bounced back from the Little Ice Age cold, rising by about 1 degree and suggesting that the world may now be in the early stages of a centuries-long cycle of natural warmth. "We could be coming out of the colder phase into the warmer phase of the cycle right now," Dr. Bond said. On the other hand, he said, the warming of the 20th century could be a relatively temporary warming blip, and the cold of the Little Ice Age might resume. He and his colleagues discovered many such temporary interruptions of previous cold phases.
The dominant view among climate scientists is that the warming of the 20th century has been caused at least in part by emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which are produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The prevailing view also says that further warming is in store as a result of the emissions and that such warming could seriously disrupt the earth's climate system in the next century. Representatives from some 150 countries are to convene in Kyoto to negotiate cuts in emissions.
But no one knows how much of the observed warming is attributable to the heat-trapping gases and how much is caused by natural fluctuations in climate. In an attempt to sort things out, scientists have been focusing more on past climates, searching for patterns that might shed light on the present and future.
While the impact of natural variations on present-day climate cannot yet be pinned down with precision, Dr. Bond said, "it's probably fair to say that we're seeing a component of natural variability" in the last century's warming.
Other recent studies have suggested that the world is in the early stages of a natural warming phase and that, if so, any warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions would come on top of the natural temperature increase, delivering something of a one-two punch.
That has been suggested most recently by other new research reported in the current issue of Science. Investigators headed by Dr. Jonathan Overpeck of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colo., examined climatic indicators in lake and ocean sediments, tree rings and glacier ice in the Arctic. They found that from 1840 to the mid-20th century, Arctic temperatures warmed to their highest levels in 400 years, ending the Little Ice Age in those latitudes. The researchers attributed the early part of this bounce-back warming to natural causes but said that greenhouse gas emissions had probably contributed after about 1920.
All the recent findings say only so much about where the present-day climate fits into the long-term pattern of natural variations. The 1,500-year oscillations discovered by Dr. Bond and his colleagues, said Dr. Delia Oppo, a paleooceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute at Woods Hole, Mass., "are not perfectly periodic so we don't really know where we are in detail -- it's not that cut and dried." But "if we can nail the timing more clearly," she said, "it really helps us when we're looking at global warming." Dr. Oppo wrote a commentary on the Bond team's study in Science.
The Overpeck team, writing in Science and referring to its study of the Arctic, cautioned against efforts "to simply extrapolate past patterns of change into the future." That will "ultimately fail to anticipate future Arctic climate change and its impacts," the scientists wrote. Reliable predictions, they said, will require computerized climate-system models that simulate the long-ago changes now being reconstructed.
While precision eludes scientists who are researching ancient climates, a raft of studies in recent years has made it clear that the conventional view of the Holocene as an even, tranquil interval in climatic history is in error.
Compared with big climatic swings of the past, like the ice ages and the super-warming of the Cretaceous period, which melted almost all the world's ice before ending some 65 million years ago, the Holocene variations are small. But compared with the experience of everyone alive today, they seem large indeed.
The catalogue of Holocene climatic variability is large and growing. Several times in the Holocene, for instance, great stretches of the American West have been converted by drought into expanses of windblown sand like the Sahara. Starting about 3,300 years ago, the upper Mississippi Valley experienced a series of what would today be called 500-year floods.
Archeological and climatological evidence suggest that a number of pre-Inca cultures rose and fell in tune with big droughts. Starting about 1,100 years ago, California experienced droughts lasting 220 years and 140 years, both more intense than present-day droughts lasting less than a decade. The 20th century, scientists say, has actually been part of a California wet period. The droughts a millennium ago coincided with a similar drought that caused the collapse of South America's most advanced pre-Inca empire, a nation-state called Tiwanaku. That was roughly the same period when the Norse colonized Greenland and Britons tended vineyards.
Drought has also been implicated in the collapse of the classic Maya civilization in Yucatan, and a 300-year drought is believed to have brought the Middle East's earliest known empire, that of the Akkadians, to its knees some 4,200 years ago.
And now, thanks to the Lamont-Doherty team's study, there is the evidence of semiperiodic cold spells of millennial length. The team analyzed corings taken from ocean sediments off Ireland and southeastern Greenland.
The corings contained two kinds of evidence. One was grains of sand deposited on the sea floor when cold water north of Iceland periodically moved southward. The water carried ice, and sand was released from the ice when it melted in the more southerly latitudes. More sand at a particular time, the scientists reasoned, signified more sea ice and thus a movement of cold water southward. That, they inferred, cooled the climate.
The second kind of evidence involved tiny animals called foraminifera that live in oceanic surface waters. Their calcified shells also fall to the sea floor when they die. Certain kinds of these animals thrive in colder waters, some in warmer ones. The researchers found cold-water foraminifera in the same seabed strata as bigger concentrations of sand grains.
Together, this evidence indicated the existence of the 1,500-year cycle (1,470 years with a margin of error of plus or minus 500 years) of alternating cold and warm spells. The cycle is independent of, and superimposed on, the longer cycle in which ice ages come and go every 100,000 years or so, the researchers concluded.
The team's coring record stopped just short of the Little Ice Age, but Dr. Bond said that event appeared to have been the latest in the series of 1,500-year cold cycles. Other studies of ocean sediments have previously demonstrated that the Little Ice Age reached its coldest point about 300 years ago, that an even colder cycle occurred about 8,200 years ago and that there were instances of pronounced rises in temperature, to somewhat higher levels than today's, 1,000 and 2,500 years ago.
The cause of the 1,500-year oscillations is unclear. It could have to do with changes in the sun's output, some scientists say, but the Bond team favors some sort of mechanism within the climate system involving interactions between the atmosphere and ocean currents.
Deep ocean currents transport heat around the globe and are particularly important in delivering it to the North Atlantic region. Many scientists believe that interruptions or weakenings of the currents are involved in large-scale climatic changes. In the current issue of the journal Nature, a study headed by Dr. Jess F. Adkins of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology links the beginning and end of the last interglacial period around 120,000 years ago to abrupt changes in these deep currents.
That interglacial period was similar to the Holocene in that it marked a warm interval between ice ages. Because of the apparently major role of the ocean currents, many scientists express nervousness about the possible effects of greenhouse warming on the currents.
For example, computerized climate models indicate that global warming would cause more water to evaporate from tropical oceans and be carried northward, where it would condense and fall as rain or snow, said Dr. Scott Lehman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Colorado in Boulder who wrote a commentary on the Adkins study in Nature. The extra influx of fresh water, he said, could dilute the salt content of the heat-transporting current, and the density conferred by salinity affects the capacity to carry heat.
Less salinity "tends to weaken the conveyor" of heat, he said. That could cool the North Atlantic region substantially, but the overall warming exerted by greenhouse gases would probably keep the rest of the world warmer.
In any event, he said, "the stability of interglacial climate is delicately poised with respect to the ocean circulation." To the extent that climate is governed by natural oscillations, Dr. Lehman said, "we may excite that process by fossil fuel burning."
 
Warming World
 This article is one of a series that has appeared since Aug. 12 on the science, politics and economics of climate change with the approach of an international meeting in Kyoto, Japan, beginning Dec. 1 to discuss limits on greenhouse gases.

As nations debate how to cope with the prospect of global warming, researchers are learning more about natural climatic variations. The climate in the last 10,000 years has been relatively stable, but a study of sediment from cores drilled in the North Atlantic-seabed found that even during this period centuries-long cold spells have occurred roughly every 1,400 to 1,500 years. Researchers counted grains of sand that had been deposited on the ocean floor after being carried south by drifting ice before it melted. They inferred that a high number of grains meant there was more ice and thus ocean surface temperatures were colder. Graph shows amount of sand in ocean corings, for deposits dated all the way back to over 30 thousand years ago. (Source: Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University)(pg. F8)

HEADLINE: Information Technology Field Is Rated Largest U.S. Industry

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Sales by the computing and telecommunications industries have grown by 57 percent during the 1990's, to $866 billion, making those businesses an increasingly important force in the nation's economy, according to a study to be released today.
Indeed, the field of information technology -- often defined as both computing and telecommunications -- is the nation's largest industry, ahead of construction, food products and automotive manufacturing, the study concluded. 
 The study, sponsored by the American Electronics Association and the Nasdaq stock market, which lists the shares of a large number of high-technology companies, represents perhaps the most comprehensive statistical portrait to date of what is called "the new economy" -- populated by high-technology companies that generate new wealth, new work practices and new challenges in public policy.
The study, based on Commerce Department data, is titled "Cybernation: The Importance of the High-Technology Industry to the American Economy." A large part of the report's intended audience is in Washington, where a growing number of high-technology policy issues are being debated. Those issues include whether to establish national educational standards, whether to relax export curbs on data-scrambling software, whether to impose special taxes on Internet commerce and whether to raise immigration quotas to allow more skilled workers into the United States.
The report also provides Silicon Valley with some useful intellectual ammunition as its entrepreneurial leaders increasingly yet uncertainly try to gain influence in Washington.
"Whether we like it or not, high-technology issues are going to be front and center in Washington and in state capitals during the next few years," said William Archey, president of the American Electronics Association, a trade group.
"At the state and national level, policy makers have a lot of positive impressions about the high-technology industry, but often very little knowledge of it," Mr. Archey said. "The biggest public policy threat to the high-technology field is the ignorance of technology and of how these industries work."
The electronics group is being joined by a number of new high-technology lobbying efforts. These range from the strengthened Washington presence of companies like the Microsoft Corporation to the formation last summer of the Technology Network, a Silicon Valley group headed by John Doerr, general partner of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and James L. Barksdale, the president of the Netscape Communications Corporation.
So far, the younger computer companies have generally tried to promote their positions with small offices in Washington and without being big contributors to political campaigns. That approach is very different from the one favored by the other side of information technology, telecommunications, an industry that deploys corps of lobbyists and makes sizable political contributions.
For purposes of the new study, telecommunications was grouped with computer hardware and software as a single field mainly because the technologies are so closely linked -- and becoming more so, as the nation's communications system makes the transition to the digital technology of computing.
The high-technology sector, the study reports, generated 6.2 percent of the nation's output of goods and services in 1996 and employed nearly 4.3 million people. Workers in the field earn wages 73 percent higher than the average wage in the overall private sector, the report shows.
Productivity -- or output per worker -- in the high-technology field is also growing sharply. From 1990 to 1996, as high-technology revenues increased 57 percent, to $866 billion, the report said, employment rose 7.2 percent, to 4.26 million.
The revenue and employment figures in the study were assembled from the Government's statistics, grouped by type of business, a system called the standard industrial classification, or S.I.C., codes. The study included sales and jobs data reported by companies in 45 of these industrial groups.
Using Government statistics to define a field as broad as high technology is tricky. But some analysts say that the study's methodology was fairly conservative. For example, the report excluded semiconductor manufacturing machines and electronic games because those two businesses fit into much broader S.I.C. groupings; if they had been included, they would have bloated the overall information technology numbers.

Treasury Prices Rise on Benign Industrial Production Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Rebounding from early weakness, Treasury securities prices moved higher yesterday, after a benign industrial production report for October alleviated some fears of inflation among investors.
The 30-year bond gained 14/32, to a price of 100 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.06 percent, from 6.10 percent on Friday. Volume was somewhat lighter than it had been as investors awaited today's consumer price report; on average, analysts expect a gain of two-tenths of a percent over all in the October Consumer Price Index, with a one-tenth of a percent gain excluding the volatile food and energy categories. 
 While industrial production in October rose by a healthy five-tenths of a percent, that was less than analysts expected. And Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said, "Slower gains are in store due to both negative upcoming trade effects from Asia and also the recent softening in U.S. retail sales of durable goods."
The market reacted favorably to the report, as investors concluded that it added to the recent signs of a slowing economy, which would reduce the need for an interest-rate increase to head off inflation. But for the interest-rate-sensitive bond market, Mr. Harris added, next month's industrial production report could be more significant; it will be issued on Dec. 15, a day before the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.
Bond prices were also helped yesterday by a drop in oil prices as it appeared less likely that the standoff between the United States and Iraq would result in military action.
Initially, the market was down after a strong rally in overseas stock markets. The big gains, particularly in Tokyo stocks raised concerns among Treasury investors that the recent strength in the bond market, fueled by a so-called flight to quality because of concern over volatility in global stock markets, might now reverse itself.
William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a speech to a group of German mortgage bankers, indicated that he was growing more confident that the Asian financial crisis was close to ending. "Still that doesn't mean there won't be additional swings in prices," he said. "We shouldn't assume that the markets are already fully stabilized."
Analysts said yesterday's weekly auction of new Treasury bills saw moderate demand, in line with expectations. The average rate at auction was 5.165 percent for both the three-month and six-month issue. Even though the slowing of the flight to quality from overseas generally pressured the bill market yesterday, the auction was helped by tightened supply. The Treasury sold only $14.5 billion of bills, down from $15 billion as recently as early October.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Take Big Drop Amid Talk of Iraq Compromise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil posted its biggest drop in a month yesterday as Iraq and the United States sought to resolve a dispute over weapons inspections without a military confrontation that could disrupt world oil supplies.
In other markets, orange juice reached a six-month high on a Florida cold snap and coffee rose. 
 December crude oil fell 74 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $20.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a seven-week low, dragging down heating oil and gasoline prices.
Iraq is the source of about 1 percent of the world's oil supply under a United Nations agreement that allows Iraq to export $2.14 billion of oil every six months to buy food and medicine. The agreement, an exemption from broader United Nations economic sanctions, comes up for renewal Dec. 5.
Iraq expelled American inspectors last week and Washington dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, moves that helped send crude oil prices 2.5 percent higher late in the week. The Middle East accounts for a third of global oil supplies.
After Iraq offered a compromise, a State Department spokesman said the United States was considering a proposal to allow Iraq to sell more oil as one of several options to encourage Iraq to comply with weapons inspections.
The drop in crude oil helped send December heating oil down 1.69 cents, or 2.8 percent, to 57.85 cents a gallon, and December gasoline down 1.55 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 59.44 cents a gallon.
Orange juice jumped on speculation that a cold snap in Florida over the weekend could signal a crop-damaging frost ahead.
"There's a freeze scare in Florida today," said James Cordier, an analyst at Allendale Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. "That scares people into buying futures contracts."
Orange juice for January delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 3 percent, to 84.70 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange, the highest price for a most-active contract since May 19.
Coffee rose on anticipation that an industry report from the Green Coffee Association would show that stockpiles plunged last month.
Coffee for March delivery rose 1.3 cents, or eight-tenths of a percent, to $1.5275 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
After markets closed, the association said inventories declined 283,000 bags during October, to 2.011 million.

HEADLINE: Approving the Rail Link to Kennedy

 BODY:
Of the 10 busiest world airports, New York City's John F. Kennedy International has a dubious distinction. Although 42 percent of its arrivals are headed for Manhattan's central business district, it does not have a decent rail link to the city. Today the Federal Aviation Administration can help the region's economy, and all users of the airport, by approving the Port Authority's request to help finance a $1.5 billion rail link with revenue from a passenger surcharge.
The 8.4-mile rail link that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would build in Queens from Jamaica to J.F.K. is by no means the best mass-transit option that travelers deserve, namely a seamless, one-seat ride all the way from the airport to Manhattan. But after decades of dithering, this critical link, which would connect the airport to the Long Island Rail Road and three subway lines, is a move in the right direction. The Port Authority's promise to make the transfer at Jamaica simple and to design this line so that it can be easily transformed someday into a one-seat ride makes this option palatable. 
 The Air Transport Association, the airlines' industry group, opposes the plan and wants the revenue invested instead in projects that would expand aviation capacity and improve the airport itself. But there is ample precedent for investing in rail. The Port Authority has already used the surcharge for a 1.1-mile rail link that ties Newark Airport to New Jersey Transit and Amtrak.
Approval of the Port Authority's request by the F.A.A. would help cut highway congestion and spur Kennedy's expansion. Equally important, travelers would no longer feel as though getting to and from Kennedy was an Outward Bound experience.

Zurich Group to Buy a Big Piece of a Hong Kong Investment Bank

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The Zurich Group has agreed to pay $200 million to become the biggest shareholder in Peregrine Investments Holdings Ltd., a fast-growing Asian investment bank that has been hurt by the plunge in regional stock and bond prices.
The agreement, announced on Sunday, gives Peregrine the backing of a global powerhouse with $85.5 billion in investments. For the Zurich Group, a rapidly expanding Swiss insurance company that is one of the world's biggest money managers, the purchase of the 24.1 percent stake provides it with a ready-made avenue for growth in Asia. 
 Peregrine, one of Asia's biggest investment banks outside Japan, said last month that it had incurred losses of $37 million from equities and derivatives trading between July and October as Asian securities markets and currencies tumbled. But it denied that it had lost as much as $1 billion during the year as a whole and said a sale of the firm was not in the works.
On Nov. 1, the Japanese Bond Research Institute, Japan's largest credit-rating company, placed Peregrine's credit rating on review with "negative implications" and said the firm faced "pressure on its financial strength" because of the turmoil in Asia.
Peregrine's chairman, Philip Tose, said of the agreement with the Zurich Group, "We have gained a very large and prestigious independent minority shareholder that can bring us credibility and give some comfort to our bankers. They have clearly undertaken very exacting due diligence of our group, underlining that we do not have any of the problems that have been the subject of the rumors that forced our share price down."
The transaction values Peregrine at $830 million, about three-quarters of its book value at the end of 1996. That is less than the amounts of two or three times book value that some American securities firms have recently fetched.
The Zurich Group paid a per-share price for its stake that was 9.8 percent above Peregrine's closing stock price on Friday of $6.80 (Hong Kong), or 87 cents (United States). Peregrine's stock jumped 15 percent today, to $7.85 (Hong Kong).
Zurich Centre Investments Ltd., the group's private-equity arm, will receive convertible preference shares with full voting rights, as well as three seats on an enlarged nine-member board. The convertible stock may be exchanged for common shares between Jan. 1, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2004, for $8 (Hong Kong) a share.
Peregrine will pay a fixed rate of 7.5 percent on the convertible shares. Peregrine convertible bonds outstanding are trading at nearly twice that yield. At a time when it is very difficult for many Asian corporations to get credit, and when the Hong Kong prime lending rate is 9.5 percent, the rate to be paid is "not a bad deal" for Peregrine, said Anne Gardini, head of Hong Kong research at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett Asia Ltd.
The Zurich Group's investment will reduce Peregrine International Holdings Ltd.'s stake in the investment bank to 20.3 percent from 26.6 percent, making it the second-largest shareholder. Peregrine International is a private company whose owners include Mr. Tose and the investment bank's managing director, Francis Leung.
The investment is the latest expansion step by the Zurich Group, which reached agreements this year and last to buy the financial-services unit of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. for shares and $2.1 billion, the New York money-management firm Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc. for $1.7 billion, and the Kemper Corporation, an American insurance and asset-management company, for $2 billion.

Crusader Takes On the Postal Piggy Bank

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 17

 BODY:
He is called Japan's Don Quixote, and indeed, it does seem that Junichiro Koizumi is tilting at windmills.
Or, rather, tilting at post offices -- 24,667 of them, to be exact. Mr. Koizumi, Minister of Health and Welfare, wants to privatize them, contending that no less than Japan's future role as a world financial leader hangs in the balance. 
 Yes, financial. For the Japanese post office is far more than a mere mail carrier. As guardian of an astounding $2 trillion in savings and $800 billion in life insurance policies squirreled away by people like "Mrs. Watanabe," the ubiquitous housewife who controls the family purse strings, it is also a financial monolith that dwarfs titans like Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank, Citibank and Deutsche Bank.
But to Mr. Koizumi, it is a juggernaut threatening to strangle Japan's private financial institutions. "We can achieve nothing without tackling this problem," he said recently.
Problem? Most Japanese consider the post office a cultural icon, a national treasure. Postmasters here think nothing of picking up an old man's passbook on their way to work and dropping off his withdrawal on their way home at night. They run errands for elderly widows, find jobs for customers' children and organize local festivals and events.
No wonder, then, that the man calling the post office a troublesome anachronism is meeting with fierce resistance. In a recent poll by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, more than half of those surveyed were adamantly opposed to privatizing the post office, and his office has received a flood of -- what else? -- letters pleading with him to stop.
But with Japan's economy struggling again, weighed down by a mountain of bad debts held by banks and other financial institutions, such opposition has not fazed Mr. Koizumi. Indeed, so passionate is he about privatization that he has threatened to resign if his boss, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, fails to back him.
Tokyo is scheduled to announce its decision as early as Wednesday. In many ways, privatizing the postal system is being seen as a litmus test of Mr. Hashimoto's resolve to reduce Government influence and unleash market forces on Japan's economy. Without at least a modest step in that direction, some say, Tokyo will never rival London and New York as a global financial capital.
"Politically, privatization is difficult, but it is important that the Hashimoto administration make it clear that the Japanese Government will privatize the postal savings system in the long run, if not right away," said Heizo Takenaka, a professor of economics at Keio University.
Mr. Koizumi contends that allowing a public financial institution -- one that is protected by and, indeed, part of, the Government -- to compete with private banks that do not enjoy such favored status is not at all the free and unfettered competition Mr. Hashimoto has promised. "Japan is being drawn into global competition," he said. "I doubt whether one can truly carry out meaningful reform if we leave intact a national bank that operates outside the market economy."
The system began in 1875 as a way of harnessing private savings for use in building the country's infrastructure, and much of the savings and life insurance money it takes in is passed on to the Ministry of Finance, which has used it for everything from rebuilding Tokyo after World War II to providing low-interest loans to small businesses and homeowners.
"The postal system is a symbol of Japanese history and society," said Shumpei Tsukahara, a member of the "postal tribe," lawmakers who fiercely defend the institution in Parliament. It is vital, he said, that it "continue as a national institution."
Interestingly, if anyone has reason to feel warm and fuzzy about the postal system, it is Mr. Koizumi himself. In the 1930's, his grandfather, Matajiro, was head of what is now the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the post office's overseer. And he himself served as postal minister for a brief stint in 1992 and 1993.
But Mr. Koizumi, 52, is a hard-hearted realist. "Times are different," he said. "Japan was poor back then, and the economy was still weak. Private financial institutions were still undeveloped, and so the post office had a role to play."
Its role is still extensive. Postal savings represented about 45 percent of all deposits at the end of last year and have probably climbed even higher, as bank customers and investors move money out of scandal-ridden securities firms and banks laden with bad loans.
And local postmasters, whose jobs are hereditary, have cultivated unrivaled grass-roots support through community service. They lend that support to the Liberal Democratic Party, long the ruling party here. In some districts, postmasters round up more than 4,000 new party members a year, by some estimates, although as Government employees they are barred from official political activity.
Their influence was apparent at their national convention in October, which was attended by several ranking ruling-party officials, who denounced privatization and its supporters. "We will never forget your support and kindness," vowed Koichi Kato, the party's secretary general, using a Japanese word, "go-on," that implies a deep sense of obligation.
Katsuji Shimizu, head of Zentoku, the postmasters' organization, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications declined to comment, saying the timing was not right since the Government was expected to make a final decision on the matter as early as this week.
While the postal tribe is not saying much publicly these days, the extent of its influence can be measured by how quickly the Government rejected the recommendations of the group it appointed to come up with ways to overhaul the Japanese bureaucracy.
In September, the Administrative Reform Council suggested privatizing first postal insurance and then postal savings, but this idea was given a quick heave-ho by Mr. Hashimoto and his Cabinet.
It was then that Mr. Koizumi made his threat to resign, setting off a "will he or won't he" debate that has been running ever since.
Japanese Cabinet ministers resign over scandals, not policy. But Mr. Koizumi is not your average Cabinet minister. "Koizumi-san is a very strange person, isn't he?" said Mr. Tsukahara, a member of Mr. Koizumi's faction of the party.
And by Japanese standards, Mr. Koizumi is indeed a strange bird.
His latest outrageous act was to refuse the roughly $2,400 monthly stipend given to those who have served in Parliament for 25 years, saying he could not accept such a payment when the national deficit is so high. He also refused to have his portrait painted, saving the Ministry of Finance nearly $8,000.
Last summer, he raised eyebrows as one of six Cabinet ministers to visit a shrine to war dead that some regard as a symbol of Japanese aggression in World War II.
He is divorced, which is almost unheard of in Japanese political circles, and has raised his two sons, now 16 and 19, by himself.
And, unlike most Japanese politicians, he speaks good enough English to have served as an interpreter for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on one of her visits to Japan.
"I don't think I am odd," Mr. Koizumi said. "The politics here are what is odd."
That may be, but he is certainly the odd man out in the postal savings discussion. Even Washington, which has been pushing hard for changes in the Japanese financial system, is treading lightly on postal privatization.
Change could come unaided, though. Some economists say deregulating private-sector financial services will make them so attractive that Mrs. Watanabe will take her money out of the post office without privatization. "By the year 2010, the postal savings system will be privatized, either by law or simply by circumstance," said Jesper Koll, head of research at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd.
But Japanese bankers are not at all sure. The post office enjoys so many hidden subsidies, they say, that even with deregulation, they will be unable to compete with it if it retains Government sponsorship. "All we want is a level playing field," one Japanese banker said. "They're playing the game under a different set of rules."
The postal financial services, for instance, pay no taxes or deposit insurance and are not required to hold reserves against potential losses. A Government advisory panel estimated that those exemptions save the system some 950 billion yen a year, or about $7.5 billion. But that means it also costs taxpayers that amount in lost revenue.
"So far, the inefficiency of public finance is not so clear to the Japanese people," Professor Takenaka said. "My mother-in-law, who lives in the country, asked me just the other day why I wanted to put her post office out of business."
While rates on the postal system's time deposits are no higher than those of private banks, the deposits are more liquid. The most popular postal savings account, called a teigaku, yields compound annual interest semiannually but can be withdrawn without penalty after six months. In the private sector, a depositor would forgo a few tenths of a percent in interest for such a privilege; a teigaku holder does not.
An internal report by the International Monetary Fund suggests a step-by-step privatization of postal financial services, perhaps by region, along with lowering rates on teigaku and making the system's subsidies more visible.
Changes like those would put postal savings "on a more equal footing with the private banking sector," the report concludes, adding, "Such a development would represent a significant step toward establishing a more dynamic and competitive financial system in Japan."
With the economy on the verge of another recession, though, the Government seems unwilling to take on so popular an institution right now.
And Mr. Koizumi is still going to work every morning, leading many to conclude that his threat to resign was a bluff.
Not so, he says. "I believe the Prime Minister's passion for reform has not waned," Mr. Koizumi said. "I trust that he will contain the opposition within the party and implement a reform that cuts deeply into the issue, thereby avoiding a situation where I would have to resign."
By staying on now, Mr. Koizumi poses perhaps a bigger threat to Mr. Hashimoto's already wobbly Government. Because the postal system plan comes from the governing party, not out of the Parliament, it will require the approval of all Cabinet ministers, regardless of their portfolio and responsibilities. If the recommendations do not go far enough to please Mr. Koizumi, then Mr. Hashimoto would have to sack him to get the measures passed, an embarrassment that would send a negative message about the depth of his commitment to change.
"One person alone does not make politics," Mr. Koizumi said, "but I think it's worth testing to see what a single person can do."

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Rose in October For 15th Consecutive Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
United States industrial output advanced in October for the 15th straight month, though at a subdued rate, indicating that inflation does not greatly threaten the economy, analysts said.
Federal Reserve figures showed today that production at factories, mines and utilities rose five-tenths of 1 percent, a smaller-than-expected rate, led by increased output of consumer goods and computers. The advance matched September's revised gain of five-tenths of 1 percent, which had initially been estimated at seven-tenths of 1 percent. 
 "The overall industrial picture is still solid," said Jonathan Basile, an economist at HSBC Securities in New York.
The Fed report showed that the plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, rose to 84.3 percent in October -- its highest level since March 1995 -- from a revised 84.2 percent in September. Previously, the September plant-use rate was estimated as 84.4 percent and before the report, analysts expected an October reading of 84.7 percent.
While central bankers consider a rising plant-use rate as a sign that inflation could accelerate, a variety of inflation gauges suggest no imminent threat of rising prices. On Friday, for instance, the Labor Department said that producer prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October.
Moreover, manufacturers continue to hold down production costs and improve the efficiency of their plants and employees. Manufacturing productivity -- the average amount produced in an hour of work -- rose at an annual rate of 9.8 percent in the third quarter, the biggest gain in 15 years, Government figures showed last week.
In today's industrial production report, the broad category of manufacturing output rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month. Within that, business equipment production, including computers, rose 2.5 percent; auto and truck production rose three-tenths of 1 percent, and household appliance production rose one-tenth of 1 percent.
Construction supplies production fell two-tenths of 1 percent as mining output fell 1.1 percent and output at utilities rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
Analysts expect that several factors, including the economic crisis in Asia and a traffic backup on the Union Pacific Railroad could cause the economy to slow in the fourth quarter from its 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter.

Strong growth is expected to continue through the first years of the next century in computer-related employment in the New York City metropolitan region, in fields from telecommunications to Wall Street to the small start-up companies in the Internet industry, state officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut say.
Now comes the tough part. What skills will be required for New York-area residents to land those jobs? Given the pace of technological change, can the region's schools, students and training organizations even prepare for those jobs? Will the jobs look so different as to be unrecognizable? 
 "For the kids in kindergarten, we don't know what jobs will be there when they complete their schooling -- we're not sure what the labor market will be," said Jan L. Hennessy, project director for the New York Association of Training and Employment Professionals, and a participant at a daylong conference in Newark last week on job skills and education standards sponsored by the Federal Department of Labor.
One major message of the conference was that gazing into the future of the regional job market is like analyzing a complicated football play in which every player is in motion. Experts in such fields as manufacturing and retailing said that the levels of education and skills required for many jobs in their industries would continue to rise, putting new pressures on schools to prepare graduates who can communicate well and work in teams: skills necessary for entry-level clerks and highly paid technicians alike.
The conference, part of a series of meetings being held around the country to discuss emerging job skills, focused on a particular answer to the jobs-in-flux phenomenon: skills standards. Establishing education and skills standards for any job, conference speakers said, sets up a system of measurement, which is valuable even if the yardsticks need to be adjusted as jobs evolve.
"In the past, if you were a manufacturing worker, you went in, put your head down, did your work and went home -- that's not the case today," said C. J. Shroll, vice president for work-force development at the National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing. "We need to communicate that to schools."
The skills standards process also has other benefits, experts like Mr. Shroll said. It injects a certain practicality into education, because students, in learning what specific skills must be mastered for a job, realize that some subjects -- surprise! -- actually have value.
"If you link the Pythagorean theorem, say, to measuring the size of a room, suddenly you realize that there's a reason to know geometry, that it's not an abstract subject," said John F. Kershaw, manager of the General Motors Training Center in Moorestown, N.J. "The key word is 'meaning.' You put meaning in education, and motivation develops as a result of that."
But making projections about specific jobs is risky. Last year, for example, Connecticut issued a 10-year projection of the fastest-growing occupations in the state, a list led by jobs in the casino industry, which was then in the middle of a hiring spurt. In the new preliminary projections to be released later this year, the casino jobs are shown leveling off. The new numbers will show electronic pagination system workers -- people who lay out text and art on computer screens for print or electronic publishing -- topping the list of fastest-growing occupations, followed by computer engineers and computer support specialists.
In New Jersey, systems analysts will be in vogue for the coming decade, followed by computer engineers and home health care aides, according to Labor Department projections. In the New York City region as a whole, computer engineers top the list of fastest growing occupations, according to projections from the New York State Department of Labor. The engineers are followed by electronic pagination system operators, systems analysts and computer support specialists.
Officials at the New York Labor Department said that the next updating of projections of occupational growth will take into account an increase in New York City retailing, which was creating more jobs than economists had expected when the last round of numbers was prepared last year. Projected growth in health care employment, on the other hand, is likely to inch downward as hospital consolidations and labor-saving technology advance into the industry more quickly than expected.
A recent study by the Community Service Society of New York, a private nonprofit antipoverty organization, said that people making the transition from welfare to work over the coming decade would create yet another demand for work-related education.
The study said that while New York was producing many entry-level jobs with low education requirements in industries like retailing, the overall job mix was "continuing to evolve toward jobs that require higher skills and pay higher wages."

HEADLINE: U.S. Stocks Surge After Strong Rally in Japan

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A strong rally in Japan spurred a surge in United States stocks yesterday as American investors apparently were encouraged by the handling of a bank failure by the Japanese government.
Large multinationals and technology, banking and financial services companies -- whose stock prices have suffered recently as investors weighed the fallout from weaker Asian economies -- led the way. 
 In addition to Coca-Cola and General Electric, stocks posting strong gains included I.B.M., Compaq, Dell, Intel, J. P. Morgan, Travelers and Chase Manhattan.
After the Japanese Government intervened to assist with the closing of a regional bank, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., Japan's Nikkei 225 soared 7.96 percent in its largest one-day surge in seven years.
Stocks were slightly higher at midday today in Tokyo. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks was up 19.78 points, or 0.12 percent, at 16,303.10.
The Japanese market gains also spilled over into other world markets, including Hong Kong, Brazil, Britain, Germany, Sweden and Israel. But some Southeast Asian markets ignored the increases. Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand finished lower, with South Korea's composite index, falling the most, just over 4 percent.
Gaining strength from Japan's rise, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 125.74 points, to 7,698.22. Despite the sizable gain, the Dow moved off its highs late in the day and again failed to finish above 7,715.41, the level it had reached on Oct. 24, the Friday before its record 554-point drop on Oct. 27. Still, during the last three trading days, the Dow has gained more than 296 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 17.85 points, to 946.20. That put the index above its Oct. 24 level of 941.64 for the second time.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 30.60 points, closing at 1,614.11, up 1.93 percent.
But the Nasdaq 100, a listing of the 100 largest stocks on the over-the-counter market, gained 21.85 points, or 2.13 percent, to 1,049.70, indicating investors' preference to place their technology bets on larger company names.
But analysts say the rally does not mean stocks will just go up from here.
"I think the market is being led by a pretty overnight picture in the world markets," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross.
Several investment strategists cautioned that even with the Japanese rally, Asia was not out of the woods yet because of lingering problems throughout the region.
"I think it's premature to get overexcited at this point," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Smith Barney.
"You can get some good news in one spot and some bad news in another," added Mr. Acuff, who just returned from a one-week visit with institutional investors in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
"It was clear from my trip that expectations for growth are continuing to be revised downward" and that the impact will last for more than six months.
And the full impact of slower growth in Asia and other regions like Latin America cannot yet be gauged, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.
"Our view is that this is not the start of a very big uptick in the market," Mr. Cripps said of yesterday's gains.
He said that earnings of United States companies should slow in 1998, in part because of the negative impact of the slowdown in Asia.
But that view has not yet been reflected in compilations of earnings estimates from analysts.
As of the end of last week, analysts had not significantly lowered their 1997 or 1998 earnings estimates for the stocks in the S.& P. 500, said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call, a Boston-based company that tracks earnings estimates. Analysts are forecasting 12 percent growth in 1997 and 14 percent growth in 1998, he said.
"Given the pressures that are emerging out there, that would seem unrealistic," Mr. Cripps cautioned.
Indications of slower company growth could come as early as fourth-quarter pre-earnings announcements, said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City, Kan.
Jeffrey Bahrenburg, a global strategist and Japan specialist at Merrill Lynch, said that yesterday's move by the Japanese Government to deal with the weakness of its banking system was only "a step in the right direction." The markets could continue to be volatile, he cautioned, while the Government develops a plan to deal with the banking crisis.
American depository receipts of several Japanese companies were among the stocks posting the strongest gains yesterday.
Ito-Yokado, a supermarket chain in eastern Japan, rose 12 1/2, to 190. Canon gained 8, to 118 1/4, and Mitsui, a trading company, rose 6 1/8, to 147. Matsushita Electric gained 6, to 160.

HEADLINE: For the South, G.O.P. Secures Defense Bounty

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss.

 BODY:
In the decades that the Democrats controlled Congress, influential members from the South proudly brought home military-procurement contracts like eight-point bucks strapped to the hoods of their trucks.
For generations, Southerners like Senators Richard Russell of Georgia, John C. Stennis of Mississippi and Sam Nunn of Georgia and Representatives L. Mendel Rivers of South Carolina and Carl Vinson of Georgia used their powerful positions on the Armed Services Committees to bring jobs and dollars to their states and to help insure their own political longevity. 
 These days Congress is ruled by a different breed of Southerner: tight-fisted, fiscally conservative Republicans, bound and determined to rein in Federal spending.
But the tradition still holds. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi; House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, each succeeded this year in adding large sums to the military budget to give lucrative construction contracts to hometown companies.
None of the projects had been requested by the Clinton Administration. But the President, apparently not inclined to provoke a war with the Congressional leadership, chose not to excise the projects with his line item veto.
Here in Pascagoula, Mr. Lott's hometown, officials at Ingalls Shipbuilding are celebrating a $720 million appropriation added to this year's military budget to speed the construction of a DDG-51 Aegis-class destroyer.
In Marietta, Ga., just a block outside Mr. Gingrich's district, workers at Lockheed Martin are about to begin building eight C-130J transport planes, worth a total of $503 million, despite the Air Force's contention that it does not need or want them.
And near New Orleans, just outside Mr. Livingston's district, the Avondale Industries shipyard has received $100 million as a down-payment on construction of an LPD-17 amphibious ship that was not supposed to be financed until next year.
"The Southern Republicans are just continuing a tradition that was well established by the Southern Democrats," said Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University and an authority on Southern politics. "They balance the budget elsewhere."
 
On a Question of Need, 2 Different Answers
The Federal budget is, and always has been, a deeply political document. On Capitol Hill, money follows power and seniority, which helps explain why West Virginia, home of the veteran Democratic Senator Robert C. Byrd, or central Pennsylvania, home of Representative Bud Shuster, the Republican who leads the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure are so endowed with Federal largesse.
But the South, which for much of this century was grindingly poor, has long depended on Federal spending, particularly for military projects, to shore up its economy, and has long rewarded the lawmakers who provided it.
Regarding this year's appropriations, Mr. Lott, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Livingston argue that they are simply supporting a strong defense and that there is a military justification for each project. In the case of the two shipbuilding programs, they say they will save the Pentagon money by speeding construction and avoiding inflationary price increases. Regarding the Lockheed Martin contract, Mr. Gingrich said in an interview that it had become the obligation of the Republican Congress to buy planes that "a liberal Democrat Administration" will not.
Although the Republican leaders are responsible for setting national priorities, none apologize for fighting for their home states and districts. "It's one of the most important shipyards in the country," Mr. Lott said of Ingalls Shipbuilding, "and if I were not supportive of my hometown, that shipyard and the workers in that shipyard, I wouldn't deserve to be in Congress, now would I?"
But opponents of the extra military spending question whether the purchases of ships and planes are truly needed, especially this year. Furthermore, they contend that this year's contracts illustrate the primary weakness of pork-barrel spending: even when it is not overtly wasteful, it substitutes political priorities for sound policy judgments.
"In all fairness, much of what they've added is in the Pentagon's five-year plan," said Lawrence J. Korb, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the first term of the Reagan Administration. "So the question is whether they more need planes or tanks or ships. If Livingston was from Detroit, would we be buying more tanks? And if Lott was from California, would we be buying more planes?"
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has chafed many of his colleagues with regular critiques of pork-barrel spending, said he was disturbed that his party had continued the Democratic practice of adding politically influenced dollars to the military budget, particularly given other Pentagon needs.
"It's troublesome that Republicans are doing this because, in 1994, I thought one of the commitments we made to the American people was that we would eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending," said Mr. McCain, who sits on the Armed Services Committee.
"The money should be going to where it's needed," he said. "There are 12,000 military families on food stamps. We're seeing a hemorrhage of Air Force pilots from the military because they're stretched way too thin. We're failing to modernize our forces. Our readiness is deteriorating. Our backlog of maintenance in our depots is at an all-time high."
 
Helping a Company, Even in Good Times
Here in Pascagoula, of course, there is no such hand-wringing. Ingalls Shipbuilding, which employs 10,000 people at its 800-acre shipyard, is not only the largest private employer on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, but also in the state. With union wages that average $28,000 a year, it has provided a decent living for generations of workers in one of the poorest states in the country.
One of those workers was Mr. Lott's father, Chester, a sharecropper whose life improved significantly when he moved his family to Pascagoula and took a job as a pipe-fitter at Ingalls. Mr. Lott played tuba in a high school band that performed for battleship launchings.
But the end of the cold war, and the subsequent shrinkage of the military procurement budget -- to $38.9 billion in 1997 from $108 billion in 1987 (in 1997 dollars) -- has posed hardships for Ingalls. Twenty years ago, the shipyard finished seven warships a year. Now it produces three.
At Ingalls, employment has dropped 60 percent, from a high of 25,000 in 1977. Although Ingalls, a division of Litton Industries, has tried to diversify, 90 percent of its business still comes from the Navy.
Without enough work to keep the country's six private-sector naval shipyards operating at anywhere near capacity, military analysts are questioning whether the industry should consolidate. Because the Mississippi Gulf Coast economy could not absorb thousands of unemployed shipbuilders, the pressure is intense on Mr. Lott and other members of Congress from Mississippi to make sure that Ingalls remains viable.
Last December, Ingalls suffered a bruising blow when it lost out on a Navy contract to build the first 3 of a class of 12 new amphibious assault ships, the LPD-17, worth about $750 million each. The deal was awarded to a consortium of the Bath Iron Works Corporation in Maine and Avondale Industries in Louisiana, a decision that outraged Mr. Lott.
Mr. Lott and Ingalls then turned their attention to an existing contract to build 12 DDG-51 destroyers from 1998 to 2001, with the ships split evenly between Ingalls and Bath, a subsidiary of the General Dynamics Corporation. First, they tried and failed to get the Navy to shift 2 of the 6 Bath ships to Ingalls. Then they succeeded in persuading the Navy, and Congress, to speed up the construction of two additional destroyers, which would not have been contracted until after 2001, and to have them both built at Ingalls, one in 1998 and one in 2001.
"The question for the Navy was how do you keep Ingalls happy so Lott doesn't get angry," a Congressional staff member said on the condition of anonymity. "And the answer was to build two extra ships. Are they there because of Congressional intervention? Absolutely."
Mr. Lott said the rationale for building the two additional destroyers earlier than planned was that it would be cheaper to do so, a point acknowledged by all sides. He added that if Ingalls had been forced to reduce its work force much further its ability to compete effectively for future Navy contracts would have been hurt.
"We need to keep them viable," Mr. Lott said. "We should have learned from past experience that if you drop your guard, if you lose your manufacturing capability when everything is nice and peaceful, then when you need it in times of buildup or war it's very difficult. You don't retrain a nuclear welder in a week's time."
 
'Egregious Waste' Or Games People Play?
In Mr. Gingrich's case, the Pentagon says it does not even want the eight C-130J transport planes that were added to this year's budget. The White House had requested one such plane, but Congress appropriated money to build nine.
"We didn't request them," said Gloria J. Calef, an Air Force spokeswoman. "They just gave them to us."
Mr. Gingrich scoffed at that notion. "It's a game the Air Force plays every year," he said. "The Air Force always under-requests C-130's and they always know they'll be added by Congress."
But one high-ranking Air Force official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Air Force actually had more transport planes than were called for in the Pentagon's strategic plans.
Furthermore, the official said, the transport planes being replaced by the C-130J's "still have some life on them." And financing for construction of the new planes was not accompanied by financing for spare parts, maintenance equipment and other logistical support, making them something of a burden.
"The fact of the matter is that Lockheed needs to sell C-130J's more than the Air Force needs to buy them today," the official said.
Both Senator McCain and Mr. Korb, the former Assistant Defense Secretary, agreed. Mr. McCain, in a letter to President Clinton urging a line item veto of the planes, called them "a particularly egregious waste of taxpayer money."
Mr. Livingston, meanwhile, secured $100 million as a down payment to Avondale for construction of one of the $750 million amphibious assault ships that was not scheduled for construction until 1999.
"I don't apologize at all," Mr. Livingston said. "The Navy wants the LPD. It's been high on their five-year plan. It's going to be built. It's got to be funded. This is some advance funding that enabled Avondale to begin planning for a ship that they had already won."
But a Congressional staff member countered that there was no military need to advance Avondale the money. "Why make the down payment?" asked the staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "They just took $100 million and devoted it to this year's budget, for no purpose at all. You get nothing. Nothing for national defense. Nothing for the taxpayer."

HEADLINE: Despite Crackdown, Islamic Group Keeps Killing

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Even after years of harsh Government repression, even with 15,000 sympathizers imprisoned and its top leaders in jail, exile or both, the militant movement thought to have killed scores of foreign tourists in Luxor remains Egypt's most active Islamic fundamentalist organization.
In recent months, the Egyptian Government has been claiming success at bringing the Islamic Group -- Al Gamaa al Islamiya in Arabic -- under tighter control. 
 But that is not the same thing as eradicating it. Instead, the struggle seems to have merely transformed the Islamic Group from a highly disciplined organization that assassinated Anwar el-Sadat in 1981 into a far more loosely knit group of cells.
While these cells have become less and less effective in Egypt's cities, today's attack shows that they are still able to wreak havoc in sporadic attacks on tourists or in the countryside.
The damage this can do to a country where poverty is deep and tourism is enormously important was evident in the shock expressed here today by Mamdouh el-Beltagui, Egypt's Tourism Minister. Here for the first day of the London Travel Fair, a major event for tourist operators, he found himself unable to boast that Egypt had conquered terrorism and its threat to travelers.
"I can't predict at this stage what is going to happen about tourism to the country," Mr. Beltagui said.
In Egypt, Nabil Osman, the Government's spokesman, said, "We have never said we stopped these groups but that we had contained them." He added that terrorism was "an international phenomenon."
What he did not say was that Egypt had largely succeeded in recapturing an enormous flow of tourism, which had sharply fallen in 1993 and 1994 during a previous wave of attacks on tourists, and now will probably have to start again.
The Islamic Group was founded in the late 1970's by a band of radical Muslim theologians, led by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, and former army intelligence officers and lawyers. The sheik was later exiled and is now serving a life prison sentence in New York for his role in inspiring the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center; the former army officers and lawyers are all now serving life sentences in Egypt.
The group's most spectacular attack was the assassination of President Sadat while he was reviewing a military parade in 1981, and in subsequent years it staged attacks on prime ministers, cabinet ministers, ranking police officers, secularists and intellectuals, including the Nobel literature laureate Naguib Mahfouz, who was stabbed in an assassination attempt in 1994, when he was 82.
In the last five years, however, its status and tactics have changed. President Hosni Mubarak and a succession of interior ministers have claimed, with some justification, to have broken the framework in which fundamentalist terror had operated in Egypt. This was accomplished with a ruthless and highly effective security campaign, and with a diplomatic offensive that cut off funds for the militants from rich supporters in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Egyptian officials estimate that the movement now has at most a few hundred operatives, who are hounded by security forces. Having been chased out of big cities, they typically hide out now in a few villages and towns in southern Egypt. Their targets tend to be foreign tourists or the largely defenseless 10 percent of Egyptians who are Christians.
The attacks on tourists are a threat to Egypt because of its economic vulnerability; the tourist industry brings in a desperately needed $3 billion a year. Beyond that, the Islamic Group's very survival erodes Egypt's efforts to portray itself as a dominant Arab nation with a future based on democracy and economic ties to the wider world.
Today's attack came after the top six jailed leaders of the Islamic Group made repeated appeals, starting in July, for a cessation of violence "for the sake of Islam and Muslims."
They seem to have concluded that the battle to convert society by force has been lost, even though the basic political environment in which they recruit converts remains the same: the Government resists democratization while endemic corruption and vast disparities of wealth continue.

In a Surprise, South Korea Ends Its Attempts to Defend Its Currency

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
South Korea suspended efforts to defend its currency with its own, fast-depleting financial reserves today as American, Asian and European officials scrambled to determine if the world's 11th-largest economy -- and one of America's largest trading partners -- will become the latest Asian nation needing an economic bailout.
The surprise announcement from South Korea came after a series of public and private warnings in the United States that South Korea faces the kind of financial reckoning that has swept through Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia this year. But South Korean officials, facing a presidential election that the ruling party could lose, said that despite a series of major bankruptcies and reports that banks could not meet their debts, the country was fundamentally sound. 
 Today's announcement by the central bank in Seoul that it could no longer afford to battle the markets and prop up the value of the Korean won was a sign to many investors that the country's troubles run much deeper. And United States officials are clearly concerned that a deeper financial collapse in South Korea could resound more loudly around the world than the currency crises that have struck far smaller and less strategically vital nations in Asia.
"If a bailout of Korea was needed -- and no one is ready to say yet that it will be -- the size of the effort could be frightening," a senior Administration official said today.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not estimate what would be required, but economists and trade experts who raised the same prospect at a Congressional hearing last week said that the costs could run from $50 billion to $100 billion, far more than the cost of the American-led bailout of Mexico in 1995.
South Korea is estimated to have $67 billion to $77 billion in short-term debt owned by financial institutions and investors worldwide, and there is good reason to question whether it has the resources to pay that back.
The country had roughly $30 billion in foreign currency reserves at the end of October but has spent billions defending the won against attack by using those reserves to purchase its currency in the foreign-exchange market, which reduces the supply in circulation and at least temporarily lifts the won's value.
In Seoul, South Korean officials refused to disclose the current level of their reserves, and are apparently reluctant to tell American and European officials how much they have left. "These guys are still in denial," one American official said.
As in the case of Mexico, American concerns go beyond the fate of South Korea's overextended banks or currency woes. United States officials are worried about a financial contagion that could easily spill over into Japan, where banks are already teetering from the effects of bad loans at home and elsewhere in Asia.
Indeed, early today, Japanese authorities closed the country's 10th- largest bank; a major securities house went under earlier this month. Moreover, because South Korea directly competes with Japan in manufacturing a variety of products, any rapid devaluation of the won would create competitive pressure for Japan to allow its own currency, the yen, to weaken so that the country's exports are not sharply more expensive than those of South Korea. That would greatly enlarge America's trade deficit, one of the most sensitive economic issues between Japan and the United States.
Concern that the won's depreciation might drag down the yen contributed to an initial surge in the dollar's value against the yen today in New York, but it ended lower at 125.50 yen, down from 125.62 Friday.
Earlier today, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was in Japan to urge Tokyo not to export its way out of trouble.
The currency crisis could also affect South Korea's role in the long-delayed talks just about to begin with Communist North Korea over a formal end to the Korean War. American officials are concerned that South Korea is entering the talks appearing weak, its economy in free fall while a contentious presidential election is under way. "It's not an ideal negotiating position," one State Department official said last week.
A third concern focuses on how to organize a bailout if needed. Speaking in Chicago today, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin avoided any specific discussion of South Korea, apparently concerned that he not worsen the situation by contributing to the weakening of investor confidence. But Mr. Rubin made it clear that the United States would not take the lead in any financial rescues, working instead through the International Monetary Fund.
"It is our view that the right way to approach these is through I.M.F.-centered programs," he said. "Some people interpret that as a ceding of U.S. leadership. Not at all. We have been very actively involved with the I.M.F. and countries involved."
Still, on Thursday, before Congress adjourned, it refused to approve $3.5 billion the Clinton Administration sought to help create a new fund at the I.M.F. to deal with such emergencies. That is bound to reinforce an impression in Asia that the United States wants to maintain influence in the region, but not contribute financially to solving its problems.
The current financial crisis in Asia began this summer when Thailand, once a booming example of rising Asian economic power, conceded that its banks had lent billions to unsuccessful projects. The Thai currency fell by roughly 40 percent, interest rates soared and growth slowed sharply.
The I.M.F. came to the rescue with a $17.2 billion bailout, but Thailand has yet to comply with all the austerity measures required. The Thai Government fell last month, and a new Prime Minister has promised to comply with the measures.
But the contagion quickly spread, first to Malaysia and then to Indonesia. Late last month the I.M.F. announced a rescue package for Indonesia that included $15 billion in immediate funds, and agreement by several countries -- including the United States -- to provide "backup financing" if needed.
South Korea is more complicated. Its economy is far larger than any of the troubled Southeast Asian nations; its gross domestic product last year was $484 billion, up from only $253 billion in 1990. That makes it more than twice the size of Thailand's economy, though only about a tenth the size of Japan's.
Already the won has fallen about 17 percent since the beginning of the year to a record low against the dollar, and many economists believe it must fall much further in coming days to make Korea's products -- from semiconductors to auto parts to steel -- competitive with those of Southeast Asian countries that have already withstood devaluations of 30 percent to 40 percent this year.
While traders clearly expect the won to continue to slide, it may not happen as swiftly as in other countries. Korea limits the won's daily fluctuation to 2.25 percent of its value the previous trading day. At the current exchange rate of roughly 1,008 won to the dollar, that means any daily decline would be limited to about 23 won.
 On Tuesday in Seoul, the won plunged again, hitting its daily decline limit.
But even that trading band might have to be abandoned if it essentially stopped transactions from occurring, meaning that companies and banks might not be able to convert enough currency into dollars to meet their obligations.
Tuesday, Mr. Summers is to meet in Manila with finance ministers and central bankers from throughout Asia for a previously scheduled meeting to discuss how to aid financially distressed nations throughout the region.
South Korea's troubles will clearly be a major subject of conversation. But South Korean officials say they will not turn to the I.M.F. -- perhaps because they do not need to, perhaps because it would be humiliating.
"It is not a certainty, but they are certainly the leading candidate to be next," C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics, said last week. "The Asian contagion has made its way north."

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Iraq Opportunity Of Buying More With Its Oil

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, finding itself forced to retreat from its unswerving refusal to negotiate with Saddam Hussein, is offering to allow Iraq to buy more goods with its oil.
The offer -- cobbled together as a position paper over the weekend by British and American diplomats -- was passed to the French and Russians, who were to discuss it with the Iraqis, officials said today. 
 "What we're saying is that if they come into compliance, we're prepared to look hard at the humanitarian issues," a senior Administration official said today. He added, in a reference to President Hussein, "We're kind of calling his bluff."
The United States remains unwilling to bargain on the right of the United Nations to choose its own weapons inspectors and keep them in Iraq. But, propelled by the deteriorating Middle East peace effort and the need to hold together the shaky coalition against Iraq while enticing Mr. Hussein to comply with United Nations demands, the Americans have shifted ground.
They have pushed the Russians and the French to step forward, as international agents with more credibility in Baghdad. To give Russia and France more to work with -- and Mr. Hussein further incentive to settle -- American officials are talking of expanding the $4 billion a year in food and medicine that Iraq is allowed to buy under the "oil for food" resolution, No. 986.
American officials said they would consider a number of possibilities: increasing the amount of money that Iraq could raise through oil sales; extending the agreement so it would not be subject to review every six months and, most important, expanding the kinds of goods that Iraq could apply to buy. The expanded category would include "civil needs," one official said. Among these might be spare parts and vehicles, like ambulances, not easily used for military purposes.
While the coalition seemed pleased with the effort to extend the oil-for-food deal, the first, unofficial response from Iraq was negative.
 The Iraqi representative to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, told Reuters in New York that the idea of improving the oil-for-food deal was a "nonstarter in trying to resolve the current crisis" and reiterated that Iraq wanted to see economic sanctions lifted.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's frenetic tour through the nervous nations of the Persian Gulf in the last few days revealed both the outlines of the new diplomatic strategy for dealing with the crisis and the fine line she must walk to make that strategy credible.
President Hussein's latest challenge to the unity of the United Nations is well-timed -- aided by European fatigue with the sanctions, the undeniable pain the sanctions have caused ordinary Iraqis and the deterioration in the Middle East peace effort since the election last year of Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel.
The American aim is to get United Nations weapons inspectors back to work in Iraq as soon as possible, while refusing to let Mr. Hussein dictate who the inspectors will be, how many will be on a team or what their work rules will be. But Ms. Albright is also trying to hold together the widest possible international coalition, to prevent this conflict from appearing to be solely between the United States and Iraq.
"We recognize sanctions have gone on nearly seven years and represent the longest and most comprehensive sanctions in history," said a senior official traveling with Ms. Albright, adding, "We're prepared to look at it."
While denying that the United States was "negotiating" with Mr. Hussein, the official said: "If our concern for the Iraqi people is how Saddam Hussein reverses course and lets inspectors in, we'd be doubly happy. The French and Russians have said sanctions have gone on too long, and we hope that they will look at this as a step forward, which will hopefully help the Russians change Saddam's mind. We're trying to get the job done, and the job is to get the inspectors back."
To achieve her goals, Ms. Albright is working to accomplish four things:
*Rattle the sabers loudly enough to get Mr. Hussein to take the threat of military action seriously, but not so loudly as to frighten moderate Arab leaders.
*Provide enough increased relief, in the event Iraq backs down, to satisfy the Arabs, the Russians and the French, but not so much as to appear to be bargaining with Mr. Hussein out of weakness.
*Rely on diplomacy as long as possible, to make military action, if it comes, seem reluctant and inevitable, but not so long that Iraq can reconstitute the weapons of mass destruction that inspectors were in Iraq to destroy.
*Push Israel hard enough on making progress with the Palestinians to show a renewed American "evenhandedness" in the Middle East, but not so hard as to infuriate too many lawmakers and American Jews.
The moderate gulf states, from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, have no great love for Mr. Hussein, but no interest in associating themselves with the use of force against him, American officials said. Ms. Albright's main task was to reassure them that the United States is not looking for a military solution, but to remind them of the danger Mr. Hussein poses, with his pursuit of chemical and biological weapons.
"If they could press a button and get rid of Saddam, they would," said a senior American official based in the gulf. "But there is a lot of talk about American 'double standards' on the Arab street -- that the Americans are happy to starve Iraqis and punish Saddam Hussein, but do nothing to make Israel live up to its commitments to the Palestinians."
So Ms. Albright preached peace and patience but warned, quietly, that force could not be ruled out, trying to reassure the gulf states that the United States cares about their interests and has no vendetta against Iraq. And she secured their backing, American officials said, for the strategy of "intensive diplomacy backed by a robust military presence."
They urged her to stress the diplomatic side, with a particular emphasis on limited American goals, international unity and more visible sympathy for the Iraqi people.
In Qatar and elsewhere on her trip, Ms. Albright kept pressure on the Israelis to move urgently "to take the actions required" for peace and to "keep their commitments."
"Time is not on our side," she repeated. While urging courage on both sides and not mentioning Mr. Netanyahu by name, her message was meant to acknowledge Arab despair over Israeli negotiating tactics. Her pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to act during the Iraqi crisis seems to explain his efforts to meet Mr. Arafat quickly in London, and if not Mr. Arafat then King Hussein of Jordan.
An indication of the delicacy of her task was given today in Saudi Arabia, which is already a base for American, French and British pilots enforcing the "no-flight" zone in Iraq. After her long talks with Saudi leaders, the Saudi Government issued an unusual statement that stressed the Middle East peace first and the Iraqi crisis second.
The statement praised Ms. Albright for trying "to bring the peace process back to its proper tracks" and said the Saudi leaders "indicated that the difficulties facing this process are exclusively attributable to the intransigent position held by the Israeli Government and its departure from the principles and tenets of the peace process, and its failure to abide by the contractual obligations as articulated in the Oslo agreements."
On Iraq, the Saudis cited "the dangers posed to the region through the production of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq" and called on Mr. Hussein to back down. The statement concluded: "Saudi Arabia expresses its satisfaction at the collective desire to give diplomatic efforts every chance to resolve the present crisis peacefully."
Asked if the Saudis were willing to let Americans fly over Saudi territory, if necessary, to attack Iraq, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador, said simply: "We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. We and the Americans genuinely want to give the diplomatic approach a good chance. If we can avoid negative outcomes, we'll be happy."
Officials traveling with Ms. Albright said, hardly surprisingly, that she had had frank and reassuring talks. The gulf nations share the American view of the dangers Mr. Hussein poses if he is armed with weapons of mass destruction, one of the officials said. As for tactics, he added, "the dance is delicate, but we're getting a lot closer."

HEADLINE: BUILDING ON THE ARTS: A special report.;
Cities Are Fostering the Arts As a Way to Save Downtown

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
In this city in the heart of Silicon Valley, where the rise in property values (and taxes) over the last decade has fueled a mammoth redevelopment effort, the city government has built from scratch, among other things, a children's museum, a new wing for the art museum, and, opening next month, a 525-seat theater that will be the new home of the San Jose Repertory Theater. All in a downtown that was, a dozen years ago, in the words of one city official, "a wasteland, chaos everywhere you looked."
Under construction in the same general neighborhood is a technology museum, a community paean to the industry that has spurred the city's resurgence. The building is scheduled to open next fall, and the cost, $43 million, is being covered by the city. Another city-financed project, the $9.1 million Mexican Cultural Heritage Gardens, with performance space for local dance and drama troupes, is to open in 1999 in another rundown district. 
 "We want our downtown to have the support of future generations," said Frank Taylor, since 1979 the executive director of the redevelopment agency. "We lost an entire generation of children, who grew up ashamed of their downtown. There is no better way to get children acquainted with a city than through cultural facilities, through art, through music, those experiences they can share. So that's been our approach."
In a report titled "American Canvas," the National Endowment of the Arts recently described the arts in the United States as being vastly undersupported, and the Federal Government continues to debate withdrawing from its already modest role as bolsterer of the nation's creative artists. But it is one measure of the complexity of the role of the arts in this country that San Jose is voting another way, aggressively using the arts to fuel its growth.
And though this city's investment in the arts is extraordinary, it is hardly unique. From Anchorage to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cities have recently built or are in the midst of building arts palaces.
One of the most visible examples of big arts dollars being pressed into the service of local uplift is Newark, where the new $180 million New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts opened on Oct. 18 to considerable fanfare and great hope that it will turn the fortunes of a downtown area stagnant since the 1960's; more than $100 million of the cost came from the state. In September, just an hour's drive north of here, the historic War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco reopened after a refurbishment costing nearly $90 million, more than half of which was financed by a city bond issue. The same month, Kansas City opened the first American museum devoted entirely to jazz, paid for by the city. And earlier this year, Chicago announced its $18.8 million contribution to a new building for the Goodman Theater, a prominent nonprofit venue.
Philadelphia is in the midst of a $330 million project, the Avenue of the Arts. And Miami awaits ground-breaking on a mammoth performance center that would provide a home for its symphony and its opera.
"You could easily say there has been $4 billion to $5 billion in arts capital building in the last decade alone," said Steve Wolff, the president of AMS Planning and Research, a consulting concern in Fairfield, Conn., that specializes in capital building projects in the arts. "I can add up the first $3 billion in 30 seconds without even thinking."
Beyond the big-ticket building projects are myriad other efforts in which cities have imposed designated taxes on hotel rooms and amusements, offered incentives to developers and aggressively leveraged property tax revenue to raise money. They have created arts districts, financed arts festivals and promoted regularly scheduled cultural events. Often they have invested large amounts of public money in museums, concert halls and theaters to create tourist destinations, burnish regional reputations and stimulate blighted neighborhoods.
 
White Elephants? Hard Lessons From the Past
Cities have long been known for following the modish urban redevelopment concept of the day, only to find their tomorrows beset by the flaws in those ideas. Urban renewal left vast empty tracts. New highways wound up speeding the flow out of cities rather than traffic into them. Downtown office development bred design sterility and nighttime ghost towns. Whether reliance on the arts will have a similar legacy in many locales is an open question.
Many fear that without solid indigenous programming, an interested audience to build on, and links between the projects and the fabric of the city, the grandest of the arts projects can turn into white elephants. Indeed, since Lincoln Center opened in New York City in 1962, more than one city intent on replicating its success has built an arts complex that remains underused and cut off from the city.
"We have a tendency in America, if we have a success in one place, we want to replicate it," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "But there is no panacea. Arts centers are not necessarily sufficient in and of themselves to cause revitalization."
Such projects can also raise political issues that can be dangerously volatile. Is it right to spend taxpayer money on a risky capital venture that many citizens may see as elitist when hospitals, schools and roads also cry out for attention?
Supporters of the new initiatives maintain that they apply lessons learned from both the successes and failures of the past.
"I don't know if it's that people are becoming more sophisticated," Mr. Wolff said. But in many cities, he said, arts groups have led the effort to weave a new center into the fabric of the city. It was the arts people, he noted, for example, who initiated an elaborate sign system to help visitors find their way through downtown Newark.
In any case, the presumption that art is good for everybody seems to be carrying the day.
 
A Solution Local Governments Into the Breach
Congress has cut Federal financing for the National Endowment for the Arts from $176 million in 1992 to just under $100 million today, raising questions about the survival of many theater, dance and performance troupes. Still, a survey of the involvement of municipalities presents an optimistic picture of support for the arts.
According to figures compiled by Americans for the Arts, which serves as a kind of trade association for community arts groups, local government support to groups in the nation's 50 largest cities has increased an average of 4.7 percent annually since 1991. That does not take into account much of the spending of local governments on things like independent festivals and new buildings.
Providence, R.I., pushed a law through the state legislature that gives artists who move to a designated downtown district an exemption from state income tax sales of their work; landlords in the district who convert commercial space to living space get breaks on property taxes.
In Tucson, Ariz., a partnership of the city, artists and building owners has created a "phantom gallery," placing artworks in unoccupied storefronts downtown while the owners seek tenants. Rock Island, Ill., has made a modest $600,000 arts center and a riverboat gambling casino on the Mississippi the twin cornerstones of an arts and entertainment district that has witnessed an influx of restaurants, nightclubs, design firms and galleries.
"Almost every community in this country is using the arts in some way as a part of revitalization," said Hilary Frost-Kumpf, who is writing a book about municipal cultural districts for the Americans for the Arts coalition. There are 55 to 60 officially designated cultural districts in cities across the country, and in many of them, "people are coming downtown again," she said.
The most dramatic municipal ventures involve buildings, particularly the rash of ambitious theater/exhibition/performance complexes that have been constructed all over in the last decade as local governments followed the lead of private foundations in places like Cleveland.
In the 1970's, three downtown theaters in Cleveland were refurbished into Playhouse Square, a performing arts center that brought about a renaissance just when the city was financially desperate. In Pittsburgh, during similarly lean times, the old Stanley Theater was expanded into the Benedum Center, home to the opera and the ballet: since opening in 1987, it has become the building block of an expanding arts district.
In the last decade, cities as small as West Palm Beach, Fla., and Escondido, Calif., a San Diego suburb, have invested millions in arts centers. Charleston, W. Va., with less than 100,000 people, has an $80 million project, a combination concert hall, arts museum, interactive science museum and planetarium, scheduled to begin construction in the spring; the state has contributed $22 million, and the city has pledged $5.5 million, with corporations, grants and private donors also contributing.
Philadelphia's ongoing $330 million Avenue of the Arts project, which would line Broad Street with cultural sites anchored by a $200 million performing arts center that is still a twinkle in Mayor Ed Rendell's eye, includes $100 million in support from the state and the city.
Miami is certainly going through hard times now, the World Series notwithstanding. Its coffers are low and its municipal government has been buffeted by a massive corruption scandal. But that has not extinguished hope for the future, based in large part on the arts. Optimism endures even though a plan to build two performance halls totaling 4,700 seats on a seedy tract just north of downtown is now well over budget and the city is seeking $48 million in private money to start the project.
"We have aspirations to be one of the great cities of the 21st century," said Michael Spring, director of the Metro-Dade Cultural Affairs Council. "Our civic leaders believe that great cities have great buildings. This will be the jewel in our crown."
Chicago considered and rejected the construction of a new arts center. But it has the Goodman, and it is working with a variety of entertainment giants -- Disney, Livent of Toronto and Fox Theatricals -- to refurbish other theaters in a part of the city that is now dark and dangerous at night. By the year 2000, there could be 15,000 seats to fill for performances in a radius of just a few blocks -- an American theater district second only to Broadway.
"The downtown already had most of the museums," said Lois Weisberg, the city's cultural affairs commissioner. "It had most of the interesting architecture that people come here to see. I would say Chicago is pinning its hopes on cultural institutions to redevelop downtown."
The historical model for these efforts is Lincoln Center, which broke ground in 1959 in what was then a benighted neighborhood and is now the anchor of Manhattan's thriving Upper West Side. But the transformation took decades, a luxury of waiting that many cities may not be able to afford.
"We always felt that in a city like Miami, which is already made out of many pieces, it was very risky to bet on the success of a facility in an isolated area," said Jean-Francois Lejeune, a professor at the University of Miami's school of architecture. "In the case of Lincoln Center, it took a long time, maybe 20 years. We are afraid it may be the same for Miami."
The other, and in some ways larger, question is whether such an entity is suited to the local arts marketplace. An arts center in a small city, like a Wal-Mart on the outskirts of town, can siphon attention and audiences from the arts groups already operating. And to sustain a major arts venue in a place where none existed before, the habit of attendance has to be nurtured in the potential audience. Lincoln Center, after all, not only had New York, with its built-in demand for the arts, it had world-class performing organizations -- the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic -- as original tenants.
"It wasn't an economic development project, it was an artistic project with development overtones," said Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center. Although this might be disputed by the urban planners who once derided the project as gussied-up slum clearance that uprooted a viable neighborhood, its artistic potential wouldn't be disputed by anyone. The problem faced by many of these new centers elsewhere, Mr. Leventhal said, is "what they call product."
"What do they actually put in these buildings?" he asked.
 
A Textbook Case From Arts Showplace To Bar Mitzvah Venue
 Perhaps nowhere have these issues been more evident than in Escondido, a city of 125,000, which spent $81 million in public money to build the California Center for the Arts. The center -- which includes a 1,500-seat concert hall, a 400-seat theater, a contemporary art museum and a conference center on a 12-acre greensward across the street from a struggling mall -- is a beautiful campus, but it does seem a bit overwhelming in what is fundamentally a bedroom community with empty storefronts downtown.
It opened in 1994 with a hugely ambitious program that was meant to lure audiences and performers north from San Diego (though the larger hall is too small for sizable Broadway productions and big-draw concert performers). It was also hoped that, in combination with the nearby San Diego Wild Animal Park, the arts center would help establish Escondido as a destination all of its own, even though there is not a single hotel downtown.
The operating budget was $3.5 million, but the center spent more than $8 million its first year. Corporate and private donations declined after the hoopla of the grand opening. All of this forced the city to triple its annual support, from $500,000 to $1.5 million, and bring in a new director, Robert A. Freedman, who cut staff and all department budgets by 20 percent. The city's Mayor faced an unexpectedly close re-election campaign, as a result, many felt, of his big project.
Since then Mr. Freedman has had to cut back on the center's ambitions by allotting more events to independent promoters, essentially renting the place out, and to find other revenue-producing uses for the buildings. The campus is a frequent site of photo shoots and, increasingly, television and film sets, and the conference center is booking bar mitzvahs and weddings.
The center's programming is sprinkled with the kinds of pop performers not ordinarily thought to be regulars on the arts circuit. Country and New Age music increasingly joust with classical performers for room on the marquee.
"In a community like this there's always a balancing act," Mr. Freedman said. "We have a lot of trailer parks here. Do you bring in Yo-Yo Ma for the people who write the checks? Or do you bring in Johnny Cash for the people who might want to see something else? Yo-Yo Ma sold out. Johnny Cash sold out. John Tesh sold out."
After losses totaling $1.5 million two years ago, the center had a deficit of just $76,000 last year and is expected to break even for the 1997-98 season. "We may not be drawing for every show, " Mr. Freedman said. "But we're finding out who our audience is. And it feels good."
 
Success Story How a City Was Reborn
 Escondido seems to have discovered what San Jose foresaw -- that, in the words of David Resnicow, a museum consultant in New York who has worked with many city planners around the country, "the big issue is whether a city government makes arts building a part of a broader strategy, woven into the city's infrastructure, or whether it's supposed to be a quick fix."
San Jose, with a population of 850,000, was once the small, thriving capital of the agricultural region below San Francisco. But it began losing its center in the 1950's, when City Hall and the newspaper, The San Jose Mercury News, moved from downtown and a new mall drained away shoppers. Over the next three decades, downtown went to seed as the population grew on the outskirts.
"The city we're replacing was a city of 50,000 to 75,000," said Mr. Taylor, the redevelopment director, "a city that existed from 1900-1950. It was just a nice place. You went downtown, the doctor was there, the dentist was there. You bought a hat; you got a key made; you went home."
It was in 1976 that San Jose built its performing arts center downtown as a home for the San Jose Symphony. Though the center thrived on its own, it never catalyzed the kind of renaissance that places like Newark and Escondido are hoping for.
"When people used that one lonely cultural facility, they came into town and left right afterwards," said Carol Beddo, an assistant to Mr. Taylor who grew up in San Jose.
But today, a half-dozen major arts sites are within walking distance of one another downtown, all built with the 2 percent of the budget that goes to public art. An arts district on South First Street (nicknamed SoFa) is beginning to bloom, with coffeehouses, music clubs, galleries and movie houses.
Members of the arts community are delighted by the city's rebirth. But more notable is their sense of being included -- "We're all trying to make this a barn-raising mentality," said Peter B. Giles, the president of the new technology museum.
It is a place where the glass indisputably seems half full. "The city gave us the land, and they gave us $20 million," said Timothy Near, the artistic director of the San Jose Repertory Theater, which is about to move into its first permanent home since its inception in 1980. "They said, we want this, but you are the professionals, so we had a lot of input into making this building. For a city to put this much support behind a theater company, it's an extraordinary expression of its desire to have a cultural heart."
Granted, San Jose's resurgence has required a windfall; the bustle of Silicon Valley has provided property-tax income that the city has leveraged in the bond market to the tune of more than $1 billion over the last dozen years. The money financed a strategy of knitting arts building to other civic concerns like creating parks, building a light-rail system, a convention center and an arena (which brought a professional hockey franchise, the San Jose Sharks, to town) and luring corporations like Adobe Systems, which established its headquarters downtown last year.
"You can redevelop without cultural institutions," Mr. Taylor said, "but it's not going to be a happy city, a city you'll feel proud about."

HEADLINE: CUNY Trustees Narrow Search for Chancellor to Three as Board Meeting Approaches

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Two months after the departure of Dr. W. Ann Reynolds as its Chancellor, the City University still has no acting chancellor, the deputy chancellor has resigned and no search committee for a permanent chancellor has been named.
But a panel of trustees that is seeking a temporary replacement for Dr. Reynolds has narrowed its list to three longtime educators: Christoph M. Kimmich, provost and academic vice president at Brooklyn College; T. Edward Hollander, a professor at the Graduate School of Management at Rutgers University and former Chancellor of Higher Education in New Jersey, and Ira Bloom, a professor of political science at CUNY's Lehman College and a former CUNY vice chancellor. 
 The candidates, who all declined to comment on their candidacies, are to be interviewed by the CUNY board this week and by aides to Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The trustees are hoping to name an interim chancellor at their meeting on Monday.
Some officials and faculty members called the close attention by the Governor and Mayor's offices unusual. Edith Everett, a longtime trustee and former vice chairwoman who was involved in naming previous chancellors, said neither office had screened candidates then. "Politically speaking," Ms. Everett said, "I think education and politics should be kept very far apart."
But she added that "I understand that because there has been so much difficulty, they may have a special interest here," referring to the board's differences with Dr. Reynolds and to its search for an interim chancellor.
Spokesmen for Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani said the interviews were courtesy calls. The chairwoman of the trustees, Dr. Anne A. Paolucci, would not comment on the search or the involvement of the Mayor and Governor's offices, except to say: "Whatever input they have, I'm sure we'll hear. It is our decision, whether they leave it to us or not."
The Chancellor's office has been vacant since mid-September, when Dr. Reynolds left to become president of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, after growing disagreements with the CUNY trustees.
Since July, when Dr. Reynolds announced her resignation, the general counsel and the vice chancellor for student affairs have left, and the deputy chancellor, Laurence F. Mucciolo, has said he will leave by Nov. 30, to go to Northeastern University.
The board has not named a committee to seek a permanent chancellor, although Dr. Paolucci said she hoped to do that soon.
Mr. Kimmich, a history professor with degrees from Haverford and Oxford, has been at Brooklyn and the Graduate Center since 1973. He has been provost at Brooklyn since 1989. Faculty members there called him a good manager with respect for the faculty. But he was criticized for his role in "Brooklyn Connections," proposals for interdisciplinary programs in areas like communications and the environment. Critics said they threatened the rigorous core curriculum, but Mr. Kimmich and other officials said they would build on the core, not replace it.
Mr. Hollander, an accountant and economist with a Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh, taught at CUNY and was vice chancellor for budget, academic affairs and planning there from 1967 to 1971. He has the broadest administrative experience of the candidates; from 1977 to 1990, he was Chancellor of the New Jersey Department of Higher Education. A respected administrator, he worked under three governors, but some faculty members saw him as overly tough on unions.
Mr. Bloom is the only person remaining from the search panel's original short list. A graduate of City College who received a law degree from Harvard, he was CUNY vice chancellor for faculty and staff relations from 1984 until 1992, when he had a disagreement with Dr. Reynolds and returned to teaching. Some CUNY officials described him as a good administrator with a broad grasp of the university and its problems.

HEADLINE: CUTOFF SWITCHES FOR CAR AIRBAGS WILL BE ALLOWED

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Soccer moms, people who drive school carpools and others who can state that they drive more children than will fit in back seats will be permitted to have switches installed to disable passenger-side airbags, as part of a new Federal policy to be announced on Tuesday.
The rule, to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, marks a conspicuous U-turn on airbags, devices required by law in new cars on the driver's side in the steering column and on the passenger's side. The new rule not only will allow car owners to have mechanics install switches to disable passenger-side air bags, but in some cases will also allow owners to get permission to have the driver's side bags disconnected. 
 Transportation officials still assert that airbags remain life-saving devices for the majority of people. But as the use of passenger-side bags widened, their design proved dangerous to small children and petite women.
Standard airbags can expand at up to 200 miles per hour in a crash, fast enough to cushion an average-sized man not wearing a seatbelt who is thrown forward in a 30 m.p.h. head-on collision.
But the inflation of the bags is so fast that airbags have killed 87 people, including 49 children, according to national statistics collected over a 10-year-period, leading to an outcry that forced the Federal Government to adjust its position.
The National Transportation Safety Board has long argued that the solution in these cases is to bar children from front seats and to enforce seat-belt laws. Although the Government has allowed car owners themselves to disconnect the bags, it has forbidden car dealers and auto repair shops from doing so unless the Federal Transportation Department granted an exemption to the car owner.
Now, with awareness of the fatalities bringing increasing public clamor for cut-off switches, Transportation officials and the White House decided instead to give car owners more freedom to choose.
Several Government officials said that they were persuaded to endorse the new policy because the airbag rule, unlike other Government rules, fundamentally affects people differently. Although airbags generally reduce the risk of death for adults, the safety devices come at the expense of children.
Of the children who died, 12 were babies in rear-facing seats, their skulls positioned directly in front of the bags. Of the 37 older children, 34 were not wearing seat belts and the remaining three were not belted properly, Government statistics show. In addition, three adults have been killed by passenger-side airbags. Airbags have killed 35 drivers, of whom 24 were not wearing seat belts. Thirteen of the total were women under 5-foot-2 inches tall.
Government officials and private experts who knew details of the rule would not comment publicly today. But privately, they provided specific descriptions of the policy, which the Government will begin using on Dec. 18 to process applications.
Under the new rule, car owners will still have to apply to the Transportation Department for permission to have a cut-off switch installed. The car owner would have to show the permit to a car dealer or repair shop to have the disabling device installed.
The cut-off switch will probably cost $150 to $200. A display light will indicate that the airbag is disabled.
In addition to applying to people who carry children in the front seat because they have too little space in back, the new rule will apply to vehicles that have no back seat, like pick-up trucks. The policy will also affect children who a pediatrician says must be kept in sight of a parent for medical reasons. Drivers who cannot sit with their chests 10 inches from the steering wheel, and adults with special health problems, will also get permission.
Transportation officials and safety experts say they are worried that the new rule will encourage far too many people to seek permission to disable airbags, creating a whole new category of fatalities that occurred because the bags were turned off. The insurance industry also has expressed misgivings about letting people choose to turn off their airbags.
In anticipation, the Transportation Department on Tuesday plans to couple the announcement of the rule with a safety campaign to dissuade the general public from rushing to buy the switches.
"For the vast majority of people, airbags continue to make sense," said Michael J. Jablonski, a spokesman for TRW, which builds both airbags and cut-off switches. "How well that educational message goes through, it all depends."
As part of its safety message, the Transportation Department says that in the past 10 years, airbags have saved 2,288 drivers, and killed 35. Among passengers, they have saved 332 people, and killed 52. Another 20 passenger deaths are still under investigation, though, which could change the ratio of about one life lost for every six saved.
Robert C. Sanders, whose 7-year-old daughter was killed by the airbag in the front passenger seat of the family's 1995 Dodge Caravan in Baltimore two years ago in a 9.3 m.p.h. collision, said he had no doubt that some people would now die because they had switched off the airbags. Mr. Sanders, who heads an organization called Parents for Safer Airbags, said the new rule made it more important than ever for the Government to release a list of car makes in which no one has been killed or seriously injured because of superior air bag design. Among those he listed were BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Saab.
Mercedes and BMW bags do not deploy in the lowest-speed collisions, and expand more slowly if the driver or passenger is buckled into a seatbelt, reducing the risk of airbag injury. The Government is considering requiring new cars to have those features in a few years.
As of Oct. 6, the Transportation Department said it had received 11,379 letters from people seeking to disconnect their bags. Of those, 6,573 were denied immediately for not stating a valid reason, according to the agency, and of the remaining 4,806, the agency granted the requests in 4,188 cases and rejected them in 592. Twenty-six were pending.

HEADLINE: 70 Die in Attack at Egypt Temple

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: LUXOR, Egypt, Nov. 17

 BODY:
At least 70 people, including 60 foreign tourists, were killed outside a 3,400-year-old temple here this morning, in what Government officials called the deadliest attack by Islamic militants in their five-year campaign to overthrow the Egyptian Government.
While the militants had attacked foreigners in the past, today's strike brought the violence for the first time to the tombs and temples here that have attracted so many visitors in recent years that Luxor had come to resemble a Pharaonic theme park. 
 At 8:45 this morning, as tourists left their buses and walked toward a staircase leading to the Temple of Hatshepsut, they ran into what was apparently a carefully planned ambush by six gunmen who concealed themselves in the structure.
The battle between militants and the police that followed sent gunfire crackling for three hours among the sites on the west bank of the Nile, which is home to the famed Valley of the Kings and the tomb of Tutankhamen. Egyptian authorities said all six attackers were killed.
Egypt's Interior Ministry said the dead among the tourists included Swiss, Germans and Japanese. The British Foreign Office said six Britons were among the victims. United States officials said they had not been told that any Americans were among the dead.
The massacre seemed bound to exact a heavy toll on an economy that depends heavily on foreign tourism. Only last month, the temple was the scene of a gala moonlight performance of Verdi's opera "Aida" sponsored by the Egyptian Government, which has been trying to draw even more tourists to Luxor. The total is now two million a year.
Tonight, a very different mood was cast by the flashing red light of a solitary police vehicle that stood watch outside the massive structure, which is partly carved into a limestone cliff. Armed policemen barred reporters from the scene and from a nearby hospital that had been turned into a mortuary for the victims.
Hours after the early-morning attack, the details of what happened remained imprecise. The Government gave no breakdown by nationality of those who were killed, and it did not say whether any group had taken responsibility for the attack.
But an Egyptian taxi driver wounded in the shooting said in a hospital here tonight that the attackers had worn red headbands identifying them as members of the Islamic Group, the largest of the militant organizations fighting to topple the Government of President Hosni Mubarak and replace it with an Islamic state.
Reuters and Agence France- Presse quoted reports that pamphlets left at the scene of the attack appeared to link it to the Islamic Group. And Egypt's official television referred to the attackers as "terrorist elements." President Hosni Mubarak convened an emergency meeting of his Cabinet tonight.
Mr. Mubarak made no public statement, but the Tourism Minister, Mamdou el-Beltagi, told reporters at a travel fair in London that he felt "shock and sorrow" at "this cowards' crime committed against our guests and Egyptians as well." The minister was quoted as saying that the Government was doing all it could to protect tourists, but added that it was too early to predict the impact of the massacre on Egypt's $3 billion-a-year tourism industry.
According to accounts by several witnesses, the attack began as a group of tourists who had just arrived by bus began to walk from a parking lot toward a broad stairway leading into the three-level temple, built as the resting place of the Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut, who ruled from 1492 to 1458 B.C.
Some witnesses, including the taxi driver, Badawi Ahmed Salam, 33, said the assailants had opened fire from several levels of the temple, first killing police guards and then turning their guns upon tourists.
The Interior Ministry said the six assailants had been armed with six automatic weapons, two handguns and hand-made explosives. One was shot dead at the scene, but the others were not killed until hours of carnage had passed. At one point, according to the police, they boarded a bus to kill Japanese tourists.
Only after they tried to flee the scene by hijacking a tour bus and then running into forbidding hills were the last five assailants slain by the police, some three hours after their attack began. And even then, hundreds of troops scoured the hills and the surrounding desert in search of possible accomplices to the attack.
Among those whom the Egyptian Government said were killed in the shooting were two policemen and two Egyptian civilians.
Another 25 people were wounded, 16 of them foreign tourists. Some were so seriously wounded that they were flown by military helicopters to hospitals in Cairo, 315 miles to the north.
As the gun battle raged, hundreds of tourists who began their day by crossing from the luxury hotels in Luxor to the sites on the west bank found themselves pinned down. Many of them cowered in fear inside the temples.
"Everyone here is just absolutely devastated," a British tourist said tonight. Like most other foreign witnesses still in Luxor this evening, she refused to give her name or to talk much about what she had seen.
Since they began their violent campaign in 1992, Islamic militants in Egypt had killed 34 foreigners in bombings, shootings and other attacks that have left more than 1,200 people dead in all. They also include 9 German tourists killed two months ago in an attack on their tour bus in central Cairo, and 18 Greek tourists who were killed in April 1996.
Over the years, the militants have issued several warnings for foreign tourists to leave Egypt. But tourists have flooded back to Egypt in recent years as a harsh Government crackdown has sharply decreased the level of violence.
Since 1993, the number of foreign tourists visiting Egypt has increased from 2.5 million to a projected level of 4.2 million this year, a record.
The timing of today's attack suggests that it may have been intended to coincide with a military trial beginning in Cairo of 66 suspected militants accused of plotting to kill Government officials.
In addition to the red headband glimpsed by one witness, the evidence linking the Islamic Group to today's attack included pamphlets emblazoned with the group's name and left near the scene, Agence France- Presse reported.
Reuters quoted a tour-agency employee, Ahmed Youssef, as saying that he had seen a pamphlet that read "No to tourists in Egypt" and that was signed "Omar Abdel Rahman's Squadron of Havoc and Destruction." Sheik Abdel Rahman, the spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, is serving a life sentence in the United States for plotting to blow up the World Trade Center.
The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it thought as many as 20 Swiss nationals were among the slain tourists.

The M.T.A. Doesn't Like The 'S' Word

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
LONG, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away -- to be more precise, in the first term of Mayor Edward I. Koch -- the proposed education budget one year mentioned something called "service delivery system consolidations."
Once the jaw was reset after having chewed on that a bit, it could be asked what in the name of Casey Stengel they were trying to tell us. It soon became clear that this was not a case of bureaucratic polysyllabism happening to run amok. This was what they call a public relations strategy. 
 "Service delivery system consolidations," in plain English, meant that the people in charge were about to shut some schools. But you tell parents flat out that a school is about to be closed in their neighborhood, and you'd better hunker down for polysyllabic flak of the four-letter variety. A linguistic veil like "service delivery system consolidations" buys some time to find cover.
All this came to mind yesterday at a monthly board meeting of New York City Transit, formerly the Transit Authority. If you have never sat in on a meeting of this branch of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, take it from a first timer. You haven't missed much.
But an interesting thing did happen. It was hard not to be entertained by the way board members jumped through hoops to avoid using the word "surplus," as in, "It seems we will end the year with a large surplus." Instead, they used phrases like "above budget."
When Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, went briefly astray by uttering the dread word, he was immediately set right by Daniel T. Scannell, a veteran subway man who presided over the meeting. "Excess of budget," Mr. Scannell corrected him, and that led to memories of "service delivery system consolidation."
Why the word games?
Because the last thing that transit officials want to say out loud for now is that they are indeed running a substantial surplus: $128.6 million and counting. Their concern -- quite understandable, really -- is that if they acknowledge they are rolling in dough, the Governor and the Mayor will cut state and city subsidies for mass transit faster than you can say IRT. Both have done it before, and could well do it again. So ixnay on the urplusay.
But the fact remains that New York City Transit is suddenly, and happily, knee-deep in cash. That's partly because New Yorkers, lured by a new Metrocard system that enables them to transfer between subways and buses for free, are using mass transit in numbers not seen in decades.
The figures for September, presented to board members yesterday, were remarkable. Bear in mind that September was the first normal work month since the transfer system went into effect in July.
Ridership soared. Weekdays, it was up 3.5 percent on the subways over September 1996, making it the best September since 1970. On weekends, the increase was 8.1 percent, the best since 1968, when John V. Lindsay was mayor. Buses did even better, with ridership 15.8 percent higher than the year before on weekdays and 14.7 percent on weekends, numbers not seen since the 1980's.
IN short, giving the customer a break is a money maker. Care to bet that Metrocard use reaches the ionosphere in January, when the M.T.A. begins offering card buyers 11 rides for the price of 10?
"They're in an official state of denial, but they're sitting on a lot of money," said Gene Russianoff, a leader of the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group.
So, whether you call it a surplus or an excess of budget, the only question that matters is what to do with that cash. Mr. Reuter refused to tip his hand. "We want to use this money," he said, "but we don't want to do something that in six months we will have to take away." Meaning, should the economy turn south, or Albany and City Hall turn stingy.
Several ideas have been floated: put the money in a rainy day fund; use it to reduce the M.T.A.'s debt; funnel it into capital projects. Sound suggestions, all.
But none is exactly high profile, and the lack of visibility almost invites political leaders to slice mass transit subsidies at some point down the line, Mr. Russianoff argued. Spend the money now, he urged, to put more subway cars and buses into service, or to enhance the Metrocard discount to a 12-for-10 deal.
Otherwise, he predicted, the politicians will find a way to steal that surplus, and we all know what could then happen: a service delivery system consolidation.

HEADLINE: PLUS: BASEBALL -- YANKEES;
Williams Unwanted

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Nobody wants Bernie Williams.
 That's what Bob Watson said today. Watson is the Yankees' general manager and apparently should know these things. 
 "I've run it by everybody," Watson said. "Nobody's talking about Bernie. That is somewhat understandable but also surprising. Nobody wants him. Why?"
 Watson didn't answer his own question, but the answer he had in mind was obvious: the kind of contract the center fielder is asking for.
 "I just don't see Bernie being an $80 million guy," Watson said, picking a figure that Scott Boras, Williams' agent, said he has never used. Boras, in fact, said today he had not asked for any specific amount of money, just a seven-year contract based on the contracts gained earlier this year by Gary Sheffield of Florida ($10,1666,667 a year) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs ($10,625,000 a year).
 "Just because these other people are doing these things, from my standpoint we have to take a good look at baseball sense and economic sense," Watson said. "This does not make good economic sense to step out and do this. Just because someone else is jumping off the cliff, why should I?"
 The Yankees, for 20 years, have been the team other teams complain about raising the market price for players, and George Steinbrenner has always defended his spending practices. Now the Yankees are singling out other teams for doing foolish things.
 Watson said he would be content with signing Williams to a one-year contract, after which he could become a free agent. Does that mean that the Yankees would be willing to pay Williams $10 million if he won that figure in salary arbitration?
 "They will not award him $10 million," Watson said. "The people who do the arbitrations tell us it will be in the mid-7s."
 The Yankees have offered Williams $7.5 million a year for five years. MURRAY CHASS

HEADLINE: Invisible, and in Anguish;
A Slain Driver's Service Brings Attention to Senegalese

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
The first 150 or so people to arrive at Francisco's Funeraria in East Harlem yesterday were able to squeeze into the upstairs room where Elhadji Gaye's body lay inside a plywood crate, the word "Senegal" scrawled across it in black marker as a crude shipping instruction.
Later arrivals to the funeral home made do with the staircase, then the lobby, then a chapel on the first floor, and finally the sidewalk, where they could barely hear the Muslim prayers being said as a farewell to Mr. Gaye, a livery-cab driver who was shot and killed on Friday night. 
 It was a stunning turnout, rife with tears. It was also a window into the tight bonds and common anguish of a little-known immigrant group whose struggle to make a better life in New York City led many of them into a dangerous profession.
Over the last 15 years, thousands of men from the West African country of Senegal have trickled into New York City. Many, like Mr. Gaye, followed a trajectory that put them behind the wheel of a livery cab. Many, like Mr. Gaye, have died there.
The people who showed up at a prayer service for him yesterday came not only to pay their respects but to draw attention to that phenomenon. "This goes on and on and on," said one Senegalese immigrant, Saite Sall, referring to prayer services for Senegalese men who have been killed driving livery or gypsy cabs.
Police said Mr. Gaye was shot in the back of the head when he tried to escape two female passengers who were trying to rob him. The women, Marta Nelson, 17, and Erica Colon, 22, were arrested on Saturday and are being held without bail on murder charges.
Mr. Sall, who is president of the African Islamic Center in the Bronx, said that Mr. Gaye is at least the 40th Senegalese cab driver killed since Mr. Sall's own brother died that way in 1985.
According to Timothy O'Brien, owner of the company that operates Francisco's Funeraria, that may be a low estimate. Mr. O'Brien, who does many of the Muslim prayer services for West African immigrants in Harlem, said that over the last 15 years, he has handled scores of funerals for West African livery-cab drivers killed on the job. About half of those drivers, he guessed, were Senegalese.
Alan J. Fromberg, a spokesman for the city Taxi and Limousine Commission, said yesterday that whatever the nationality or immigrant status of livery-cab drivers killed annually on the job, the number has decreased dramatically. Mr. Fromberg said that while 35 drivers were killed in 1992 and 37 in 1993, only 19 were killed last year and 13 so far this year. "The drop in crime under the Giuliani administration has been very effective in making the livery industry safer," he said.
Senegalese drivers insisted that the job remains not only perilous, but is an economic stepping stone and a necessary evil.
Men from Senegal first began arriving in New York in significant numbers in the early to mid-1980's, around the time that France, a favorite destination, erected new boundaries to their arrival.
Although city officials say that the known population of Senegalese immigrants here is under 1,000, social service and health care agencies say that a more likely figure, taking into account undocumented residents, is between 6,000 and 20,000.
For the most part, these men, who usually entered the United States on tourist visas, were not among the poorest residents of Senegal; they needed at least enough money for a plane ticket across the Atlantic. They left behind wives and children, promising to send money home so that relatives could join them.
Although some men ended up in parts of Brooklyn and others in the Bronx, perhaps the greatest number settled in Harlem, where they found fellow West Africans and mosques with Islamic services. And they lived as cheaply as they could. Mr. Gaye, for example, lived in an apartment with four other West African men.
"They were quadrupled and quintupled up in rooms in single-room occupancy hotels and cooking on burners on the floors," said Dr. Francesca M. Gany, director of the New York Task Force on Immigrant Health, who has treated and come to know many of them.
For many, the first job was hawking watches, T-shirts or sunglasses as a street peddler. But it was work that paid poorly and exposed them constantly to police officers and immigration officials. They rented or bought a car for a livery cab as soon as they made enough money.
They were drawn into the livery business much as any immigrant group is drawn into a particular trade: because other West Africans and Senegalese before them had made that choice.
But there were other benefits as well, particularly for undocumented workers with minimal education. A driver did not need to know much English, and was not subjected to the prying eyes of a boss.
"We go to other places and ask for work and they ask for a green card or immigration papers," said Moustapha Dieye, who came here from Senegal in 1988 on a tourist visa. He shares a Bronx apartment with three other men. Mr. Dieye, 28, said that before he began driving a livery cab six years ago, he was turned down for jobs at restaurants and supermarkets and, for a while, sold T-shirts in Times Square, but there was no money in it and too many police officers around.
Driving a livery cab, he clears about $200 a week. He said he is aware of the danger: he knew Mr. Gaye, and he also knew another driver who was killed a year ago.
"I am scared but I can't do anything else," Mr. Dieye said. "I have no choice. I have no green card. That's why I drive a cab."
That sense of helplessness hovered over Francisco's Funeraria. Janice Phibian, said that she and other co-workers of Mr. Gaye had made donations so that his body could be washed and wrapped, in accordance with Islamic tradition, and sent home. Mr. O'Brien, who supervised that process, said it has grown more familiar, but no less sad.
"These guys are so honorable," he said. "It's a shame what happens to them here."

HEADLINE: Too Many Trees Are Falling

BYLINE: By James A. Leach; James A. Leach, a Republican, is a United States Representative from Iowa.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The only trouble with the movement for the preservation of our forests," Theodore Roosevelt noted in 1908, "is that it has not gone nearly far enough." That is still the problem today.
In the waning hours of the just-concluded session, Congress passed a bill intended to set up a pilot "fuel break" project in certain national forests in California. But is the bill landmark legislation because it places modest limits on logging, or will its allowance of cutting on more than 40,000 acres only continue the 300-year hemorrhaging of one of our most precious resources? 
 Like the bison herds that sustained the Plains Indians, the sea of trees that covered the eastern half and far west of America seemed to early settlers to be an inexhaustible resource.
In 1891, with the effect of two centuries of profligate tree cutting becoming apparent, Congress established the national forest system. But a short six years later it created the Federal timber sales program, and logging in our new national forests began.
Today, with 95 percent of the country's original forests already logged, most of the remaining 5 percent are subject to being cut, with logs hauled from public land on access roads constructed at public expense.
Less than 4 percent of the country's wood products come from public lands, yet Federal subsidies for this logging are inexcusably large; last year alone, the subsidy was $791 million. And the Government not only subsidizes roads for logging companies, it also pays communities to support schools and other services for the families of loggers.
But the program's real cost extends beyond this corporate welfare. Continued logging in national forests worsens soil erosion, lake and stream sedimentation, and air and water quality. Some jobs may be created, but whether their number exceeds those in the fishing, recreation and tourism industries that are jeopardized when machines intrude on nature's habitat is open to question.
Indeed, according to the Forest Service, logging jobs represent less than 3 percent of all jobs in our national forests.
If we are to be good stewards of public lands, we must protect what remains of our national forests. One way to do this is to create programs to insure maximum use of recyclable materials.
In 1992 almost half of all American hardwood lumber production was used to make pallets for shipping. And according to the industry, more than half of these pallets are used just once and then discarded, ending up in landfills. Subsidized wood products promote this type of waste.
Ending the logging subsidy makes good environmental and economic sense and should be a high priority for a free-market economy. That is why Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a Georgia Democrat, and I have introduced legislation to end logging on public lands.
Our bill would provide for the retraining of displaced timber workers, economic development assistance to affected lumbering communities, and research into recycling and ecological restoration.
At first blush, some might think ending logging on Federal land is environmental extremism, but in fact, it is common sense.
Insuring the environmental future requires a global effort, and we should do our part. The United States is quick to scold third world countries that destroy tropical forests, decrying the impact on global warming and biodiversity.
If we are going to exhort other countries to preserve their forests, we ought to act to save our own. Forest preservation is neither a regional nor a partisan issue. The national forests belong to all Americans, and their proper management is everybody's business.

Cathay Pacific is offering a big discount on round-trip fares from the U.S. to Hong Kong.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
HOPING to revive Hong Kong's slumping tourist industry, as well as increase passenger loads, Cathay Pacific is offering an economy-class round-trip fare for two from New York or Los Angeles for $999, plus taxes. Travel, which includes five nights at one of the approximately 60 participating hotels, must be booked no later than Dec. 3 and completed by Feb. 15, 1998. Seats are limited.
The hugely discounted fare amounts to a formal recognition that Hong Kong's once vibrant tourist industry has been in a deep slump since last May, two months before it reverted from British to Chinese rule. Tourism fell 35.2 percent this July, compared with the previous July; it plunged 24.4 percent in August and 22.4 percent in September. 
 Those falling numbers have hurt -- if not imperiled -- Hong Kong hotels, restaurants, boutiques, the tourism work force, and, of course, Cathay Pacific. Other airlines are also feeling the pinch; traffic on Northwest Airline's Tokyo-Hong Kong route is down about 15 percent so far this month.
Its 2-for-1 offer, Cathay Pacific said, is designed to revitalize Hong Kong's inbound tourism. The carrier added that it hoped to attract 20,000 visitors who, according to the Hong Kong Tourist Association, could "inject more than $18 million (United States) into the area's economy."
Malaysia is also experiencing a drop in tourism, largely because of haze from the forest fires in Indonesia that covered much of Southeast Asia last month, causing airports to shut down and the United States and some European governments to warn their citizens against visiting the involved areas. As a result, tourism is down throughout most of the region, from Singapore to the Philippines.
But Malaysia, which has plans to double its number of tourists to 20 million by 2000, is especially worried by the drop in tourism and hotel cancellations -- so much so that some hotels are offering discounts up to 50 percent
Ahmad Zaki, the head of the Malaysian Tourist Office in New York, acknowledged yesterday that tourism had fallen off throughout the region. But he added that while some air pollution from the fires remained, it was no longer a big problem.
 
Hotel for 'Sale'
Times Square has long been synonymous with New Year's Eve, so it probably is not surprising that the Millennium Broadway hotel is planning a special event to welcome in the year 2000: It has offered to "sell" the 627-room hotel for three days to a single customer for $3 million. And it claims to have a bona fide potential customer.
"It's an international company," said Michael Littler, the manager of the 52-story hotel just off Broadway on 44th Street. "But we still have to work out some details."
Whoever it is, the "buyer" will have exclusive control of the hotel and its staff from Dec. 30, 1999, until checkout Jan. 2, 2000. In addition to all meals, snacks and beverages for up to 1,200 guests, the price tag will include the hotel's attached Hudson Theater, which seats 700 theater-style or 300 for a sit-down dinner. And it will include the right to entirely wrap the top of the building with a corporate logo or "any legal or acceptable promotion."
"We'll know by the end of this year whether we have a signed contract," Mr. Littler said, and if that falls through, the hotel will keep the bid open until next September. After that it will take the offer off the table, because, he added, "We already have enough inquiries to fill the place with individual visitors."
 
Read Before You Go
Business travelers going abroad will be able to bone up on the culture and commerce of the countries they are visiting with a series of books recently introduced by the American Geographical Society. Reintroduced, and updated, to be exact, since the series, "Around the World," was a big seller years ago but has not been published for 25 years.
The six volumes published so far are on Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Fiji, Madagascar and Malta, with Brazil, Scotland, Brunei and Oman to follow. Only 60 pages each, the books are not intended as travel books but as introductory overviews, and all are written by geographers; the volume on Japan, for example, is written by Roman Cybriwsky of Temple University, the author of a previous book about Tokyo.
 
Plug In the Car
Hilton Hotels said yesterday that it was equipping its hotels and corporate office in Southern California with charging stations for electrical vehicles.

HEADLINE: On Using the Subway Surplus

 BODY:
Despite their reluctance to admit it in public, the executives who run New York City's mass transit are accumulating a 1997 surplus that would make some on Wall Street salivate. At $126.8 million and rising, the surplus could wind up close to $150 million. But whatever it totals come Dec. 31, every penny ought to finance vastly improved bus and subway service -- plus discounts and marketing efforts that will persuade more people that you can get around faster underground than above.
Transit executives should have their spending plans to relieve overcrowding and improve the environment for riders locked in long before year's end. As riders and officials know, those who hesitate run the very grave risk that history will repeat itself. In recent years Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki have made deep, unwarranted cuts in state and city aid to the operating and capital sides of mass transit, contending they were only forcing the system to tighten its belt. The Governor's recent remarks, which tilt toward returning the windfall to the system's customers, are encouraging. The Giuliani administration has expressed interest in using the surplus for reducing debt, improving subway and bus service and more experimentation with fare discounts. 
Around the city, there is a spirited debate over the size of the surplus. Transit officials, acting conservatively, put the number on the low side -- at $37.7 million, which they attribute to increased ridership. They are reluctant to toss in all of the $48.1 million expected from dedicated tax streams and the like because it is unclear that they will receive all of it from Albany. Other longtime students of the system see a pot that just might hit $150 million.
Whatever its final size, the recurring share that results from increased rider revenue and dedicated tax funds will give transit officials the wherewithal to add trains and enhance the cleanliness and physical conditions of stations, subways and buses.
With ridership and confidence in the service rising, the Mayor and Governor need to remember that a healthy transit system is good for the economy and the city and state tax base. The system deserves investment, not disinvestment.

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index: Again No Surprises

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Despite the nation's economic strength, consumer prices rose only modestly again in October and helped push inflation during the last 12 months to the lowest level since oil prices collapsed a decade ago.
The benign inflation data for October, reported today by the Labor Department, marked the fourth consecutive month that overall consumer prices rose only two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 When volatile energy and food components are deleted from the Consumer Price Index data, consumer inflation during the last 12 months is at its weakest rate in more than 31 years.
"The Consumer Price Index remains a picture-perfect portrait of stability," said Jarry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Economists continued to marvel at how inflation has remained in check even with a fast-growing economy that has helped drive the unemployment rate down to the lowest level since the Nixon Administration.
Over the last year, consumer inflation shrank to 2.1 percent from 3 percent even as the jobless rate was falling to 4.7 percent from 5.2 percent, challenging traditional assumptions that inflation and unemployment go in opposite directions.
The 2.1 percent rate is the lowest since the 1.1 percent rate in 1986, when an extraordinary drop in oil prices sharply reduced inflation. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy and is a more accurate barometer of long-term price trends, was 2.3 percent over the last year, lowest since 1966.
"Current price performance is unprecedented," Cheryl R. Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, told clients today. "Inflation has never been so low so far into an expansion."
Joseph Liro and Anita Ash, economists at CIBC Oppenheimer, called the latest price figures, which were in line with expectations, "boring but very satisfying."
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail inventories jumped a hefty 1.1 percent in September, suggesting optimism about the holiday shopping season and pointing to an upward revision in national output for the third quarter that was initially estimated at a 3.5 percent annual pace.
Analysts said it appeared the inventory buildup was intentional, rather than caused by sluggish customers, because the $320.2 billion worth of stockpiled merchandise was enough to last just 1.5 months, a bit more than in August but less than in September 1996.
The price report showed consumers paid just one-tenth of 1 percent more for energy last month than in September, after two months in which prices spurted a total of 2 percent. This moderation was partly offset by sizable but presumably temporary gains in the cost of home maintenance, dairy products, hotel rooms, tobacco and airline fares.
Medical care inflation continued to slow, edging up one-tenth of 1 percent last month to bring the 12-month advance to 2.5 percent, barely more than the 2.3 percent advance for all items other than food and energy.
What inflation there was last month was in services, which account for 57 percent of the Consumer Price Index and rose three-tenths of 1 percent. The price of commodities, which account for 43 percent of the index, was unchanged.
While services are up 3 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 1 percent for commodities that are subject to greater international competition, some analysts said they found little reason for concern.
Suzanne Rizzo, an economist at Maria Fiorino Ramirez, a New York investment advisory firm, noted that service inflation had decelerated for much of 1997, to a 2.7 percent rate for the three months through October.
"Rather than goods catching up with services," as many had once projected, she said, "services have been slowing down."
Medical care services, for example, rose at a 2.2 percent annual rate during the latest six months, sharply below the 3.1 percent rate for the six months through April.
For the New York metropolitan area, prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month to bring the 12-month inflation rate to 2.4 percent, compared with 2.1 percent nationwide. Prices rose 2.3 percent in Chicago and 1.4 percent in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Quixotic Quest to Invent A Different Car Engine Fails

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
After four years and $24 million, the brothers Ben and Harold Rosen -- one a successful venture capitalist and the other a celebrated rocket scientist -- are abandoning a quixotic quest to remake the automobile industry.
The brothers said yesterday that they were closing down Rosen Motors, a venture they founded in 1993 to create a car that would run on conventional gasoline but would have virtually none of the pollutants and twice the fuel economy of today's automobiles. 
 Rosen Motors successfully road-tested its first vehicle last January and had since refined its design. But the Rosens decided to call it quits because they were unable to attract a major auto maker that would provide the cash needed to transform the prototype into a commercial vehicle.
"We always said that the marketing challenge would be the most difficult," Ben Rosen said yesterday. "That was our Achilles' heel."
Mr. Rosen said that a few of the 10 car makers he approached were interested in an alliance, but that none was willing to invest in Rosen Motors and commit to using its technology in future cars. "We weren't interested in doing a deal with a company where this would be in research and development forever," he explained.
One reason there was so little interest is that the world's car makers are already spending considerable time and money developing alternatives to today's internal-combustion engine.
Last month, six new such vehicles were announced at the Tokyo automobile show, including a hybrid gasoline and electric car from Toyota that gets 66 miles to the gallon and will go on sale in Japan next month, making it the first mass-produced hybrid-electric vehicle. Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and others are working on designs that use fuel cells, batteries, or simply refine a conventional engine so that it is cleaner and more fuel efficient.
"Is this a big setback for the industry?" said Sheila A. Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a government-supported nonprofit group that promotes the use of clean vehicles. "To be quite blunt, no."
But Rosen Motors, which is based in Woodland Hills, Calif., was certainly one of the most celebrated and daring attempts to dethrone the internal-combustion engine. The idea was born in the early 1990's, when Harold Rosen, 71, who is credited with inventing the geosynchronous communications satellite, retired from the Hughes Aircraft Company and decided to take a stab at reinventing the automobile. He convinced his younger brother, Ben, 64 -- who has helped found several successful technology companies, including Compaq Computer, where he remains chairman -- to bankroll the effort.
The Rosen design uses a small gas turbine engine, much like a miniature jet engine, to create electricity that drives motors attached to the axle of a car. A flywheel that spins as fast as 60,000 revolutions a minute recovers energy as the car brakes, which can then be used to increase the car's acceleration.
Rosen Motors recently fitted the powertrain into a navy blue Mercedes E320 sedan. The goal was to improve the performance until the car could go from zero to 60 miles an hour in six seconds, faster than the acceleration of a Mercedes with an eight-cylinder internal-combustion engine.
The company said it was on track, but Ben Rosen, who has spent $24 million of his own money, decided that it would cost too much to continue development alone. The 70 employees of Rosen Motors will be laid off, though some will be hired by the Capstone Turbine Corporation. The company, based in Tarzana, Calif., makes the gas turbines, which can be used as stationary power generators, and is partly financed by the Rosens.
"We are proud of the fact that we had this dream and we pursued it with our money," Ben Rosen said. "We didn't succeed. That is what is so great about our system: you either succeed or fail on the merits."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Japan Fears Push Bonds Slightly Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices for Treasury securities slipped slightly yesterday, hurt by talk in the market of Japanese selling but buoyed by a Government report showing that consumer prices rose only mildly last month.
The 30-year bond fell 1/32, to a price of 100 26/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent, from 6.06 percent on Monday. 
 Some investors continued to worry that Japanese Government agencies might decide to sell American Treasury securities to finance a plan to bolster banks, after the Government shut down a major commercial bank this week. Others, though, said such selling was unlikely because Japanese agencies hold more lower-yield Japanese Government bonds than they do Treasuries, making a sale of the Japanese securities more likely.
Also weighing on Treasury prices were reports of a billion-dollar sale of five-year notes and a $500 million sale of long bonds by large investors.
But the news that consumer price increases have again stayed in check helped limit the declines.
"Inflation continues to be very subdued, benign and nonthreatening, and thus remains one of the few constants in the economic picture," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.
In October, the Consumer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent, as economists had expected. On a year-to-year basis, the increase in the index stands at a low 2.1 percent.
Mr. Fine said that confidence about continued low inflation had played a key role in pushing bond yields to near-21-month lows. Contributing to the feeling that prices will stay in check has been an expectation that American economic growth will slow, in part because of the recent turmoil in Asian markets.
"However," Mr. Fine said, "what matters going forward is the extent and the timing of the anticipated slowdown, because to say the economy will slacken from its current 4 percent pace is not a particularly heroic assumption."
During the last several quarters, gross domestic product has grown at surprising strong annual rates: 3.5 percent in the third quarter, after 4.2 percent in the second.
Kenneth J. McCarthy of the Economic Intelligence Company, a consulting and forecasting firm, said that low inflation and slower growth would normally be a prescription for higher bond prices. The problem now, he added, is that bond prices have risen so much in recent weeks that it is hard to see how they can go much higher.
"In this environment, current interest rate levels are already too low," he said. "While they may go lower temporarily, we remain convinced that at current levels, interest rates are in a bottom zone and the next major trend will be upward."
Bond yields could also run into some resistance because of looming new supply in the next week or so. Today, the Treasury is to announce the size of next week's auctions of new two-year and five-year notes, while investors brace for this week's supply of corporate debt. Analysts expect about $10 billion of corporate and asset-backed debt to be priced.

HEADLINE: Profit Taking Sends Dow Down to 7,650.82

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday for the first time in four sessions as investors took profits.
Lingering concerns that slowing Asian economies would hurt profits of United States companies also weighed on stocks. Shares of Avon Products Inc. tumbled 8 percent yesterday after the company warned of lower overseas earnings. 
 "No matter how you slice the baloney here, the events that we saw in Asia are on balance negative for earnings," said Rick White, who manages $2.4 billion for Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc. in New York. "It's hard to make a case for the market rocketing north."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.40 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 7,650.82, after rising 4 percent in the last three sessions. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.97 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 938.23. The Nasdaq composite index lost 13.67 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,600.44, after rising 1.9 percent on Monday.
Avon fell 5, to 57 1/2, after the direct marketer of cosmetics said fourth-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' estimates because of lower-than-expected sales in Brazil, China and Japan. The company cited tighter regulatory controls in China and concern among Brazilian consumers about the nation's economy.
Colgate-Palmolive, which also does a lot of business in Brazil, fell 2 5/16, to 63 15/16.
Still, many analysts said any slowdown in Asia and Latin America would not have such dire effects on most American companies. And investors still like the fundamental backdrop in the United States: an expanding economy with falling interest rates and growing profits.
Schlumberger Ltd. and other oilfield service and equipment stocks, some of this year's best-performing issues, tumbled the most yesterday. Schlumberger fell 4 9/16, to 83 5/8; Smith International slid 4 11/16, to 67 7/16, and Cooper Cameron fell 4 1/2, to 65. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index, up 50 percent this year, declined 5.4 percent.
Analysts offered several explanations for the drop, including concern about increased supplies of oil from the Middle East, which would curtail drilling elsewhere.
AT&T, one of the 30 Dow components, rose 3 7/8, to 52 1/2, after Blake Bath, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, reiterated a "buy" rating on the stock, with a 12-month price target of 72 a share.
Mr. Bath said that after meeting with company executives, he was convinced AT&T would make an effort to cut expenses and make a key acquisition.
Hewlett-Packard, another Dow component, fell 5/8, to 61 5/8.
The company said it might close some plants after missing Wall Street's earnings estimates because of higher-than-expected expenses. The computer and printer maker fell short of expectations for a third quarter in a row.

HEADLINE: A Chorus of Silence From China's Few Dissenters

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Inside an ash-gray apartment block, up a stairway made narrow by stacks of winter cabbage, a gray-haired veteran of China's dissident movement held a finger to his lips as he opened the front door, silencing a visitor until the door was safely closed, the shades drawn and tea served.
Seated in a cramped living room, the dissident was eager to discuss the politics of the day, and he traded opinions and gossip with the fervor of a tabloid columnist. But he lamented the way Beijing's tightly constricted political atmosphere made it impossible for him to speak publicly, lest he be sent back to jail. 
 The release of Wei Jingsheng, China's leading dissident, who flew to the United States on Sunday, leaves behind a small band of political partisans who are essentially powerless to voice their concerns, much less organize any significant advocacy. Other dissidents languish in prison, similarly silent.
The gray-haired dissident said that Mr. Wei's departure, while bringing cheer to many sympathizers who are happy to see him free, has not otherwise altered the monotonous political landscape for dissidents here. The Communist Party tolerates no open questioning of its authority these days.
"There is a time to speak out and a time for silence," the dissident said. "Now is still a time for silence."
There is virtually no public debate of real political issues in China today. Political reform, religious freedom, even China's ambitious dam projects: almost every topic of political substance has been banned from serious discussion in public meetings or in the state-run media.
One measure of how tight the political atmosphere is in Beijing can be seen in the fact that there simply aren't many dissidents to check on. Two who openly criticized Government policies in the past said today that it was "not convenient" to meet or discuss the political situation.
It may seem remarkable that a nation as enormous and complex and fast-changing as China would be able to allow so little open discussion of political issues.
Yet a central paradox of China today is that such strict political limitations coincide with a tremendous expansion of personal freedom in recent years. Economic growth has brought an ever-wider array of choices when it comes to a job, a place of residence or a spouse -- all areas where Communist Party authorities once wielded near-absolute control.
"Ordinary people pay less attention to politics today than a few years ago," said the gray-haired dissident. "That's good. It means they can spend their time on other things."
When a change in the political atmosphere may come, he added, is as hard to predict as week-to-week developments in any country. President Jiang Zemin's recent trip to the United States, he said, laid the groundwork for Mr. Wei's release more than for any political relaxation.
Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University, who has written extensively on Chinese dissidents, said Mr. Wei's release could encourage other dissidents to speak out.
"I see this as a -- I can't say a green light -- but as a way for people who have been silent to come forward now," said Ms. Goldman. "It'll be hard for Jiang to crack down now because he wants better relations with the U.S."
Mr. Wei was the best known of China's dissidents because of his eloquent writing and his unwillingness to bend to pressure from the authorities during his long incarceration, which spanned more than 18 years with only a brief respite.
The ranks of Chinese dissidents overseas are splintered and largely unheard in China. Some are refugees from the student-led movement in 1989, like Shen Tong and Chai Ling, who experienced only a few months of political activity within China followed by escape and then years of exile in the United States.
Yet Mr. Wei's case more closely resembles that of Wang Juntao, a longtime political activist who was jailed in China from 1989 until 1994, when he was released shortly before Congress voted on whether to renew most-favored-nation trading status for China. The official reason Mr. Wang was sent to the United States was also medical treatment.
A dilemma faced by Mr. Wang and Mr. Wei is that going overseas robs them of the moral stature that inevitably comes with bearing the hardship of being a political critic within China, whether in jail or not.
It is the same choice that could face Wang Dan, a 28-year-old former student leader who is the best known among China's remaining political prisoners. Mr. Wang said in the past that he would resist going overseas, though his mother has said more recently that he would consider it if it were necessary for medical reasons.
Asked today whether Wang Dan might also be released on medical parole, Shen Guofang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, answered elliptically, "There have been such cases in the past, and there will continue to be such cases in the future."
Human rights activists in the United States, while welcoming Mr. Wei's release, have insisted that it does not really affect the overall human rights situation within China.
"Sending one more dissident into exile does not represent an improvement in China's human rights situation," said Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China. "It is a disgrace that the Chinese Government holds its own citizens hostage to international politics."
A better measure, Mr. Xiao said, can be seen in the countless cases of ordinary people who face irrational or unfair handling by China's security and judicial branches.
One recent case involved a former prosecutor in Anhui Province in central China, who was detained without charge for 46 days after he wrote several open letters to Government leaders asking for the release of other dissidents. The man, Shen Liangqing, 35, has said he planned to sue the local government after it held him from Sept. 1 to Oct. 17 without charging him.

HEADLINE: BANKING'S CONSOLIDATION: THE BIG INVESTOR;
A Rattler of Status Quo With Status in His Veins

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
It seems incongruous that George Strawbridge Jr., a member of an old Main Line family, a historian and the biggest individual shareholder in the Corestates Financial Corporation, has played an instrumental role in the takeover of Philadelphia's last independent banking franchise, ending a tradition that stretches back to colonial days.
Mr. Strawbridge, who is 59, owns more than 5.1 million shares of Core states, a stake worth more than $400 million. If the sale of Corestates to the First Union Corporation goes through as now structured, the value of his holdings will be worth at least an additional $25 million. 
 Mr. Strawbridge, who was closeted in the Corestates board meeting yesterday and could not be reached for comment, has been a force at Core states since the fall of 1995, when Corestates agreed to buy the Meridian Bancorp of Reading, Pa., for $3.2 billion. Mr. Strawbridge, who was a big holder of Meridian shares, was named to the Corestates board shortly after the merger was completed.
But people close to the negotiations say Mr. Strawbridge has increased his influence even more in the last few months and has been pressuring Terrence A. Larsen, Corestates' chairman and chief executive, to sell the bank.
The pressure intensified after negotiations with the Mellon Banking Corporation broke down. Mr. Larsen balked at what would have been an $18 billion deal, in part because it would not have given him a substantive role in the new, combined company.
According to people close to the transaction, after the Mellon deal collapsed, the pressure on Mr. Larsen to sell came from board members like Mr. Strawbridge who were dissatisfied with the approach Mr. Larsen was taking in negotiations to sell Corestates.
Mr. Strawbridge has experience in dealing with recalcitrant bank chairmen, and his relationship with Mr. Larsen has a familial connection.
Mr. Strawbridge was one of a group of board members at Meridian who forced the company's sale to Corestates. Samuel A. McCullough, who at the time was chairman of Meridian, initially objected to the sale, insisting that the bank remain independent.
Mr. Strawbridge, who took two members of Meridian's board with him to Corestates, is a distant cousin of Peter S. Strawbridge, heir to the Strawbridge & Clothier retail chain, which was sold in July 1996 to the May Department Stores Company. Peter Strawbridge is also on the Corestates board.
But a much closer relative, G. Morris Dorrance, was the chairman of Corestates before Mr. Larsen succeeded him in 1988. Indeed, Mr. Dorrance was instrumental in elevating Mr. Larsen, a former economist, to the top job. Mr. Dorrance retired long before George Strawbridge became a big owner of Corestates stock or a director.
Mr. Strawbridge's connection to the Dorrance family, heirs to the Campbell Soup fortune, comes from his mother, the late Margaret Dorrance Strawbridge.
His father, George Strawbridge Sr., was long a force in Philadelphia financial circles: until he died on April 3, 1990, at the age of 80, the elder Mr. Strawbridge was a senior vice president and director at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., the Philadelphia-based stockbrokerage firm.
Initially, George Strawbridge Jr. used his Campbell's inheritance to buy big tracts of Brandywine Valley horse country and develop a racing stable, Augustin Stables. An avid steeplechase rider, he is a former president of the National Steeplechase and Hunt Association.
What's more, Mr. Strawbridge is an academician. After receiving his bachelor's degree at Trinity College in Hartford, he earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, where he specialized in Latin American history and politics. Currently, he is an adjunct professor at Widener University in Chester, Pa.
Mr. Strawbridge began investing in banks in the Philadelphia area in the 1970's, when he bought out the William duPont family's stake in the Delaware Trust Company, a sleepy bank in Wilmington, for an estimated $10 million. The value of his holdings has risen substantially since, as Delaware Trust was first sold to Meridian and Meridian was sold to Corestates and as Corestates is now being sold to First Union.
As of late yesterday, it was not known for certain whether Mr. Strawbridge would be named to the board of First Union. It is also not clear what relationship, if any, he has with First Union's chairman and chief executive, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. But if the past is any guide, investors might find it instructive see how their relationship develops.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Earnings Near Expectations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Several big retailers -- Home Depot Inc., the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation and Limited Inc. -- reported fiscal third-quarter operating earnings yesterday that were in line with or above analysts' expectations.
Analysts said the results showed that consumers were in the mood to spend as the holiday shopping season approached, amid low unemployment and rising incomes. 
 As consumer incomes and confidence have risen, so have the number of people willing to invest in buy or remodel a house, analysts said, benefiting retailers like Home Depot.
Home Depot's operating profits rose to $299 million, or 40 cents a share, above the 39-cents-a-share estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by First Call. Without the special charge, Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, earned $236 million, or 32 cents a share, up from $221 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier.
At Dayton Hudson, higher sales at the Target discount chain lifted operating profits above analysts' estimates. Net income at the Minneapolis-based retailer rose to $160 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $107 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.
Ann Taylor said that net income fell to $2.2 million, or 8 cents a share, from $3.3 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. But it still managed to drum up enough sales to better Wall Street estimates of per-share earnings of 6 cents, based on 13 analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International.
Limited's earnings -- $42 million, or 15 cents a share -- matched the average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S.

HEADLINE: THE TEAMSTERS: LOOKING FORWARD;
Delay of Election Is Sought To Allow for Hoffa Inquiry

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
A day after a court official barred the teamsters' president, Ron Carey, from running for re-election next March, another court-appointed monitor said yesterday that she would seek a postponement of the election to allow more time to investigate the campaign finances of Mr. Carey's rival, James P. Hoffa.
Mr. Carey's supporters applauded the move because it raised the possibility that Mr. Hoffa might also be disqualified. A postponement would also give the Carey forces more time to settle on a candidate strong enough to replace Mr. Carey. 
 "We are asking for as full an investigation of Hoffa as they did of Carey," said Kenneth Paff, national organizer of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a Carey faction. "We believe that a full investigation might uncover that employer money or mob money had been funneled into the Hoffa election campaign."
But none in the Carey camp suggested that their leader would somehow be reinstated, although Mr. Carey, who is 61, has announced that he will appeal Monday's ruling by the court official, Kenneth Conboy. Instead, they suggested that a new leader would probably emerge from among various Carey allies, without speculating on who that might be.
The election overseer, Benetta M. Mansfield, was appointed by the Federal courts to supervise the teamsters election. She reports to Judge David Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has overall supervision of the teamsters and must ultimately decide whether to delay the election, and for how long.
Ms. Mansfield said she sought the delay because Mr. Conboy, in barring Mr. Carey from re-election, had also said there was enough evidence to justify an investigation of Mr. Hoffa.
Ms. Mansfield and Mr. Conboy serve as court-appointed officials under a 1989 consent decree the union accepted to settle a Federal racketeering suit.
The stakes in the election are enormous, not only for the teamsters but also for the American labor movement. Mr. Carey, as teamsters president, played a big role in installing John J. Sweeney in 1995 as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and his downfall could hurt Mr. Sweeney. Under Mr. Sweeney's leadership, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has channeled tens of millions of dollars into expanding union membership and supporting pro-labor political issues and political candidates.
Mr. Hoffa's aides criticized the request for an election delay. "We think it's an effort where they won't hold an election unless they can fix it," Richard Leebove, a spokesman for Mr. Hoffa, said of the Carey camp. "What they are going to do is go after us."
Some Federal officials said the coming battle over leadership of the teamsters' union could hurt the union movement just as it was regaining some public support. In particular, they cited the union's success in rallying support during a strike last summer of 180,000 teamsters against the United Parcel Service. The union had called for less part-time work and higher pay for part-timers.
"After the U.P.S. strike, the teamsters certainly were identified as a symbol of the union movement's ability to represent an important new class of workers: part-time workers," said Edward Montgomery, chief economist at the Labor Department. "The concern now is that all of the scandal associated with the election financing will erode public support."
The teamsters, with 1.4 million members, have expanded far beyond truck drivers, their original constituents. They represent Northwest's flight attendants, for example, salt-mine workers near Cleveland, 25,000 New York City public employees, performers at Disney World and thousands of office and health care workers.
Until a new president is chosen, Mr. Carey will continue to lead the union. And his effectiveness -- or the effectiveness of the union itself -- will get its first test in negotiations just getting under way for a new contract for 100,000 long-haul truck drivers. One issue -- whether drivers should continue a current practice of being called in to drive although they might not have gotten sufficient rest -- is the sort of safety issue that Mr. Carey would have used in a public relations campaign to get public support for the teamsters, said Michael Belzer, a transportation expert at the University of Michigan.
Mr. Carey, who became president of the teamsters in 1991 on a platform of rooting out corruption, narrowly won re-election last December against Mr. Hoffa, the son and namesake of the powerful teamsters president who disappeared in 1975.
But a court-appointed official threw out the results in August, and on Monday, Mr. Conboy ruled that Mr. Carey had illegally diverted $700,000 in union funds to his election campaign, and for that reason could not be a candidate in the new balloting, scheduled for February and March of next year.
That seemed to leave the field open to Mr. Hoffa, who is far better known among the teamsters members than the two or three others considered potential candidates. But Mr. Conboy also said on Monday that the Hoffa camp might have "systematically misreported" its campaign contributions. He called for a further investigation. And in anticipation, Ms. Mansfield said yesterday that she would petition the court for a suspension of the balloting.
Ms. Mansfield also postponed the mailing of the December issue of the union magazine The Teamster. She said it would be misleading to distribute the "notice of election included in the magazine."

HEADLINE: At Ancient Site Along the Nile, Modern Horror

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: LUXOR, Egypt, Nov. 18

 BODY:
In the Middle Court of the Temple of Hatsepshut today, piles of newly strewn sand could not disguise the plain fact that a structure dating from before 1400 B.C. had become a late 20th century slaughterhouse.
Blood spattered the ancient colonnades, and sandstone pillars were marked by bullet holes and bits of flesh. These traces of evidence, together with accounts by survivors, began to provide a gruesome picture of the Monday-morning massacre in which Islamic militants fell upon two groups of tourists admiring the magnificent pillars and carved reliefs memorializing a queen who wore a false beard to rule as a Pharaoh. 
 Firing automatic weapons in a prolonged fusillade, the attackers left 58 foreign tourists dead.
"They shot everyone in the arms and legs," a surviving Swiss tourist, Rosemarie Dousse, told the Swiss national radio. "Then they killed everyone who was still alive with a shot to the head."
"They took all the young women, the girls, and disappeared with them," Ms. Dousse said. "I don't know where they went with the women but they hurt them. We could hear screams of pain." There was no official confirmation that young women had been singled out in this way, however.
The militants were also said to have been armed with knives, and there were reports by credible witnesses that they had seen bodies of several foreigners in which an ear or a nose was missing. These accounts, too, were not officially confirmed.
Today, as some tourists began to leave Egypt in fear, others ventured to the temple here despite the chilling accounts. Those interviews and other details that have emerged in the last two days indicate that the slaughter was more vicious than was previously known, and that the militants seemed intent on making even more tourists their victims.
The Egyptian authorities said today that the final death toll was 58 foreigners, rather than 60 as reported on Monday, in addition to four Egyptians and six attackers. According to their governments, the dead included at least 35 Swiss, 9 Japanese, 6 Britons, including a child, and 4 Germans. Others killed in the attack included a Bulgarian, a Colombian and a French citizen, the Egyptian authorities said.
By many of the accounts that emerged today, the attackers took advantage of a modest police presence and killed their victims in two clusters inside the grounds of the ancient temple.
A statement issued in the name of Egypt's most prominent Islamic militant group said the massacre had begun as an effort to take hostages in order to secure the release of a leader imprisoned in New York for his role in the World Trade Center bombing. But the accounts by survivors gave no hint of any attempts to take tourists alive.
In an apparent acknowledgement of shortcomings, the Egyptian official responsible for internal security, Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi, was reported this evening to have resigned. President Hosni Mubarak, who visited the scene of the attack, told reporters that Egypt would now "take much more tougher measures" to protect foreign visitors.
But within 24 hours of the attack, some tour operators had suspended vacation tours in Egypt. Seven charter aircraft left London today for Luxor to fly tourists home, in some cases weeks ahead of schedule.
In the face of that reaction, the Egyptian Government hurried to reopen the temple to the public. This morning, guides were pointing out to visitors famous images including a relief in the Punt Colonnade that celebrates a trading expedition to Punt, on the Somali coast, that brought back to Egypt valuable wares, including incense and myrrh.
The tourists had arrived at Hatshepsut's Temple on Monday morning to climb a steep ramp leading to the Middle Court and a pair of colonnaded terraces at the rear that were the temple's archeological gems.
It was there, witnesses said, that as many as 50 of the victims died, because the cramped terraces offered no route of escape in the face of the assault by six men armed with knives and automatic weapons.
The attack began just before 8:45 A.M., when six men dressed in plain black clothing and carrying vinyl bags entered the temple through its main gate, ignoring guards' request to produce their tickets. "This is the ticket," the last of the men finally replied as he produced an automatic weapon and opened fire, killing a police guard.
Ahmed Ghassam, 40, another guard, described the exchange. He too was shot, but in an interview from his hospital bed, he said he had survived because the body of the other guard had fallen on top of his.
A 45-minute rampage inside the temple followed. People who had access to the site before the dead were removed said that the main concentrations of bodies had been near the Birth Colonnade and the Punt Colonnade, and that between 20 and 25 people, most if not all of them foreigners, had been killed at each site.
Today, bullet holes had been patched and some blood stains scrubbed away, but debris including a piece from broken eyeglasses and a stray earring near a patch of blood remained. And deep inside the colonnades, the amount of blood and tissue sprayed high upon some walls appeared at least in part to substantiate the accounts of witnesses who say that some of the victims were hunted down and slain.
While the assailants relied mostly on automatic weapons, some accounts said they also used knives to kill and to mutilate several bodies.
Mr. Ghassam was among several witnesses who said he had seen the raiders slit the throats of some victims. Ahmed Youssef Aly, a Luxor-based journalist, said that during a visit to a morgue on Monday night he had seen several mutilated bodies, including that of a Japanese woman missing an ear and a Swiss man whose nose was missing.
Even as they fled the scene at about 9:30 A.M., the assailants may have intended to renew their attack elsewhere.
After running from the temple grounds, the attackers hijacked an Isis Tours bus and its driver, Hagag al-Nahas, 36. They fled again on foot after a gun battle near a police checkpoint left one militant dead. The remaining five were killed near the Valley of the Queens some time after 11 A.M. in the last of many firefights that raged as policemen and civilians pursued them into the rugged hills.
Mr. Nahas, who was badly beaten with a rifle butt during the hijacking, said, "They were trying to go to another place to shoot more people, and I refused."
The Islamic Group, Egypt's largest Islamic militant organization, took responsibility for the attack, saying that it had intended to take hostage as many foreign tourists as possible, and that it had hoped to force the release of its spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, from an American jail.
But Egyptian officials and other experts said the methodical nature of the killings did not appear to be consistent with an attempt to take hostages. In attacking tourists, the militants have made plain that their goal is to undermine a sector vital to the Egyptian economy, and the experts said they may be trying to frighten foreign governments, tour operators and potential tourists.
The dead included four Japanese couples on honeymoon, and George Wigham, 68, and his wife Ivy, 71, a retired couple from Kent, England.
"They just liked the idea of going down the Nile," their son Paul said today in a telephone interview. "It was their dream. I tried to persuade them not to go, but my father said he could get killed just as easily at home. It was the trip of a lifetime for them."
Many tourists remained in Luxor today, however, and most of those who were interviewed said they saw no reason to change their plans. Several hundred, including many Americans, even visited the Temple of Hatshepsut.
"Lightning never strikes twice in the same place," Mike Grubbs, 33, of Lamont, Colo., explained.
For others, however, a heavy pall had been cast by notices posted by tour operators in several hotel lobbies this morning. They included an announcement from the British-based Thomson Tours that the company was suspending its tours in Egypt "in accordance with advice received" from several authorities, including the British Foreign Office.
At one hotel, tourists who had been given less than two hours notice of their departure were boarding buses for the Luxor airport and a flight home to Manchester, England. "I think it's the right thing to do," said Sasha Ainbow, who until Monday night had expected to stay on in Egypt for another week.
"It's like the I.R.A., isn't it?" Mrs. Ainbow said, referring to the Irish Republican Army. "An explosion goes off and you never know if there will be just one or many, many more."

HEADLINE: Illegal Iraqi Oil Shipments Increase, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Senior officials of the United States Navy and State Department told a Security Council sanctions committee today that Iraq's illegal exports of oil through the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf have jumped 500 percent in the last year.
These exports, primarily of diesel fuel, are carried in ships that stay within the territorial waters of Iraq and Iran, out of the reach of an international naval force patrolling the gulf to enforce a United Nations embargo on Iraq. 
 The international force, comprising ships from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United States, is coordinated by Vice Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, commander of the United States Fifth Fleet.
American officials said that the briefing occurred coincidentally during the crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq. But some diplomats expressed concern at the timing of the charges of increased smuggling.
The United States has used the sanctions committee in the past to maximize pressure on Baghdad at critical moments. The committee meets behind closed doors.
The American officials, who declined to be identified, said that the Iraqis, apparently working in close cooperation with Iranian officials, had developed an efficient export-import operation in the sea corridor hugging the coast of Iran to the border with Pakistan and beyond. Diesel fuel is shipped out in a steady stream of vessels, the officials said. Iraqis earn cash from the sales or buy imports prohibited by sanctions.
There has been illegal trade in the Persian Gulf since sanctions were first applied to Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But that trade, always small in scale, has suddenly mushroomed, American officials said. They estimate that Iraq sold about $10 million in diesel fuel in 1996 and $75 million this year.
Some of the fuel has been traced to Bombay, where the Iraqis would be able to purchase any number of useful but prohibited items, including electronic equipment and chemicals. India and Iraq were trading partners before the 1991 war in the gulf.
Since the border trade is out of the reach of interception ships, whose activities are limited to international waters, officials do not know much about Iraqi imports beyond the cargoes that have been seized when ships strayed onto the high seas.

HEADLINE: In Afghan Refugee Camp, Albright Hammers Taliban

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: NASIR BAGH, Pakistan, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Speaking to Afghan refugees here, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today issued her harshest criticism of the Taliban movement that rules most of Afghanistan, calling its treatment of women and children "despicable."
At the desolate mud-brick camp for 80,000 Afghan refugees, 25 miles from the Afghan border, Ms. Albright spoke proudly of her own experience as a wartime refugee who rose to become the first woman to serve as Secretary of State. She urged the young Afghan women and students, listening attentively in their flowing head scarves and long trousers, to take charge of their lives, demand education for themselves and seek equality in their society. 
 "It is impossible to modernize a nation if half or more of the population is left behind," Ms. Albright said at the Bibi Mariam school for girls at the camp, which is helped by American aid provided through the International Rescue Committee. "If a society is to move forward, women and girls must have access to schools, be able to participate in the economy and be protected from physical exploitation and abuse."
The Taliban, which began as a movement of fundamentalist Islamic religious students in Afghanistan's villages, took over Kabul, the Afghan capital, in September 1996, but has been unable to seize the northern part of the country. Although American officials welcomed the initial stability in Kabul, they were appalled by the abuses of human rights by the Taliban, and the State Department's tone has grown increasingly condemnatory.
Pakistan has recognized the Taliban, and the country's security services provide important help to the movement. Asked by a Pakistani journalist in Islamabad this morning why Washington would not recognize the Taliban, Ms. Albright said bluntly: "It's very clear why we're opposed to Taliban. We're opposed to their approach to human rights, to their despicable treatment of women and children and their lack of respect for human dignity, in a way more reminiscent of the past than the future."
Asked if Ms. Albright's comments embarrassed Pakistan, a senior minister, emphasizing that he was speaking unofficially, said that "it is no great problem in Pakistan, but what we don't know is what the reaction will be over there," pointing to the mountains beyond which Afghanistan lies.
But both Pakistan and the United States support a United Nations mediation effort to try to form a coalition government that might last and bring the Afghan civil war to an end. Of the three million Afghan refugees who entered Pakistan from 1979 onward, about half returned after the fall of the Communist Government, American officials said.
But 100,000 more refugees have come since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, and the bulk of the women Ms. Albright spoke to today had fled Kabul. Some expressed resentment that the United States did not back those opposed to the Taliban before their victory.
At the camp, Ms. Albright and two of her top aides, both of them women, met privately with a group of women to ask them about their lives. Given cultural and religious restrictions, only female reporters were allowed into the room to listen, but they provided a description and tape of the meeting to their male colleagues.
"We've had a hard time getting our jobs," Ms. Albright said to the 25 or so women and girls in a small mud-brick classroom, "but not as hard a time as you."
Ms. Albright said that "American women have been very concerned about Afghan women."
"We have read about you," she said. "And I especially wanted to come to meet with you and hear your stories."
"I find that women have the same stories," Ms. Albright continued. "It is very hard for me to sit here and compare myself to you, and I have been very lucky, as have my friends. But I know we are all the same, and we have the same feelings -- we all suffer when we hurt and we all suffer for each other."
"I have found that when women are given a chance to work and raise children, they can be so brilliant," she said. "Yet so many women are destined to suffer, and we should do all we can to help them."
Dressed conservatively in a long brown jacket and trousers, Ms. Albright concluded by telling the women: "I hope I can come visit you again -- but come to a Afghanistan where you can live as full equals. We really are all sisters."
The last working visit of a Secretary of State to Pakistan was by George P. Shultz in 1983, although Mr. Shultz also went in 1988 to the funeral of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
In conversations with Pakistani officials, Ms. Albright discussed nuclear and missile proliferation and other security questions, Afghanistan and Kashmir, which Ms. Albright said she hoped would be settled in her lifetime.
She also discussed the 38 F-16's that Pakistan bought from the United States but never received, an issue Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khana called "a matter of critical importance to our people."
The Pakistanis paid for the planes, which were built. But before delivery, President Bush told Congress he could not certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear weapon. Under the so-called Pressler Amendment, intended to discourage nuclear proliferation, the planes could not be delivered. But the United States has been unable to sell them elsewhere and return the proceeds to Pakistan. A deal to sell them to Indonesia was blocked late last year by Congress, which criticized that cpountry's human-rights record.
Ms. Albright also urged the Pakistanis to find those responsible for the killing of four American oil workers and their Pakistani driver last week in Karachi. The murders made her insistent on going ahead with her visit to Pakistan despite other pressing business surrounding Iraq, her aides said.
But her long-planned visit here was shortened by her diplomatic shuttling around to deal with the Iraq crisis, and her trip to India will be shortened as well. A visit to Bangladesh was canceled altogether. From India, she may fly back to Western Europe to meet on Iraq with other foreign ministers, but officials said that no firm plans had been made.

Untouchable Huang

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Has John Huang, the Lippo banker and Clinton fund-raiser at the vortex of the campaign finance scandal, been notified that he is a target of a Federal investigation?
No. How about "subject of an investigation"? No. Has Huang been called as a witness? No. 
 In 12 months has the F.B.I., or anybody at Main Justice, interrogated John Huang? No. Grand jury? Forget it. Huang is not in hiding; has anybody at Justice even tried to ask him anything? Again, no.
How can this be? You might think that Huang has asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself, as he did to duck Congress. But he has not taken the Fifth with Justice. His testimony has not even been sought.
Because he is under no pressure from Justice to talk, Huang has not sought immunity from prosecution by proffering evidence about higher-ups. As Janet Reno's Public Integrity section dawdles, Huang lets the statutes of limitation run.
Reno's excuse for not seeking independent counsel -- that no "hard money" was being raised in Clinton-Gore White House phone calls -- was shattered by The Washington Post, which ran evidence of diversion unknown to Justice's legion of lazy lawyers. She put on a charade of "shaking up" her inept staff.
Some shake-up. Reno soon gave her fall guy, Laura Ingersoll, a special departmental commendation for "focusing the investigation on potential campaign financing violations of high officials." Ingersoll and her boss (Mark Richard, feted last week for 30 years of bureaucratic service) earned the plaudits of Reno Justice by doing about John Huang what the White House wanted done: nothing.
Did the latest patsy prosecutor, Charles La Bella, zero in on John Huang? White House videotapes long withheld from Congress, and never even sought by Reno Justice, showed Huang in action with Bill Clinton. On one clip, the Indonesian gardener solicited by Huang to channel an illegal $450,000 to the Clinton campaign popped out with the connection to Huang's old employer: "James Riady sent me." Justice shrugged.
Because The Post's Bob Woodward and NBC's Tim Russert enticed Reno into asking publicly for an interview with Clinton, La Bella had a chance to ask him about the Sept. 13, 1995, Oval Office meeting in which the President and Riady switched Huang from Commerce favor-doer to Democratic fund-raiser.
Was the President asked about this Huang meeting, or about Lippo-Riady-Huang connections to China? Clinton permitted no oath or transcript. I hear the investigators choked, confining their questions to narrow issues, not abuses of power.
Last week, with Senate hearings safely closed down, our conflicted Attorney General was humiliated by her own inept troops again, forced to reveal to the senators a long-lost F.B.I. file reporting that Huang, while working with a top-secret clearance at Commerce, gave a classified document to Chinese officials.
Leaks from Justice pooh-pooh the possibility of economic espionage. But some officials allow as how Maria Hsia, the Huang colleague who set up the unlawful Buddhist temple fund-raiser, is cited in F.B.I. files as being too tight with Beijing.
Is Justice following the lead generated at the Senate hearings about Huang's use of the faxes and phones at the Stephens Inc. "drop" across the street from his Commerce office? Huang's friends say it was for his philanthropic activities. Reno Justice wants to believe that.
About the only investigation showing an interest in Huang is Larry Klayman's Judicial Watch, a private group that started a Freedom of Information suit to find out who sold slots on Commerce's trade missions to Asia. Huang cannot plead the Fifth to this civil suit; his sole public appearance since the scandal broke was the videotape of his deposition.
Klayman (who is also suing to discover the culprits in Filegate, long sleeping in Ken Starr's arms) deposed Janice Stewart, Huang's secretary during the stint Riady arranged for him at Commerce. She swore that Huang often ordered her to shred overseas cables. Freeh's Bungling Institute shows no interest because it has trouble accessing what is already in its files.
Who will get the man at the center to sing? Not this crowd; to Reno Justice, Huang is untouchable.

Bombing Trial Begins in Berlin
The trial of five people charged with the 1986 bombing of a Berlin night club, in which two American soldiers and a Turk were killed, began in Berlin. Sixteen scarred and maimed victims of the bombing sat in the courtroom with the five alleged perpetrators of the attack. German prosecutors said the two Palestinians, a Libyan and two Germans on trial had acted on orders from Libyan intelligence. A5
 
Dissident Was Too Ill to Stay
Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known political prisoner until his release three days ago, had to make a painful decision to leave China but he had little choice, his sister said. She said he had shingles and other health problems that made the option of remaining in China as a martyr all but impossible. Mr. Wei, who spent nearly 18 years in Chinese prisons after publicly advocating democracy, is now in a hospital in Detroit. A3

Still stymied in their investigation of three Atlanta bombings in the last 16 months, law-enforcement officials released details about the bombs' components, hoping to shake the memory of a sales clerk or someone who knows the bomber. A18
 
Gun 'Education' Criticized
The National Rifle Association, faced with a slump in gun sales and negative publicity, is trying to cultivate a new generation of gun owners by using the same strategies to hook children on guns that the tobacco industry has used to hook them on cigarettes, according to a study by an anti-gun group. The N.R.A. disputed the findings, saying its educational programs promote safety. A24
 
U.S. to Claim Tobacco Money
The Clinton Administration has told states that the Federal Government will take at least half of any money they recover through lawsuits against tobacco companies for the costs of providing health care to smokers under Medicaid. Administration officials reason that the Federal Government contributes at least half of every Medicaid dollar spent by the states, so it should get at least half of every dollar recovered from the tobacco companies for the costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses of Medicaid recipients.

U.S. Plotted Castro Sabotage
The Pentagon offered President Kennedy an extraordinary variety of dirty tricks designed to sabotage Fidel Castro, newly declassified documents show. These plans included sophomoric pranks, such as faking a picture of a fat and debauched Castro to destroy his image, and murderous plots. A25

HEADLINE: IRAQ AND RUSSIANS DRAFT A PROPOSAL TO END GULF CRISIS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Russia and Iraq have drafted a proposal to end the standoff between the United States and Saddam Hussein, Russia's Foreign Minister said this evening.
Yevgeny M. Primakov, the Foreign Minister, said the plan would allow the United Nations to carry out weapons inspections, presumably with Americans taking part. But he said the inspectors' open-ended search for chemical, nuclear and biological weapons should be brought to a speedy conclusion. 
 Mr. Primakov did not spell out details, but he outlined how Iraq might achieve its long-sought goal of ending the crippling economic sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The discussions opened with the blessing of the United States, which hoped Mr. Primakov could find a face-saving way for President Hussein to back down. But the Russian proposal raised serious questions even in its bare outlines, as it seemed to call for a softening of American policy on Iraq.
Clinton Administration officials in Washington said tonight that they did not know enough about the proposal to react to it, although Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke by telephone with Mr. Primakov today.
The United States proceeded with a slow military buildup in the Persian Gulf area, including the dispatch of six F-117A "stealth" fighters and six B-52 bombers to beef up American striking power. President Clinton has also authorized the deployment of about 30 additional fighters and bombers if American military commanders conclude that they are needed.
The Pentagon said an American U-2 reconnaissance plane flew over Iraq today without incident. But the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said Iraq was moving around its air defenses in the southern part of the country in a way that could be threatening.
"We think he is interested in much more than diplomacy," Mr. Bacon said of President Hussein.
Pentagon officials said the Iraqi military appeared to be setting up its surface-to-air missile batteries to "trap" allied aircraft patrolling the no-flight zones in the country's north and south, a tactic the Iraqis have used before.
For six years, the United States has insisted that the terms under which President George Bush stopped the Persian Gulf war in 1991 are not negotiable. It has never been willing to set deadlines for completing the inspections or to put any restrictions on the demands made by the United Nations.
The United Nations has insisted that the sanctions remain in effect until the inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its missiles and its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs. Mr. Hussein must also meet other demands including returning of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and paying reparations to Kuwait for the 1990 invasion.
The weapons inspectors have attributed the slow pace of their work to an elaborate effort by Baghdad to conceal its armaments and destroy weapons. The head of the United Nations team said Baghdad had stepped up those efforts in the days since the inspectors were expelled.
Mr. Primakov made his televised announcement after President Boris N. Yeltsin met with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq. Mr. Primakov boasted that he had found the diplomatic solution that had eluded the United States, France, Britain and the United Nations.
He made a similar assertion shortly before the start of the gulf war, but the allies against Iraq swiftly rejected his ideas.
Tonight, Mr. Primakov said, "As a result of these talks, a specific program has been worked out which, we believe, allows us to avoid military confrontation and the use of military methods, and to move toward resolving the crisis."
Mr. Primakov engaged in intensive diplomacy before the gulf war, as Moscow sought to dissuade Washington from its offensive to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait. As a special envoy, he shuttled from Moscow to Washington to Baghdad. Mr. Primakov even traveled to the Iraqi capital in a camouflaged car during American bombing raids.
The Bush Administration viewed Mr. Primakov's diplomacy as a transparent effort to help the Mr. Hussein's Government preserve its military might and hold on to power.
But this time the situation is different. The Clinton Administration is not eager to use force, nor are its allies in Western Europe and the Middle East. The goal is not to evict an occupying Iraqi Army from Kuwait, but to persuade Baghdad to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to work unfettered.
Nor does Iraq seem determined to fight. Its goal now is not to annex a neighboring country, but to bring a quick end to the inspections, create divisions between the United States and its allies and force an end to economic sanctions.
American officials remain suspicious of Russian intentions, but this time they appear willing to let Moscow play the role of mediator if it can deliver Iraqi concessions.
Mr. Primakov said he wanted to meet in Geneva on Wednesday with Ms. Albright, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France to go over the details.
Secretary Albright dropped plans for a side trip in India but has no immediate plans to fly to Geneva, a spokesman said. Not only would the logistics be difficult, but American officials seem wary of putting themselves in a position in which pressure would be put on them to go along with a plan that remains somewhat vague.
A senior Administration official said the proposal appeared not to be in final form. He said it was possible that Russia was attempting a last-minute intervention that could interfere with American policy. "Is there a possibility of that?" the official said. "Absolutely. But I'm not too concerned about it, because the answer will just be no."
Another official said the fact that the Russians might not have finished their negotiations with the Iraqis could explain why they had not disclosed any details.
Mr. Primakov has talked of accelerating the work of the United Nations Special Commission established to insure that Iraq has ended its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction and has destroyed existing weapons.
That might be something the United States could discuss if the United Nations inspectors were allowed to resume their work unconditionally. But if Iraq insists that the United Nations agree to expedite its work before the inspectors are allowed back in the country, Washington will almost certainly reject the plan.
There are other potential sticking points. The United States does not want to guarantee an immediate end to the sanctions, even if the Special Commission determines that Iraq's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction have been ended.
American officials say they need to see a pattern of compliance in other areas as well before agreeing to any lifting of the sanctions.
Russia, in contrast, is eager to see the sanctions removed as quickly as possible, as is France.
Economics is a big reason. Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars. The debts were accumulated during Iraq's war with Iran during the 1980's, when the Soviet Union was a major arms supplier. Iraq can only afford to repay these debts if sanctions are lifted and it begins exporting more of its oil.
Further, Russian oil companies are anxious to pursue lucrative deals to develop new Iraqi oil fields after the sanctions are removed. And Russian weapons manufacturers would like to conclude new arms deals.
Politically, the burst of diplomacy provides Russia with an opportunity to assume a central role on the world stage and maintain influence in the Middle East. That is important for a country that is still uneasy about its loss of superpower status.

HEADLINE: De Kooning's Abstract Women Bring Millions at an Art Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Sparks flew for only a few brief intervals at Christie's auction of contemporary art last night. But what the evening may have lacked in fireworks, it made up in strength and sensibility.
The sale totaled $24.8 million, close to the middle of its estimate of $21.5 million to $28.8 million. Of the 72 lots offered, 62 found buyers. 
 Throughout the evening, buyers were enthusiastic yet cautious. They knew what things were worth, and few were willing to pay more than they had to.
"It was very sober, but the estimates were right on target," said Neal Meltzer, who heads Christie's contemporary-art department.
One of the evening's most closely watched artists was Willem de Kooning. Since his death in March at 92, there has been much speculation about how much art is left in his estate and what will come on the market. Two exceptional early works sold last night had nothing to do with the artist's estate; yet they became the evening's top sellers.
His "Two Standing Women," the sale's most expensive painting, was being sold by two Detroit collectors, Irwin Green, a retired auto parts manufacturer, and his wife, Bethea. Painted in 1949, the abstract image of two sexy women standing side by side was expected to sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million. Several bidders wanted the painting, sold for $4.1 million to Robert Mnuchin, the retired Goldman Sachs partner who is now the chairman of C & M Arts, a gallery on the Upper East Side. The Greens bought the painting at Sotheby's for $45,000 in May 1970, when the seller was the Norton Simon Foundation of Los Angeles. "It was an exceptional painting," Mr. Mnuchin said after the sale.
He also tried to buy a slightly later work from de Kooning's "Women" series, "Woman (Blue Eyes)," from 1953, one of 16 images of women the artist painted from 1953 to 1955. It was being sold last night by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo to raise money for acquisitions. But Mr. Mnuchin was outbid by a tenacious, unidentified telephone buyer who was willing to pay $2 million, far above the painting's $1.2 million high estimate. Mr. Mnuchin finally looked at Christopher Burge, Christie's chairman in America and the evening's auctioneer, and shouted, "I surrender."
Tonight Sotheby's is auctioning a later de Kooning, "Untitled XIII" (1977), which it hopes will sell for $800,000 to $1 million.
(Final prices include the auction house's commission: 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
One of the strengths of last night's sale was that Christie's was fortunate to obtain works, from estates or collectors, that had not been on the market and therefore were among the most desirable.
"Two Standing Women" was one of an estimated $9 million worth of artworks the Greens were selling last night because they are retiring to Florida, Christie's said. Over 25 years, they collected the work of Abstract Expressionist and color field painters. Among the best works auctioned was Rothko's "Untitled" (1961), one of the artist's signature abstract paintings in brilliant reds, estimated at $2 million to $2.5 million. Mr. Mnuchin bought this one, too, paying $1.8 million, just under its $2 million low estimate.
Also in the Greens' collection was Hans Hofmann's "Paling Moon," painted a year before the artist's death in 1965. This brightly colored work was estimated at $600,000 to $800,000, and two telephone bidders wanted it, but only at the right price. It finally sold to an unidentified bidder for $717,500.
Morris Louis's "Floral" (1959), a series of brightly overlapping pours of paint, also sold within its estimate. An unidentified bidder bought it for $772,500, just below its $800,000 high estimate.
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert H. Kinney, Washington art patrons, were selling Kline's "Diamond" (1960), one of the artist's signature abstract paintings in greens, blues and purples. Estimated at $1.2 million to $1.8 million, it sold to an unidentified American collector for $1.1 million.
When works were of the right date, in good condition and rarely available, bidders were willing to pay the price. Warhol's "Self-Portrait," a set of four canvases from 1978, was one of the evening's more popular objects. It sold to a telephone bidder for $1 million, far above its $800,000 high estimate. Only two of this image exist; the other is in the Menil Collection in Houston.
Early Calders sold extremely well too. "White Discs," a 1955 hanging mobile, had many eager buyers and finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $794,500, nearly twice its $400,000 high estimate. Even older was Calder's "Aspen," a standing mobile from 1948. Four people wanted it, and the mobile finally sold to a telephone bidder for $651,500, also above its high estimate of $400,000.
While the artist's work has been virtually recession-proof, its popularity last night may have been due not only to the rarity of these pieces at auction, but also to the fact that Calder is considered a hot artist right now. A major Calder retrospective is to open in March at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
Many of the last night's buyers were dealers; some were bidding for themselves, some for stock. Frits de Knegt, a SoHo dealer, was a big buyer, snapping up works by artists like Cy Twombly and Frank Stella. In fact, Mr. de Knegt bought all three Stellas in the sale. The best was six canvases from the Benjamin Moore Series, painted in 1961, which brought $277,500, above its low estimate of $200,000.
"We've got to give the market a kick start," Mr. de Knegt said after the sale. "It's a good time to start buying again."

HEADLINE: David Ignatow Is Dead at 83; Poet Wrote of Ordinary Life

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
David Ignatow, whose clear, direct, seemingly effortless verse won him one of poetry's highest honors, the Bollingen Prize, in 1977, died on Monday at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 83.
He had been suffering from congestive heart failure, said a friend, Virginia Terris. 
 "An ordinary man is a message to the world," Mr. Ignatow once wrote. The words defined the essence of his poetry, his subject matter of ordinary life and his emphasis on meaning rather than the artifice of language.
One of his best-known poems, "Get the Gasworks," written during the 1940's, contained these lines:
Get the gasworks in a poem
and you've got the smoke and smokestacks,
the mottled red and yellow tenements,
and grimy kids who curse with the pungency
of the odor of gas. You've got America, boy.
Mr. Ignatow was the author and editor of 27 books, including "I Have a Name" (1996) and "Shadowing the Ground" (1991). He published short stories and a memoir, "The One in the Many" (1988), and edited collections of the work of William Carlos Williams and Walt Whitman. The critic Ralph J. Mills once wrote that Mr. Ignatow followed "in the tradition of those genuine poets who have, in independent ways, struggled to create a living American poetry from the immediacies of existence in this country, from the tragedies and potentialities of its legacy, and from the abundant music and vitality of its language."
Mr. Ignatow's chief influences were Williams, Hart Crane and especially Whitman. His work ran against the dominant strain of his generation of poets: James Merrill, Richard Wilbur, John Hollander, and John Ashbery. For many of them, Mr. Ignatow once said in an interview in The Paris Review, "language takes precedence over content." But he had learned from Williams, to guard against "a romantic view of life," he said. "Against elevated language. Against trying to make a leap into something which didn't exist."
Robert Bly, in his afterword to Mr. Ignatow's "Selected Poems," which he edited in 1975, said: "We are more used to poets open to personal unconscious. If the dark side is thought of as part of the personal unconscious, we notice that David Ignatow sees his dark side clearly only after he he has seen it reflected in the angers and frustrations of the collective."
Calling him "a poet of the community, of people who work for a living, as Whitman was," Mr. Bly said Mr. Ignatow "is also a great poet of the collective."
He was born David Ignatowsky in Brooklyn on Feb. 7, 1914, and graduated from New Utrecht High School. His father, Max, an immigrant from Russia, had learned the bookbinding trade as an apprentice in a Russian monastery, and he brought his skills with him to the new country. Max Ignatowsky pressed his son to work in the family bookbinding business, but the aspiring writer resisted until the Depression cornered him into taking the job. Later, when David was accepted in the W.P.A. Newspaper Project as a reporter, Max Ignatowsky, proud of his son's achievement, financed "Poems," Mr. Ignatow's first book, which was published in 1948.
The book won immediate, influential praise from Williams, who wrote in The New York Times Book Review: "These are poems for the millions." He went on to praise their "tragic force, economy of language and plastic sense governing the words." Mr. Ignatow, he said, was "a first-rate poet."
Still, Mr. Ignatow struggled for years to support himself and his family while continuing to write. He took jobs that he hoped would give him time for poetry, toiling as a night clerk in a vegetable market, as a paper salesman, as a weekend messenger for Western Union and as an admitting clerk at St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn. Later, as his reputation grew, he was able to obtain teaching positions at Vassar College, Columbia University and York College of the City University, where he was a poet in residence.
Mr. Ignatow's early work concentrated on the evils of business and having to earn a living. He once defined money and getting it as "the central issue of our time." But in many ways, he was at his best when he wrote of the intimacies of everyday life, in poems about his family and about love.
In one of his recent poems, "My Love for You," he wrote:
My love for you is a dark hall
through which I tap my way
along the walls for an exit
to an orchard under which
I may sit and speak.
In 1937 Mr. Ignatow married Rose Graubart, a painter and writer, and he adopted her son, who was also named David. Later, the boy had a mental breakdown and was institutionalized. Mr. Ignatow wrote of him in a poem called "In Limbo":
I have a child in limbo,
I must bring him back.
My experience grows
but there is no wisdom
without a child in the house.
The son died in 1985. The couple also had a daughter, Yaedi.
For many years, Mr. Ignatow lived separately from his wife. After she died, also in 1985, Mr. Ignatow wrote of her: "I will lie down beside her in death/ because it is no longer possible/in life./ And within me I feel a tenderness for what is kept, and what cannot be kept."
From 1962 to 1963, he was poetry editor of The Nation, and he served as president of the Poetry Society of America. In addition to the Bollingen, he received an award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the Robert Frost Medal of the Poetry Society of America and the Wallace Stevens fellowship at Yale.
Mr. Ignatow is survived by his daughter, a writer, of Manhattan and East Hampton. "We're not going to die," Mr. Ignatow once wrote when his daughter was a child and had asked him a question about death:
We'll find a way.
We'll breathe deeply
and eat carefully.
We'll think always on life.
There'll be no fading for you or for me.
In another poem, "Two Friends," from the collection "Against the Evidence, Selected Poems 1934-1994," he again approached the subject of death:
I have something to tell you.
I'm listening.
I'm dying.
I'm sorry to hear.
I'm growing old.
It's terrible.
It is, I thought you should know.
 Of course and I'm sorry. Keep in touch.
 I will and you too.
And let us know what's new.
Certainly, though it can't be much.
And stay well.
And you too.
And go slow.
And you too.

HEADLINE: Gazli Journal;
Free of the Russians, but Imprisoned in Cotton

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: GAZLI, Uzbekistan

 BODY:
The classic description of Uzbek geography as two-thirds desert and one-third cotton fields is something of an exaggeration, but it does seem that wherever there is arable land here, there is cotton.
Countless Uzbek families have been cultivating "white gold" for generations. Brigades of students are trucked into the fields every year at harvest time. Cotton motifs decorate everything from road signs to teacups. 
 In a field outside Gazli, a town in central Uzbekistan, Shamor Karamova spends her autumn days hunched over the blossoming plants, picking puffy white bolls and tossing them into a long burlap sack slung over her shoulder. She began doing this work when she was 15 and now, 25 years later, she can imagine no other way of life.
"We live from cotton, and Uzbekistan lives from our work," she said during a short break from her labor.
Ms. Karamova earns the equivalent of two cents for each pound of cotton she picks, which gives her a monthly income of about $135. Her family works a small tract of land that it bought from the Government three years ago, but in practice she is still part of a state-run system.
"We get our seeds, our fertilizer and everything else we need from the Government," she said. "After we pick the cotton, we sell it to the Government. How could it be any other way?"
Cotton is big in Uzbekistan, and without it the Uzbek state is all but unimaginable. Farmers sell their produce to the Government at a fixed price, and the state then sells it on the world market for about three times that price. The profit is this land's main source of income, as it has been for more than a century.
Soon after Russian armies began conquering central Asia in the mid-19th century, civil war broke out in the United States, disrupting the supply of cotton from Southern states to Europe. The czars, quick to recognize a market, ordered that Uzbekistan and surrounding regions be turned into vast cotton plantations.
Several of the strains they introduced came directly from America. One, from Mississippi, still bears the evocative name "delta."
Soviet leaders extended and intensified the czars' plan, raising Uzbekistan's output from 200,000 tons in 1924 to a reported 9 million tons in 1980.
Two-thirds of the Soviet Union's cotton came from Uzbekistan, but there was not a single textile factory here. Soviet planners feared that if such factories were built they would drain labor from the fields. Raw cotton was sent to other parts of the Soviet Union for processing, and many Uzbek cotton pickers never owned a single garment made from the fiber they harvested.
Today Uzbekistan exports five million tons of cotton each year, making it the world's fifth-largest producer.
During the period of Soviet rule here, so much water from Uzbekistan's principal river, the Amu Darya, was siphoned into cotton irrigation canals that none was left to flow into the Aral Sea. As a result the sea has been shrinking at an alarming rate, and scientists fear it may dry up altogether within 25 years.
"There is a saying in Uzbekistan that cotton is white, but it works black," said Akhmadjon Meliboyev, a journalist who has written extensively about cotton and the problems it has brought to Uzbekistan. "That means it has had a terrible effect on our people."
"Cotton fields extend right up to the walls of houses, kindergartens and schools, so pesticides sprayed on the fields have also been sprayed on people," Mr. Meliboyev said. "Land that was used to grow cotton was land we couldn't use to grow food. Total reliance on this one crop has prevented us from developing a balanced economy, and since everything is built for cotton production, we are finding it very difficult to change."
Because cotton has so completely dominated this region for so long, it was perhaps inevitable that it play a key role in the biggest political scandal in modern Uzbek history.
In the 1970's, Uzbek officials devised an elaborate fraud in which they managed to bill the central Government in Moscow for the costs of producing large amounts of cotton which in fact did not exist. Hundreds of people were involved, diverting funds estimated at up to $2 billion. The scam thrived until the mid-1980's, when aides to the Soviet leader Yuri V. Andropov realized from satellite photographs that land supposedly producing cotton was in fact lying fallow.
Discovery of the fraud led to a series of arrests and several suicides. Dozens of officials, including a son-in-law of the former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, were sentenced to jail terms.
Sharaf Rashidov, the Uzbek leader during whose 24-year rule the fraud was perpetrated, died in 1983 and so avoided punishment. Reviled in death as a corrupt thief by the Soviets, he is now widely viewed here as a clever Uzbek who managed to outwit the supposedly more sophisticated Russians. A statue of him now stands in Tashkent, the capital, and a main avenue there has been named for him.
Since Uzbekistan became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, foreign companies have been looking for new ways to use Uzbek cotton. One of them, partly owned by American investors, is building a factory where it plans to manufacture cotton automobiles.
The company has bought a license from the company that used to manufacture the Trabant, the cheap East German car whose body was made of plastic. In the Uzbek version, the body will be made of cotton wastes.
When a prototype was unveiled last year, a company official, Vyacheslav Shin, jumped on its roof to prove its strength to skeptical onlookers.
"Admittedly it's not ultramodern," Mr. Shin said, "but it's cheap and simple. People in Uzbekistan and nearby countries are very interested."

HEADLINE: In America;
The Game Is Rigged

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in the United States dropped to 4.7 percent in October, the lowest it has been in 24 years. Inflation has, for all practical purposes, vanished. Alan Greenspan continues his mad hunt for the dragon of wage inflation, threatening always to kill it, but he can't find it.
Meanwhile, all those economists who argued for years that a drop in unemployment below the "natural" rate of 6 or 6.5 percent would inevitably lead to accelerating rates of inflation are now furiously grinding out reams of learned papers (explanations and rationalizations) that ought to be published under the collective title "Never Mind." 
 That's the good news. The not-so-good news is contained in a report released last week by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. The report found that despite the low overall jobless rate, persistently high unemployment continues to plague low-wage workers. Some groups -- including young African-American women -- are experiencing disastrous levels of unemployment.
Jared Bernstein, a labor economist and author of the institute's report, noted that the continuing job squeeze at the low-wage level has ominous implications for the so-called welfare-to-work initiatives that so many politicians, starting with President Clinton, are pushing with such vigor.
The report says: "If workers with a similar labor market profile to welfare recipients are already facing difficulty finding work, our expectations regarding the success of welfare to work might be somewhat tempered. As one example, note that while overall unemployment has averaged 5.2 percent over the past year, unemployment among young African-American women ages 15 to 25 with a high school diploma was 19.7 percent."
Fifty percent of the women who have been on welfare for an extended period of time do not even have high school diplomas. To throw them and their children off welfare while pretending that their job prospects are anything but bleak is irresponsible, cruel and potentially tragic.
Women make up 58.2 percent of the low-wage sector. And not surprisingly, in the fierce competition for jobs in that sector, individuals who are young, black and non-college-educated fare the worst.
The report touches on a point that is fully understood by economists and politicians but not widely known by the general public -- that it is national policy to restrain growth and keep unemployment artificially high. "Fearing inflation, the Federal Reserve Board has used monetary policy to keep unemployment rates unnecessarily high," the report says, "thus dampening potential wage growth among those who benefit most from tight labor markets: low-wage earners."
The interests of the monied classes will trump the interests of the lower classes every time. Alan Greenspan's purpose in life is to protect the assets of the very wealthy. The value of those assets erodes with every uptick in the rate of inflation. Never mind that a modest increase in inflation may be the result of a growing economy that is providing jobs and higher real wages for millions of additional Americans. Let unemployment slip a little further, or wages climb just a little higher, and watch how quickly Mr. Greenspan, the powerful chairman of the Federal Reserve, raises interest rates to slow the economy and halt that modest improvement in the quality of life for ordinary working Americans. Watch how eagerly he slams the door on the employment opportunities of those men and women, especially the poor and the young, who are looking for work.
The game is rigged against those at the bottom, and hardly anyone talks honestly about it. Last Monday President Clinton urged businesses to provide jobs to more welfare recipients. And he noted that since last spring some 2,500 companies, responding to the nonprofit Welfare to Work Partnership, had pledged to do so.
"This has to be an American crusade," said Mr. Clinton.
But The Times's James Bennet, in an article on Tuesday, reported that the companies had "only agreed to hire at least one welfare recipient." Citing government statistics, Mr. Bennet wrote that "more than 10.2 million people remain on welfare."
Some crusade.
The welfare recipient, all good intentions, gets up in the morning and goes off in search of an entry-level job, not knowing and in her eagerness not suspecting that the game is rigged at the very highest levels of the national Government.

HEADLINE: Up to 3,000 Jobs May Be at Stake in Latest First Union Deal

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The First Union Corporation and the Corestates Financial Corporation disclosed further details yesterday about their pending $17.1 billion merger, but still declined to quantify the number of layoffs the deal would entail.
In a conference call with reporters, Terrence A. Larsen, the chairman and chief executive of Corestates, estimated a net loss of no more than 3,000 jobs, but offered little guidance beyond that. Mr. Larsen said that the huge merger "requires disruption in people's lives." Corestates, based in Philadelphia, has about 11,000 employees. 
 "It is very much an in-market transaction for us; they're a heck of a corporate bank, and they were available," First Union's chairman and chief executive, Edward E. Crutchfield, said yesterday in an interview. "This whole consolidation picture is clearly going to continue and we needed to participate in that to get low unit costs and economies of scale."
First Union said yesterday that it expected to take a $795 million after-tax charge against earnings in the second quarter of 1998 to cover severance costs, relocation expenses, a fixed-asset write-off and other merger-related charges.
First Union told analysts yesterday that it would need to cut about 45 percent of Corestates' 1997 expense base by the end of 1999 to make the expensive transaction profitable within the next 18 months.
"It's an aggressive number, but keep in mind that there's a lot of overlap between Corestates and First Union, and First Union has a great track record of delivering on cost and revenue synergies," said Sandra Flannigan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company.
First Union said that it set a target of reducing the Signet Banking Corporation's expenses by 50 percent when it announced that acquisition four months ago and that it had already reduced expenses by about 55 percent.
Even so, First Union faces a daunting challenge in meeting its goals and the task is sure to fall heavily on Corestates workers. Of the $1.13 billion in pretax cost savings required during the next two years, First Union said about 25 percent, or $287 million, would involve staff cuts.
The bulk of the cuts, about $578 million, or 51 percent, will come through the shuttering of bank branches and other units. First Union, based in Charlotte, N.C., said that 55 percent of Corestates' branches were within two miles of First Union branches. The remaining reductions will come from automation and operations.
"They will have to get it exactly right," said Lawrence Vitale, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. Mr. Vitale said that because Corestates' back-office systems were so antiquated, integrating them with those of First Union "may produce risk First Union is not used to dealing with."
First Union also anticipates revenue enhancements of about $200 million as part of the transaction, a figure that concerned some analysts because projecting sales growth resulting from a merger is not an exact science.
"The revenue enhancements are a little difficult," said Nancy Bush, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "That always gives me pause."
First Union said it would divest itself of $800 million to $900 million in deposits, mostly in the Philadelphia area.
Addressing the thorny issue of how important the guarantee of a job for Mr. Larsen was in completing a merger with Corestates, Mr. Crutchfield said that "it was not a factor" and speculation arose because of bad information circulated by self-interested parties. Mr. Larsen declined to comment on the matter.
In trading yesterday, shares of First Union fell 75 cents, to $49.50, and Corestates' shares fell 93.75 cents, to $78.0625.

HEADLINE: Spending Ted Turner's Money: State Dept. Aide Gets U.N. Job

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Ted Turner, who has promised to give $1 billion to the United Nations over the next decade, today named the man who will allocate the money, the largest donation ever made to the organization. He is Timothy E. Wirth, a former Senator from Colorado who is now the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Mr. Wirth, who is involved in environmental and population issues, is to leave the State Department at the end of December to become president of what will be called the United Nations Foundation. United Nations officials are meeting today and Thursday with representatives of Mr. Turner to discuss areas in which the new foundation will work. 
 The impending departure of Mr. Wirth from the Administration clouds an international conference on Dec. 1 in Kyoto, Japan, on a treaty to fight global warming. As the top State Department official dealing with environmental issues, he was the lead negotiator in those talks.
People in environmental organizations who have worked with Mr. Wirth said today that he appeared to be unhappy with the Administration's policy, which did not meet the hopes of Europeans and others that the United States would move faster to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
"He is passionate on these issues, said Jonathan Lash, executive director of the World Resources Institute in Washington. "He was often Horatius at the bridge."
In an interview, Mr. Wirth, 57, brushed aside differences with the Administration and said he accepted Mr. Turner's offer because he could not resist "an incredible opportunity" to help shape a new generation of foundations and concentrate on global issues in an international setting.
He said he would be part fund-raiser, increasing the seed money of Mr. Turner's grant of stock and cash; part networker, drawing on the growing number and strength of private organizations around the world, and part public advocate for the United Nations as it focuses increasingly on 21st century themes.
"People care a great deal about these new issues, the new global issues, post-cold-war issues," he said, mentioning immigration and population growth, the environment, terrorism, narcotics, international crime and the world economy.
"These are the new issues," he said. "We have these new issues and in a way you have old bottles. You have systems set up at the State Department and elsewhere that were designed for a cold-war era."
Joseph E. Connor, Under Secretary General of the United Nations for Administration and Management, said today that the United Nations had presented the Turner group with 10 areas in which the new foundation could concentrate its efforts, from poverty to education and help for refugees.
The United Nations has named Angela Kane, a German who has been in charge of the organization's library and electronic informations, as its representative at the trust fund.
Directors of United Nations programs will have to compete for the Turner money, which will be spent at the rate of about $25 million a quarter. Grants are expected to begin in early 1998.
Mr. Wirth said today that he considered Mr. Turner "a man of enormous vision and genius" with whom he has shared a number of important interests over the years. While in the Senate, Mr. Wirth supported -- among other things -- the loosening of broadcasting monopolies held by large commercial networks, which was a boon to Mr. Turner's Cable News Network.
Both men also share an interest in bringing economic forces into solving environmental problems, Mr. Wirth said. "I have known Ted Turner for 20 years," he said, "and have always admired the way in which he fought in a very mold-breaking fashion."
Mr. Turner said in a statement today: "Tim Wirth shares my vision for the future, in which the public and private sectors work side by side to improve global quality of life and rebuild the spirit of and support for the United Nations."
Mr. Wirth, who was born in New Mexico, grew up in Colorado and graduated from Harvard and Stanford, where he received a Ph.D. in education, said Americans are much more interested in global issues and world affairs than politicians think.

HEADLINE: Asian Nations Affirm I.M.F. As Primary Provider of Aid

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: MANILA, Nov. 19

 BODY:
After two days of discussion among a dozen of Asia's deputy finance ministers and their counterparts from the United States and Canada, a broad agreement was reached today that would open up Asian economies to greater scrutiny by their neighbors and international financial institutions while strengthening the ability of the International Monetary Fund to respond swiftly to a crisis.
At the same time, the officials -- strongly encouraged by the United States -- jettisoned an proposal by Japan to create an Asian-only fund, replacing it with a more vague commitment to financing that would, if necessary, supplement I.M.F. assistance. 
 "The United States is very pleased with the outcome of this meeting," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.
Many details of the new forum as well as the size of a regional financial stability fund were left ambiguous. But the I.M.F. made it clear that it remained the principal global institution that would be called on to resolve financial crises.
"The first line of financing will be provided by the I.M.F.," said Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director of the fund, "and the second-line financing will be provided by Asian countries."
Since July, economies in Southeast Asia have been shaken to their roots by a cascade of currency crises. Beginning with Thailand, and then spreading swiftly to Malaysia and Indonesia, and to a lesser extent the Philippines, the implosion of local currencies -- most losing more than 40 percent of their value against the dollar -- has been followed by the collapse of banks under the weight of huge numbers of bad loans.
"The ongoing economic turbulence in Southeast Asia poses a major challenge to all of us," Roberto F. de Ocampo, the Philippines' Finance Secretary, told the officials gathered here. "It is in the interest not only of economies in Southeast Asia but of the whole world that we address the issues that have emerged from this currency crisis not only to solve it and regain investor confidence in the region but also to prevent a crisis like this one from recurring."
Under the measures supported today -- and which are expected to be ratified by heads of state at a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Vancouver, British Columbia, this weekend -- a regional forum made up of the 14 countries and territories will be created, endorsing four broad measures:
*The systematic exchange of economic and financial information among the region's nations and a push toward more disclosure of government economic decision-making.
*Greater economic and technical cooperation among Asian nations to strengthen financial regulatory and banking systems.
*Encouraging the I.M.F. to respond more swiftly to growing problems and to devise a way to provide rapid, short-term financing to governments in emergency situations.
*The creation of a distinct, regional source of financing to supplement I.M.F. support.
Since September, American officials have sought a plan to satisfy the desire of Asian nations for a distinct entity and set of policies for regional crises while not undermining the fiscal discipline the I.M.F. seeks in exchange for financial support.
From the outset, American officials have criticized a Japanese effort to create a fund independent of the I.M.F., arguing that without the fund's supervision, Asian governments would lack incentive to embark on the structural reforms needed to fix their economies.
"I think there was a recognition from the beginning of the importance to strengthen the international community's capacity to respond to these crises," Mr. Summers said after the agreement was announced.
"Today's problems," he continued, "have more to do with a lack of confidence in capital markets than with trade imbalances. The I.M.F. needs a 21st-century response to 21st-century crises."
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister for international affairs in the Ministry of Finance, sought to put the best face on the group's rejection of the Japanese proposal. "The feeling that the new problem can't be addressed by the traditional I.M.F. has been shared by all, including the I.M.F.," he said.
In general, I.M.F. support is intended to assist countries with current account and trade deficits, which most economists feel play only secondary roles in the current economic crisis gripping Asia.
"There is a need to address the need for supplemental finance," Mr. Summers said. "You need to have a capacity to provide financing to restore confidence. The approach we have laid out here offers the prospect of enhancing capital flows to the region that are not only strong but sustainable."

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Were High In October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Construction of housing in the United States rose in October to the highest level in eight months, confounding expectations of a slowdown.
A large increase in construction of apartments, town houses and other multifamily complexes accounted for the increase reported today by the Commerce Department. It also revised upward the September gain in housing starts to 8 percent. "We're still optimistic that in this very steady economy the home-building world will perform very well," said Stuart Miller, president of the Miami-based Lennar Corporation, a leading residential home builder. "There's nothing that looks like a bump on the road." 
 Housing starts rose 1.4 percent last month to an annual rate of 1.528 million, the highest since February, the Commerce Department figures showed. Many analysts had been expecting a decline of 2.1 percent.
The October gain partly reflected a drop in mortgage rates last month to the year's lowest level, as well as consumer expectations that the American economy would continue growing, analysts said.
For the first 10 months of the year, housing starts totaled 1.256 million, about 1 percent below where they were at this time in 1996. But if the building pace of the last two months does not falter, this year's starts could match or exceed the 1.477 million reached last year.
"There's a pretty good chance we'll beat the 1996 number," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for HSBC Markets Inc. "There's no reason to believe today's strong number was a fluke."
Construction of single-family homes fell 3.8 percent in October, today's report showed, while construction of multifamily buildings surged 20.6 percent during the month. Still, the decline in single-family house construction is likely to reverse, as permits for that category have been rising.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Gets Evidence Of Illicit Iraqi Arms Buildup

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The head of the United Nations team disarming Iraq went to the Security Council today armed with photographs, documents and a team of experts to demonstrate that Baghdad continues to pose a threat in almost every area of weapons development and cannot hope to be free of sanctions if it does not cooperate with inspectors.
The presentation by the official, Richard Butler, executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, appeared to be intended to harden the resolve of the Council as foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France and Russia met in Geneva to consider a diplomatic way out of the crisis. 
 No arms inspections have taken place in Iraq since Oct. 29, when Baghdad first threatened to expel Americans on the monitoring teams, a threat finally carried out on Nov. 13. Mr. Butler pulled all other inspectors out the next day.
The experts who briefed the Council today summarized where the investigation into Iraq's biological, chemical and missile programs stood at this point. They also explained in some detail how the Iraqis had run a bedeviling system of concealment and evasion that make any pledges of compliance difficult to accept at face value.
The experts repeated some of their testimony at a news conference this evening.
Using photographs made by an American U-2 aircraft, Charles Duelfer, Mr. Butler's deputy, showed that a convoy of trucks had been seen entering and leaving a factory near the Baghdad airport after inspectors had indicated that it was a site they wished to visit.
Since last year, Mr. Duelfer said, the inspectors asked to see eight sites where they suspected that material had been moved or hidden after the Iraqis were notified that a visit was planned.
Mr. Duelfer said the inspectors had been delayed at or denied entry to 83 percent of what Iraq had declared to be "sensitive" sites usually associated with one of those agencies.
"No one doubts Iraq's right to defend itself," Mr. Butler said at the news conference. But he added that such obstructions would only prolong the embargo that had crippled the Iraqi economy, an embargo that could not be lifted until all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were eliminated.
"We can't get to the end of that task unless Iraq lets us in," he said.
Mr. Butler added that he would say to the Iraqis that "all the world community is trying to have you back as a member." Virtually all nations are subject to monitoring, he said, but few have the kind of weapons Iraq insists on making.
As an example of how Iraq has changed its accounting, Horst Reeps, a German chemical weapons expert, said that in 1995, Iraq admitted to having made 160 kilograms of VX nerve agent. VX enters the body through the skin, cutting off nerve transmissions, and eventually causing victims to stop breathing. Then Iraq altered its figures, first to admit making 240 kilograms of VX, then 1,250 kilograms. By June 1996 the Iraqis acknowledged producing at least 3.9 tons.
Similarly, said Richard Spertzel, an American expert, the Iraqis denied making botulism toxins until 1995, when they admitted having produced 19,000 liters. Baghdad said it had made 600 liters of anthrax, but later admitted to 6,000 liters and finally 8,400.
While Council members made an effort today to put a united face on their resolve to have President Hussein back down and allow inspection teams to return on the commission's terms, with no stipulations as to nationality, there still are differences not far below the surface here.
In comments to reporters during a break in a daylong session, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative on the Council, continued to put the emphasis on speeding up the disarmament process. He said all diplomatic efforts, including those of Russia, were aimed at allowing the Special Commission to "resume unconditionally and in full" its activities in Iraq.
But he added that inspections needed to be accelerated so that Security Council conditions could be met and sanctions lifted.
Sir John Weston, Britain's representative, said that if inspections had not been carried out as expeditiously as some would have liked, that was not the fault of the commission.
"The primary reason for that is lack of cooperation from the Government of Iraq," he said. "Of course there is room for speeding them up. If we had had cooperation all along, we wouldn't be asking ourselves these questions six and a half years after the event."
Bill Richardson, the United States representative, told reporters that in important areas, the commission, known as Unscom, "is not in a position to say that it has all the information it needs."
The Security Council also heard a report from a nuclear expert representing the International Atomic Energy Agency, which conducts separate monitoring programs in Iraq. Again, the Council was told that there were still questions left unanswered about a potential nuclear arms program.
"All of the speakers were in agreement about several things," Mr. Richardson said. "First, that Iraq has concealed the truth and that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction continue to pose a grave threat. Unscom and the I.A.E.A. continue to need to be able to conduct intrusive inspections and maintain their long-term monitoring capability to be able some day to be sure that Iraq no longer poses the threat it is trying so hard to retain."
Russia, France and China have pressed the Council for a quicker accounting, and thereby a lifting of sanctions, because they have commercial interests in Iraq.
Mr. Lavrov, the Russian representative, defended these economic interests but added that this argued only for a swifter, more efficient disarmament process, not a premature end to sanctions.
He acknowledged after the briefing that the prognosis did not look very good. "As we suspected, the effects are not very encouraging," he said of the break in inspections. "We have to resume monitoring as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: Big-Name Stocks Push Dow Up 73.92 Points

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Broad stock market indexes closed mostly higher yesterday, as investors seemingly turned to a round of safe-haven buying after a day of profit taking on Tuesday.
In a lackluster session, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.92 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 7,724.74. Those gains helped the Dow to surpass for the first time the 7,715.41 level it held on Oct. 24, before its record 554-point plunge on Oct. 27. 
 A handful of stocks -- J. P. Morgan, Coca-Cola, American Express, Walt Disney, Merck and Procter & Gamble -- accounted for about three-quarters of the Dow's gains. Analysts said investors were favoring these stocks because their sales would be expected to hold up relatively well even as the economy slowed.
The shift toward these stocks signals a more defensive posture among investors, said Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York.
J. P. Morgan and other bank stocks also benefited from declining interest rates and recent merger news, analysts said.
The Dow's gains came despite weakness in overseas markets like Japan, whose benchmark Nikkei 225-stock index fell 5.29 percent.
While stocks seemed to ignore the turmoil in Asian markets, the sharp drop in Tokyo pushed United States Treasury bond prices higher yesterday. The price of the 30-year Treasury rose a half-point, to 101 10/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.03 percent, from 6.07 percent on Tuesday -- a 21-month low.
The Dow's strong showing came as Standard & Poor's broader 500-stock index inched up 6.36 points, to 944.59. The Nasdaq composite index eked out only a 78-hundredths of a point gain, closing at 1,601.22. Meanwhile, the Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks slipped 1.44 points, to 430.69.
The limited breadth of yesterday's rally left some analysts perplexed and others worried about the sustainability of the price increases.
"I'm really kind of speechless about the strength in the market," Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities, said of the Dow's rise. "I think it's too quick a move" back above the Oct. 24 level.
And because problems with Asian economies and those of other world markets have not been resolved, the Dow's gains may not hold, she said.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, said, "I wish I could say happy days are here again, but I think you have to look a little bit more closely." Mr. Johnson pointed to the limited gains in the S.& P. 500 and the technology-laden Nasdaq and the downturn in some other market indexes like the S.& P. 400 mid-cap index. "These kinds of technical indicators say there's a great deal more caution than there was on the last trip" above 7,715, he said.
The lingering worries over Asian markets gave the Treasury market a lift as investors sought a safe haven. A report on import prices that showed inflation remains benign also helped bonds. The Labor Department reported that prices the businesses paid for imported goods rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October. Even with the gain, import prices fell 3.8 percent in the last 12 months.
Another Government report showing an unexpected 1.4 percent rise in starts of housing last month failed to drag bonds lower.
"It's the quietest rally I've seen in a while," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla. "The market on the whole over the last week has been ignoring the macroeconomic numbers and focusing on international events."
The Treasury announced yesterday the size of next week's note auctions. On Monday, in addition to the regular weekly bill auction, the Government is selling $15 billion of two-year notes and $11 billion of five-year notes on Tuesday. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year was being offered at a price to yield 5.66 percent and the five-year, at a price to yield 5.75 percent.
In the stock market, several technology shares were among the most actively traded issues.
Intel rose 5/16, to 79 1/16, and Microsoft gained 1 1/16, to 135 1/16. But Compaq fell 1 point, to 65. Dell lost 1 3/4 to close at 83 3/8.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Trusted Budget Director Is Leaving for a Top Job at the University of Chicago

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Patricia A. Woodworth, the sharp-edged architect of Gov. George E. Pataki's efforts to end New York's tradition of big government, announced today that she was resigning her position as budget director to become vice president of the University of Chicago.
Ms. Woodworth's resignation will take effect in late January, depriving the Republican administration of its most ardent fiscal conservative on the eve of budget negotiations between Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders. Several legislators wryly noted that the departure of the hard-bargaining budget director could pave the way for an on-time budget accord, something that has not happened for 13 consecutive years. 
 With Ms. Woodworth acting as his guide through the thickets of New York's $66 billion spending plan, Mr. Pataki has pushed tax cuts through the Legislature each year he has been in office. He has also reduced the state payroll by several thousand positions and held increases in spending from state taxes to below the inflation rate. For the last two years, the state has ended its fiscal year with sizable surpluses, and is expected to do the same in 1998.
But to the dismay of even her biggest fans, Ms. Woodworth was not entirely able to prevent the use of some of the fiscal practices that have resulted in New York having one of the lowest bond ratings in the country. Those policies, long enshrined in New York State budgets, have included enacting long-term tax cuts without cutting spending to pay for them and using nonrecurring funds to finance recurring costs.
"In the end, it's unfortunate, but, I think fair to say that the outcomes weren't as close to her proposals as she would have hoped," said Cynthia B. Green, vice president for the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit budget watchdog group.
In a statement, Mr. Pataki praised Ms. Woodworth, 42, who was among his closest advisers, as "an outstanding budget director" who played "a critical role in restoring New York State as a national leader in tax cuts and fiscal responsibility."
Several Republicans outside the administration said today that the candidates to replace Ms. Woodworth included Donna Arduin and David Richter, two of her deputies; Abraham Lachman, the chief budget adviser to the Republican Senate conference, and Thomas Murphy, the chairman of the State Dormitory Authority.
But Mr. Pataki's aides said there was no short list for replacements, and they left the door open to appointing a temporary director first.
Although Ms. Woodworth's behind-the-scenes battles with both Democratic negotiators and other members of Mr. Pataki's inner circle are Albany legend, she insisted today that such scuffles had nothing to do with her departure. In an interview, she said she had always intended to stay for only two years, and was lured away by a "fantastic offer" from a university she admired.
Ms. Woodworth's full title will be vice president and chief financial officer, which will make her one of the most powerful people at the university. Although state officials said her salary would be roughly triple her current one, which is $105,805, she and university officials declined to say how much she will be paid. "I don't have to report that publicly anymore," she said.
With a reputation for a tough negotiating style and cutting wit, Ms. Woodworth was the lightening rod for both Democratic and Republican criticism of the administration's budget policies. Today, Democrats in the State Legislature responded with open glee at the news of Ms. Woodworth's departure.
"It's great news for the public sector," said Assemblyman James E. Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat.
But conservatives and bond analysts generally praised Ms. Woodworth's tenure. "She was a strong budget director, a strong voice for balanced budget and fiscal prudence and restraint, for spending only the resources that they had, for building reserves and planning for rainy days," said Robert Kurtter, senior vice president for Moody's Investors Service.
In 1995, Mr. Pataki hired Ms. Woodworth from Michigan, where she had helped Gov. John Engler close a large budget deficit and end welfare programs. In New York, her first task was to balance a budget that was projected to be $5 billion out of balance. She succeeded, but only after repeated battles with Michael Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's counsel, and Democratic budget negotiators. She threatened to quit that year, but Mr. Pataki talked her into staying.
For the next two years, the state ended its fiscal year with large surpluses, which supporters attributed to her tight-fisted policies but which detractors said resulted from her underestimating state revenues, which have risen sharply with the booming stock market. She said she expects the state to end the current fiscal year on March 31 with a surplus of more than $500 million.
Asked if she had any major disappointments, she demurred. "I think we've made great strides," she said. "The change in the fiscal management under this governor is miraculous in comparison to the previous one."

HEADLINE: The Asian Virus Spreads

 BODY:
Until now the financial chaos buffeting Thailand, Hong Kong and other small Asian economies has posed little threat outside the region. But this week the contagion hit South Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy. Korea's misfortune has already shaken Japan and other countries.
Unlike Mexico's recent troubles, Asia's crisis reflects problems in the private sector more than reckless monetary and fiscal policies. Less government spending and tighter monetary policy are not the answer. The pressing need in South Korea and its neighbors is to stabilize their banks, with the help of the International Monetary Fund, thereby quieting the fears of investors and depositors, whose panicky withdrawals could endanger institutions essential to commerce. 
 Surprisingly, the hard-hit Asian economies also include others of the region's best performers, like Hong Kong and Singapore. But even they have weak points, which financial contagion exploits. In South Korea, companies raise money primarily by borrowing heavily rather than selling stock. The loans come from domestic banks whose lending decisions are based more on government pressure and personal relationships than on dispassionate business calculations. The strategy worked well in the 1970's and 80's, but has now been taken to excess. South Korea's banks carry a crippling burden of bad loans, scaring depositors and driving foreign investors to withdraw their money.
South Korea needs to stabilize its banks, pumping in whatever reserves are necessary to reassure depositors that their savings are safe. Yesterday it took some timid, disappointing steps toward this goal. It might also need to let its currency, which has already contracted by more than 20 percent, drop further to keep its exports and economy afloat. That will require forbearance in the United States, which will see its exports to the region fall and imports rise. But the Federal Reserve Bank can offset the impact of diminished exports by easing monetary policy.
The Clinton Administration has so far responded appropriately. It has resisted bailing out Korea directly, instead insisting that Korea, like Thailand and Indonesia, seek aid from the monetary fund. But Korea, for reasons of domestic politics, has resisted reaching out to the fund because its loans come in exchange for stringent commitments to fix banking and other financial imbalances. If Korea waits too long, and the economy sinks, the consequences will spread far beyond its borders.

Korea's Troubles Worsen As Pressure for Aid Grows
South Korea said it would seek help from the United States and Japan to rescue its faltering economy, which represents the biggest threat yet in Asia's infectious financial crisis.
But American officials said the International Monetary Fund must orchestrate any aid, and it appeared that South Korean officials were becoming more receptive to that alternative as their currency plummeted further and the country's financial paralysis spread. Page A1. 

An agreement was reached in Manila by finance emissaries from Asia, the United States and Canada on ways to minimize the impact of Asian crises. But under United States pressure they scrapped a Japanese proposal to create a bailout fund only for Asia, opting for a vaguer commitment. D2.

HEADLINE: Japan Stocks Soar on Possibility of Bank Bailout

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Stocks surged in early trading today on renewed optimism that the Government would use public funds to bolster the troubled banking system.
At the midday recess, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 545.45 points, or 3.44 percent, at 16,387.91. 
 In Seoul, stocks were lower as the South Korean currency, the won, fell its daily trading limit, under a new, widened band. At midday, the stock market's main index was down 16.29 points, or 3.2 percent, at 486.30.
Earlier, the won fell the 10 percent daily limit, ending at 1,130.00 to the dollar, from 1,035.80 on Wednesday.
In currency trading here, the dollar was quoted at 126.54 yen, down from 127.00 yen in New York late Wednesday. Earlier on Wednesday, the dollar rose as high as 127.42 yen, a five-year high. The dollar also rose on Wednesday to 1.7318 marks from 1.7294 marks on Tuesday.
The fortune of the Japanese stock market in the last week has been tied to conflicting signals over whether the Government would use public funds to move aggressively in shoring up the troubled banking system.
Today, stocks rose on reports that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had instructed the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to consider the use of public funds for banks. The Cabinet's chief spokesman, Kanezo Muraoka, later confirmed that the party would debate the use of funds.
The comments marked a turnaround from Wednesday, when comments by Mr. Hashimoto and the Finance Minister indicated that the use of public money was not an option. That day, the Nikkei fell 5.3 percent -- its biggest drop since the Kobe earthquake in 1995.

HEADLINE: Iowan Makes U.S. History, Giving Birth to 7 Live Babies

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Nov. 19

 BODY:
A shy Iowa seamstress accomplished the extraordinary today, giving birth to seven babies, the first time in this country that so many infants have been born alive.
Bobbi McCaughey, a 29-year-old woman from the small town of Carlisle, underwent a Caesarean section performed by a team of more than 40 specialists shortly after noon. In six minutes, the four boys and three girls were taken, one by one, from her uterus, the smallest 2.5 pounds, the largest 3.4 pounds. The babies were about two months premature and even doctors were surprised at the success of the delivery. 
 "All the babies were so well-grown, so well-developed, it just strikes me as a miracle," said Dr. Paula Mahone, one of the doctors who helped perform the delivery at Iowa Methodist Medical Center.
Doctors said this afternoon that one of the boys was in critical condition and the other children were in serious condition, all of them on ventilators in the neonatal unit of a children's hospital. Hours later, the boy was taken off the critical list, and his condition was upgraded to serious.
The doctors said it could take several days to determine how strong the babies' lungs were, but they said their condition was not alarming for premature babies.
If all the children survive, it would be the first time that has happened. In September, a Saudi Arabian woman became the first to deliver seven live babies, surprising her doctors. , who thought she was carrying only five. But those babies were born three months premature and one month after birth, three of them died.
The closest an American woman has come to having septuplets was in 1985, when seven babies were born to Patricia and Samuel Frustaci of Orange, Calif. But one of the infants was stillborn, three died within 19 days, and the other three had medical and developmental problems.
For months, the news that Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey were expecting seven children was kept secret by neighbors in Carlisle, an old grain and railroad town just outside of Des Moines. But word of the septuplets began leaking out about two weeks after Mrs. McCaughey (pronounced McCoy) entered the hospital on Oct. 15.
Since then, the pregnancy has captured worldwide attention as both a symbol of the ultimate scientific miracle and a cautionary example of the unwanted consequences of fertility treatments.
Mrs. McCaughey had taken Pergonal, one of several fertility drugs being taken by an increasing number of couples trying to conceive.
Many doctors and medical ethicists had expressed concern that a successful pregnancy might lead people to believe that multiple pregnancies were desirable and safe. Some experts stressed that more needed to be done to avoid the multiple pregnancies that can occur with fertility treatments.
Today, Mrs. McCaughey's father, Robert Hepworth, issued a statement saying, "I would ask that all believers across the world join us in praying for Bobbi and the babies, that their health would continue and only improve."
It was not determined whether any of the infants are identical, but doctors said that not all the babies were.
"All the babies are so well-grown, so well-developed," said Dr. Mahone, a perinatologist who helped perform the delivery. "As we delivered each baby and saw the size of the babies and how vigorous they were, we were very, very happy."
Dr. Mahone said the first baby -- also the heaviest -- was nicknamed Hercules because he "held all the others up" in a pyramid formation in the womb.
Mrs. McCaughey had been taking the fertility drug because the couple had trouble conceiving their first child, Mikayla, who was born nearly two years ago.
The McCaugheys were told early in the pregnancy that aborting some of the fetuses, or selective reduction, would increase the chance of survival for the others. But they said their religious beliefs would not allow any abortion.
"God gave us those kids," Mr. McCaughey, 27, a billing clerk at an auto dealership, said last month. "He wants us to raise them."
Ethicists said the case of the McCaughey septuplets raised several of medicine's hardest questions.
First, is it appropriate to use technology to create life? Some, including Pope John Paul II, have taken a moral stand against fertility drugs, particularly because multiple fetuses often result, and many are likely to be stillborn or to die soon after birth.
Others question the ethics on the basis of resource allocation: should society spend so much money so one family can have a child?
Even tougher are the questions raised by a conundrum of multiple births. If some of the fetuses are not aborted, all could die or could be born so small that they might not survive. So is it appropriate to use technology to end life, especially life created by technology?
"Some people see a duty not to kill," said Jennifer A. McCrickerd, an assistant professor of philosophy who teaches biomedical ethics at Drake University in Des Moines. "Others see a duty to save as many as you can."
All has turned out well, so far, for the McCaugheys. They bet correctly.
"But what would people have thought if these children had been stillborn?" Professor McCrickerd asked. "Would they have characterized this couple as selfish parents?"
Doctors let the pregnancy continue as long as possible. Mrs. McCaughey was in her 31st week, at least three weeks past the point that doctors consider fetuses likely to live if born prematurely. She had been confined to a bed since the ninth week, moving as little as possible so as not to induce contractions, and had been hospitalized for a month. Doctors decided on Tuesday night to deliver, as she was experiencing contractions and did not want any more drug therapy. "She had had it, so we delivered," said Dr. Karen Drake, another of the attending doctors.
The children were named before the birth: Kenneth Robert, 3 pounds, 4 ounces; Alexis May, 2 pounds, 11 ounces; Natalie Sue, 2 pounds, 10 ounces; Kelsey Ann, 2 pounds, 5 ounces; Brandon James, 3 pounds, 3 ounces; Nathanial Roy, 2 pounds, 14 ounces; and Joel Steven, 2 pounds, 15 ounces.
"I'm probably one of the proudest grandfathers in this country at this moment," said Mrs. McCaughey's father, Bob Hepworth, after whom the largest baby was named.
The births touched off an extraordinary outpouring of donations. Under the orchestratration of Iowa's Governor, Terry Branstad, businesses in the state have agreed to give the McCaugheys a plot of land with a new house on it big enough for the suddenly expanded family, furniture and appliances to put in it, a new car and a lifetime supply of Pampers diapers that could number 32,200 disposables.
In Carlisle, many of the 3,200 residents celebrated the births and planned fund-raisers for the family.
"I wanted to tell someone, but I didn't," said Lavern Thompson, the McCaugheys' next-door neighbor. "Everyone in town is running around having a good old time. It's quite an event."
The McCaughey pregnancy is one of an increasing number of multiple births in this country, prompted by aggressive fertility treatments and also by improvements in prenatal and neonatal medical care.
Fertility drugs induce a woman to produce more than the usual one egg per cycle, increasing the chances that one of the eggs will be fertilized, but also increasing the risk of a multiple pregnancy. According to the Society for Reproductive Medicine, in 1995, more than 2.7. million women took fertility drugs, up from about one million women in 1988.
The number of multiple births has also accelerated, quadrupling over the last 25 years. In 1995, the last year for which statistics are available, there were 4,973 children born in sets of three or more. Most of those were triplets, but quadruplets and quintuplets are also becoming more common.
Doctors say that the more fetuses a woman carries, the greater the risk to the health of each one. All these babies are likely to be born premature, and problems can include cerebral palsy, brain damage, blindness, mental retardation or developmental problems with speech and motor skills. The economic costs are great too, not all of them covered by insurance. By some estimates, the McCaughey pregnancy will end up costing close to a million dollars.
Many say that fertility specialists can help forestall multiple births, either by encouraging women to "selectively reduce" the number of fetuses or by stopping the fertility drugs in mid-course once it becomes apparent that there is a multiple pregnancy. Some ethicists are in favor of stricter rules governing reproductive medicine. But some fertility doctors say they already take these steps on their own.

HEADLINE: Seoul Will Ask U.S. and Japan For Assistance

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
South Korea said today that it would ask the United States and Japan to help rescue the country from potentially the most damaging outbreak yet in a financial crisis that has erupted across Asia. But American officials, while encouraging South Korea to seek assistance, made clear that the International Monetary Fund, not Washington, would have to take the lead in any bailout of South Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy.
The urgent need of the country for billions of dollars to meet its commitments to overseas lenders and to end a selloff of its currency prompted a hurried series of back-channel consultations by American, European and Japanese officials hoping to prevent South Korea's problems from infecting other markets. 
 Their immediate concern was how to persuade South Korea's leaders that the country could no longer forestall a bailout by the I.M.F. until after presidential elections next month. In the midst of a turbulent campaign in which the ruling party may lose power, Korean politicians are trying hard to avoid the embarrassment of surrendering economic policy for the country to an outside authority. This afternoon, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin issued a statement urging Korea to "move forward quickly to address the present challenges, in particular with forceful and effective action to strengthen the financial system."
To underscore the need for quick action, two senior United States officials were dispatched to Seoul today to meet with the country's new Finance Minister, Lim Chang Yuel, who took office today after his predecessor was dismissed by President Kim Young Sam. Within hours of his appointment, Mr. Lim said he would seek help from the central banks of the United States, the main military ally of South Korea, and, more remarkably, from Japan, its onetime colonial master and its current economic rival. The two American officials are Timothy F. Geithner, the assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, and Edwin Truman, who runs the international finance division of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Lim did not specify what he had in mind, and no formal request has yet been made. Presumably, what South Korea would ask for is a complex transaction between central banks, known as swaps, in which dollars or yen would be temporarily exchanged for South Korean won. Mr. Lim also reversed the Government's previous insistence that it would not accept rescue plans the way Thailand and Indonesia did earlier this year, saying he would "consider an I.M.F. bailout if necessary."
Both outside economists and American officials say that the underlying industrial capability of South Korea remains strong; it is a big manufacturer of steel, automobiles and semiconductors. But the country's growth can no longer provide the cash to cover the debts of a banking system that is now in shambles after lending money to wildly overinflated real estate projects, pork-barrel construction and well-connected businesses that in return paid the ruling party handsomely.
Bad loans now total more than $20 billion, Korean officials say, and many economists believe that the real figure is much higher.
No one seems to know how big a bailout fund may be required. Internal estimates within the Treasury Department indicate that a $30 billion I.M.F. program might be sufficient. But private economists have given much higher numbers.
"The fact of the matter," one Administration official said today, "is that we still don't have all the facts."
What is clear is that any I.M.F. package would require South Korea to agree to far-reaching economic change. In such bailouts, the reforms generally include wide-ranging disclosure of critical financial data -- something the South Korean Government has so far resisted -- and permitting foreigners to invest in the country without restrictions.
Mr. Lim moved in that direction today, and said that he was ending a Government requirement that had prevented the national currency, the won, from falling more than 2.25 percent a day. Early on Thursday in Seoul, the won, which had already fallen 20 percent against the dollar since the beginning of this year, fell by the newly raised limit, 10 percent, and stocks were trading lower.
America's interest in helping South Korea goes far beyond the country's role as a trading partner. After Japan, it is America's most important military ally in Asia, and more than 30,000 American troops are based near the demilitarized zone that divides the country.
Moreover, Washington is concerned that South Korea not appear weak at a critical moment in negotiations with the North. On Friday, representatives of North and South Korea, the United States and China, meeting in New York, are expected to agree on talks in Geneva next month that could lead to a formal end to the Korean War, which ended in an armistice but no peace treaty.
Some American officials are also worried about the stability of the South Korean Government. The leading candidate for president is a longtime opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, who was kidnapped, imprisoned and nearly killed during his long career as an opposition leader against a series of repressive military governments. But Mr. Kim's political base is weak, and he is openly disliked by the country's leading businesses -- the huge conglomerates known as the chaebol -- and by the financial community.
"We could be in a position in which Kim Dae Jung takes office in the midst of a financial emergency that is going to require a lot of pain and downsizing by South Korean businesses," one American diplomat said earlier this week.
That is why the United States is trying to convince all the political factions in Korea that the I.M.F. must be called in. Once the country is committed to following the fund's requirements, the thinking goes, politicians can blame the I.M.F. for the pain of layoffs and slower growth rather. Over time, that could restore the confidence of outside investors who have abandoned Korea.
"The problem now is that there is no one in the Government to deal with," said Lawrence B. Krause, a professor at the University of California at San Diego and director of its Korea Pacific Program. "Everyone knows the Government is responsible for much of the problem," he said, and politicians on all sides of the election are steering clear of endorsing an austerity plan that will be deeply unpopular in a country known for volatile politics and sometimes violent demonstrations.
If South Korea fails to restore the confidence of foreign investors, the country's problems seem bound to worsen. South Korea has $67 billion to $77 billion in short-term debt to financial institutions outside the country that must be paid within the next year. Making those payments has become increasingly difficult, in part because of the string of bankruptcies, and in part because the quick devaluation of the local currency has made it nearly impossible for many companies to pay back a debt that is denominated in dollars.
It is a measure of the country's desperation for short-term aid that the Government was also appealing to Tokyo, not just to Washington, for aid. Korea's enmity toward Japan is longstanding; the entire Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony for most of the first half of this century, and bitterness over the treatment of Koreans still runs deep. Statues in Seoul celebrate a Korean admiral who fought off Japanese invaders more than 400 years ago.
But Japanese officials say they, like the United States, are not in a position to lend the kind of cash South Korea needs.
Japan's deepening problems, in fact, have forced the country to back away from a proposal it made in September to create an Asian bailout fund that would operate separately from the I.M.F. At a meeting in Manila that ended today, the United States persuaded a group of Southeast Asian nations that any bailout fund should be centered on the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: Albright Says Iraq Agrees to Let U.S. Inspectors Back

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Thursday, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Iraq has told Russia that it will allow the unconditional return of all United Nations weapons inspectors, including Americans, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said this morning after an extraordinary 2 A.M. meeting here of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Iraqi officials told the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, that Baghdad will make an announcement of its reversal later today, she said. 
 But Ms. Albright immediately tempered her optimism by saying, "I will believe it when I see it."
In a briefing with reporters after the two-hour meeting, she added, "The announcement is to be made later this morning, and then we'll have to see whether it's carried out." Either the inspectors are allowed to return unconditionally and in their previous composition or they are not, she said, adding, "I'll be watching and waiting just as you are."
An American official at the meeting said Mr. Primakov seemed "reasonably confident" that Iraq would follow through. "It was definitely his strong expectation," the official said. "And he said if Iraq did not follow through, we could all meet again."
If Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein does back down without warfare, it will represent an important victory for American and Russian diplomacy. But the price, now and for the future, is unclear.
Mr. Primakov held out to Mr. Hussein the hope of speedier work by the inspectors, to give Iraq a sense that inspections will not go on forever. Iraq also wants a change in the composition of the team, and a end of all the sanctions imposed in 1991 after the Persian Gulf war.
Ms. Albright made it clear that the United States had not agreed to changes in inspections or sanctions.
In their statement at the end of the meeting, read by the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, the five announced a meeting on Friday in New York of the United Nations Special Commission, or Unscom, which carries out the inspections, "to discuss and advise, among other important issues, ways to make Unscom's work more effective."
Those recommendations will be subject to approval by the Security Council. But Ms. Albright also suggested that more efficient inspections might mean more personnel, which could dilute the percentage of Americans slightly. Americans currently account for about 10 percent of the inspectors. Such a change, which is not assured, could be presented as face-saving alterations to a sanctions regime that President Clinton has said could last as long as Mr. Hussein rules Iraq.
Ms. Albright said lifting sanctions "will probably be discussed at some time, but the United States has not agreed to anything."
The statement read by Mr. Cook urged Mr. Hussein to make an "unconditional decision" to comply fully with United Nations resolutions and allow weapons inspectors, "in their previous composition," back into the country.
These were the bottom-line demands of the United States and Ms. Albright, who rushed here from India to discuss a Russian plan to get Iraq to reverse course and avoid a military confrontation.
The statement said that the attendees -- Ms. Albright, Mr. Primakov, Mr. Cook, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and China's Ambassador for disarmament, Sha Zukang -- "appreciated the diplomatic initiative undertaken by Russia," which "the participants in the meeting hope will lead to the unconditional decision by the leadership of Iraq to accept the return of the personnel of the Special Commission of the U.N. Security Council, that is, Unscom, in its previous composition for its work."
But the statement did not suggest, as Ms. Albright said explicitly, that Iraq had told Mr. Primakov it would do exactly that.
Crucially for the Americans, the statement also "underscored the importance of the efforts in solidarity." American officials came to this meeting unclear about the details of what Mr. Primakov was negotiating and concerned that he might be getting ahead of the Council.
There is also some lingering American mistrust of Mr. Primakov, an expert on Arab affairs and former Russian intelligence chief who, as a Soviet diplomat, tried to head off military action against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The White House has been sensitive about appearing to engage in any negotiation with Mr. Hussein or offer any inducements to him, no matter how small or obvious, to persuade him to back down.
Even a sudden American and British offer to allow Iraq to sell more of its oil to buy food, medicine and other supplies for civilians if it comes back into compliance with United Nations weapons inspection requirements was described by White House officials as a humanitarian gesture with no particular connection to the diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis.
In Washington, hours before the meeting, the President reiterated that he wanted to solve the Iraq problem without military intervention, but he did not rule it out.
"Iraq must comply with the unanimous will of the international community and let the weapons inspectors resume their work to prevent Iraq from developing an arsenal of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons," he said.
"The inspectors must be able to do so without interference. That's our top line. That's our bottom line. I want to achieve it diplomatically, but we're taking every step to make sure we are prepared to pursue whatever options are necessary."
In defiance of United Nations sanctions, Mr. Hussein expelled American weapons inspectors from Iraq last week, and the entire international team departed.
The battle over the weapons inspectors led to a military buildup by the United States in the Persian Gulf, while diplomatic efforts to bring Iraq into compliance continued.
The United States is sending 2 aircraft carriers, about 300 military planes and more than 20 warships as well as 6 stealth fighter planes, to be based in Kuwait, and 6 B-52 bombers, to be based in Diego Garcia.
Iraq's positions have shifted, following Mr. Hussein's pattern.
First Iraq demanded that all American weapons inspectors with the United Nations Special Commission leave Iraq, and then demanded that the percentage of Americans on inspection teams be reduced.
British officials suggest that problem might be dealt with by simply expanding the commission's personnel, rather than dropping any particular nationality.
But Iraq now seems to want, more than anything, to have some form of schedule or assurance that United Nations weapons inspections within its borders will end soon. And American officials -- as Ms. Albright repeated this morning -- are likely to oppose concessions on this matter, especially if they appear to have been won by Mr. Hussein's tactics.
Until inspectors certify that Iraq is free of all weapons of mass destruction, the United Nations will not lift crippling economic sanctions imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which led to the Persian Gulf war.
But American officials have said that certification by the commission would not be enough to lift sanctions entirely, and that Mr. Hussein will have to show a sustained pattern of good behavior first, Mr. Rubin has said.
That is an assertion that other countries do not necessarily accept.
Despite President Clinton's statement about the link between the sanctions and Mr. Hussein's role, American officials deny that Washington intends to keep sanctions on Iraq as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power, as the French and Russians say they believe. But the officials also say they have "serious doubts" that Mr. Hussein, who has consistently challenged the United Nations and consistently pursued weapons of mass destruction, can ever satisfy the requirements of sustained good behavior the Americans want.

Hussein Briefs Ministers
 BAGHDAD, Nov. 19 (Agence France-Presse) -- President Saddam Hussein briefed his ministers today on Russian diplomacy intended to calm the dispute over United Nations weapons inspections, the state media reported.
A special parliamentary session was set for Thursday.
Mr. Hussein chaired a Cabinet meeting today to brief ministers on "discussions with Russia and developments in the crisis provoked by the United States," the official Iraqi news agency said. Baghdad said it would not back away from the standoff after offering to allow the return of weapons inspectors if the Commission was restructured to ensure a balance of nationalities.
Meanwhile, Iraq has accused the American representatives on the United Nations sanctions committee of blocking four contracts under the oil-for-food accord. The contracts cover equipment for power stations and desalination plants and batteries, an official spokesman quoted by news agency said.
The United States "is seeking to aggravate the suffering of the Iraqi people while at the same time falsely speaking of its concern about their suffering," he added.
Under the oil-for-food accord first introduced in December, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion dollars of oil every six months to buy food and medicines and other supplies.

Boat Builder Closes, Eliminating 130 Jobs

DATELINE: EGG HARBOR

 BODY:
After 50 years, the Egg Harbor Yacht Company closed its doors Monday, putting 130 people out of work. The boat-building company was one of the largest employers in Egg Harbor, which has a population of 4,500. 
 The company shut down once before, in 1993, but was able to reopen later that year after obtaining a $3.5 million Federal loan. The company owes $3 million on the Federal loan and may have as much as $7 million in additional debt, said Rose Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Economic Development Authority.

U.S. Agency Says AIDS Will Orphan Millions

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The United States Agency for International Development said today that 40 million children in developing countries would be without one or both parents by 2010.
With a population explosion of young people, especially in poor countries, "it is a crisis of staggering proportion," Dr. Nils Daulaire, senior adviser on children and women's health issues, said at a news conference. 
 According to the report, AIDS, already prevalent in Africa south of the Sahara, will become widespread in the next decade in Asia and Latin America.
"That is going to affect not only the future of these countries, it is going to affect the entire global network of trade, diplomacy and development," Mr. Daulaire said.
"What we are talking about here is something that has never been seen before, which is countries with one-sixth to one-quarter of all children without one or both parents."

Newest Challenge for Welfare: Helping the Hard-Core Jobless

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: OREGON CITY, Ore.

 BODY:
After 14 years on and off the welfare rolls, Kimberly Malcom still had a few problems to work out before settling into a job.
She was fleeing a husband who had broken three of her fingers. 
 She was living in her car.
She was recovering from thyroid cancer.
And she was smoking crack cocaine.
"I probably wasn't in the welfare office for five minutes before I burst into tears," said Ms. Malcom, who soon added a suicide attempt, an alcoholic boyfriend and a runaway daughter to her list of afflictions. "I was just so hurt."
With the most employable recipients fleeing the rolls, Ms. Malcom personifies the nation's next major welfare challenge: working with the increasingly difficult cases that remain. As caseloads plunge under strict new laws, rising proportions of those left behind face the limiting conditions -- from illiteracy and homelessness to mental illness and addiction -- that analysts euphemistically call "barriers to employment."
After one of the nation's sharpest caseload declines, 50 percent in just three years, Oregon stands on the edge of this policy frontier. It is one of the first states to confront a welfare population dominated by the most troubled cases and is making unusual efforts to find them jobs. But the costs and difficulties of the work involved offer a host of cautionary lessons.
While states with far less experience are boasting of early success, the first recipients to leave the rolls are often the easiest to employ. A tougher test of last year's welfare overhaul will be posed by those who remain, especially over the next few years, as time limits threaten to chase them from the rolls. The Oregon experience offers a warning: the hardest work has yet to begin.
Officials estimate that 75 percent of those left on the rolls in Oregon suffer from mental health problems that could interfere with a job. Half acknowledge drug or alcohol abuse, and half say they have been beaten or sexually abused. Forty-two percent lack a high school education. Thirty percent have criminal histories.
And since much of this data is self-reported, sensitive problems like drug use or family violence may be even more prevalent than they seem.
"It's not just a matter of telling people, 'You ought to work,' " Sandie Hoback, the state welfare director, said. "Many of these families have real significant problems."
In this blue-collar suburb just south of Portland, caseworkers have a term for such clients with multiple, soul-wrenching problems. They call them drawer people, since that is where their files used to reside while caseworkers focused on more promising prospects.
With the files now coming out of the drawers, officials say they feel newly encouraged about the people they once wrote off. The percentage of clients placed in jobs has grown each year, even as the cases have grown more difficult. The average starting wage has risen too, climbing 6 percent last year to $6.57 an hour.
"I'm surprised at the progress we continue to make," Ms. Hoback said. "I fully expected by now we'd see some leveling off."
But Oregon has an advantage over many other states. It enjoys a generously financed program and a history of civic commitment. Other states trying to replicate these achievements will find they have been hard won. With clients needing more expensive services, from drug treatment to wage subsidies, costs per case have risen 28 percent in the last year alone. The time the average client spends on the rolls has risen 10 percent, to 29 months.
And progress now rides to an unprecedented degree on the skills of the state's caseworkers, who are being thrust into unfamiliar and sometimes uncomfortable new roles. Trained for the bookkeeper's task of calculating eligibility, they now find themselves asking clients what drugs they are taking, what mental disorders they are experiencing and what violent relationships they may be escaping.
"I think Oregon's approach is encouraging," said LaDonna Pavetti, a researcher at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., and an authority on long-term recipients. "But it remains an open question about who you can help, how much you can help and how much it will cost."
Last year's law limits recipients to five years of Federal aid, while allowing extensions for 20 percent of the caseload. Ms. Pavetti doubts that percentage is large enough to cover all who will need the long-term help. And she fears that states will not grant extensions to those whose maladies are difficult to define.
"States will cover recipients with concrete disabilities," she said. "But many people fall in a gray zone. Sometimes they function and sometimes they don't."
Operating under a Federal waiver granted before last year's welfare law, Oregon essentially has no time limits. It plans to continue aid, using state money if necessary, to all who cooperate with the program by seeking jobs or services. But critics say the state remains too eager to push fragile clients into stressful, low-wage jobs, rather than train them for better-paying work. At best this promises a life of continued need, they say, and at worst the pressure can trigger a drug relapse or a resumed relationship with a violent man.
And with caseworkers exercising vast new discretion, critics also say some troubled clients simply get turned away before they can get on the rolls. Ms. Hoback, a former Legal Services advocate, contends that such instances are rare. But she is also trying to retrain the state's 750 caseworkers, who start at salaries of $25,400 and mostly lack college degrees.
"Some workers still don't get it," she said.
Ms. Malcom's odyssey shows the problems that can arise when even the most thoughtful casework collides with lives rooted in distress. As a child she was beaten so badly by her mother that her teachers summoned an investigator. She left school in 10th grade and was married as a teen-ager. Her husband threw her down the stairs while she was pregnant and left choke marks on her throat.
Though Ms. Malcom says "we're good friends now," she and her husband split up, and she drifted from bartending to welfare and from cancer to crack. By the time she returned to the welfare rolls in 1995, she had resumed living with her ex-husband and he had beaten her again. Her thyroid disease had raised her weight to 250 pounds, and she had resumed smoking cocaine.
Alarmed, her caseworker sent Ms. Malcom to a mental health clinic, but she swallowed an overdose of anti-depressants, trying to kill herself. For the next year, welfare officials deferred a job search while Ms. Malcom attended drug treatment and counseling programs. "They asked me not to do anything else -- that basically I needed to work on my mental health," she said.
As she did, Ms. Malcom began to emerge as a capable, insightful woman. Impressed by her progress, her caseworker arranged a volunteer job at the welfare office, where she did such a good job that she was hired as a clerk at more than $1,300 a month.
"She was better than the other support staff we had," said Carolyn Ross, the office head.
But Ms. Malcom met a man who moved in and drank heavily. Her daughter ran away, her depression returned, and she once more turned to crack. When she was dismissed, two months after she was hired, Ms. Malcom cried, begged and threatened to kill herself, then fled to the mental health clinic.
Though that failure is not the story's end -- Ms. Malcom found another clerical job and left welfare again -- she and Ms. Ross were each fighting off tears at a recent lunch where they discussed what went wrong.
"She showed such incredible potential," said Ms. Ross, who hopes to rehire her.
Ms. Malcom said, "To be honest, I think the success scared me."
 
The Oregon Model
Inclined to Lead, Willing to Spend
The Oregon program has developed along strikingly apolitical lines. While many governors elsewhere have cultivated tough welfare images, Oregon's politicians have mostly deferred to the state's Department of Human Resources. And with whites accounting for 79 percent of the caseload, the issue has generated virtually no racial conflict. But while welfare has scarcely figured in elections, the state has long shown an interest in innovation and a willingness to spend money.
In the first half of the decade, the average state spent just 60 percent of its potential Federal welfare-to-work money. But Oregon put up enough matching money to gain access to its full Federal grant -- then added 20 percent. And since Federal subsidies are now tied to past spending, Oregon receives about $6,600 a year per family, a figure 60 percent above the national average and second only to Wisconsin's.
As it evolved over the last 10 years, the Oregon program, called Jobs, underwent two significant shifts. The first dropped an emphasis on long-term training in favor of quick job placements. While the program still offers a rich array of services, most applicants must first spend a month looking for work before getting help. The rule evolved after officials found that even the most troubled clients sometimes find jobs.
The second shift essentially eliminated the exemptions that used to abound in welfare-to-work programs. Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, the new Federal welfare program, requires states to enroll 50 percent of their recipients in a job-related activity by 2002. By last year, Oregon's participation rate had already risen to 89 percent. The activities vary greatly, but virtually everyone has to do something.
There are two-week classes to build self-esteem, and three-month classes in marketable skills. There are unpaid "workfare" jobs to build resumes, and subsidized, wage-paying jobs for those who remain unemployed. Caseworkers have tremendous discretion in making assignments. But as long as a client complies, there is effectively no time limit on aid.
As caseworkers shifted from processing checks to offering services, they made a discovery: their clients were even more troubled than they knew. While reliable data are scarce, researchers have typically talked of a "bottom third" with sharply limited prospects. Oregon's experience suggests that the bottom third is every bit as big as -- and perhaps even more troubled than -- the researchers knew.
"We really weren't getting the story," said Jane Moore, a caseworker who specializes in teen-age mothers. "These are not cheerleaders who accidentally got pregnant on prom night. I've had Grandma, Mom and teen all come in stoned out of their gourd. I had one girl whose mother gave her to a mechanic to pay for a repair on her car."
Still, the rolls have fallen 51 percent from their peak of nearly 44,000 in March 1994. And the pace of decline has accelerated even as the state digs deeper into the caseload -- the rolls fell 10 percent in the first half of 1996 and 13 percent in the first half of 1997. Here, as elsewhere, the question remains: Where are recipients going?
Critics worry that the requirements, especially the up-front job search, simply drive some clients away. They point toward people like Elizabeth Stevens, who applied last month after her boyfriend drank the rent money, threatened to kill her and left town. Her landlord threatened to evict Ms. Stevens and her two children within 72 hours. And she was scheduled for surgery to remove kidney stones the next week. But when she applied for benefits, a caseworker turned her down.
"She said they have a waiting period of 30 days," said Ms. Stevens, who was already calling homeless shelters when a lawyer for a welfare-rights program got the decision reversed.
Even admirers of the Oregon approach, like Ms. Pavetti, worry that "some clients are too fragile to make their way into the system." But Ms. Hoback argued that caseloads were falling mostly because clients were finding jobs. The number of clients placed in jobs each month has risen to more than 1,800 last year from about 500 in the early 1990's. (The effort has been aided by falling unemployment rates, which for the last three years have averaged about 5 percent.)
While costs have also grown -- to $632 a month per client in the first half of 1997, from $493 in the first half of 1996 -- the spending has been more than offset by the savings from caseload declines. Ms. Hoback estimated that the declines had saved $114 million over the last two years.
"It's still cost effective," she said. "With the right amount of support, everyone can move ahead."
 
The Substance Abuser
For Addicts, Help First, Jobs Second
The wooded hills of Clackamas County stretch 50 miles east from Oregon City to the slopes of Mount Hood. The isolation makes the area a magnet for methamphetamine labs, hideaway trailers where the low-cost drug is mixed in marathon malodorous sessions. The drug is so prevalent that caseworkers are trained to flee the giveaway smell, which is reminiscent of cat urine.
By the time she was 20, Lori Furlow had consumed so much of it that she had already had a heart attack. That did not slow her. Facing criminal as well as cardiac arrest, Ms. Furlow passed her urinalyses on probation by chugging bottles of vinegar.
"I weighed 86 pounds," she said. "Spandex would fall off me. You could smell meth coming out of my pores."
With problems like this, Oregon caseworkers increasingly act as brokers of more specialized care. They can refer addicts to treatment or depressed women to mental health clinics. They can refer abused women to shelters or immigrants to employment counselors fluent in Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.
But there are no clear rules about who gets what service or for how long.
"While a really good worker will figure it out, not everyone's a really good worker," Ms. Pavetti said. Recipients who do not comply face escalating penalties, beginning at $50 a month and ending in the denial of the whole cash grant.
Oddly enough, substance abuse -- for all the devastation it wreaks -- is one of the less complicated problems that caseworkers confront. The diagnosis is relatively straightforward. And addiction can often be conquered more quickly than chronic mental health problems, like depression or severe anxiety. (Many clients, however, have both.)
While previous studies have estimated that anywhere from 7 percent to 37 percent of welfare recipients have substance abuse problems, a recent Oregon survey produced a much higher figure: 50 percent.
Unlike most states, Oregon has been expanding its efforts for addicts. In 1992, it became the first state to require them to attend treatment as a condition of receiving welfare. And the Oregon Health Plan, the state's Medicaid equivalent, now provides up to 14 hours a week in outpatient care. In addition, about a third of the substance abuse clients end up in residential treatment, which is paid for by separate mechanisms, including a state tax on beer and wine.
An evaluation of the program recently found that clients who completed the Oregon treatments earned 65 percent more than clients in a comparison group. They were 45 percent less likely to be arrested, and half as likely to be investigated for child abuse or neglect. The evaluator, Michael Finigan, concluded that for every dollar Oregon spent, it saved at least $5.60 on other social services.
But a recent survey by the Legal Action Center, a New York advocacy group, found that 20 states retained an optional feature in last year's law that simply bans recent drug felons from receiving aid. And 21 other states retained a modified ban.
The restrictions come from an understandable anger at seeing benefits used to buy drugs. But Oregon officials say outright bans can make addicts unwilling to seek help. Christa Sprinkle, a drug and mental health specialist in Portland, urges a carrot-and-stick approach of services tied to penalties for those who do not comply. But Ms. Sprinkle said some caseworkers, fearing confrontation, were too slow to impose sanctions.
Indeed, it was a penalty that helped capture Ms. Furlow's attention. While ducking her probation officer and manufacturing more drugs, Ms. Furlow began receiving notices from the welfare office, insisting she report for a job-preparation class. She ignored them, her check was reduced -- and that, she insists, is what unsettled her.
"That was part of the reason I went into treatment -- you rely so much on that welfare check," said Ms. Furlow, who spent a year in a residential program.
After leaving she spent another year doing volunteer workfare assignments before landing a clerical job with the state in 1996. She now earns $18,000 a year.
"It all finally culminated -- the burnout, the guilt, the fear," she said. "I think the sanction's a real wake-up call."
 
The Hidden Factor
Physical, Sexual And Mental Abuse
As caseloads dwindle, Oregon may be uncovering a second epidemic, one less obvious and less recognized than drugs. That is the sheer level of violence that many if not most of the women have endured. While 50 percent report histories of physical or sexual assault, the real incidence may run much higher. Like women addicted to drugs, women trapped in violent relationships can be slow to concede the problem, to caseworkers or even themselves.
The injuries extend beyond the obvious, physical ones. Women fleeing violent men are often too afraid to seek work, especially if it means entrusting young children to the care of strangers. And many women find that jealous men, threatened by their move toward independence, will do all they can to keep them from classes or jobs.
"People don't always tell you they're in an abusive situation," said Wendell St. John, a caseworker specializing in domestic violence. "They just always have an excuse about why they don't follow through."
While the violence is prevalent, most states are still groping for a response. Twenty-eight states have adopted an option in last year's law that simply exempts abused women from work requirements.
Oregon has put its energy in caseworker training, rather than blanket exemptions. Many offices now have a specialist, like Ms. St. John, who works closely with local shelters. Caseworkers can waive the 30-day job search for women in dangerous situations. They can spend up to $1,200 on rent and deposits for safe housing.
But in Oregon and across the country, there is no policy for, and only the haziest understanding of, a second kind of violence: the sexual abuse many recipients have suffered as children. Yet it often surfaces in conversations ostensibly about other topics, like drugs, anxiety or self-esteem. Of the 16 recipients with noteworthy "barriers" interviewed for this article, 11 alluded to childhood incidents of rape or molestation.
One said she was raped by a baby sitter when she was 6. A second said that her mother's boyfriend had molested her when she was 12, and that her mother had evicted her when she complained. A third, a teen-age mother molested by an older cousin, said, "I don't call it anything special because it seems like it happens to everybody."
Among those it happened to was Rita Davis, whose earnest, thwarted search for work shows the unlikely impediments that recipients can face. Ms. Davis, 35, was one of 13 siblings schooled at home by an abusive father. After her husband left two years ago, she began looking for more profitable work than the paper route supporting her and her 2-year-old son. But she reads at the seventh-grade level. And she weighs 325 pounds.
An unremittingly sincere woman, Ms. Davis recounted her experience between deep, steadying breaths.
"I went to 10 or 15 temporary agencies," she said. "I'd call up on the phone and they'd say, 'Oh, you sound like the perfect person.' Then they take one look at me and they blow it off."
After months of rejection, Ms. Davis solicited the help of Gene Hanson, a job-placement counselor she had met in past training programs. Knowing she had an interest in numbers, Mr. Hanson went to unusual lengths to create a subsidized job for her as receptionist at an accounting agency. The agency hired her after the state agreed to pay most of her salary for the first six months.
Then a new problem arose: body odor. Her boss called Mr. Hanson and complained that it was driving customers away.
"I don't know what it is," said Ms. Davis, whose problem has stumped her doctor as well. "I take a shower every day."
Mr. Hanson arrived the next day with two sacks of deodorant and shampoo from a state donation bin. Ms. Davis experimented, the products worked, and she was permanently hired.
"She's even better than some professionals I've had," said her boss, Douglas Capps, who is so impressed he has promoted her to bookkeeping.
Ms. Davis was an hour into her story before she mentioned another element of her struggle: years of sexual abuse by her father.
Ms. Davis said that she waited years before having a child of her own, "because they say you pass it on." And she even wonders whether she subconsciously decided to keep gaining weight as a way to protect herself.
"Sometimes I think this is like a shield: a lot of men don't like heavy women," she said.
Ms. Davis said she chose to tell her story because it helped her to talk, and because it might help those with similar problems. "I want people to know it didn't destroy me," she said.
Now earning $6.75 an hour, she remains $3,000 in debt -- to her divorce lawyer, her doctor and a student loan agency. She has lost her health insurance, and she gets headaches from her outdated prescription lenses. But, she says, "I love this job."
"Somebody is able to look past my size and see me," she said. "I've wondered why it took so long."

HEADLINE: An All-Bach Program That, the Fact Is, Isn't Quite

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
On any scale of scandal and mayhem, it doesn't even register, but truth in advertising perhaps requires full and immediate disclosure. Of the 25 Bach cantatas that Canticum Novum, a New York chorus, is performing this season to celebrate its 25th anniversary, two, or at least one and a half, are not by Bach: No. 53, "Schlage Doch, Gewunschte Stunde," which was written by Georg Melchior Hoffmann, and No. 118, "O Jesu Christ, Meins Lebens Licht," which was either conceived or arranged by an unknown second hand.
"I knew they were spurious and decided to do them anyway, for interest's sake," Harold Rosenbaum, the chorus's founder and director, said last week. "It will get people thinking: 'There must have been a reason people thought they were by Bach. They must be good. Were there other people who were almost as good?' 
 "They're actually charming pieces. And part of the reason I'm doing them is that they fit in in terms of length. They are not long."
Practicality, to be sure, is no small consideration when you are trying to cram 25 substantial works into four programs. The series, at Merkin Concert Hall, opens tomorrow evening with seven cantatas, all certifiably Bach's, and continues on March 22. It closes on May 17 with afternoon and evening concerts, 11 cantatas in all.
Why celebrate with Bach? "We've done more Bach over the years than any other composer," said Mr. Rosenbaum, who learned his own Bach first through the Swingle Singers, in the 1960's, and started Canticum Novum in 1973, when he was fresh from his studies at Queens College. Still, the group has performed only a dozen or so of the cantatas along with several larger works.
So why the cantatas now? "They are the most important body of church music ever written," Mr. Rosenbaum said, "and most of them are not very well known."
Some 200 of Bach's sacred cantatas survive. They are typically multimovement affairs, alternating choruses and instrumental numbers with recitatives and arias, and ranging in length from 5 to 50 minutes. There are also works for solo vocalist, two of which will be heard tomorrow. The cantatas were performed at the principal services on Sundays or feast days, and during some stretches, Bach ground out one a week, while also preparing the performances and carrying out other duties.
Mr. Rosenbaum carefully examined all the cantatas over three months, "the most pleasurable three months I've had in a long time," he said. Length, though only one consideration, was a major one. In this context, the great one-movement No. 50, "Nun Ist das Heil und die Kraft," despite its being merely a remnant of a larger work either lost or incomplete, comes as a blessing.
The conductor also had to take instrumentation into account so he could hire players economically. Among the more remarkable findings in his studies was that Bach, ever inventive, used no fewer than 145 different instrumentations in the 200-odd works. The program tomorrow will use only a handful of players, mostly from the Orchestra of St. Luke's, on period instruments. The program in March will roll out the big guns: trumpets and drums.
Two other of Mr. Rosenbaum's goals worked slightly at cross-purposes: to present the finest cantatas but also to bring as many unknown works to light as possible. "I found in going through them that the well-known ones are the best ones," Mr. Rosenbaum said, "or certainly among the best ones." The mix he arrived at is judicious.
Still, might not all of this be too much of a great thing? "It will be interesting to see," said George Stauffer, a professor of music at Hunter College and the president of the American Bach Society, who will give a preconcert lecture tomorrow. He suspects not, if only because of the great variety.
The first program offers four works from Bach's time in Muhlhausen (1708), two from Weimar (1708-17) and one from Leipzig (1723-50). "You can hear Bach evolving before your very ears," Mr. Stauffer said.
Yet the project remains a challenge, to say the least. "It's the craziest thing I've ever done," Mr. Rosenbaum said. Even he is already worried about that Sunday in May with two programs.
"I figure I'll have about two and a half hours in between," he said. "Should I lie down? What should I eat? Should I sit on a stool during the concert? Should I go to my church job that morning?"
Mr. Rosenbaum is the organist at South Salem Presbyterian Church in Westchester County, where he lives. He directs nine choruses, including the New York Virtuoso Singers, a professional organization, and Canticum Novum, an elite group of 26 nonprofessionals.
Canticum Novum has a busy schedule in addition to these concerts, including Christmas programs throughout December, and Mr. Rosenbaum says he encountered resistance to the Bach project among his board and, even more, his singers. "They love Bach but thought it was too much singing," he said.
The trepidation was evidently not universal among the wide variety of people who make up the chorus.
"For me it was the incentive to stay with the group," said Charles Eubanks, the assistant director of the music division at the Library of the Performing Arts in Lincoln Center, who sang with Canticum Novum in its early years and recently returned. "This repertory is a lot of fun to sing."
Stephen Gomersall, another member of the chorus, confirms that it took a while for the singers to become convinced of the project's wisdom, but he now finds it exciting. He also finds it therapeutic in relation to his job, as deputy representative to the United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations, which has placed him in the news recently in relation to the tensions in Iraq.
"I've bent pretty well every rule to get to rehearsals," Mr. Gomersall said. Still, Mr. Rosenbaum reads the newspapers with trepidation, fearing that Mr. Gomersall's participation may yet fall victim to world politics.
Mr. Rosenbaum doesn't need more to worry about. "Bach is so monumental," he said. "It's very scary to do Bach."
 
The Programs
 
Canticum Novum will perform 25 cantatas, most of them by Bach, in four programs for its 25th anniversary season. The first is at Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, tomorrow at 8 P.M. The cantatas on the program are Nos. 106, 54, 61, 196, 82, 131 and 4. Tickets are $20.

Beetlemania: Snug Bugs and Other Specimens

BYLINE: By KEITH MARTIN 

 BODY:
ALL it Bug II: Early in 1998, some 65 years after the Volkswagen Beetle was conceived -- as the brainchild of Adolf Hitler -- a new Beetle will make its debut, updated for the 21st century.
This time, the car will have its engine up front; a cooling system that uses water, not air, and a price that Bug drivers of the 60's would have considered a real bummer. But even if the new $18,000 to $22,000 VW turns out to be wonderful, it's a sure bet that purists will still prefer the original to the sequel. For old-style Beetles are not just cars; they are automotive and cultural icons. 
 Decked out with peace symbols, they were the original flower power vehicle of the 60's. One named Herbie starred in a 1969 Walt Disney movie, "The Love Bug," that brought more people into theaters than "Easy Rider." In the 1973 future spoof "Sleeper," Woody Allen comes across a Beetle that had been stored for two centuries. It starts on the first try, of course.
More than 20 million Beetles have been produced, making it the best-selling car ever with a fundamentally unchanged body. (The best-selling auto nameplate, the Toyota Corolla, has been produced in many styles and variations.)
The first Beetles left the assembly line in Germany in 1939, and they are still built in Mexico at the rate of 100 a day. There are hundreds of VW-based clubs in the United States, along with numerous foreign clubs, several magazines and a host of Internet sites. The Beetle led the invasion of European imports in the 50's and 60's, which in turn gave way to the wave of Japanese economy cars that arrived in the 70's and 80's.
Hitler provided the impetus for the Beetle in 1933 by calling for a "people's car" that could travel at 100 kilometers an hour, or 62 m.p.h.; go 33 miles on a gallon of gasoline, require minimal repairs, offer enough space for four or five occupants, and have an easily maintained air-cooled engine. In 1934, Ferdinand Porsche, who later built the famous sports cars, received the contract to develop the people's car. His design featured a rear-mounted engine, eliminating the need for a long drive shaft; aluminum engine castings to keep the rear end from being too heavy, and a simple suspension of a front torsion bar and rear swing axle.
The first Beetles were sold in 1939 as the KdF-Wagen (for Kraft durch Freude, or "Strength through joy," a Nazi slogan). The cars were offered through an unusual stamp-book approach. A worker could buy a few stamps each week, and when his book was full -- with a value of 990 Reichmarks, or about 800 hours' pay for a skilled worker -- he could exchange it for a KdF-Wagen. The outbreak of World War II put a halt to the program, with few if any cars delivered.
But more than 200,000 German workers had been saving the stamps. In 1961, VW bowed to popular pressure and allowed savers to exchange their old stamps for credit toward new Beetles.
In World War II, the Volkswagen chassis was used under many types of military vehicles, the most familiar being the Kubelwagen, the German command car similar to the American jeep. One unusual variation was the Schwimmwagen, an amphibious adaptation with a retractable propeller. More than 30 years later, VW sold a variant of the K-wagen in the United States with the minimalist name of "the Thing."
After the war, the VW plant at Wolfsburg was quick to resume production despite heavy damage from Allied bombing. The first two Beetles arrived in the United States in 1949, but few dealers were interested in the odd little car with the unusual air-cooled engine at the wrong end.
Once a beachhead was established, millions of Volkswagens rolled ashore, tapping a vein of discontent with Detroit's styling excesses, conspicuous consumption and slipshod quality. American sales of all types of VW's peaked in 1970 at 582,573.
The original 1946-52 Beetles -- easily identified by their small two-piece rear windows -- are known as the "split rear window" model. (Irreverent collectors call the distinctively curved and scalloped rear deck of these cars the "pope's nose" design.)
In 1953, the two-piece rear window was replaced by a single piece of oval glass. "The oval-window Bug is the ultimate for many Beetle lovers," said Troy Heitzenrater, publisher of Voice of the Enthusiast, a newsletter published six times a year by the German Air Sucker Society, or GASS, a club for classic Volkswagen enthusiasts in Salem, Ohio. "It has the 36-horsepower engine, which is nearly impossible to break, and hydraulic brakes, which were much better than the mechanical ones on earlier Bugs."
Mr. Heitzenrater has seen both types of early Beetles, in perfect, restored condition, sell for $15,000. More ordinary cars change hands for $7,000 to $8,000.
Mr. Heitzenrater says Beetle owners are a breed apart in their ability to be "flexible people -- to take the good along with the bad." He said this may be because, amid the bustle of modern society, "the Beetle just pokes along in its own simple way, never in too much of a hurry to get anywhere."
In 1957, the front and rear windows were enlarged, giving the car the look that everyone is familiar with. During the next 40 years, engines were enlarged, transmission ratios altered, bumpers refined and electrical systems upgraded. But the basic body shell remained unchanged. (The Super Beetle, a slightly larger, upgraded version, was sold in 1971-74. Its redesigned front end made it look squashed in comparison with the standard Bug, and there is little collector demand for it.)
Among baby boomers, at least, who has not owned, driven or rode in a Bug at one time or another?
An off-white 1964 Beetle made a fine 40th birthday present this month for Betsy Killorin of Middlebury, Vt. "She's always wanted one, and now she's very happy," said her husband, Eric H. Killorin, the publisher of Mobilia, a monthly magazine for collectors of automotive paraphernalia. "It was an affordable way to satisfy a fantasy."
When he presented the car to his wife, their three children popped out of the sunroof exclaiming "Happy birthday!" Even better, when the car was later shown at a dinner party, "all the guests had a VW Bug story to share," Mr. Killorin said.
Beetle convertibles are especially prized today. They went into production in 1949, and were the last new Beetles sold in the United States in 1979. Examples in average condition are worth $8,000 to $12,000; nearly perfect soft tops bring as much as $15,000.
There is also a growing interest in Microbuses and Things, which shared the same air-cooled, rear-engine layout. The first generation of Microbuses, recognizable by their two-piece windshields, was produced from 1950 to 1967. When adapted for commercial use they were called Transporters and were available in a bewildering array of styles, including pickup trucks, ambulances, fire trucks and panel vans.
The most desirable Microbus is the 21- or 23-window people mover that served as hippie mass transit in the 60's. It is especially popular in Japan, where enthusiasts have paid more than $30,000 for vans restored to better-than-new condition.
There is also a steady market for the Karmann Ghia, a VW built for those who wanted a sporty look but didn't care to go very fast. The coupe was first sold in the United States in 1956, and the convertible in 1958, and both cars ceased production in 1974, victims of smog and safety regulations. Due to extra sound-deadening materials, Karmann Ghias were never as quick as standard Beetles of the same year. Figure on spending $4,000 to $6,000 for a coupe in very good condition, or $6,000 to $8,000 for a convertible.
In general, Karmann Ghias, like other classic VW's, have modestly appreciated in the last decade, and prices are likely to keep rising. In general, the older the VW the more desirable it is among collectors.
My own family has not been immune to Beetlemania. While on a family vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, our 17-year-old son, Eric, discovered that the Beetle was his fantasy car as well. After we picked up our rented Bug, he pronounced it "tight" -- which can be roughly translated as "groovy" -- and when he returned home he found a 1965 model in decent shape, with a few dents and dings, a loud exhaust and a CD player, for $650. He immediately joined the new generation of classic Beetle owners.
 More information on collecting Volkswagens is available from the Vintage VW Club of America, 5705 Gordon Drive, Harrisburg, Pa. 17112.

HEADLINE: The Greed-Fear Cycle

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In Peter Passell's Nov. 20 Economic Scene column, Robert Hormats, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs International, argues against "flat-out capital controls" despite the recent turmoil in global currency markets. I agree with his position, but he and his counterparts in the financial markets have brought the specter of additional regulation upon themselves by encouraging overinvestment abroad.
The level of greed required to cause the current crisis in Asia is profound. As always, however, fear is the check and balance for greed. Fear will drive Asian currencies down to the level where greed kicks in again to support them. 
 As for a bailout by the International Monetary Fund, the pattern was set during the Mexican currency crisis. Investors can now find comfort in the fact that the I.M.F. will cushion them from the consequences of their own greed. It appears that Mr. Hormats and his friends will be able to have their cake and eat it, too.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Hits a 4-Month Low As Dispute With Iraq Eases

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell 3.2 percent yesterday, to a four-month low, after Iraq appeared to retreat from a standoff with the United Nations over arms inspections, defusing a dispute that threatened to disrupt Middle East oil exports.
Crude oil for December delivery fell 64 cents, to $19.16 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest for a contract closest to delivery since July 22. Prices are down 26 percent so far this year. 
 "Iraq plays quite heavily in the market and now tension has eased," said Alan Struth, chief oil economist for Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Okla., who said oil prices could soon fall below $19 a barrel.
Iraq agreed to allow American members of a United Nations team searching for biological weapons and other arms back into the country after expelling them on Nov. 13. President Clinton said the United States would "wait and see" whether the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, actually allowed the inspectors unfettered access to the country.
Also pushing prices lower were expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting next week in Indonesia, would lift its production quota, currently 25.033 million barrels a day.
In other markets, natural gas and coffee also fell.
Natural gas fell 5.3 percent, to a two-month low, after a smaller-than-expected drop in inventories and forecasts for warm weather raised expectations for ample supplies in the months ahead.
American natural gas supplies declined 64 billion cubic feet, to 2.75 trillion cubic feet, last week, according to a report from the American Gas Association. The decline was less than the 70 billion cubic feet analysts expected and left inventories 5.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
Natural gas for December delivery fell 15.3 cents, to $2.708, for each 1,000 cubic feet, the lowest closing price since Aug. 18 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Coffee fell 3 percent as overseas growers, lured by this month's price rally, stepped up sales of freshly harvested beans.
Coffee for March delivery fell 4.65 cents, to $1.528 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: Islamic Militants Taunt Cairo, Demanding Break With Israel

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The militant Islamic Group, which has claimed responsibility for the strike that killed 58 foreign tourists in Luxor, issued a statement today taunting the Egyptian Government, which it has said was the real target of the attack.
The organization, the largest Islamic militant group in Egypt, said it might be willing to halt its military operations "for a while." But the group said it would do so only if the Government took steps that Egypt has repeatedly rejected, including halting its security crackdown against the militants and severing relations with Israel. 
 The Islamic Group has said its attack on the tourists was part of a strategy aimed at hitting economic targets in order to topple President Hosni Mubarak's Government and install an Islamic state.
As part of the price for a suspension of its attacks, the group demanded in today's statement the release of thousands of prisoners, including its spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who remains in an American jail after his conviction in connection with the plot to bomb the World Trade Center and other prominent targets.
In its statement, the Islamic Group also mocked what has so far been the Government's main response to the attack: the dismissal of the country's Interior Minister and most of the upper echelon of its security chiefs.
"A movement that leads a people cannot be defeated," the group said. "The policy of removing ministers and replacing them with others cannot solve the problem of the Egyptian regime."
The statement came as President Mubarak convened a second emergency Cabinet meeting to weigh Egypt's response to the attack, which has dealt a heavy blow to Eygpt's economically significant tourism industry.
Mamdouh Beltagui, Egypt's Tourism Minister, said in a telephone interview today that in addition to tougher security measures, the Cabinet had decided to employ new political and economic means to combat the threat posed by Islamic militants. Mr. Beltagui declined to be more specific, but he suggested that the Government would do more to address concerns exploited by the militants to gain popular support.
But three days after the attack in Hatshepsut Temple in which 68 people died, including six assailants, the main thrust of the Egyptian Government response appears aimed at shoring up security holes.
Mr. Beltagui said that security at tourist sites from all over the country would be "stepped up drastically," and that policemen at those places would be provided more sophisticated arms. To lessen the possibility of attacks on remote areas, Mr. Beltagui said the Government would no longer permit tour buses to travel south by road from the southern city of Aswan.
At least for now, Mr. Beltagui said visitors to the world-renown Temple of Ramses II in Abu Simbel, a three-hour drive from Aswan, will have to travel by air. He said the Egyptian Government will subsidize air tickets to insure that tourists are not unfairly burdened by the new security measure.
In the aftermath of the attack, the tone of most Egyptian Government statements has also been primarily defensive, along lines set by Mr. Mubarak when he visited the temple the next morning and pointed out that no place in the world is immune from acts of violence. "Sometimes I feel afraid going to London," Mr. Mubarak remarked.
Today, however, Mr. Beltagui emphasized a spirit of regret. "We are all still under a shock, and our respects go out to the victims and their families," he said. "We address to them our apologies for what has happened."

HEADLINE: Edwin Mansfield, 67, Scholar Of Economics and Technology

 BODY:
Edwin Mansfield, a leading scholar of the economics of technological change, died on Monday at his home in Wallingford, Pa. He was 67.
He died of cancer, according to a spokeswoman for W. W. Norton & Company, publisher of his economics textbooks, which were used by millions of college students. 
 Investing government money in corporate research and development benefited the public far more than the private companies involved, according to Dr. Mansfield's research. But the technological advances that produced the biggest economic gains since World War II, he found, were not high-tech innovations, but low-tech developments that made clothing more affordable.
A consultant to corporations, governments and agencies like the World Bank, Dr. Mansfield was director of the Center for Economics and Technology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught until last month. He joined the university as a professor of economics in 1964 after teaching at Carnegie-Mellon, Yale and Harvard.
Dr. Mansfield received a number of honors for his scholarship, including the Special Creativity Award from the National Science Foundation, as well as Fulbright and Ford Foundation fellowships. After receiving his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College, he earned a diploma from the Royal Statistical Society and a doctorate from Duke University.
He is survived by his wife, Lucile Howe Mansfield; a son, Edward, of Columbus, Ohio; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Gambier, Ohio, and a grandchild.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Securities Prices Lose Early Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities rose early yesterday, briefly sending the yield on the 30-year bond down to nearly 6 percent -- the lowest level in about two years -- before investors cashed in profits.
By late in the day the price of the 30-year bond had backed into negative territory, falling 11/32, to 100 31/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.06 percent, from 6.03 percent on Wednesday. 
 The late-day weakness came despite more signs suggesting that the economy may be slowing; generally, that would help the Treasury market because it would reduce the chances of higher inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. In one report, the Federal Reserve provided a weaker than expected survey of regional manufacturing conditions for October. In another, the Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by 20,000, to 333,000, or more than expected, a sign that the labor market may be loosening.
But the market's inability to push below a 6 percent yield on the long bond indicated that investors seem to want more conclusive evidence that the economy is slowing and that inflation remains contained before placing any further bets on price gains in Government securities.
"Its going to take a few tries at testing the 6 percent level before we can break through," said Jack Ablin, executive vice president and fixed-income department head at Barnett Capital Advisors Inc., Jacksonville, Fla. "We haven't been below this psychological number since the beginning of 1996. It's one thing to get to 6 percent on the long bond; it's another to break below, and, of course, quite another just to stay there."
Some early support for bonds came from investor relief when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in remarks to the Senate Budget Committee's Task Force on Social Security, refrained from making any comments that might have unnerved investors.
But the recent decline in interest rates has itself fueled the buying, traders said. Expecting redemptions of mortgage-backed securities because the underlying mortgages are being refinanced, managers are buying Treasury securities to fill potential openings in portfolios.
But contributing to the late-day slide were recurring fears in the market that the Japanese Government might sell Treasuries to raise funds for a bank bailout plan.
Still, Ken Logan, a managing analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the decline was caused largely by a desire to lock in recent profits and did not signal a shift in sentiment. "Selling was by no means a bearish indictment of the market," he said. "Market participants for the most part remain constructive and were likely making room for the upcoming Treasury supply."
Supply figures to play a big role in the market over the coming days, with sales of new two-year and five-year notes scheduled for next week. In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.69 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.77 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Soar as Turmoil in Asia Seems to Ease

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied again yesterday, gaining some momentum after the global financial and political turbulence that has rocked markets around the world over the last few weeks eased somewhat.
Even though stock markets in Asia continue to be troubled by an infectious economic and currency crisis, the Japanese Government said yesterday that it would attempt to bail out that nation's wobbly banking system, a move cheered by investors who had feared the world's second- largest economy was bracing for an even sharper decline. 
 That decision sent Japanese shares soaring, and touched off a worldwide rally bolstered further in the United States by growing evidence that the domestic economy remains robust, with few signs of inflationary pressure.
After financial markets rallied overnight in Europe, American shares opened sharply higher yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 101.87 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 7,826.61.
This week, the Dow has gained about 3.3 percent, pulling it well above the position held just prior to the 554-point drop on Oct. 27.
Broader indexes also strengthened. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.39 points, or 1.52 percent, to 958.98, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues climbed 5.01 points, or 1.16 percent, to 435.70.
The rally this week has been fueled by a growing optimism among investors that the turmoil overseas will not subvert the spectacular bull market. Investors might have also been soothed by indications that a conflict in the Persian Gulf might have been averted.
"We've had sort of a shifting of the international sands in the past few days," said Robert J. Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Kemper Funds in Chicago. "It doesn't look like we're heading into a major Persian Gulf war, and we had some good signs from Japan."
Indeed, the American markets have weathered the worldwide developments better than most. While stock markets in Britain, France and Germany have lost between 8 percent and 12 percent from their recent highs, the Dow is down just 5 percent.
And even while the Hong Kong stock market has plummeted nearly 40 percent in the last two months, and the Nikkei in Japan is down 21 percent, the S.& P. 500 is having one of its best years ever, up nearly 30 percent so far this year.
"Investors here have become more confident," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., a market strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "The growing concerns about Hong Kong and the Japanese banking system seem to be behind the market right now."
One propeller in the market recovery has been the surge in the prices of financial and technology shares, which had led the market sharply higher earlier in the year. Yesterday, for instance, the shares of semiconductor and financial services companies gained sharply.
Analysts said that yesterday's gains might have been tied to expectations of further consolidation after the First Union Corporation announced plans to merge with Corestates Financial on Tuesday, and Merrill Lynch said it would acquire Mercury Asset Management Group, a London-based investment house, on Wednesday.
Indeed, Philip J. Purcell, the chairman and chief executive at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company -- one of the year's biggest combinations -- said that the consolidation would continue well into the future, and create even bigger companies.
"We're about to go from $20 billion deals to $100 billion deals," Mr. Purcell told a meeting of the Securities Industry Association earlier this month.
Whether such expectations were behind the surge in brokerage shares is unclear, but almost every brokerage firm stock closed sharply higher, with shares of Lehman Brothers -- a rumored takeover target -- climbing 6 percent, or 2.8125, to close at 48 3/8.
Technology issues were also strong yesterday, regaining some of their momentum after a few tumultuous weeks. Shares of Texas Instruments, for example, rose 5 3/4, to 103 3/4, after it was upgraded by an analyst.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 24 gained yesterday including AT&T, extending a remarkable rally in what had been, for a time, the year's worst-performing Dow issue.
Since C. Michael Armstrong was selected to replace Robert E. Allen as the chief executive of AT&T on Oct. 20, shares in the company have risen about 20 percent. It closed up 1 3/4 yesterday at 54.5625.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE ARABS;
Arab Capitals Are Relieved: No Need No Pick Sides

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Arab leaders and diplomats expressed satisfaction and relief tonight over the agreement that appears to have averted the threat of a military confrontation between the United States and Iraq.
There remains little affection for Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President, among fellow Arab leaders. But with sentiment on the street running sharply against the United States, even Arab Governments that sided against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war had made plain that military action would have only complicated matters in an already troubled region. For that reason, reactions to the resolution of the standoff were akin to sighs of deep relief. 
 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said tonight that he believed that the American decision was motivated in large part by a recognition that "the Arab people were not ready" for American use of force.
"I saw the situation as very sensitive," he said in a television interview. "We were afraid that the United States and other forces were going to launch attacks on Iraq, and people were going to lose lives."
The reason for that concern is the view that American military strikes against Iraq would have presented Arab governments with a nightmarish choice. By standing with the United States, they would have risked a backlash among citizens who perceive American favoritism toward Israel in efforts to broker a Middle East peace and American callousness toward the suffering of the Iraqi people through seven years of economic sanctions.
Siding with Mr. Hussein would have allowed Arab leaders to play to the sympathies of people who themselves feel put upon by the West. But that would have meant suppressing concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as well as risking vital economic and military partnerships with Washington.
Arab officials said they believed that efforts by leaders like Mr. Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan to stave off a military threat had prevented a regional crisis and more.
"Saddam avoided a war in the region, and he made it known that sanctions cannot go on indefinitely," an Arab League official said in a telephone interview tonight. "He has made his issue the front-burner issue."
The official, who insisted on anonymity, said: "At the same time, Arab countries have not given him a blank check. The major Arab countries want him to understand his limitations and show some subtlety and flexibility, something for which he is not known."
Mr. Hussein's blatant aggression in ordering the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 made it possible for Egypt, Syria, Morocco and other Arab nations to justify sending troops into battle against Iraq. But those decisions were accepted grudgingly, and tempered by two ideas: that Iraq's ostracism would be short-lived, and that Arabs would be rewarded for their cooperation by American pressure on Israel to reach lasting settlements with its neighbors.
Increasingly, Arab frustration that neither goal is within reach has been expressed in complaints -- from ordinary people, politicians and the press -- that the United States has not kept up its side of the bargain.
"Those of us living in the area, friends of the United States and friends of the West, know that the slowing up of the peace process has meant that the American image is not what it might be," Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan said in a television interview at the beginning of the week. "So the use of force as a blunt instrument, I don't think would reflect well on the United States at the current time."
Arab leaders still do not disguise their exasperation with the Iraqi leader. In the interview tonight, Mr. Mubarak said that for now "he is not a threat for sure." But when asked why Mr. Hussein had ousted American weapons inspectors, the Egyptian President replied: "You should ask him. He started the war with Iran, then he started the war with Kuwait. It's a mess. I hope this will come to end."
Over the last three weeks, while American officials have warned that Iraq's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction was increasing daily, some Arab leaders were concerned that as long as the standoff continued, it would galvanize antipathy to the United States in a way that could have produced an anti-American explosion next month at an Islamic summit meeting in Teheran.
A Jordanian official who insisted on anonymity made clear that his Government would continue to press for a broader policy review. "The moral question that we have to ask ourselves is: How can you punish 18 million Iraqis when their leader is not suffering and does not care whether his people are being punished or not?"

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE POLICY;
A Shift to Diplomacy and Coexistence

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton came into office executing the policy toward Iraq that he had inherited: Keep Saddam Hussein cornered and respond to provocations with force.
But over time, Mr. Clinton's Administration adopted a much tougher line, plotting the Iraqi leader's ouster with covert operators on the ground in his country and planning ahead for an Iraq without him. 
 Now, in its handling of the most recent crisis with Iraq, the United States seems to be entering a new stage, unstated but apparent: Compromise and coexist, at least in the short run.
Mr. Clinton used force for the first time in his first two days as President, attacking an Iraqi position in January 1993 after Iraqi anti-aircraft guns fired at a Navy patrol. Later that year, after the United States uncovered what it said was an Iraqi plot to assassinate President George Bush, Mr. Clinton ordered the bombing of a military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad.
In 1994, after Iraq massed troops along the Kuwaiti border, the United States sent 40,000 troops, 770 military aircraft and about 30 warships to the region to force him to retreat.
Along the way, the Clinton Administration spent more than $100 million on a covert program to oust Mr. Hussein, run by the Central Intelligence Agency out of northern Iraq. Although the classified intelligence order calling for a change in the Iraqi regime is still in effect, the program itself was largely abandoned after American agents were forced to flee Iraq and many of their Iraqi supporters were killed by the Iraqi military last year.
The failure of the program and the meager U.S. military response after Mr. Hussein unleashed his forces in northern Iraq last year sparked criticism both on Capitol Hill and among military analysts within the Administration that the American strategy was no longer working.
In a Senate hearing, in fact, William Cohen, then a Republican Senator from Maine and now Mr. Clinton's Defense Secretary, challenged Administration claims that the American response had produced a victory; he pointed out that Mr. Hussein had boosted his standing with his people, splintered the American-led international coalition and consolidated his power in the north. Mr. Cohen even elicited from John Deutch, then the Director of Central Intelligence, an admission that Mr. Hussein had emerged from the military confrontation stronger.
As for American policy on international economic sanctions, whose main objective was to prevent Iraq from ever again amassing a strong military, it, too, has evolved over the years.
In an effort to "depersonalize" the conflict with Iraq, in early 1993 Mr. Clinton dropped Mr. Bush's demand that Mr. Hussein leave power as a condition for ending sanctions. What emerged was a policy stating that sanctions would be lifted if Mr. Hussein complied with all United Nations resolutions -- but adding that he was probably incapable of doing so.
Over time, Mr. Hussein complied with some resolutions, like the requirement that he recognize Kuwait's border. He also partially and grudgingly complied with the most important resolution, which required him to destroy all his weapons of mass destruction. Still, he kept the ability to produce chemical and biological weapons, setting the stage for the current crisis. Full compliance would mean he could freely sell his oil again.
But American policy toughened last March. At that time, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced that the United States would be willing to end Iraq's economic and political isolation -- but only after Mr. Hussein was out of power and not, as America's closest allies in Europe and the Middle East have said, after he complied with United Nations resolutions.
Now, although it may be only for tactical reasons, Administration officials are again saying that sanctions could be lifted if Mr. Hussein complies with United Nations resolutions.
As Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" last Sunday, "It's always been the United States Government position that if he complied with Resolution 687, which is the one we're talking about here, that principally deals with weapons of mass destruction, and the other key resolutions that come out of the Gulf War, then we're prepared to lift sanctions."

HEADLINE: For Citibank, A Problem Plum;
Mexican Deal Survives, Despite Fraud Case and Political Turmoil

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Julio de Quesada, the head of Citibank's operations in Mexico, did not know that the chairman of a Mexican bank he was negotiating to buy had installed a secret door and an underground tunnel in a palatial mansion in northern Mexico.
Mr. de Quesada never guessed that the Mexican banker, Jorge Lankenau Rocha, would one day admit to the police that he had used the tunnel to escape from 20 rifle-toting officers surrounding the estate. 
 But what he did discover just as he thought he was about to successfully conclude his pursuit of Mr. Lankenau's company, Banca Confia, was that Mexican prosecutors were accusing Mr. Lankenau of fraud and malfeasance in his financial empire amounting to $350 million.
Nevertheless, Citibank went ahead. Just days later, on Aug. 27, it agreed to pay $45 million for Confia and to inject up to $175 million in capital into the bank.
An obvious question is why Citibank, whose parent, Citicorp, has assets of more than $300 billion and tentacles in almost every country in the world, would want to link up with a Mexican bank whose chairman was in so much hot water. The answer is that it saw its chance to get into street-corner banking in Mexico, a longstanding goal, and to do it with generous help from the Mexican Government's extensive bailout of the country's ailing banking system. Mexico agreed to back up all of Confia's bad loans, a commitment that will cost at least $1 billion in public funds.
For all its troubles, which also include signs of mismanagement, Confia is a plum for Citibank. It has 200 branches throughout the country and a reputation for service that is rare in Mexico.
The acquisition also fits in with Citibank's desire to become banker to the world's rising middle class. That strategy, in which the most global bank in the United States often finds the greatest opportunity in the least appetizing circumstances, emerged yet again this week in Thailand when it was reported that Citibank was eyeing First Bangkok City Bank P.L.C.
Mr. Lankenau, who was put under house arrest in late August, slipped though his secret door and tunnel in October and spent four days on the loose before turning himself in. On Monday, he was finally jailed, facing 12 criminal charges, including racketeering.
"The only association I ever formed was a financial group designed to provide banking services to the public," Mr. Lankenau testified in court this week after pleading not guilty to the charges. "I insist that association had and continues to have a completely legal purpose."
Meanwhile, though, a constant barrage of news in Mexico about Mr. Lankenau's travails threw an unwelcome light on Citibank's takeover -- and has helped make it something of a referendum for many debt-weary Mexicans on the Government's efforts to jump-start failing banks and revive an entire industry.
While similar bank rescue operations have been carried out in the United States and Europe, the program here is losing popular support because many Mexicans believe it benefits few people other than local bankers like Mr. Lankenau and deep-pocketed foreigners like Citibank.
Confia's case hit a nerve because it was the first Mexican bank snapped up by a United States corporation after three others were bought by Canadian and Spanish banks. And it was not just any United States bank; it was Citibank, the financial conglomerate that Mexicans have loved and hated for decades.
The acquisition also coincided with a political sea change in Mexico last summer, when opposition legislators, many inspired by the protectionist ideas that prevailed a generation ago, took control of the lower house of the Congress for the first time in decades.
"This deal is absolutely incomprehensible to me," said Ricardo Garcia Sainz, a new opposition lawmaker who is chairman of the powerful budget committee. "I don't see why we have to spend $1 billion of the Mexican people's money to clean up a bank so we can sell it to foreigners."
Criticism also came from the generally pro-business National Action Party, or PAN, one of the biggest opposition group. "These shady bailouts are only awakening the mistrust of the people," said Rogelio Sada Zambrano, economic policy coordinator for the PAN delegation.
Even Mexican bankers grumbled, although they welcomed Citibank's injection of capital into the system.
"The foreign banks are buying very healthy Mexican banks at very good prices because they get them with no bad assets," said Antonio del Valle, the chairman of Bital, a Mexican bank, and president of the Mexican Bankers Association. Mr. Del Valle bought Bital from the Government at top rates during boom times in 1992.
Mexican banks became vulnerable to takeovers after being crippled by bad management, soaring interest rates and loss-plagued loan portfolios in the wake of the peso collapse of 1994. Of 18 banks the Government sold to Mexican buyers in the early 1990's, only eight remain in business and in Mexican hands today.
Most Mexican businessmen say they realize the Government had no choice but to make huge investments -- now estimated at $47.5 billion over three decades -- to preserve the financial system. They also understand that foreigners are helping to modernize the system. "The two things foreigners are bringing in, capital and administration, are not available right now in Mexico," said Jonathan Heath, an economist here.
Moreover, many Mexicans remember with gratitude how Citibank, the longest-operating foreign bank here, hung in even after the turbulent nationalization of Mexican banks in 1982.
But the authorities have had a hard time explaining the bailout to working people, many of whom were ambushed by exploding debts after the peso collapsed. And recently, Citibank's image here has been tarnished by Washington's investigation of Citibank's handling of the accounts of Raul Salinas de Gortari, the wayward brother of the exiled former President. Moreover, United States prosecutors recently charged that middlemen for a Mexican narcotics cartel had used Citibank accounts to launder huge proceeds.
In the drug case, the prosecutors are not directly investigating Citibank itself. In the case of Mr. Salinas's accounts, Citibank has said that it is fully cooperating with United States authorities and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Citibank is counting on Confia's popularity with Mexicans to help it ride out the storm. Confia paints its branches forest green to project a warm ecological feeling and appeal to young, up-and-coming Mexicans. Its style and emphasis on service are largely the legacy of Mr. Lankenau, a jovial entrepreneur who once took planeloads of clients on all-expenses-paid trips to see the Super Bowl.
"We found that the staff thinks in terms of satisfying the customer," Mr. de Quesada, a 20-year Citibank veteran, said in an interview in his penthouse office overlooking Mexico City's smog-enshrouded sprawl.
Mr. Lankenau made his name by earning big profits as a stockbroker in the 1980's. He bought Confia from the Government in 1991. But after the peso crisis, Confia's troubles deepened. By this year, Mexican banking commission officials said, it was clear Mr. Lankenau was short by $150 million of the capital the Government had ordered him to raise to save his bank.
In April, after more than a year of sporadic talks, Citibank made an offer that banking authorities liked. But when the bank's officials examined Confia's books, they found chaos. There were no clear standards for extending credit. Collateral for loans had been artificially inflated. Other loans had no documentation.
"He was a one-man show who did everything with a point of his finger," said one banker who examined Confia's accounts. Mr. Lankenau traveled around Mexico ordering his staff to open branches at sites he chose by whim, bankers said, and he frequently overruled his own weak system for evaluating potential loan customers.
As negotiations with Citibank neared a close, everybody involved could see that Mr. Lankenau was growing frantic about losing his investment in Confia, worth tens of millions of dollars.
Even so, Citibank officials underestimated his desperation. Just days before Citibank was scheduled to announce its purchase, dozens of clients of Mr. Lankenau's brokerage firm, part of his financial group that also includes Confia, sued him for fraud. Soon the Mexican Government brought 12 criminal charges that could put Mr. Lankenau in jail for five years or more.
Mexican officials said that Mr. Lankenau does not appear to have willfully embezzled his customers, but rather that he grew reckless in his maneuvers to keep Confia and other holdings.
According to Mexican bank regulators and attorneys for those who are suing him, Mr. Lankenau sought to gather capital through offshore companies in the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Uruguay. On his orders, the authorities say, brokers at his trading house offered clients investments in dollars paying 11 percent.
Documents released by Mexican Government investigators show that Mr. Lankenau quietly moved $120 million from the offshore companies into Confia in operations that Mexican regulators called illegal. He also invested $40 million in Atlanta real estate, the documents show.
Early this year the offshore companies ran dry and the brokerage firm stopped paying. Clients discovered that the notes they received were "worth as much as a napkin" in Mexico, according to Gerardo Jimenez Cantu, a lawyer representing some of the investors.
At one point, Citibank considered pulling out of the deal, Mr. de Quesada said, but decided to stay the course. Then, in a meeting that lasted until dawn on the very day Citibank signed the contract, Mexican banking officials declared they had decided to take over Confia for several months before turning it over to Citibank. They apparently will remain in charge until the deal is officially closed.
Citibank officials, hoping to calm the furor around Mr. Lankenau, started an ad campaign about the Confia takeover, with huge green billboards and banners that said, "Good News!" in Spanish. It was no use; Mr. Lankenau continued to dominate the headlines, first by eluding the police officers who surrounded his residence in a chic suburb of Monterrey on Oct. 25, then -- looking haggard and sprouting a bristly beard -- by turning himself in.
A deferential district court simply returned him to house arrest, causing so much public outrage over favoritism for the rich that Monterrey officials finally jailed him this week. When he entered prison, newspaper photographs showed that he was carrying fresh garlic cloves and quartz crystals in his suit pocket, talismans he apparently hoped would protect him from harm.
Mr. Lankenau has strenuously denied that he defrauded any of his investors and has blamed the Mexican Government's intervention in his financial group for tangling his finances and making it impossible for him to meet his obligations.
Mexican regulators and Citibank lawyers said there was little chance that Mr. Lankenau's legal troubles would have any effect on Citibank's purchase. Citibank, which is awaiting approval for the purchase from the Federal Reserve in Washington, said it would leave the bank under the Confia name and hoped to complete the deal this year.
Confia depositors, initially nervous, have been reassured by Citibank's arrival. Their deposits stabilized. Mr. de Quesada said he remained confident that Citibank's investment would be good for its business and for Mexico.
But Mexicans are clearly thinking twice about how far they want to go to be part of international corporations that minimize borders.
"Everybody has seen that globalization, whether they like it or not, is inevitable," said Mr. Heath, the economist. "Mexicans see foreign ownership of the banks as part of that process. At the same time there is a fatigue syndrome setting in. There is starting to be a backlash."

Charts: "Good on Paper, Bad for Its Image"
In August, when Citibank agreed to buy a high-profile Mexican bank from Jorge Lankenau Rocha, it looked like a good deal. It still may be, but in the months since the acquisition of Banca Confia was announced, it has become a major headache for Citibank and its Mexican director, Julio de Quesada, below. Mr. Lankenau, right, has been arrested and charged with fraud, and the deal has become a lightning rod for Mexican criticism of foreign corporate ownership.
 
February 1997 -- Faced with mounting financial problems, Mr Lankenau asks Citibank to buy his bank.

"Selling Mexico's Banks"
In 1991 and 1992, the Mexican Government sold 18 national banks to Mexican investors. At the time, it offered no special subsidies for buying the banks, but after the economy turned down in late 1994 and early 1995 because of the collapse of the peso, some of the banks had to be bailed out. Here is the status of each of them.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widens; Impact From Asia Fell

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit jumped to an eight-month high of $11.1 billion in September, the Government said today, as financial turmoil in Asia helped widen the gap. The deficit with China and Japan widened significantly.
United States exports, whose growth has sputtered since early spring, declined, while imports rose, fueled by the strength of the domestic economy. 
 For evidence that the Asian turmoil has begun to affect the American economy, not just securities markets, analysts noted that the combined trade deficit with South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong doubled to $2 billion in September.
"This may be the first sign of what's to come with that region," said Carol A. Stone, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
The September figures were especially revealing because American financial markets were not seriously buffeted by the Asian turmoil until October.
Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley sought to minimize the effect of Asian disruption on the American trade deficit, declaring that while his department had not yet analyzed the situation, he thought the impact would be "fairly minor." But he also stressed that there could be an indirect benefit from higher imports because they restrain the prices that domestic producers can charge.
"As a consumer you would enjoy the fact that the prices may be coming down on some of the imports," Mr. Daley said.
Other Administration officials, however, have been emphasizing the risks in the situation. Only last week Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin warned Japan against attempting to export its way out of its economic malaise, fearing a ballooning trade deficit with Asia. The deficit is always a sensitive issue in Congress, which recently refused to restore President Clinton's authority to negotiate trade accords that could not be amended.
The report of an increasingly wide trade deficit came as the President prepared for a two-day summit meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, early next week to regain momentum for lowering trade barriers. Asian financial disruption is to dominate the agenda, but Mr. Clinton, Mr. Daley and other officials are also to discuss trade issues with Japan and other Asian nations.
Currency devaluations and weak growth in Asia could mean further increases in the American trade deficit, analysts believe, as low prices for Asian exports spur sales to the United States while flat Asian economies mean poor markets for more expensive American exports.
September's deficit with the Pacific Rim's newly industrialized countries "probably represents a harbinger of future trade trends," said Joel L. Naroff, economist at the First Union Bank in Philadelphia.
Mr. Daley, after citing such positive elements in today's report as a 25 percent surge in exports to Mexico this year, once again took the occasion to complain about China and Japan, with whom he said the trade situation "remains problematic."
He referred to barriers to trade and investment that have contributed to a record $5.5 billion deficit with China in September, up from $5.2 billion, and to a $5.1 billion deficit with Japan, up from $4.5 billion.
Mr. Daley acknowledged that these latest import surges included large volumes of holiday-related toys, decorations and electronic equipment -- figures for trade with particular countries are not adjusted for recurring seasonal patterns. He also insisted that Asian nations needed to buy more American exports. Secretary Daley announced that the first task he had set for his newly confirmed Under Secretary for International Trade, David Aaron, was to conduct a review of how trading partners were complying with agreements the United States had negotiated and to study the effectiveness of the Commerce Department's year-old Compliance Center.
The September trade report showed that imports rose 1.2 percent from the previous month, to a new peak of $89.07 billion, mainly reflecting increases in apparel, diamonds, art work and industrial supplies.
Exports fell seven-tenths of 1 percent from August, to $78 billion, still a high total but below the levels early this year. Since March, exports have fallen in four of the six months that have been reported.
In publishing the September trade results, the deficit for August was revised sharply lower, to $9.5 billion from $10.4 billion.
For the first nine months, the United States deficit was $86.5 billion, 1.9 percent above the 1996 pace, which resulted in an eight-year high for the full year.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE IMPLICATIONS;
A Teetering Coalition

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 20

 BODY:
With Iraq's agreement to let all United Nations weapons inspectors return, the immediate crisis appears to have ended without use of military force, and the United States is declaring a victory for a united Security Council and for diplomacy.
American officials argue that Saddam Hussein had to back down and that they preserved the authority of the United Nations. They also insist that the United States gave Iraq nothing concrete in return -- at least for now. 
 But Mr. Hussein has lost nothing in this confrontation and may indeed have gained some ground. While the inspectors will resume their work, Mr. Hussein had three weeks to further hide his own work on weapons of mass destruction. And the American position of no deals with Mr. Hussein, no quick removal of United Nations inspectors and no changes in the sanctions is in greater jeopardy today than at any time since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke proudly of maintaining the unity of the Security Council and most of the coalition that the United States assembled against Iraq after the Gulf War.
But the future of that coalition looks increasingly shaky. The United States will find itself under more pressure from Russia, France and Arab states to bring the seven-year-old program of sanctions to a faster end.
Despite all the chest thumping by the American military, United States officials also understand that many of their allies opposed the use of military force. Although Washington insists that it did not and will not negotiate directly with Mr. Hussein, it came very close, using the agency of the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, instead.
What remains unclear is just what Mr. Primakov told Mr. Hussein that Russia would do, and what Mr. Hussein thinks he has been promised.
In the Russian-Iraqi statement published today in Moscow, the Russians promised Mr. Hussein that they would be an even more forceful advocate for the Iraqi demands to end weapons inspections and lift economic sanctions.
"Russia, for its part, will energetically promote the speedy lifting of sanctions against Iraq on the basis of its compliance with the corresponding U.N. Security Council resolutions," the statement said. "With this in mind, steps will be taken to increase the effectiveness of the Special Commission's activity on the basis of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and security."
While the Americans define "effectiveness" as better work in ferreting out Mr. Hussein's secrets, the Russians appear to define it in terms of speed.
The French Foreign Ministry, for its part, on Wednesday called for Iraq to be shown a "light at the end of the tunnel" on sanctions, once Mr. Hussein reversed himself. "There is a chronology that has to be respected," Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said today. But clearly the French and Russian clocks run at a speed different from Washington's.
The solidarity that Ms. Albright maintained and praised was easier to sustain when Iraq blatantly defied the Security Council by expelling inspectors. But this unity will not last on issues that require judgment calls, such as how much money Iraq should be able to receive from its oil, what it should be able to buy, how long the United Nations inspectors should stay and how much good behavior on Mr. Hussein's part is enough to lift the sanctions on Iraq.
That is perhaps the most important benefit of Mr. Hussein's defiance. It will not happen immediately, but he has managed to bring to the fore the essential disagreement among the great powers, and between the United States and a large part of the Arab world, about what should happen in the future. Those disagreements are bound to increase over time.
The United States retains its veto power in the Security Council. But Washington knows the costs of using its veto against the will of the majority, including some of its closest allies.
To American officials facing the prospect of diplomatic isolation, letting Russia make vague promises that the United States need not affirm and can veto later seemed a reasonable trade-off to make, as was the prospect of an expanded United Nations inspections effort to promote "efficiency" that also may just slightly reduce the percentage of Americans involved, but not their number.
And if Washington is willing to discuss allowing Iraq to sell more of its oil to pay for humanitarian and civil needs, now that Iraq is presumably complying with the sanctions again, this is not by any means an easing of sanctions, American officials argue. Instead, they insist, such humanitarian aid allows the rest of the world to salve its conscience about ordinary Iraqis and accept the harsh overall sanctions even longer.
Mr. Primakov also scored a victory in his quest to restore Russia as a player in Middle East policy. Russia remains a sponsor -- with the United States -- of the Middle East peace effort and is now better able to claim its place at the table. Mr. Primakov, who is an Arabic-speaking expert on the Middle East, has also put Washington in his debt, even though senior American officials who still do not trust him were careful not to praise him too highly today, saying simply that the Russian role was "helpful."
Mr. Primakov is likely to argue that the Russian role was critical, at least to an apparently quick ending of this crisis, and was exercised on the world's behalf, not merely Moscow's.
But in some ways his role was also easy. He could argue to the Iraqis that they were only hurting themselves by expelling the inspectors, because they could not hope for a lifting of the sanctions while they blocked their work. And Mr. Primakov could promise to fight even harder for the Iraqi contention that the United States is itself playing with Security Council language to find justifications to persecute Mr. Hussein until he is overthrown.
Mr. Hussein may have received another benefit. If the crisis was engendered by the United Nations inspectors coming too close to his biological and chemical weapons work -- and not by Security Council splits -- then he may have preserved the deterrent that he hopes will keep Iran at bay and Iraq's reputation high.
Whether he has succeeded in this aim, if indeed he had it, is almost immaterial, as one senior American official admitted. "Deterrence is about perceptions," he said, "not reality."
Asked if the same might be true of assertions of diplomatic victories and defeats, he smiled, shrugged and walked away.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON SAYS U.S. WILL WAIT AND SEE AS IRAQIS BACK OFF

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
With a "wait and see" edge of wariness, President Clinton welcomed Saddam Hussein's decision today to back down and allow United Nations inspectors to resume their search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
"Saddam Hussein must comply unconditionally with the will of the international community," Mr. Clinton declared, as the Administration emphasized that its full Persian Gulf military buildup would proceed as previously announced in the three-week-long crisis. 
 "In the coming days we will wait and see whether he does, in fact, comply," Mr. Clinton said in brief, cautious remarks before a White House ecumenical breakfast.
In Baghdad, the state radio issued a statement after a meeting led by President Hussein, announcing, "Iraq has accepted the return of United Nations Special Commission inspectors, including Americans."
United Nations officials said today that a team of weapons inspectors will return to Iraq on Friday; they are to begin work again on Saturday. The team is to comprise about 77 people, the normal size for such a group, and will include Americans, although officials have not specified how many.
It was Iraq's sudden barring of Americans on the United Nations inspection teams that started the crisis and fed fears of another military showdown with Mr. Hussein.
The break in the standoff was announced after an emergency conference at 2 A.M. today in Geneva of representatives of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- France, China, Britain, Russia and the United States. The meeting was called hastily after negotiations between Baghdad and Moscow.
After long, inconclusive hours, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright emerged to cautiously announce Mr. Hussein's "reversed course."
The meeting, while easing global tensions, was immediately followed by questions whether Iraq might have won some secret concession or understanding through Mr. Hussein's gambit of openly challenging the terms of his defeat in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
"There is absolutely no understanding," Samuel Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, insisted at a briefing. "There's no deal. There's no concessions."
His sentiments echoed those of James P. Rubin, Ms. Albright's spokesman, who summarized the Administration's view of the outcome by saying, "We protected all our rights and gave away nothing."
Mr. Hussein has sought to ease the United Nations' crippling economic sanctions and to speed an end to the on-site weapons inspections that began after Iraq's defeat in the war that began with Mr. Hussein's invasion of neighboring Kuwait in 1990.
Officials have expressed concern that the Iraqis exploited the last three weeks of foiled weapons inspections to hide evidence, destroy monitoring equipment and produce new arms or toxins.
Another issue is that the new team will have no better access than previous teams to certain secret sites, among them the presidential palace, according to Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative to the United Nations.
Administration officials took care today to hail only a "step in the right direction," rather than a full resolution, pointing to the American ships and warplanes undeterred in their mission to take up positions in the Persian Gulf area.
"This is not over," Mr. Berger said. "We have to maintain the two-pronged strategy we've been pursuing."
Mr. Clinton was equally guarded in reacting to the Hussein announcement. "The United States must remain and will remain resolute in our determination to prevent him from threatening his neighbors of the world with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons," he said.
This threat includes stores of the deadly nerve agent VX and of botulinus and anthrax toxins, according to United Nations inspectors who were pulled out of Iraq last week after the team's American specialists were expelled.
France and Russia, which have been holding heavy Iraqi debts through the long economic blockade, maintained support for the sanctions and inspections but have taken their own approaches to the current crisis.
In France, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine was openly critical of the United States in a radio interview today, contending that Washington had left Mr. Hussein with the impression that "there would never be a way out of the tunnel," even if he got rid of all his weapons programs.
Another French diplomat, speaking anonymously, suggested that "the Americans bent a little" to reassure the Iraqi President.
In Baghdad, some officials said Mr. Hussein had agreed to allow inspectors to return only if Russia would guarantee an easing of sanctions and inspection procedures, possibly by changing the makeup of the inspection teams or by limiting U-2 surveillance flights over Iraq.
But Mr. Berger firmly denied this, noting that while Russia was free to speak up for Iraq at the United Nations, "we have a veto on the Security Council." He denied that Mr. Hussein had achieved a success of sorts in stirring world anxiety and underlining Western diplomatic differences.
"I have a hard time computing that as anything except a setback for him," Mr. Berger declared, adding that the United Nations had reaffirmed "the most pervasive sanctions regime in the history of mankind."
Through the day, American officials laced their expressions of relief with skepticism. They emphasized the Pentagon's orders to proceed full speed ahead to the gulf.
The dispatched armada includes 2 aircraft carriers and about 300 warplanes, including the latest F-117A Stealth fighters, plus a score of warships and defense units bristling with Patriot missile batteries, and 18,000 personnel.
Six B-52 bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana for Diego Garcia, the British base in the Indian Ocean. The Pentagon said its "air expeditionary force," a special 32-plane combat unit previously announced as being on standby, had been ordered to proceed to the region even before diplomatic progress was clear.
Mr. Clinton tracked the Geneva negotiations into the night, according to the White House. Twice, he slipped out of a screening of the film "Welcome to Sarajevo" at the residence to check with Mr. Berger on the news from Geneva. Later, he went to Mr. Berger's office and waited for word from the meeting, finally thanking Secretary Albright for the agreement that emerged.
The President stayed beyond midnight with security specialists, conferring on the steps needed to get United Nations inspectors back to their tasks, according to Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. Mr. Clinton also sought to assure that "our force posture in the region is consistent with what we think the reality of future behavior will be by the Government of Iraq," Mr. McCurry said.
The one possibility Mr. Berger mentioned -- an increase in the program that allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to purchase food and medicine -- might not be opposed by the Administration "at some point," he said. "Let me say that never even came up last night in the meeting in Geneva," he added.
Far from concessions, Mr. Berger emphasized continuing wariness at the White House in the face of Mr. Hussein's impetuous stratagems. "Skepticism is not a bad way to proceed through a matter like this," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Panel on Race Relations Is Itself Biased, Gingrich Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich today sharply criticized President Clinton's race relations advisory board, asserting that the panel did not seek the views of conservatives or foes of affirmative action to help it explore the means to bring about better race relations.
"Americans of all racial backgrounds believe that true diversity must include a wide array of opinions," he wrote. "The racial and gender obsessive focus that came out of the 1960's is outdated as we stand on the edge of a new millennium." 
 The Speaker's comments came in response to a meeting of the President's advisory board on race, at which the topic was the value of having a diverse faculty and student body and how to promote that. No opponents of affirmative action were invited to address the board.
Noting that Mr. Clinton had said he created the board to help him promote a dialogue on racial issues, Mr. Gingrich wrote: "When did your call for a dialogue become a monologue? Is your panel interested in educating our citizens -- or indoctrinating them?"
Mr. Gingrich's comments angered White House officials, who noted that the board's chairman, the historian John Hope Franklin, had written Mr. Gingrich on July 7, seeking his advice and suggestions on how the panel could carry out its job. The Speaker never responded, they said.
"If the Speaker now wants to get involved with the race initiative, his views will be welcome," said Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman. "Unfortunately, to date he has been reluctant to become involved."
But Mr. Gingrich's office produced a copy of a letter dated Sept. 29 that it said was sent to all panel members, in which Mr. Gingrich outlined a 10-point program he said would help "close the racial divide."
Mr. Lockhart said the White House has been working for several weeks on setting up a meeting with conservative scholars and opponents of affirmative action to elicit their views on how to improve race relations.
But a check with some noted conservatives active in the race relations area and people opposed to affirmative action turned up none who said they had been contacted by the White House.
Among those contacted who said they were mystified by reports of the White House reaching out to conservatives were William H. Mellor, President of the Institute for Justice; Robert Woodson, President of National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise; Gwen Daye Richardson, editor of Headway Magazine; Stephen and Abigail Thernstrom, writers of "America in Black and White: One Nation Indivisible," and Glen C. Loury, an economics professor at Boston University.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Issues Call for Action To Rescue Social Security System

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, urged Congress today to act quickly to fix the looming problems in Social Security, saying the political and economic difficulties of addressing the impending shortage in the program's financing would only grow with time.
Mr. Greenspan, who was chairman of a national commission on Social Security in the early 1980's and has long used his platform at the Federal Reserve to warn of the problem's urgency, said the solutions to the retirement system's financial difficulties would not be painless, but were within reach. 
 "More important," Mr. Greenspan said, "most entail changes that are less unsettling if they are enacted soon, even if their effects are significantly delayed, rather than waiting five or 10 years or longer for legislation."
"We owe it to those who will retire after the turn of the century to be given sufficient advance notice to make what alterations in retirement planning may be required," he said. "If we procrastinate too long, the adjustments could be truly wrenching."
Mr. Greenspan's statements, to the lone Senator at a hearing called by the Senate Budget Committee's Social Security Task Force, came as Congress and the Clinton Administration are beginning to grapple with the problems of the pension program. Social Security will start running out of money in the decades after the baby boom generation begins reaching retirement age in 2010.
The task of the White House and Republican leaders will be made easier by projections that the Government will begin running budget surpluses in the next few years. Both parties are exploring how the surpluses could be used to shore up the system or to help create a new one that would give people more responsibility for retirement savings.
Yet neither the White House nor the Republican leadership has developed a plan or even a timetable for dealing with the issue, which is among the most politically sensitive facing either party and is certain to draw pressure from constituencies as diverse as the elderly and Wall Street.
Among the questions being debated is whether Washington should address Social Security before the next Presidential election in 2000 and whether a Social Security overhaul will have to wait until after Congress deals with similar problems afflicting the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly.
Mr. Greenspan said it would be a mistake to use any budget surplus to increase Government spending. Although he suggested that surpluses alone would probably not be enough to restore the retirement system's health, he offered no new solutions.
Instead, with Congress out of session, he conducted what amounted to a tutorial for Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is the chairman of the task force.

HEADLINE: Spate of Skinhead Violence Catches Denver by Surprise

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The emergency call about a prowler seemed normal enough. But when a Denver police officer searched the working-class neighborhood this morning, a young white man with short cropped hair popped up from behind a bush and emptied an automatic pistol at him.
The bullets missed their target, but the ambush echoed as the latest of a series of attacks by racist skinheads that belie Denver's modern image of tolerance and affluence. 
 Two weeks ago, a 20-mile car chase ended in a blaze of gunfire and the arrest of a young man who proudly sported the tattoo "God of Hate." Last week, another car chase, this one stretching 30 miles, ended with the killing of a Denver officer and the suicide of a skinhead.
Tuesday night, two white men taunted a West African at a downtown bus stop and then shot him to death. A few hours later, at the station where the policeman who was killed last week had worked, someone dropped off a dead pig. The carcass was daubed with the drawing of a police badge and "Vanderjagt," the name of the dead policeman.
"The pig's head said that they are ready to go to war with the police," said Carl Raschke, a University of Denver religion professor who has studied white supremacist groups here and nationwide. "This is the worst outbreak of skinhead violence that has happened anywhere. Nowhere has there been such a direct challenge to the police."
The crude racial hatred flies in the face of Denver's image of an open-minded city where a white majority population has twice elected Wellington Webb, a black man, as mayor. The violence flies in the face of Denver's world image as a city proud of its $5 billion international airport and of its smooth handling of a summit of world leaders last June.
But Denver's unexpected outbreak of violence, most of it by young, white skinheads, is part of a national trend in which skinheads groups are growing while Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups decline, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group based in Alabama that tracks hate groups nationwide.
According to the center, the number of Klan and neo-Nazi groups dropped by one-quarter from 1995 to 1996, hitting 140 last year.
"As the economy goes better for most people, you get less of this scapegoating rage," Mark Potok, a Center spokesman, said.
At the same time, the number of organized skinhead groups increased by 23 percent, hitting 37 in 1996. The difference seems to be demographic. The Klan often attracts a more middle-aged group. The skinheads draw on young people, often teen-agers facing job markets without high school diplomas.
The largest city of the Rocky Mountain West, modern Denver has occasionally seen eruptions of white supremacist activity.
In 1984, Alan Berg, a radio talk show host, was shot to death outside his home here. Three years later, two men were convicted of murder in the case. Members of a neo-Nazi gang, the Order of the Silent Brotherhood, the men apparently targeted Mr. Berg because he was Jewish.
Through the early 1990's, rallies on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday regularly drew counterrallies by skinheads and Klansmen.
But, in general, reported hate incidents tapered off in Colorado through the 1990's.
The number of victims of hate crimes dropped 14 percent from 1994 to 1996, according to statistics from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Anti-Semitic incidents dropped by three-quarters during the 1990's, falling to 17 last year, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
"Police around Denver cracked down very hard on skinhead activity in the early 1990's," Mr. Potok said. "Last year, we didn't document the existence of any organized skinhead groups in Colorado at all."
The new outbreak started on Nov. 6, when two young men barricaded themselves in a house overnight, leading to a police siege. Escaping in a car the next morning, they traded dozens of shots with the police before surrendering unharmed.
One of the men, Jerald Dean Allen, sported such tattoos as "100% hate" and "God of Hate." "I believe in white pride," Mr. Allen told The Rocky Mountain News from jail. "I'm fighting for my own cause."
One week later, Matthaeus Jaehnig, led police on another car chase. According to the police, his girlfriend drove part of the way, while he fired at pursuers with an automatic rifle. Cornered, he shot to death a police officer, Bruce Vanderjagt, then committed suicide with the officer's handgun.
A longtime member of the Denver Skins, a loosely knit group of young men, Mr. Jaehnig, 25, had been arrested seven times since he dropped out of high school. One arrest was for ordering his dogs, a pit bull and a Rottweiler, to attack a police officer. The officer was Mr. Vanderjagt.
For all his arrests, Mr. Jaehnig spent about 30 days in jail. His affluent family routinely paid his bail and legal fees. Mr. Jaehnig grew up in a large house in a comfortable neighborhood and his father was a founder of the Denver Waldorf School, a school that teaches racial tolerance.
Dozens of skinheads attended Mr. Jaehnig's funeral. Death threats were telephoned to the condolence line for the dead police officer.
Late Tuesday night, two young white men approached Oumar Dia, a 38-year-old black immigrant from Mauritania who waiting for a bus after working his shift as a housekeeper at the Hyatt Regency Denver. They made fun of his hat, throwing it into the street. Then the two shot him twice, killing him on the spot.
When another person at the bus stop, Jeannie VanVelkinburgh, sought to intervene, the men shot her, also. Ms. VanVelkinburgh, a single mother of two boys, is now paralyzed from the waist down.
This afternoon, Bruce Ritter, the Denver District Attorney, announced that Nathan Thill, 19, was being held for investigation of first-degree murder. Arrested on outstanding traffic warrants, Mr. Thill appeared in court today, wearing a black leather jacket, his hair shaved to his skin.

HEADLINE: 29 NATIONS AGREE TO OUTLAW BRIBING FOREIGN OFFICIALS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 20

 BODY:
After years of lobbying by the United States, the world's industrialized countries formally agreed today to a treaty that would outlaw the practice of bribing foreign government officials.
The treaty, negotiated in Paris by 29 countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, marks a victory for the United States, which outlawed foreign bribery 20 years ago but until now had never persuaded European and Japanese governments to follow suit. 
 American companies have complained for years that they lose billions of dollars in contracts every year to rivals that bribe their way to success overseas. Until recently, most other industrial countries had discreetly balked at outlawing foreign bribery -- indeed some had even permitted corporations to take a tax deduction for it -- arguing that corrupt government officials were an unsavory but unavoidable fixture of doing international business.
While outlawing bribery might seem as straightforward as being against sin, this treaty was only reached after long and prickly negotiations over the legal niceties of a black art. Last May, the O.E.C.D. countries agreed in principle to a bribery ban. Since then the countries have been defining precisely what kind of government officials should be covered.
The treaty's central provisions would, for the first time, force countries to prosecute corporations for paying bribes to foreign government officials in the same way that bribery of their own officials is illegal.
It would also outlaw most payments to members of parliament, something that Germany, Austria and Finland had resisted because it went beyond the laws in their own countries. In Germany, for example, it is permissible to make payments to Members of Parliament so long as the money is not directly tied to a vote.
Advocates of tough anti-bribery measures cautioned that the new treaty could prove a disappointment. For one thing, it would not outlaw most payments to political party leaders, even though party politicians are often central decision makers about government policy or simply proxies for actual government officials.
The treaty is also narrower than the United States had originally proposed when negotiations got under way more than a year ago. From the start, the United States wanted governments to embrace a detailed set of practical recommendations that would make bribery more difficult to disguise on corporate books and more costly if discovered. The treaty hammered out tonight focuses on defining crimes while merely alluding to an array of measures that governments may "consider" in policing bribery. One possibility is that a company found guilty of paying a bribe might be excluded from bidding on contracts awarded by its own government.
"Everyone should recognize that this is only one tool in a whole tool kit of measures to deal with corruption," said Peter Eigen, chairman of Transparency International, a nonprofit organization in Berlin that is supported by multinational corporations and has lobbied for the strictest possible measures. "We are afraid that countries will say they have agreed to the criminal measures and then leave the matter at that," Mr. Eigen said.
Nevertheless, even skeptics said the treaty marked an important breakthrough. Once ratified by individual governments, it would become a legally binding agreement. However, there was still disagreement tonight over how many countries would have to approve the treaty before it went into effect. The nations have agreed to present it to their parliaments for a vote by next April and hope to change their laws so that it would be effective by the end of 1998.
"This is the most important anti-corruption initiative yet that is directed at the supply side of corruption," said Fritz Heiman, counselor to the General Electric Company and head of Transparency International's American chapter. He said the treaty today grew out of America's experience with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which was passed in 1977.
In the early years after the law was enacted, several dozen American companies were charged with violating the anti-bribery law but no chief executive has been convicted.
Critics say the Federal Government has raised relatively few cases, though as recently as 1995 the Lockheed Corporation pleaded guilty to bribing an Egyptian legislator to win a $79 million sale of transport plans. Lockheed agreed to pay a $24.8 million penalty.
With more and more American corporations having expanded into developing markets in Asia, where bribes are common, the Justice Department said it had beefed up its investigations; legal experts contend that the Government has not been that aggressive lately. In fact, the Justice Department has issued interpretations of the law that have given business more leeway in doing business in foreign countries even with family members of heads of state.
For their part, business executives say the treaty agreed to today reflects growing support for anti-bribery initiatives among corporations in Europe and Japan that have openly opposed the idea. Some of Europe's leading industrial corporations, including a few that have been embroiled in recent allegations of bribery, have spoken out in favor of tougher measures and on the increasingly corrosive effect of corruption.
Some companies have been acutely embarrassed by allegations of serious bribery. Last year, five companies, including Siemens A.G. of Germany, were accused of paying millions of dollars to a Government official in Singapore to win a big contract to supply telecommunications equipment. Singapore prohibited all five companies from doing business with its Government.
But the O.E.C.D. negotiations over the last three days were nonetheless arduous, boiling down to three main questions. First, to what extent are executives at state-owned or state-controlled companies considered "public officials?" The issue was crucial, because many of the biggest contracts involve sales to state-controlled telephone companies, airlines, railroads and utilities.
American negotiators successfully argued that the bribery ban should include any company in which a government owns more than 50 percent of the stock. But European negotiators argued that a public official should also be engaged in some kind of "public function." According to American officials, who spoke tonight on condition of anonymity, the treaty defines these "para-statal" companies primarily on the basis of whether a government either owns or effectively controls the organization.
The second issue was whether the treaty should cover elected legislators or members of parliament. Most countries agreed that legislators should be covered. But Germany, Austria and Finland objected, arguing that the treaty would conflict with the way parliamentarians are treated within their own countries. American officials said tonight that the treaty now clearly included members of parliament.
But the United States failed to get its way on the question of whether a treaty should cover payments to political parties. Most countries refuse to support the American demand, arguing that the line between legal political contributions and illegal bribery is too murky. American business executives acknowledged, moreover, that the issue was hardly clear in the United States, where Washington has itself been engulfed in allegations about huge "soft money" contributions to the Democratic and Republican parties.
Another question that remains unclear is whether countries will in fact prohibit corporations from writing off bribes as tax-deductible expenses, as is now permitted in many countries. Last May, members of the O.E.C.D. pledged to stop that practice, but a number of countries insisted on waiting until the new treaty actually defined foreign bribes as a crime.
The new treaty is supposed to settle lingering questions about the tax deductibility of bribes, but it may not. Mr. Eigen, as well as some American executives, said that companies might only be blocked from payments that were identified and prosecuted as criminal bribes. If companies simply account for bribes as "commissions" or "consulting fees," and auditors do not investigate the payments more closely, they could skirt the rules.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Tricky Course on Bailout Calls for Double Reverse

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
First he flipped, then he flopped, then he flipped again.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan instructed the ruling Liberal Democratic Party today to devise a plan for using public funds to bail out Japan's shaky banking system. 
 His instructions were a 180-degree reversal of his position Wednesday, which in turn was a reversal of a comment he made on Tuesday. At that time, he indicated support for using taxpayer money to help the banks unload the trillions of yen in bad debts that they have carried since the bubble in the Japanese economy burst in the early 1990's.
"It's exactly what I would have hoped he would have done," Alicia Ogawa, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, said of the Prime Minister's latest position. "Maybe it's finally the beginning of the end."
Most analysts have not put a precise price tag on a bailout of a banking system that includes some of the world's largest financial institutions. The Government estimates that the banks are saddled with bad debt worth some 20 trillion yen, or about $157 billion, but analysts believe the number is higher because many institutions do not reflect the full extent of the problems on their books.
The bailout could cost the Government from a fourth to a third of the amount of the bad debt, once bank assets are sold off, one analyst estimated.
Mr. Hashimoto's third change of heart in as many days came after a chat he had this morning with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who prodded him to find a way to inject public funds into the banking system before a meeting with President Clinton scheduled for this weekend at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation talks in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Earlier this week, Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, encouraged the Japanese Government to consider using public funds to rid the banking system of its problems, stressing Japan's need to be a leader in an Asian financial system that has suddenly gone awry.
"It's not that the Asian problems are Japan's responsibility, but since it's happening in this neighborhood, people, say in New York, are probably asking 'what is Japan doing?' " Mr. Miyazawa said in a brief interview at his office today. "So it's better that Mr. Hashimoto should have something explicit to say in Vancouver."
Additionally, as currency values have crumbled across Asia this fall, the Japanese banks' exposure in the region has come under intense scrutiny, and now even the most sound institutions here are paying a premium to borrow short term.
The banks have been slow to acknowledge problem loans that have been on their books since the real estate bubble burst as the 1990's began. Add the recent fall in Hong Kong property values, the devaluation of the Thai baht and the bankruptcy of several major South Korean corporations, and suddenly the problems seem overwhelming.
"The domestic bad-debt problem alone, they could probably grow their way out of," said Ronald Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company here. "But every day, there's another problem."
The rescue plan that Mr. Miyazawa sketched out includes elements of the system that Washington used in the late 1980's to bail out the savings and loan industry through the Resolution Trust Corporation. The Government would help troubled banks dispose of their problem debts, close the weakest banks and inject capital into those banks best positioned to regain their footing.
If the plan is adopted, Tokyo would create a fund that would issue bonds and guarantee them against default, using some of the vast pool of money that sits in Japan's postal savings system. The money raised by selling the bonds would be used to protect depositors whose banks would be shut down. It would also be used to buy preferred shares or subordinated debt of banks that need capital but are basically sound or too big to fail.
Over time, the fund would produce the money to pay back the bonds by selling the assets of failed banks. Mr. Miyazawa said that the fund, which would likely be set up inside the Deposit Insurance Corporation, would probably have a five-year life span, at the end of which the nation's banking problems would be resolved.
The rescue plan would save the biggest and best banks, but it would also open them to new types of competition at a time when the Government is already demanding that they raise their capital levels, carry their assets at market prices and adopt more rigorous accounting standards by next April.
Mr. Miyazawa's involvement in the rescue plan was unusual. Former prime ministers typically do not take a leading public role in sensitive debates. But using him to speak bluntly about the depth of the banking problems and the dire necessity of addressing them was seen as one of the most politically astute moves by an administration that has become known for its blunders.
"He has turned the public debate away from saving fat-cat bankers and toward the condition of the economy," Ms. Ogawa of Salomon said of Mr. Miyazawa. "He's got nothing to lose."
The use of public funds to bail out the banks is political dynamite here, where taxpayers have not forgotten the Government's 685 billion yen bailout of housing lenders just two years ago. That was perceived as throwing good money after bad for political expediency, and brought crowds of protesters to the sidewalks around the Ministry of Finance.
Unlike Mr. Hashimoto, whose public standing is at a low, Mr. Miyazawa, a former Ministry of Finance bureaucrat, has the experience and stature to speak plainly about the banking system's problems and why the public must step up to solve them.
It is going to be an expensive and painful task, however. For one thing, the Deposit Insurance Corporation is underfinanced. Analysts estimate that it will spend more to shutter the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, which failed on Monday, than the 460 billion yen the corporation will take in this year in premiums.
The Government will probably raise premiums and issue bonds to strengthen its deposit insurance program.
David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs (Japan) Ltd., published a report Wednesday estimating that the Government would have to inject 5.5 trillion yen, or about $43 billion, into the banking system by March 1999 if the banks wrote off all their nonperforming loans, marked down the value of their stock portfolios to accurately reflect market prices and securitized as many assets as possible to offset the cost to the public.
In the worst case, Mr. Atkinson estimates, the cost of supporting the 20 largest banks would rise to 7.6 trillion yen, or nearly $60 billion, if the Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell to about 12,000 points, from its current level of around 16,000, and each bank realized its losses but did not change its asset base.
Mr. Miyazawa said today that even with the Nikkei at 16,000 points, the bad debts at several banks outweighed their assets.
More so than is the case at their American counterparts, the financial strength of Japanese banks depends on stock prices. That is because of the Japanese tradition of companies and banks holding shares in institutions with which they do business.
That surely factored into Mr. Hashimoto's latest switch, since his comments Wednesday indicating he was cold to the idea of a bailout pushed the stock market down 5.3 percent, its biggest drop since the Kobe earthquake in 1995. The market bounced up today, with the Nikkei up 2.9 percent, to 16,308.49.
 In early trading on Friday, stocks continued their rebound. At midday, the Nikkei was up 320.08 points, or 1.96 percent, at 16,628.57.
But banking stocks were not big winners. Many investors have apparently concluded that those stocks are in for still more drubbing.

HEADLINE: South Korea Moves Closer To Requesting I.M.F. Aid

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Friday, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The Government today moved toward seeking a huge bailout from the International Monetary Fund, with the state broadcasting network saying the Finance Ministry had decided to request roughly $60 billion in assistance to avoid an economic crisis that would paralyze the world's 11th-largest economy and ripple around the globe.
There were conflicting reports on how close the Government was to making such a request, but it appeared the final decision rested with President Kim Young Sam. A spokesman for Blue House, the presidential mansion, said only that President Kim would make an address to the nation on Saturday. 
 President Kim could veto a decision to go to the I.M.F., for he would be severely embarrassed by the bailout, which would be seen as a humiliating national setback just as he is preparing to leave office. Still, it is not clear that he has any other options.
The bailout figure of $60 billion reported by the state radio would be approximately triple the amount of I.M.F. aid extended to Indonesia last month and nearly four times the size of the rescue package the fund extended to Thailand in August.
It also would confirm that the contagion that infected Southeast Asian countries in recent months had spread north. South Korea is also an industrialized country, with an economy more akin to those of Europe than to the smaller and less sophisticated Asian economies that have stumbled so far, and it has particularly close ties to the United States that would suggest a major American role in any rescue package.
This morning, the Finance Ministry denied that any final decision concerning an appeal to the fund had been made, saying that turning to the I.M.F. was only "one of a number of options," as one official who spoke on condition of anonymity put it.
At the same time, though, the state broadcasting network was carrying a telephone interview with Lim Chang Yuel, the newly appointed Finance Minister, in which he discussed the scale of an I.M.F. assistance package.
On Thursday, Mr. Lim had also seemed to signal the likelihood of an I.M.F. bailout, emphasizing that turning to the I.M.F. was an option that could resolve South Korea's crisis.
But at that time he continued to say the discussion of an I.M.F. bailout was premature and that South Korea would first try to raise funds from neighboring countries.
In a further sign that South Korea had softened its stance, Mr. Lim on Thursday did not bother beseeching the United States for help. American officials, rebuffing earlier aid requests, had insisted for days that any financial rescue must be led by the I.M.F.
South Korea announced an economic package on Wednesday, hoping that liberalization measures and bond issues would attract tens of billions of dollars to ease the country's liquidity crisis. But the markets were clearly unimpressed; the won, the Korean currency, tumbled its maximum allowable limit of 10 percent Thursday, and stocks fell 2.8 percent.
The heightened prospect of a bailout helped stem the won's retreat today and it rose slightly for the first time this week. But South Korea's stock market eased further, falling almost 1 percent by midday.
In his first full day on the job since his predecessor was dismissed as part of an economic reform package, Mr. Lim also elaborated Thursday on South Korea's extraordinary plea for help from the country's ancient enemy, Japan.
Mr. Lim said he was asking overseas banks, many of them Japanese, to extend the maturities of loans coming due. He also said that Japan could help by buying South Korean bonds, and he warned that Korea's problems could drag down Japan as well.
"Despite our sound economic indicators in Korea, we are currently experiencing financial market instability," Mr. Lim said. "Such instability, combined with a lack of international cooperation among financial institutions, is leading to economic crisis in Korea. If that becomes a reality, it will badly affect Japan as well."
The lack of cooperation Mr. Lim referred to apparently meant the refusal by some banks to renegotiate and extend loans coming due.
Asia's difficulties suggest that maybe there was something to the old domino theory after all. It did not hold true in ideology, for the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 did not lead the rest of Asia to topple like dominoes, but Asian trade and markets are now so integrated that market forces are proving much more mobile than Communist guerrillas ever were.
Since Thailand suffered a run on its currency this summer, currencies and markets have plunged throughout the region, with the Malaysian stock index tumbling 11 percent on Thursday alone.
South Korea, though, is far bigger economically than Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia or other places that have endured difficulties. In particular, South Korea carries a $110 billion foreign debt, with by some accounts one-fifth of that maturing in the next six weeks. Repayment difficulties could cause problems for international banks -- especially those in Japan.
To be sure, South Korea also has enormous underlying strengths. That point was demonstrated when the Government said Thursday that the economy grew a solid 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from July through September.
More broadly, South Korea -- its department stores packed with high-technology goods and shoppers, its Government ministries thick with Ph.D.'s from American universities -- does not remotely have the banana republic flavor that its financial policies have lately projected.
Because the underlying economy remains strong in many respects, what South Korea seems to face is a liquidity crisis coupled with a mountain of bad debts that have left many Korean banks with dubious solvency. Moreover, disclosure has been so poor that no one really knows whether confronting the bad-debt problem will be simply painful or downright agonizing.
The measures announced Wednesday might help resolve the banking problems, by liquidating bad debts and allowing bad banks to be taken over by stronger institutions. But the announcements did little to clarify how South Korea would raise the tens of billions of dollars needed to resolve its liquidity crisis.
"The direction of the measures is right, and we've been waiting for them for a long time," said Lee Won Il, head of research at KEB Smith Barney Securities here. "But it's not enough to stabilize overall sentiment. Although it's painful to our national pride, I think we've got to go to the I.M.F."
President Kim and other Government officials have been extremely reluctant to request emergency funds from the I.M.F., partly because the I.M.F. would presumably set tough conditions on Korea's economic policies and erode its financial autonomy.
"There's still a feeling in the Government and in the public that it would be giving up so-called economic sovereignty," said Han Sung Joo, a political scientist and former Foreign Minister. But Professor Han argued that turning to the I.M.F. might actually be good for South Korea in the long run.
"The reforms that the I.M.F. would demand are those that we should take by ourselves," Mr. Han said. "But we need the external impetus to do it."

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit jumped to an eight-month high of $11.1 billion in September, the Government said, as financial turmoil in Asia helped widen the gap. 
 United States exports, whose growth has sputtered since early spring, declined, while imports rose. Analysts noted that the combined trade deficit with South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- some of whose economies have been reeling from a crisis in financial markets -- doubled to $2 billion in September.

HEADLINE: Foreign Language Classes Offer Cultural Insight

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "State Regents Get It Wrong" (editorial, Nov. 20): As a language teacher, I applaud the decision to require three years of foreign language study for a high school diploma. Dr. Rudy Crew, the New York City Schools Chancellor, fears that the rule will impede the progress of students at some troubled urban high schools, but I believe language study will add to their education.
Learning a foreign language according to current methods is not about memorization. Now, basic knowledge of another language provides access to an entire culture. Language study is writing, reading and listening. It is art, history and science. Above all, it is exploration. 
 Language study is also pragmatic. Americans have earned a reputation abroad for arrogant ignorance of foreign cultures, an ignorance that has grave political and economic consequences.

HEADLINE: Meet U.S. Energy Needs With Domestic Reserves;
Technology Investment

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You say (editorial, Nov. 17) "the United States can retain its energy independence while relying on foreign sources of supply, leaving much of its own untapped wealth in the ground as a strategic reserve." That would be like limiting the number of print journalists to preserve more of our forests as a "strategic reserve." The oil and gas we can produce domestically is limited by technology and not by the amount of oil in the ground. Increasing dependence on foreign oil increases the trade deficit and makes stabilizing the dollar harder.
You say "the Administration has also failed to focus on more efficient use of existing energy supplies and on stronger conservation efforts." Yet the Clinton Administration has increased investment in energy-efficiency technologies by hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
 You suggest there may be a trade-off between stimulating oil production in the Caspian Basin and encouragement of democracy there. Yet Western expatriates have set a good example of how to operate in a free society, and Western investment has been a lever for economic and political reform. The greatest threat to human rights in the region has been Russian expansionism and now Islamic fundamentalism. United States engagement provides support against these pressures.

HEADLINE: Clinton, Remembering Rabin, Sees Urgency of Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton warned the Israelis and Palestinians today that they were running short of time. He spoke at a ceremony at which he recalled the push for peace made by Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister assassinated for his efforts two years ago.
"Now both sides have got to realize the need for urgency," Mr. Clinton said in the East Room. "The window of progress will become smaller with time. The frustration of ordinary people, both Israelis and Palestinians, will grow in the absence of progress." 
 The President spoke as he received a peace award from Mr. Rabin's widow, Leah Rabin, and Mr. Rabin's old ally Shimon Peres, the former Prime Minister. Warm remembrances of Mr. Rabin's efforts for peace contrasted with grim assessments of the state of negotiations in the region today.
"In recent months," Mr. Clinton said, "you have to acknowledge at least that the pace of change has slowed, and that the bonds of trust have eroded on both sides."
Mrs. Rabin recalled that she seemed "to be hearing the flutter of history's wing" when Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, shook hands at the White House on Sept. 13, 1993. Today, she said, she and others returned here "as a symbol of the hope we have not lost, despite some discouraging events and skies that have darkened things."
Lavishly praising Mr. Clinton's leadership, Mr. Peres also said that "peace is not lost," citing two indicators. The first, he said, was that he did not know "anybody today in the Middle East, who is serious, who wants to have a sixth war." The second reason, he said, was that countries in the region were becoming more preoccupied with economics than politics.
"Politics is a business for politicians who seek glory," Mr. Peres said. "Economy is a business for people who seek food. And every country that goes over from glory to food, from trying to make an impression to render a service, is really leading the people to a new era."
Mr. Clinton has never established the kind of friendship with Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister, that he had with either Mr. Rabin or Mr. Peres. He and his aides have expressed frustration with Mr. Netanyahu's handling of the peace effort, and the President did not see him during his recent trip to the United States.
Mr. Clinton only mentioned Mr. Netanyahu near the end of his remarks today, saying the Israeli and Mr. Arafat should "work intensively" on issues they had chosen to discuss, such as security cooperation. By contrast, he praised Mr. Peres for having "stayed true to the path they had chosen, even when the enemies of peace waged terror against the people of Israel." Mr. Peres and his Labor Party lost to Mr. Netanyahu and the Likud Party in elections in May 1996.
But Mr. Clinton today was speaking to both sides, a senior official said, acting out of a sense that the peace process "needs a kick."
"It's not a question of despair about the process," the official said, "but a message to both sides: 'You can't go on and on like this. The status quo is not sustainable.' "
In recalling Mr. Rabin's work for peace, Mr. Clinton said today, "It's so hard to say now, but, actually, from time to time, we had a lot of fun doing this."
The President told a story about Mr. Rabin that he has delighted in telling privately before. According to the President's account, just before they went out to the White House lawn to stand with Mr. Arafat in 1993, he warned the Prime Minister that "when we went out there it was going to be quite an extravaganza, and Mr. Arafat was an emotional person and there was going to have to be a handshake."
Mr. Rabin balked, but, as Mr. Clinton recalled, he reminded the Prime Minister that he himself had said that "you can't make peace with your friends."
There would be a billion people watching, Mr. Clinton said. "What are you going to do?" he recalled asking. "He said, 'All right -- but no kissing.' "
Mr. Clinton was the first recipient today of the Man of Peace Award, established by the Rabin Foundation and the Peres Foundation, two "peace centers" financed in part with money from the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize the men shared with Mr. Arafat. Mr. Clinton asked the foundations to devote the $75,000 in prize money to pay for scholarships for Americans to study in Israel.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Supply of Bribes

 BODY:
In the past few years dozens of developing countries have begun programs to cut corruption and prosecute officials who take bribes. But little has been done by the developed world to crack down on bribe-givers. That changed Thursday in Frankfurt, when the 29 industrialized countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development agreed on a treaty outlawing bribes to foreign government officials.
The treaty, while incomplete, is a victory for the United States. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, passed in 1977 in the wake of Watergate, made it illegal for American companies to bribe foreign officials. But no other nation followed. Many countries, including Germany and Australia, allow companies to deduct foreign bribes from their taxes as a business expense. 
 The spread of democracy, with the accompanying demands for governmental accountability, is one reason that more nations are trying to fight corruption. Another factor was the founding in 1992 of Transparency International, a Berlin-based organization that has helped many countries design anti-corruption strategies and has been pushing for years to make offering bribes illegal. A treaty gained support because nations were willing to give up this business advantage only if their competitors would also do so.
The treaty would force nations to prosecute any of their corporations that pay bribes to foreign government officials, legislators and executives of state-controlled companies. It has several shortcomings, however. It is not clear whether countries must stop allowing tax deductions for bribes. Corporations may continue to bribe officials of political parties. Provisions for enforcement are weak, and the treaty contains no specific steps countries must take, such as accounting changes that would keep businesses from disguising bribes as commissions.
Countries should ratify the treaty quickly and treat it as a minimum, adding their own measures to improve it. But the treaty itself is a significant accomplishment. If seriously enforced, it will reduce the number of bribes and add moral weight to the developed world's exhortations to poor countries to stop accepting them.

HEADLINE: Starting on a 'Long Road,' North Korea Agrees to Talks With Seoul, U.S. and China

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
North Korea agreed today to begin peace talks in Geneva next month with the United States, South Korea and China to bring a formal end to the Korean War more than four decades after the fighting stopped.
A delegation from North Korea agreed to join the talks after dropping a demand that the agenda for the negotiations include the immediate withdrawal of the 37,000 American troops dug in along the demilitarized zone in South Korea. 
 The agreement was a breakthrough in the Clinton Administration's efforts to entice North Korea out of its diplomatic isolation and to calm tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It was reached after a year and a half of preliminary talks and a final day of wrangling at Columbia University in New York City.
Although President Clinton and his aides welcomed North Korea's decision, the agreement did not begin to address the profound divisions between two countries ripped apart, first by warfare, then by four decades of cold war machinations.
In addition, Administration officials said they expected the talks to proceed slowly, hampered not only by North Korea's suspicions but also by South Korea's financial turmoil and approaching presidential election.
"We know that this is the beginning of a long road," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today in a statement released after she arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Mr. Clinton said he was pleased that the peace talks he had proposed along with President Kim Young Sam of South Korea in April 1996 would at last move forward, and noted the awaiting difficulties.
"There is a lot of hard work ahead," he said in a statement issued by the White House. "But this is an important first step, and the United States is prepared to be a full partner in helping the Korean people build a future of peace."
It was not clear why North Korea had dropped its demands. Officials in Washington speculated that the North's Government had felt a need to move forward or risk losing international aid to help ease hunger caused by floods and drought in recent years -- though the Clinton Administration has insisted that there is no link.
The talks will begin on Dec. 9 in Geneva, with senior delegations from the two Koreas and their principal supporters in the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with an armistice signed by the generals but not a formal peace treaty.
That armistice was only supposed to last a few months, but peace talks in 1954, also in Geneva, broke down and never resumed. For the last 43 years, the border between the Koreas has been one of the world's most heavily armed potential flash points.
While senior officials from the two countries have in the past signaled a willingness to improve relations and move toward eventual reunification, the talks next month will be the first in which the two enemies directly negotiate the terms of a formal peace treaty.
In a brief statement released in New York, the four delegations said the talks would focus on "the establishment of a peace regime on the Korea Peninsula and issues concerning tension reduction there."
A senior Administration official involved in the process said that in aiming at a peace treaty, the talks could lead both sides to try to reduce tensions. Those interim steps could, for example, include pulling forces from the demilitarized zone.
"As you move toward a formal peace treaty," the official said, "you have an opportunity to whittle away at those things that remain dangerous flash points."
In a series of preliminary meetings over the last year in New York, the North Koreans had indicated a willingness to attend more formal talks but repeatedly raised objections, dragging out the discussions.
In meetings held at Columbia in August and September, even the agenda for the formal talks proved a stumbling block. At those discussions, the United States and South Korea rebuffed North Korea's efforts to include the withdrawal of American troops and a separate peace treaty between the United States and the North, which Washington has long opposed.
Since the last round of talks in September broke off in frustration, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has consolidated and strengthened his position by assuming the titles held by his father, Kim Il Sung. One official said the North Korean delegation had not seemed prepared to make any decisions in the weeks before Kim Jong Il completed his ascension.
He is one of the world's most isolated leaders, never having traveled outside the Communist world. But he has indicated a willingness to improve relations with South Korea and the United States. In an essay published in August, he called it "an urgent requirement."

HEADLINE: Case No. 3: Asian Illness Threatening Vital Organs

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
As Thailand's economy imploded during the summer, the International Monetary Fund rushed in to try to confine the problem to one of Asia's most promising -- but still small -- economic powers.
It failed. Investors quickly turned their attention to other Asian nations plagued with wildly overextended banks, corruption and collapsing financial institutions. After a two-month hiatus, Indonesia erupted, requiring a far, far larger bailout, one that included for the first time billions of dollars in backup financing from Washington. 
 But the Asian contagion still could not be stopped. And now the impending bailout of South Korea -- a rescue plan that could easily exceed the $48 billion, American-led bailout of Mexico in 1995 -- raises the stakes for the United States and for investors around the world.
Korea is a critical fire wall in the effort to keep the contagion from engulfing the world's second-largest economy: Japan. The fear is that Japan's own teetering financial system -- one of its largest securities houses, Yamaichi Securities, is reported to be on the verge of liquidation -- could not withstand the collapse of one of Japan's biggest trading partners.
"We simply don't know where this goes next, and can't predict it," one senior Clinton Administration official said today. And if Japan heads into a precipitous decline, it would be all but impossible to prevent the United States from catching the Asian flu. Exports to virtually all the Asian markets would slow, and the effects would be felt from Wall Street to the factory floors of companies that have thrived in America's export boom.
It is for all those reasons that inside the Treasury Department, where Asia's woes have become as large a preoccupation as Iraq is in the Pentagon, few doubt that South Korea's troubles raise the Asian financial crisis to a new level. South Korea is the world's 11th-largest economy, roughly the size of Indonesia's, Malaysia's and Thailand's rolled into one.
"Korea makes this an entirely different ball game," David Hale, the chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments, said recently as economists tried to take the measure of a Korean meltdown. He estimates it could take $50 billion to $100 billion in outside assistance to aid Korea; the I.M.F. considers $30 billion an accurate estimate, though officials concede the sum could total more than that.
One thing is clear: Whatever it takes, the Clinton Administration will push to make sure that the size of the bailout is large enough to persuade investors to return. Part of the reason is strategic: Korea is a major American ally, with 36,000 American troops stationed along the demilitarized zone, and no one wants it to appear weak at a time of tense negotiations with the North. In fact, for Seoul it was a cruel coincidence that international help came on the same day that North Korea agreed to begin talks over a formal ending of the Korean War -- a concession that on any other day would be viewed as a victory for the South.
But the talks with North Korea will drag on for months; insulating Japan from the worst of the "contagion effect" is a far more immediate problem.
The worst case runs something like this:
Even with the I.M.F.'s help, Korea's pain spreads quickly across the Sea of Japan, reaching banks that lent to Korean financial institutions and cutting off business to Japanese companies that are major suppliers to what was once a Japanese colony. The Japanese institutions, already teetering, are forced into bankruptcy. Japanese exports fall. And with the Korean won sharply devalued -- it has already dropped about 20 percent this year -- Japan feels compelled to let the yen slide as well, so that its cars and computer chips remain competitive with Korea's on overseas markets.
"This is the scenario that could bring the Nikkei to 12,000 or lower," an investment banker in Asia speculated recently about Japanese stocks. And that in turn, would lead to the failure of more Japanese banks, which have long been permitted by Japanese authorities to count their unrealized stock market gains as capital. With the Nikkei index that low, there would be no gains, and, thus, far less capital. The banks would have to merge or be permitted to liquidate, as Japan's 10th-largest bank, the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, did earlier this week.
Japan's pain, of course, would quickly become America's. The trade deficit with Japan would soar, and Japanese imports, made less expensive by a declining yen, would displace American products. Political tensions would rise geometrically. This is why Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has been escalating his warnings to Japan that it must pull itself out of its trouble by stimulating domestic demand, rather than exporting more and more goods.
Of course, that is the worst case. If Japan moves quickly to confront its problems -- injecting taxpayer dollars into its banking system to ward off collapse, finding innovative ways to bolster the domestic economy -- it could ward off much of the contagion from Korea. American officials are busily trying to come up with reliable estimates of how much Japanese banks are exposed to Korea. The early answer, officials say, is that they are not as vulnerable in Korea as many first thought.
"This is a case where the Korean enmity toward Japan may actually pay off for the Japanese," an Asian diplomat in Washington said recently. "The Koreans don't especially like the Japanese, and so they often went out of their way to cut out Japanese banks and companies."
And the best-case outlook is that South Korea will respond to the medicine the way Mexico did. In the Mexican case, a huge rescue package was organized, totaling more than $52 billion. But in the end, the Mexicans only used about half of that amount. The rest served as a psychological prop to investors, who knew that the country had a cushion of loans to fall back on in case the problems took a turn for the worse. And because the cushion was there, private investment quickly came back.
It is, in short, the financial equivalent of the Powell Doctrine, which was Gen. Colin Powell's insistence on the need to use "decisive and overwhelming force." It is a doctrine well understood in Korea, a country that has been focused on military security for a lot longer than it has been focused on economic security.

HEADLINE: Killing Wasn't Much, Skinhead Says

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Red hair shaved down to his skull, Nathan Thill lounged in a black leather jacket and mulled over why he shot to death a West African man at a bus stop here.
Without a trace of emotion, Mr. Thill, a 19-year-old skinhead, told a television interviewer that he "walked through town with my gun in my waist, saw the black guy and thought he didn't belong where he was at." 
 "How easy it would be to take him out right there," he continued. "Didn't seem like much to me."
While Denverites watched the jailhouse interview on the noon news today, about 1,000 people, including Mayor Wellington Webb, gathered at the city's largest mosque for the funeral of the slain Mauritanian man, Oumar Dia.
"Oumar was one of millions of people who come to the United States to improve their circumstances, fascinated by the American dream," Mohamadou Cisse, a friend, said after coming home from the mosque. "For Oumar, his dream was shattered."
Eight years ago, Arab authorities expelled Mr. Dia from his native Mauritania because he was black, his friends said. On Tuesday night, after work as a housekeeper in a downtown Denver hotel, Mr. Dia, a 38-year-old father of three, crossed paths with Mr. Thill, a burly, former meatpacker who carried a .22-caliber pistol, Celtic tattoos on his forearms, and a visceral hatred of people different than him.
"It was not a stray bullet that killed Oumar," said Mr. Cisse, a Senegalese vendor, in the thick French spoken on the West Coast of Africa. "The murderer knew exactly what he wanted to do: to kill someone who was black."
The killing, the latest in a two-week string of skinhead incidents, has shocked Denver, a city that prides itself for racial tolerance, country good manners and a booming, high-tech economy. Only a block from the site of the race killing, newstands prominently display the current issue of Fortune magazine which ranks Denver as North America's "second most improved city for business" -- below New York and above Boston.
But this month's parade of skinheads going before judges or engaging the police in shootouts has awakened dormant racial fears.
"I am walking around downtown looking over my shoulder," said Monette McIver, a black woman who is a graduate student in education. "I am just wondering if this or that person is going to take me out because of the color of my skin."
Farther down the 16th Street pedestrian mall, Joseph Chinn, a black man who is studying criminal justice, said bluntly, "It makes me want to go out and buy a gun, O.K.?"
On Saturday, a rally to protest the attacks is to be held in Five Points, an historically black neighborhood.
A white woman who tried to help Mr. Dia was also shot by the skinhead. The woman, Jeannie VanVelkinburgh, a 36-year-old single mother of two boys, was shot in the back, the bullet severing her spine. Doctors say she will be paralyzed for life.
"I was trying to help someone who needed help and didn't have any idea I would end up in this situation," Ms. VanVelkinburgh, a nursing home aide, said from her hospital bed. "But I would do it again if I thought there was a chance that I could save someone's life."
The shootings followed a spate of skinhead incidents: a high-speed car chase that ended with the arrests of two skinheads and another car chase that ended with the killing of a police officer and the suicide of a skinhead. After the skinhead's death, police stations started receiving death threats. The word "pig" was scrawled on a police car and a pig carcass scrawled with the name of the dead officer was left at the officer's old police station.
Mayor Webb, who is preparing for a visit by President Clinton on Saturday, said the Denver police and the Federal authorities were trying to determine whether the incidents were linked to a single skinhead organization. "There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that it is an organized effort," the Mayor said.
Mr. Webb, who is black, argued that the city remained a tolerant place, adding, "Denver is a city where the African-American population is 12 percent, and where, in 1991, both candidates for mayor were African-American."
In adjacent Jefferson County, where the two car chases originated, John Stone, a county commissioner, threatened on Wednesday, "If we need to go to war with skinheads, we'll do that."
But some critics say that Colorado has become too complacent.
"The whole leadership of Colorado is caught off guard by this," said Carl Raschke, a University of Denver religious studies professor who studies local hate groups. "There has been this sugary image about Denver: that it happens everywhere else but here."
Indeed, a police intelligence unit credited with disbanding skinhead groups in the early 1990's was recently redirected to other projects.
"Law enforcement needs to come down hard on them again," said Bobbie Towbin, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League here. "Let them know that their activities are not welcome here."
Denver police have in custody two other skinheads. Jeremiah Barnum, 24, surrendered on Thursday after learning that he was wanted for questioning about the Dia killing. On Wednesday, the police arrested a skinhead who had stockpiled in his motel room bomb-making parts, ammunition and a Mac 90 semiautomatic assault rifle.
The police are searching for three more who may have been involved in the attempted ambush of a Denver policeman on Thursday morning.
While Denver awaits the outcome, residents ponder the words of Mr. Thill, a gas station clerk who saw himself as a soldier in a race war.
"In a war, anybody wearing the enemy's uniform is an enemy and should be taken out," he said of his victim, who was waiting for a bus. "I guess I was kind of thinking about him because he was black."

HEADLINE: Cigarette Tax Urged to Cover Health Costs

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
A state health panel recommended today that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and lawmakers consider raising the cigarette tax to help New Jersey hospitals cover the cost of free medical treatment for the uninsured.
The 36-member advisory committee concluded that the state's $16 billion budget should finance the estimated $400 million annual cost of the free health care, known as the charity care hospital program. The committee is made up of representatives of hospitals, insurers, consumer and business groups and organized labor. 
 The panel's members unanimously endorsed an increase in the state cigarette tax to help replace money from the state's general funds, but they did not specify an amount.
The committee also offered mixed support for other options for the Governor and legislators. Those measures include raising a tax on hospitals, imposing an annual assessment of $18.83 on each person in the state who has health insurance, and continuing to depend on payroll taxes that are designated for the state's Unemployment Insurance Trust.
"The tobacco tax enjoyed universal support," said the State Health Commissioner, Len Fishman. "Everybody agreed that a tobacco tax made sense, at least as a partial solution to charity care." He said there was less support for the other revenue choices.
Although Mrs. Whitman recommended raising the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack for the charity care program two years ago, she has not embraced the increase this time, her aides said. The Legislature refused to consider her proposal in 1995.
A 25 cent increase would raise the state tax to 65 cents a pack from 40 cents and increase the average cost of cigarettes to $2.60 a pack from $2.35.
A 25 cent increase would raise about $100 million in revenues annually and provide about one fourth of the money needed to cover the entire cost of the health care program.
"The cigarette tax is one of several options," said Michael P. Torpey, the Governor's chief of staff, "and we consider all of the options to be on the table. We just got the report, and it is going to be the basis of discussion with the legislative leadership of both parties."
Republican legislative leaders also said that all of the options were on the table and that they would seek support from Democrats before agreeing on a plan.
Jack Collins, the Assembly Speaker, has proposed raising the cigarette tax to help cover the cost of renovating and building new schools around the state. The Assembly approved his plan last year, but the tax increase failed in the State Senate, in part, because it did not receive support from Democrats. Democrats have been reluctant to support tax increases after voters punished them for supporting a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990 under Gov. Jim Florio.
State Senator Richard J. Codey, a Democrat from West Orange who is expected to be the minority leader, said that he did not think there were enough votes in the Senate to support a cigarette tax increase. He also said that the other recommendations in the report, for a tax increase for hospitals and a new tax on insured people, were not viable solutions.
New Jersey is one of about a dozen states that require hospitals to provide free treatment to uninsured patients who are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare and who are unable to pay their bills. There are no public hospitals in New Jersey.
The current financing system, which relies heavily on the state unemployment insurance compensation fund, expires on Dec. 31. Both organized labor and business groups oppose the state's practice of diverting money from the unemployment fund to pay for the program of free medical care.
Since 1993, the state has used more than $2.2 billion from the unemployment insurance fund to pay for the program.
Mrs. Whitman and lawmakers said they were committed to finding a permanent financing solution by the end of the year. Two years ago, the last time the financing system expired, hospitals across the state were forced to trim staff and postpone payments to vendors while the Governor and legislators took more than six months to agree on a plan.
Mr. Fishman, the state health commissioner, said that hospitals, particularly those in urban areas that provide the most free medical treatment, need a swift and permanent solution. "These hospitals are not in a position to survive a protracted debate over charity care financing," he said.
Gary Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said his group was fiercely opposed to raising a tax on hospitals.

HEADLINE: Norman Topping, 89, Scientist Who Guided the Rise of U.S.C.

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Dr. Norman H. Topping, who helped to develop the typhus vaccine and went on to lead the University of Southern California's transformation into a prominent research center, died on Tuesday. He was 89.
Dr. Topping was president of the university from 1958 to 1970 and chancellor from 1971 to 1980. He then was chancellor emeritus until his death. 
 The university had been known as a locally oriented campus with strong sports teams, but under his leadership, it gained respect for its academic program, particularly in science, medicine and engineering.
Beginning in 1961, Dr. Topping led a drive to expand the university with a multimillion-dollar construction program and larger graduate program. Under his leadership, it was elected to the Association of American Universities, a body of 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada.
"Norman Topping is the father of modern U.S.C.," said Steven B. Sample, the current president of the University of Southern California. "Until he came, we essentially had no research."
Dr. Topping began his career as a researcher with the United States Public Health Service in Bethesda, Md. In the 1930's, he helped develop a vaccine against typhus that was used by millions of Allied soldiers in World War II. The vaccine is still in use. Typhus, which causes a high fever and is primarily transmitted by body lice and fleas, has killed thousands of people during epidemics since ancient times.
Dr. Topping also helped develop the first effective treatment against Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a tick-borne disease native to the West.
In 1948, Dr. Topping was appointed associate director of the National Institute of Health and Assistant Surgeon General of the United States. From 1952 to 1958, he served as vice president for medical affairs at the University of Pennsylvania.
After retiring as U.S.C. president, he served as president of the Los Angeles Transit Authority. He was also appointed to a civic board overseeing urban redevelopment in Los Angeles, an issue he became interested as part of U.S.C.'s effort to improve the inner-city neighborhood around the campus.
Dr. Topping was born on Jan. 12, 1908, in Flat River, Mo. He graduated from high school in Los Angeles and earned both his bachelor's and medical degrees at U.S.C.
His wife, the former Helen Rummens, died in 1989. Dr. Topping is survived by a son, Brian B., of Baltimore; a daughter, Linda Topping Badgley of Isla de Culebra, P.R.; five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

Humbled By Debt Crisis, Seoul Seeks I.M.F. Aid
South Korea formally requested an emergency $20 billion aid package from the International Monetary Fund to help avert economic paralysis caused by rising debts and a loss of investor confidence. But the total amount of I.M.F. aid could surpass $60 billion, many economists say, which would make it the largest bailout by the lending agency ever.
 
 The decision to seek the aid made South Korea the latest victim of Asia's financial flu and marked a humiliating retreat for the country, one of the economic showcases of the late 20th century, rising from poverty and war to become the world's 11th-largest economy. Although terms of the I.M.F. aid have yet to be worked out, they will probably impose harsh restraints on South Koreans. Page A1.
 
Blue-Chip Stocks Rally
Despite concerns over Asian's financial troubles, stock markets around the world strengthened. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.46 points to close at 7,881.07, pushing the blue-chip index up 4.1 percent on the week -- its best weekly gain in five months. But the broader market was weaker, as technology issues retreated after strong gains on Thursday. The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, fell 5.81 points, to 1,620.75. D14.
 
G.M. to Close a Plant in Flint
General Motors plans to close its 2,900-employee Buick City car factory, above, in Flint, Mich. The closing is another setback for Flint, the troubled city chronicled in the documentary "Roger and Me." The closing is also the latest sign that auto makers expect Americans to continue shifting from cars to sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups. After the closing, in 1999, G.M.'s vehicle production in Flint will be limited to pickup trucks and commercial trucks. D4.
 
Clinton Clears F.D.A. Overhaul
President Clinton signed into law a major overhaul in the Food and Drug Administration intended to quicken approval of drugs and medical devices. But the President gave no indication of when he would choose someone to replace Dr. David A. Kessler, who left as commissioner of the regulatory agency nine months ago. A13.
 
TRW in $942 Million Deal
TRW plans to acquire BDM International for $29.50 a share in cash, or about $942 million. TRW said the acquisition would allow it to broaden its scope into civil, commercial and international markets. D3.
 
Judge Faults Dow Corning Plan
Criticizing what he called numerous legal flaws in Dow Corning's proposals for disposing of breast implant damage claims, a bankruptcy judge ruled it would be a "monumental waste of time" for claimants and other creditors to vote on a reorganization plan containing the proposals. D2.
 
Gerstner Staying At I.B.M.
Louis V. Gerstner Jr. agreed to extend his contract as chief executive of I.B.M. at least until his 60th birthday in March 2002, saying his turnaround work at the computer company is incomplete. In return, I.B.M. said Mr. Gerstner's compensation would include two million options for I.B.M. stock, which has increased fivefold since he joined the company in 1993. D3. .

Fear of Lower Asian Demand Hurts Copper

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Copper prices tumbled yesterday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange as concern grew that Asia's financial crisis would sharply depress demand.
Problems in Asia, the world's largest copper-consuming region, come as mining companies are increasing their output. Copper production exceeded demand by 200,000 metric tons in the first eight months of the year and surpluses will extend into 1998, according to the International Copper Study Group. Copper for December delivery fell 0.9 cent, or 1.1 percent, to 84 cents a pound, the lowest price since Jan. 13, 1994. 
 Orange juice prices jumped 4 percent as the second cold snap of the season was forecast for Florida. Though no damaging frost is expected, the lower temperatures brought expectations that colder weather during the main frost season in Florida, beginning in mid-December, could harm this year's crop. Orange juice for January delivery rose 3.1 cents, to 81.65 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.

HEADLINE: Dissident's Advice to Clinton: Only Pressure Sways Beijing

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

 BODY:
Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent democracy advocate, said in an interview in New York yesterday that he would tell President Clinton that only continued pressure from the West could help free more Chinese political prisoners. He said he intended to use his time in exile to act as a campaigner for human rights.
"This will be the very first issue that we discuss," said Mr. Wei, who is expected to meet Mr. Clinton later this month or early in December. "If you want to have a dialogue with a Communist Government, you have to use pressure, otherwise they will never talk with you." Excerpts, page A5. 
 Still weakened by his 16 years of imprisonment, Mr. Wei nonetheless appeared to be in fairly good health. Reports that he was suffering from life-threatening illnesses appear now to have been part of a strategy by family members and rights groups to press Beijing's Government to release him on medical parole, as it did last weekend.
Mr. Wei's assertions that he intends to become a strong public advocate for improvements in China's human rights situation could complicate relations between Washington and Beijing.
Mr. Wei's message may prove controversial to the Clinton Administration, which won praise yesterday from rights organizations for pressing Mr. Wei's case in private meetings with Chinese leaders in the last three years. Mr. Clinton has stepped back from the campaign of trade pressure on China that he advocated at the outset of his Administration, arguing that "engagement," not confrontation, was more likely to produce improved rights conditions in China.
Speaking at a news conference in New York and in an interview afterward, Mr. Wei said he saw himself becoming an evangelist for greater freedom and democratic reform in China using the Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and other news media that would enable him to build an audience among the Chinese.
Many people in China do not recognize his name because it is banned from being mentioned by state-run news outlets and because he has been imprisoned almost continuously since March 1979.
"Most of the Chinese people would very much like to hear other voices," he said. "Otherwise they would not know that they have choices. That is why this is very important."
He quarreled good-naturedly in the interview at being labeled a dissident. "Most of the Chinese people all want democracy," he asserted. "And the people who are different are just this little group of ruling elites of the Chinese Communist Party, so they are really the dissidents."
In the news conference, he exhorted China's democracy forces, saying, "You should not pay attention to the immediate low tide, because after a low tide there is always a high tide that follows."
The State Department earlier this year reported that political dissent in China had effectively been completely stifled through a campaign of repressive measures including jailings and forced exiles.
Mr. Wei's entrance this morning into a large hall at the New York Public Library packed by waiting reporters and well-wishers was greeted by applause and cheers. The 47-year-old activist wore a brown corduroy jacket and a red plaid shirt, his uneven prison crew cut looking in need of a trim.
In an opening statement, Mr. Wei thanked the "people and governments around the world that have made enormous efforts to press the Chinese Government for the release of political prisoners" and admonished those who already live in freedom in the world not to become complacent about those who do not.
"Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind," he said. "Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation and massacres."
Though he evaded questions during the news conference about what message he would deliver to Mr. Clinton, during the interview afterward, Mr. Wei was emphatic that he would seek continued pressure from Washington and other Western capitals for improvement of rights conditions in China and the release of prisoners.
The only reason Chinese leaders have ever engaged in dialogue over the country's internal human rights conditions has been pressure from the United States and other countries whose markets have become important export destinations for Chinese goods and a source of technology for China's modernization.
Mr. Wei said he would like to visit all parts of the United States in the coming months. While in New York, he has been assigned a New York police detective as a bodyguard. Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley have offered him office space and living quarters to pursue academic studies and pro-democracy work.
His immediate plans are to write a book about the beatings, abuse and psychological pressure that the Chinese prison authorities used to try to break him and, ultimately, to force him into exile by refusing him further medical treatment in prison.
Among the techniques were shutting off heat in his cell, using other inmates to torment or beat him and housing him in a cell where lights were left on 24 hours a day as a way of denying him sleep.
Mr. Wei was released from Jidong Prison, about 150 miles southeast of Beijing. "When I was a prisoner there in 1989, they used to brag that they were the largest salt factory in Asia, exporting to Japan and many other countries. But when I returned in 1993, I asked them if they were still exporting salt to other countries, and they denied it."
Mr. Wei indicated that international criticism of China's use of prison labor for exported products had caused the prison authorities to change their story.
He said that if he becomes active as an opposition figure in the United States, he is concerned that the Communist authorities might retaliate against members of his family left behind in China.
"I am concerned about their security," he said at the news conference. "They have suffered a lot. But there are hundreds of millions of Chinese who have been oppressed, and I am concerned about them equally."
Beijing's leaders are apparently calculating that with Mr. Wei out of the country, his threat to rekindle a democracy movement has been neutralized and his effectiveness as a political troublemaker will be minimized by his distance from China.
But rights groups based in the United States, with Mr. Wei's cooperation, already appear to be developing a strategy to give him a new voice in China, something he has scarcely had since 1978-79, when he pasted his pro-democracy essays on a stretch of wall in central Beijing that became known as the Democracy Wall.
Among Mr. Wei's first interviews yesterday were with correspondents for the Chinese-language service of the Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and a major Chinese daily newspaper in Hong Kong. He was also interviewed by The New York Times.
For a man who has spent long years in solitary confinement and watched as more than a dozen teeth dropped out from years of malnutrition because of a poor prison diet, Mr. Wei seemed to enjoy parrying the questions of a New York news conference.
Asked about his views on Taiwan and Tibet, where there are strong independence movements with support in the United States, Mr. Wei was careful not to challenge China's claims of sovereignty over both territories.
"On Tibet," he said, "this is a rather complex question. I don't agree with the Government's policy of oppressing and killing Tibetans and carrying out the destruction of Tibetan culture, but as to how to resolve this issue, I think that calm Chinese and Tibetans should sit down and figure out a good solution."
Asked to tell the greatest lesson he learned from his 16 years of imprisonment for the views he expressed during the Democracy Wall period, Mr. Wei said: "I have learned many things in prison, but the most important thing is that for a human being, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. You just have to rely on yourself and you can get through anything."
The man most responsible for Mr. Wei's jailing was Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who emerged in the years after the death of Mao in 1976 and opened an era of economic reform that is turning the nation of 1.2 billion into an Asian powerhouse.
Mr. Wei's trenchant essays on Democracy Wall pointedly criticized Deng for failing to carry through with his promises of democracy as part of the program for China's modernization. When Mr. Wei called Deng a dictator in early 1979, he was arrested and Democracy Wall was torn down.
Mr. Wei said he sent a letter of condolence to Deng's family when the 92-year-old leader died in February.
"If he could have expanded reform to the political arena," Mr. Wei said, "then -- even if he had abused me even worse than he has -- I still would not hate him."
Mr. Wei took questions for a little more than 40 minutes at the library hall and then asked politely that he be excused because he was feeling tired and dizzy.

Seoul Plans to Ask the I.M.F. For a Minimum of $20 Billion

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 21

 BODY:
In a remarkable humiliation for one of the most glittering economic success stories of the late 20th century, South Korea announced tonight that to avert a financial crisis it would seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
The amount will be negotiated in coming days, but many economists say the package of assistance will have to be enormous, perhaps exceeding $60 billion. 
 That would easily surpass the previous record of $48 billion in I.M.F. aid committed to Mexico nearly three years ago. Mexico ultimately used about half of that amount.
The vulnerability of Japan in particular to the South Korean mess has become a major preoccupation for American monetary officials, who are now viewing Asia's growing economic crisis as a more urgent threat to United States interests because previous I.M.F. efforts to contain it have failed. Analysis, page D1.
Finance Minister Lim Chang Yuel told a late-night news conference that South Korea would seek $20 billion in I.M.F. loans, plus an additional open line of credit in case that amount was insufficient. Mr. Lim also said he expected the United States and Japan, which had rebuffed requests in recent days to provide direct aid to South Korea, to participate in an I.M.F.-led rescue.
With Mr. Lim's bleak announcement, South Korea became the latest in a string of Asian nations to redefine the term "Asian miracle." Once it referred to the stunning march of East Asia from mud huts to skyscrapers in a single generation, but now it seems more a reminder of how far and how quickly these countries' economies and currencies and stock markets have tumbled.
In particular, the transformation of South Korea from industrial giant to international pauper suggests that the Asian financial flu that began in Thailand in the summer and spread throughout Southeast Asia has now begun to spread in Northeast Asia. South Korea's plummeting currency and mounting bad debts may reverberate on to America and the West.
It was just a week ago that South Korea called the idea of I.M.F. aid unthinkable. The Government agonized over the choices, changing its mind several times before making the final decision tonight.
Mr. Lim described South Korea's problems as a "temporary funding shortage" but said international help was the best solution.
"To overcome the nation's financial and currency crises, we've decided to request emergency funding from the I.M.F.," he declared.
"Although Korea's fundamental macro-economic conditions are relatively healthy, with rising exports, a string of corporate bankruptcies have decreased Korea's creditworthiness and produced calls for debt repayments," Mr. Lim said. He said of the decision to turn to the I.M.F.: "The Korean Government hopes that this measure will bear fruit."
The money is likely to be used primarily to help distressed banks repay debts they owe, giving them a chance to rework an estimated $50 billion in unrepaid loans owed to them. Reversing the process of defaults is critical to restoring confidence, which will help ease the crisis further by encouraging the return of foreign investors who have been abandoning South Korea.
But the I.M.F. aid will undoubtedly come at a painful price for South Korea by making the rules for borrowing money more stringent. That could have the immediate impact of increasing interest rates and forcing some companies out of business and raising unemployment for South Koreans, who until recently had barely understood what a layoff meant.
An I.M.F. delegation group will visit Seoul next week to negotiate the exact size and terms of the rescue, Mr. Lim said, and the money will start arriving in three to four weeks.
 In a nationally broadcast speech Saturday about the decision, President Kim Young Sam told South Koreans: "As the head of national affairs, I am truly sorry. Our economy has grown relatively quickly and smoothly, but such rapid development itself has given birth to structural problems." He said the country must endure "bone-carving pain."
Rumors about the prospect that Seoul would turn to the I.M.F. gave a strong lift to Korea's financial markets today. Stocks rose 3.6 percent and the currency, which had plunged for the previous four days, rose sharply as well.
The news also helped strengthen most other financial markets on optimism that South Korean investments need not be written off.
 In abbreviated trading on Saturday, South Korean stocks retreated again, falling 4 percent.
South Korea suffers from what is known as a liquidity crisis, or a lack of money flowing through the economy, which is causing defaults on corporate loans like falling dominos.
It descended to this point partly because of reckless lending by South Korean banks -- particularly in other developing markets not only elsewhere in Asia but also in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Billions of dollars in unrepaid loans have forced these banks to borrow from foreign banks that have grown increasingly unwilling to lend more.
In addition, many of the giant South Korean industrial conglomerates like Kia Motors, Hanbo Group and Sammi Group that helped build the country have fallen, the victims of too much debt.
The decline in lender and investor confidence in South Korea has been reflected in the diminished value of the won, South Korea's currency, which has fallen by 20 percent against the dollar this year. That has made it even more expensive for South Korea to repay loans.
Even so, South Korea's economy is still growing at an annual rate of more than 6 percent, considerably faster than the American economy. That is partly because the diminished value of the won has helped the country increase its exports, from computer chips to Hyundai Motor sedans. South Korea also has underlying strengths like a passion for education and a reputation for a diligent labor force.
In the long run, some economists suggest, I.M.F.-imposed changes to resolve the bad debts and modernize the banking system may be a boon for South Korea. In particular, they may lead to the establishment of an efficient capital market and banking system, essential if the two Koreas reunified and the South had to rebuild the impoverished North.
The Korean Government had been loath to turn to the I.M.F., partly because of the stringent conditions the I.M.F. will undoubtedly set, breaching what some South Koreans describe as their economic sovereignty. Indeed, the nation seemed to collectively lament as word of the bailout spread today, bracing for a period of austerity.
In a prime-time evening news commentary, the MBC television network declared, "Leaving behind our glorious economic development, our country must suffer the humiliation of going bankrupt."
Moreover, the I.M.F. rescue is a stinging humiliation for President Kim, who had been reluctant to admit economic failure before his New Korea Party faces presidential elections on Dec. 18.
Mr. Kim is barred by law from running again, but the ruling-party candidate, Lee Hoi Chang, is already lagging far behind in the polls. The beneficiary from the bailout may be the longtime opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, who is already leading in the polls by a healthy margin. The business establishment has long been contemptuous of Kim Dae Jung's command of economics, but these days it is equally dismissive of the ruling party's economic management.
President Kim and Mr. Lim met tonight with the presidential candidates to discuss the decision to turn to the I.M.F. Afterward, the Government said that it had the support and understanding of all the candidates. Invariably South Korea's economic difficulties also have a security dimension, because North Korea has more than a million troops next door and by some accounts is always sniffing for weakness and an opportunity for military adventure.
In addition, South Korea and North Korea, which technically remain at war, are now preparing for landmark peace talks that are supposed to reach a lasting peace to replace the armistice that suspended fighting in the Korean War. South Korea would prefer to enter the negotiations at a time when it feels more secure, but instead North Korea is relishing the chance to offer its own analyses of South Korea's problems.
"There is no way of saving the defective economy that has contradictory structure and cancer of the colonial dependent economy," the official North Korean press agency declared today.

HEADLINE: Health-Maintenance Groups Are Seen Entering a Troublesome New Phase

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 21

 BODY:
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is shutting down 11 of its health maintenance organization's 22 clinics, laying off 30 of its 65 primary-care doctors and cutting the salaries of the rest.
Humana has dismissed 4 pediatricians and 2 ophthalmologists from among the 89 salaried doctors at its 7 clinics here. St. Luke's Hospital, one of Kansas City's biggest, says that the incomes of its cardiovascular surgeons will drop 40 percent to 50 percent next year. 
 Such are the latest throes of the revolution in American health care. The managed-care industry, once widely seen as a panacea for the nation's health care woes, is now entering a troublesome new phase: struggling with the consequences of its extraordinary expansion this decade, forced in many cases to raise premiums, lay off doctors and close clinics.
In Kansas City, as in most of the rest of the country, big insurance companies like Aetna, the Cigna Corporation and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, and big health maintenance organizations like Kaiser Permanente, United Healthcare and Humana, find themselves up against two hard-to-reconcile phenomena: a seething consumer and political backlash over delays and denial of care on one hand and their own financial reversals and excess capacity on the other.
Up to now, patients in managed-care plans have felt little pain in strict economic terms. Insurers and managed-care companies held the line on premiums by chopping out the excesses and by swallowing the losses they incurred in scrambling for subscribers and a big share of the market. Lately, however, the industry's losses and plunging profits have begun to sting.
 
Sudden Changes In Health Care System
No city quite mirrors all the turbulence in health care. The wholesale shift to managed care started later in the two Kansas Cities, with a population of 1.7 million straddling the Missouri-Kansas state line, than in Boston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis or Rochester. But in few places is the competition fiercer than here, where any new national health system is most likely to be defined. The city's economy and demographic mix, like its site, is mainstream American, and by moving relatively late toward managed care, Kansas City can pick among the features that have survived the tests of other markets.
As in the rest of the country, the Kansas City area long relied for its health care on the entrenched fee-for-service system, in which consumers sought care from whatever doctor they wished and the doctors prescribed whatever they wanted. The system was built upon Blue Cross and Blue Shield, then and still the area's leading insurer, as well as self-employed doctors and 24 hospitals, most of them affiliated with a religion, like Baptist, Menorah, Bethany, Trinity Lutheran and St. Luke's.
But in just three years, the onset of managed care has shattered those traditional arrangements. Half the city's doctors work for somebody else, often a hospital. Many hospitals, local insurers and managed-care companies have merged and affiliated into two large health-care networks, one dominated by St. Luke's, the other by Health Midwest and Blue Cross. Outsiders, like Kaiser, Humana, Columbia HCA, United Healthcare, Cigna, Prudential and Aetna have moved in, too, often to ally with the members of the indigenous groups and often, too, to compete with them.
"I guess I wouldn't call it mayhem here," said Joe Tilghman, regional administrator for the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which writes Medicare checks for the elderly and Medicaid checks for the poor. "There's certainly some confusion, some trepidation and anxiety because the changes are taking place so fast. That's pretty much true all over the country."
Nationwide, premium increases of at least 5 percent next year have already been negotiated for most participants in health care groups.
To avoid the political firestorm and flight of customers that big premium increases could ignite, and to survive in a rapidly changing environment, health care companies are groping for a magical new mix of good care and cost-efficient care.
 
New Plans and Choices Take Their Toll
New approaches to care are emerging, each with new buzz words. Nationwide, consumers have joined the debate with calls to Congress and state legislatures like Missouri's for rights of "open access" to doctors so they can bypass health care organizations' gatekeepers, who control cost by controlling access to specialists, and for a "bill of rights" to appeal delays and denials of care to outside arbitrators.
Insurers, managed-care companies and groups of doctors are combining into seamless "integrated delivery systems" that offer, through a single entity, conception-to-grave care and devising cost-efficient methods of "disease management" to monitor chronically ill patients to keep them healthy longer and out of emergency rooms.
"What you've seen is an explosion of health plans, each offering a little different choice, a different twist," said Tom Bowser, executive vice president of the Blue Cross organization here. "What's happening is that these plans are having to compete more on quality, a consumer's perception of good physician care, good hospital services and choices within health plans."
More choice and quality, Mr. Bowser said, spells higher cost and thus higher premiums.
Here, as elsewhere in the country, companies arrested the rise in health care costs in part by disregarding profits in a battle for big enough pools of subscribers to spread the risk among the sick and the well and to assure profits later.
"Some of the flat pricing was artificially constructed in order to gain market share," Mr. Bowser said.
In wringing waste from the system, companies also curbed consumers' choices of care, in part by halting unnecessary surgery, excessive testing and long stays in hospitals. They squeezed doctors' fees and salaries and per-patient capitation rates, often $11 or $12 a month per subscriber.
Jeffrey O. Ellis, the head health care lawyer at the Kansas City firm of Lathrop & Gage, said companies had gone too far.
"You see cuts in compensation without a sense of what the costs should be," Mr. Ellis said. "A lot of primary-care doctors in this market are being hurt very badly. It's just an irrational cut, cut, cut."
 
Good Fortune Comes To Biggest Employer
The industry's No. 1 prize here is the Sprint Corporation, the telecommunications company with 10,000 local workers to insure. Sprint is the largest private-sector employer in the two cities.
"It's a very competitive world," said Randall T. Parker, director of corporate benefits planning and strategy at Sprint. With so many contenders for the Sprint work force, the company can play one against another in bargaining for services and low premiums.
With so much bargaining clout, Sprint can hold its employees' premium increases below the 4 percent to 9 percent that the Blue Cross group is negotiating with its customers here.
But Sprint's influence and its employees' good fortune in paying stable premiums could soon evaporate. Nothing protects even such favored employers from the laws of the marketplace. As the competition among the many health plans drives out the weak, the rich variety of plans from which Sprint can choose could shrink and leave just two or three, each with enough muscle to stand up to the company.
Along with renewed pressure to raise premiums is very likely to come reductions in services.
By all accounts, the Kansas City metropolitan area has 50 percent to 60 percent more hospital beds than it needs. Yet hospitals keep opening new outposts in affluent suburbs because if they do not, some other hospital will get the patients.
The same goes for doctors.
"In general we have probably twice as many physicians as we need," said Kathryn A. Paul, president of the Rocky Mountain Division of Kaiser Permanente.
The surplus, Ms. Paul said, generates excess demand, with underemployed doctors hustling for patients.
Doctors here say that they were surprised by the onset of managed care. When it began, they became salaried workers, or they negotiated cuts in their fees and control over their services so they could keep patients who had been in managed-care plans.
Dr. Richard Hellman, an endocrinologist and diabetes specialist, said that he sometimes lost patients because they enrolled in a managed-care organization to which he did not belong. The patients will show him the doctors on the organization's list, Dr. Hellman said, and ask him to recommend one.
Initially, he said, he would call the doctor first to say he was referring the patient. But no longer.
"They'd call and say, 'Rich, please don't send those patients to me. I only get $11 a month for them,' " Dr. Hellman said.
Doctors acknowledge that in view of incomes that start at more than $100,000 a year, they cannot elicit much sympathy.
"But what most galls physicians," Dr. Hellman said, "is not being allowed to do what they think is best in terms of care. It causes much more anger than being told you'll have to take a pay cut."
The Missouri Insurance Commissioner, Jay Angoff, said, "Kansas City can handle some more consolidation."
But it could also go too far. If the few survivors shrink to one or two, Mr. Angoff said, they could exert monopolist powers, cutting corners on care and raising premiums with abandon. So the Government will have to be watchful, he said. "If the antitrust agencies are vigilant," he said, "and the consumer protection agencies are vigilant, I think we can have a pretty good system."

Russia Presses U.N. To Ease Sanctions on Iraq
Russia asked the governing board of the United Nations commission in charge of disarming Iraq to declare Baghdad free of nuclear weapons and near compliance on prohibited missiles, as a first step to easing sanctions. A1 

United Nations arms inspectors returned to Iraq to search for a supposed arsenal of biological and chemical weapons, including up to 25 Scud missiles, whose existence has been suggested by six and a half years of inspections and reconnaissance photographs. A6
 
Dissident Presses China
Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent democracy campaigner and, until last week, political prisoner, said in an interview that he will ask President Clinton to keep up the pressure on China's Communist Party rulers to free thousands of political detainees still being held. A1
 
North Korea Agrees to Talks
A delegation from North Korea has agreed to join talks in Geneva next month with the United States, South Korea and China that may bring the Korean War to a formal end, more than four decades after the fighting stopped. The North Koreans dropped their demand that the agenda for the talks include the immediate withdrawal of the 37,000 American troops stationed along the demilitarized zone in South Korea. A5
 
Clinton Urges Mideast Talks
President Clinton received a humanitarian award from Leah Rabin, the widow of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, who was assassinated two years ago for favoring the peace process with the Palestinians. Mr. Clinton warned Israelis and Palestinians that the bonds of trust were eroding and urged them to make haste to restart peace talks, which have withered in recent months. A6
 
Social Tension Mounts in Iran
Police in Iran used tear gas to disperse a crowd in the holy city of Qum, 75 miles south of Teheran, that had attacked a religious school where the director had criticized the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameni. The incident was the latest in a series of tense confrontations between forces wanting to liberalize Iranian society and others who want to keep it strictly conservative, a friction which has come increasingly into the open since the election of a relatively moderate cleric, Mohammed Khatami, as president in May. A3
 
Key Promise Given in Somalia
Somali factions promised not to attack aid workers delivering help to flood victims. Factions have kidnapped and killed aid workers in the past, leading Agostino Paganini, director of Unicef's Somalia operations, to seek such assurances. Relief agencies estimate that 2,000 Somalis have drowned and 220,000 have been forced from their homes since heavy rains began a month ago. About 80 percent of the lower region of the Juba River has flooded. (AP)

Reno Urged to Reject Independent Prosecutor
In a memo to Attorney General Janet Reno, Justice Department officials have urged her to reject an independent prosecutor to investigate fund-raising telephone calls made by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, law enforcement officials said. A1
 
Teamster Election Postponed
A Federal judge ordered a 45-day delay in this winter's teamsters' election to give investigators more time to look into accusations that the leading candidate, James P. Hoffa, son of the legendary union leader, received improper campaign contributions in the previous election. A7
 
Clinton Signs F.D.A. Overhaul
President Clinton signed into law a major overhaul for the Food and Drug Administration, saying the agency would earn "a gold medal for leading the way into the future," but he offered no indication of when he would choose someone to lead the agency on that path. A10
 
Mother Holds a Septuplet
The mother of the first septuplets born alive in the United States was able to hold one of her babies, shortly after doctors decided the boy was doing so well that he could breathe on his own, without the help of machines. Bobbi McCaughey, looking frail and a bit nervous in a royal blue bathrobe, also made her first public appearance since the babies were born on Wednesday. A7
 
Sun Satellite Malfunctions
The space shuttle Columbia's astronauts struggled in vain to capture a satellite after the craft malfunctioned moments after its release. Within an hour, NASA had lost any chance of conducting solar observations with the satellite, now or later in the mission. The space agency still wants the satellite back for reuse on a later flight, and considered another attempt to recapture it. A12
 
Arlington Names Released
Army Secretary Togo D. West Jr. released the names of 69 individuals who were given special permission to be buried at Arlington Cemetery during the Clinton Administration, in an effort to halt Republican charges that cemetery plots were traded for campaign contributions. A13
 
Court Rules on Foster Notes
A Federal appeals court declined to reconsider an earlier ruling that the notes of one of Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s last conversations with his lawyers could be surrendered to the Whitewater independent counsel because they are not absolutely protected by the lawyer-client privilege. A9
 
Mental Evidence Considered
The judge at the trial of Theodore J. Kaczynski indicated that he would permit the defense to present evidence that the man accused of being the Unabomber is mentally ill, but he indicated he might not permit testimony of defense psychiatrists who examined Mr. Kaczynski. A16

Affirmative Action Case In New Jersey Is Settled
An affirmative action case that began at a New Jersey high school and was evolving into a potentially major Supreme Court test of the role of race in the workplace ended abruptly when the parties announced an unusual financial settlement. A coalition of leading civil rights groups, not directly involved in the case but increasingly concerned that a broadly worded Supreme Court decision could prove disastrous for affirmative action, agreed to provide the major share of a $433,500 settlement that the Piscataway Township Board of Education will pay to Sharon Taxman, a white teacher whom the school board dismissed to preserve a black teacher's job. A1
 
Identity of Suspect a Mystery
Investigators pieced together most of a brief and brutal rampage across New Jersey that left one police officer dead, another wounded and the lone suspect dead, but the two central questions of the case -- the identity of the assailant and his motive for killing an officer at random -- remained a mystery.

 BODY:
The state's unemployment rate dipped to 5.2 percent in October, tying a seven-year low for the third time this year, the State Department of Labor said yesterday.
The rate, down from 5.4 percent in September, matches unemployment levels for April and August, and has not been lower since August 1990, when it hit 5.1 percent, said Kevin Smith, a department spokesman. 
 A record 65,000 jobs were created in October, the second straight record increase, Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally Globally Despite Asian Worries, and Dow Gains 54.46

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Stock markets around the globe rallied again yesterday despite persistent concerns that the economic and financial crisis that has gripped much of Asia could spread to other parts of the world.
Even as more economic troubles erupt daily along the Pacific Rim, there have been fresh signs that the nations there and the international community are moving to halt the tide of financial washouts. 
 Efforts at stemming the crisis were greeted enthusiastically in many markets. In Japan and Hong Kong, for instance, stocks surged a day after the Japanese Government said that it would move to bail out its banking sector.
Asian markets were also bolstered after South Korea said that it would ask the International Monetary Fund for an economic bailout package.
The Hong Kong stock market gained nearly 5 percent, and the Nikkei stock index in Japan climbed almost 3 percent, helping European markets, and giving an early lift to investors in the United States, where a strong recovery from the October downturn has been under way.
In the United States, stock and bond prices were strong all week, largely because the domestic economy is robust, the dollar is strong, and the markets here are viewed as a haven for global investors.
Indeed, Wall Street analysts say that American investors have turned increasingly bullish in recent weeks, and while the buying has not been as aggressive as it was earlier in the year, the markets have quickly regained their global dominance.
Yesterday, for instance, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.46 points to close at 7,881.07, pushing it up 4.1 percent on the week -- its best weekly gain in five months.
"The market got fully washed out with the problems around the world, and a lot of people cashed out a few weeks ago," said Robert F. Dickey, a technical analyst with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. "But now investors are regaining their confidence because they think a lot of that stuff in Asia won't affect us."
Indeed, most of the major American stock indexes have seen a strong recovery since the sharp plunge that took place on Oct. 27, when the Dow fell 7.2 percent, with blue-chip issues easily outpacing the broader market.
While the Dow and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have gained about 10 percent since Oct. 27, the Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks is up just 3.5 percent and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite has gained 5.6 percent.
Yesterday, however, the broader market was weak, with technology issues slumping after a big gain on Thursday. The Nasdaq fell 5.81 points, to 1,620.75, and the Russell 2000 dropped 0.15 point to close at 435.05. Several analysts said that many investors may have taken a breather yesterday after the sharp gains on Thursday, and that much of the activity was skewed by technically driven trading related to the expiration of some options and futures.
"The ups and downs of the Dow are irrelevant today," said Hildegard Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "I suspect you're seeing some major program buying."
But Ms. Zagorski and other analysts said that there appeared to be growing evidence that American investors were less troubled about the events in Asia. Mr. Dickey, at Dain Bosworth, said he believed that the American markets were benefiting from the turmoil in Asia and other emerging markets, causing global investors to seek out shares in blue-chip companies and American Treasuries here.
"There's a very poor investment climate in the Pacific Rim and so there are Japanese investors who have been buying our stocks and bonds," he said. "So much United States money had also been moved over there, and now it's moving back."
If global investors are indeed surging into the market, they may be behind the sharp gains in the prices of Treasury securities. Yesterday, the price of a 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32 , to 101 9/32 , pushing the yield down to 6.03 percent, from 6.06 percent a day earlier.
Early in the day, bond prices slumped after Susan Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor, told Bridge News that she expected the economy to continue to grow at a healthy pace, which caused many investors to worry about inflation.
But reports that Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's biggest brokerage houses, would cease operations helped lift bond prices late in the day, because many investors believe that Treasuries will continue to attract buyers fleeing the Asian turmoil.
The problems in Asia also weighed on currency. The dollar rose to 126.40 yen from 126.03 yen, bolstered by the reports about Yamaichi. The dollar fell to 1.7384 marks, from 1.7413 marks on Thursday. The pound rose to $1.6932 from $1.6880.

HEADLINE: Russians Press U.N. to Relax Iraq Sanctions

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Russia followed up on its promise to help Iraq by asking today that the country be declared free of nuclear weapons and nearly free of prohibited missiles, diplomats said.
Such declarations would bring Iraq a step closer to meeting the conditions for lifting the crushing economic sanctions imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
 The request was rebuffed when it was presented at a closed-door emergency session of the governing board of the United Nations Special Commission, which has been in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction since 1991, said diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity. The Russians were supported by the Chinese in their request.
The results of the daylong meeting will be reported to the Security Council on Saturday, when Russia is again expected to press Iraq's case.
The board said today that the issues Russia had raised were matters to be decided by the Council and not within the province of the scientific experts, diplomats reported. American officials say too many unanswered questions remain regarding both nuclear and missile arsenals to permit any serious move toward closing files.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is responsible for the nuclear monitoring in cooperation with the Special Commission, has come close to declaring Iraq free of prohibited weapons and activities, and to deciding that nuclear inspections can be phased out and routine monitoring begun.
But the United States is expected to oppose any certification that Iraq has met the requirements to have sanctions lifted, and it has the power to veto action by the Security Council. And no nation has suggested that Iraq is close to compliance requirements on biological or chemical weapons.
Russia called today's board meeting, and used it to lay out for the first time the essence of its agreement this week with Iraq, which led on Thursday to the end of a standoff with the Security Council and allowed the return today of 75 weapons inspectors, including 4 Americans.
All inspectors were pulled out of the country last week by the United Nations; they had not been able to conduct inspections since Oct. 29.
The inspectors were greeted with a banner saying "Down America" when their plane landed at an air base about 70 miles from Baghdad. But despite the triumphant reports in the official Iraqi press about a great victory, there were no demonstrations against the Americans, who expect to resume work with other inspectors on Saturday.
Only then will it be possible to begin assessing what damage may have been done to the sophisticated monitoring system in Iraq during the period in which on-site inspections were blocked.
At the United Nations, Richard Butler, executive chairman of the disarmament commission, said the fact that six Americans had left Baghdad last week under an Iraqi expulsion order and only four entered the country today was the result of a "normal rotation" of staff, not any concession to Iraqi demands to lower the proportion of Americans on the teams.
At the commission board's meeting today, Russia raised the issue of adding non-Americans, including Chinese experts, who are not represented now, in an effort to increase the size of the teams and lower the proportion of Americans. In Washington, officials were puzzled as to why the issue of U-2 flights over Iraq had not been raised. The Iraqis had threatened to shoot down U-2's patrolling the country's no-flight zones, but seem to have dropped their objections to the spy planes.
Iraq has accused the United States of using the U-2's for old-fashioned spying, but both Washington and the United Nations commission reply that the flights are part of the mandated overt inspections.
Sixteen of 21 Special Commission board members attended today's session, and 14 of them closed ranks against the Russian-Chinese attempt to advance Iraq's case through the board, which is intended to make only highly technical decisions.
The Russians are expected to continue urging that ways be found to graduate Iraq piece by piece from a very intrusive inspection system to the kind of monitoring that any nation falls under as party to international disarmament treaties. As soon as that shift can be made in all four areas -- nuclear, chemical, biological and missiles -- Iraq would have overcome the biggest hurdle to the lifting of the embargo that prohibits it from selling oil or importing freely.
"The Russians have said to us that what they're going to do is take up the case of the Iraqis at the Security Council," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said on NBC's Today show this morning.
Ms. Albright appeared to show a trace of unease with Moscow when she was asked on the program if she trusted the Russians. "Well, I can't say that," she replied. Later she corrected herself by saying she did not mean to say that. But Administration officials seemed to be scrambling to fathom what, if anything, the Russians may have promised Iraq beyond what has become known today at the United Nations.
"We've taken a small step in the right direction, because Saddam Hussein has reversed course," Ms. Albright said. "But we're being very vigilant."
Iraq has used the attention and publicity generated by this crisis to maximum diplomatic advantage. Today, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, President Hussein's spokesman in the outside world, made the first trip to Syria by any Iraqi official since 1980. The two nations broke off relations when Syria helped Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. "I think the world better understands Iraq's cause," Mr. Aziz said in Damascus today.
In New York, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative at the United Nations, has also been talking about the most important benefits Iraq has gained from this showdown. He said Iraq had been able to reverse its decisions about the inspectors only because of the Russian commitment to its cause and the support it received from France, China and Egypt.
Mr. Hamdoon also mentioned "the hearing we've had in the last few days -- the audience worldwide that has heard our views."
The United States is not easing its military pressure on Iraq. Today, as American inspectors returned to Baghdad, American military reinforcements continued to move into the Persian Gulf. When all the additional aircraft, ships and air-defense units arrive this weekend, about 30,000 American troops will be in the region. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said this week that the forces would stay until Iraq was in full compliance with its obligations.
The British aircraft carrier Invincible is in the Mediterranean, with 15 Harrier jets on board.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, an article on Saturday about economic sanctions against Iraq misstated the year they were imposed and referred incorrectly to Iraqi threats of retaliation. The sanctions began after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, not at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The Iraqi authorities threatened to shoot down American U-2 surveillance planes wherever they might fly over Iraq, not only over areas where the United States and other allies have forbidden Iraqi planes.

 Perhaps because of his pensive nature or because of his mother's admonition to shun publicity "for she knew how easily it could distort," Laurance Spelman Rockefeller is generally no more than a background figure in the more than 200 books that have been written about his family. Robin W. Winks brings him to the foreground and gives him his due in an engrossing biography that is at the same time a perceptive assessment of the influence of environmental philanthropy on government policy.
Laurance Rockefeller was born in 1910 in New York City, the fourth of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's six children. Educated at Princeton University, with one year at Harvard Law School, he was deeply impressed by two forces in his early life: his father, who had lavished gifts of money and land to establish Grand Teton and other national parks; and the raw power of the Western landscape. In 1924 and 1926, Laurance accompanied his father on extended trips to the West. They were, Winks says in "Laurance S. Rockefeller: Catalyst for Conservation," "a kind of laying on of hands, a passing of the torch in the interests of conservation and historical preservation." Now 87, Rockefeller has made the giving away of his money, and the devotion of his time to environmental goals, his primary business. Winks reconstructs the careful mental notes that he took when his father's $17.5 million investment in the late 1920's and early 1930's in Grand Teton National Park infuriated Wyoming ranchers, who saw it as a "plotting between that outsider and the Federal Government." The experience convinced him that money and bold dreams in the public interest could be seen as both a blessing and a threat. In the nearly seven decades since, no American environmental philanthropist has understood better the dynamics of political advocacy, and none has accomplished more.
Rockefeller donated millions to expand the Grand Teton park, helped to form Redwood National Park in northern California and contributed land and buildings in Woodstock, Vt., to establish Marsh-Billings National Historical Park. But Winks argues that his greatest work came in the late 1950's and early 1960's, as chairman of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission, charged by President Eisenhower with making an inventory of the nation's recreational needs in the face of the postwar population surge. In 1962, the commission called for increasing the number of national parks and wilderness areas, protecting national seashores and lakeshores and taking quick action to reduce water pollution. Perhaps no other American environmental commission produced such a persuasive case for action. Congress passed laws to protect Cape Cod and other scenic coastal areas. The 1964 Wilderness Act enlarged the system of federally protected wild areas. The 1968 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act safeguarded the nation's most beautiful rivers. The Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund was established to purchase recreational lands.
Winks's sympathetic portrait raises few criticisms. Notably lacking is a more thorough discussion of Rockefeller's missteps in the 1960's, when he enraged property owners by calling for an Adirondack National Park, and when he supported a ruinous hydroelectric pump storage project in the Hudson Valley. Such lapses, though, are outweighed by the book's pertinent conclusions. Not the least of these is celebrating the impact of wealth, ideas and personality focused on socially useful goals.
In "The Hunter's Game: Poachers and Conservationists in Twentieth-Century America," Louis S. Warren probes the other end of the economic and political spectrum. He reports on the civic conflict that erupted at the turn of the century when wildlife became defined as a community resource, and for the first time game management was brought under government control. In exploring who gained -- wealthy outdoorsmen -- and who lost -- working-class hunters and Native Americans -- Warren helps explain the aversion to government resource management that lingers in rural America.
Warren tells the story with competently drawn reports of the nasty fights between government agents and hunters in New Mexico, Montana and especially western Pennsylvania. In 1906, the body of Seely Houk, a Pennsylvania wildlife officer, was discovered in the Mahoning River with shotgun wounds in head and torso. He had been ruthlessly enforcing the state's new game laws by targeting Italian immigrants who depended on subsistence hunting to feed themselves. Such men could afford neither the new $10 license fee the state required nor the $25 fines for hunting without a license, half of which Houk took for himself. Houk's death, it turns out, was motivated by revenge.
Warren, an assistant professor of history at the University of San Diego, says Houk's death symbolized the clash between the immigrant community's traditional notion that its members could hunt at will and a new system of conservation prompted by the rampant clear-cutting of Eastern forests that had ravaged wildlife habitat. Game was being managed as a public resource, mostly for the benefit of recreational hunters from the city, but local residents, who knew wildlife migration patterns and were successful hunters, were unwilling to accept restrictions that generally were enforced with a heavy hand. Warren argues persuasively that hunting regulations caused enduring political restiveness because they represented "one of the most startling examples of how the nation acquired power over the most intimate of relationships between people and nature."
Almost a century later, the animosity endures. The issue today, as Warren aptly puts it, is the extent to which the United States "can act as a community," and thus decide which resources are a "true national commons," to share rather than exploit.

ILLUSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY
 The American Dream in Question.
 By John E. Schwarz.
 237 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $23.95. 
 Try to get American economists into a discussion of justice and morality, and most of them fidget. Ask what should an economy achieve, and the conversation somehow shifts into how an economy works. Goals become intertwined with mechanics. And the public debate focuses not on some moral vision of what should be but on what is. Or, more precisely, on what prevailing economic theory holds to be the limits of prosperity.
The ancestors of modern economics recognized goals. In "The Wealth of Nations," Adam Smith argued that workers should be well paid because when they are, they are "more active, diligent, and expeditious." The supply and demand for workers may regulate wage levels, but what wages are is not a sufficient guide for what wages should be. Most modern economists don't make this distinction between the is and the should be, although a few, like Amartya Sen at Harvard University, lament this failure.
Theory is vital, Sen agrees. We need to know how economies function. But knowing what levers to pull to make an economy grow, or even achieving ideal growth, is not the same thing as achieving the life we want to live or constructing the society we want to inhabit. Economists don't talk about such things, and by not talking about them, Sen says, "something is lost."
One must go outside economics to make up that loss, and "Illusions of Opportunity" is a good place to start. The author, John E. Schwarz, a political scientist at the University of Arizona, sets forth what he considers a just and imperative goal. Economics in his scheme becomes a tool for achieving the goal, and a means of gauging how far short we fall. Schwarz attempts, in effect, to meld economics and moral standards -- an exercise that Sen, a former president of the American Economics Association, and a few other economists, like Robert Heilbroner, the economics historian, applaud.
Undoubtedly there are holes in Schwarz's economics. Some readers may also take issue with his chief goal. Almost certainly, many will challenge the dozen proposals he offers for reaching it. What is unassailable, however, is his approach. He insists that economics must function within a broader framework. That should be obvious, but it isn't for a public numbed by the current debates over inflation and unemployment, technology and productivity, global markets and wages -- as if the right mix would produce, ipso facto, the right goals.
"Illusions of Opportunity" is a straightforward, easy-to-follow 150-page essay. Digressions into technical aspects of Schwarz's argument are relegated to three appendixes and reference notes, occupying 50 more pages. The chief moral goal is stated early on and restated in almost every chapter. "What unites us in the present and, in turn, unites the present with the past," Schwarz writes, is a single, deeply rooted belief: that "every hard-working person who perseveres can find a respected place" in society.
Put another way, if James Madison and the other Founding Fathers returned today, "they would ask how well the nation measures up to the precept that the opportunity to attain economic independence and advancement be available to all citizens."
That is a different concept from the calculation of a person's worth in the marketplace. By Schwarz's "equal moral worth" standard, society becomes obligated to create not only enough jobs for everyone who seeks work, but jobs that pay well enough to lift "households into the mainstream." That is the just goal imposed by America's tradition, he argues. It is not to be left to the supply and demand for labor, which is not "a conclusive measure of either the value of people's contributions to others or of the degree of effort they have expended."
Turning to economics, Schwarz, who is also the author of "America's Hidden Success: A Reassessment of 20 Years of Public Policy," and, with Thomas J. Volgy, "The Forgotten Americans," calculates that since the 1950's the United States has lacked a sufficient number of good jobs and that the shortfall is increasing despite strong economic growth. The calculation is complicated and not easy to follow, which is unfortunate. The bottom line, in Schwarz's view, seems to be that the typical four-member household (parents and two children) needs at least one person earning $27,000 a year, in today's dollars, for a minimally acceptable livelihood. The shortfall in the number of such jobs now available is 16 million or more, he estimates.
The 16 million figure allows for the thousands of households in which two or more people each occupy a job that pays about $27,000. That cannot be changed; good jobs cannot be rationed, one to every household. In theory, a husband could hold a $16,000 job and his wife one paying $11,000 and meet the minimum that way. But in practice, child-care costs and other extra expenses that come with both parents working would eat up too much of the second paycheck. Dignity and independence require at least one $27,000-a-year job in every household.
These numbers could be wrong. Certainly they should be analyzed and debated. But Schwarz's line of reasoning is correct. While normal economic growth has created millions of adequately paying jobs over the years, and will continue to do so, the private sector alone cannot generate the full quota, he writes. Government action, greater than what government already does, is necessary.
Mr. Schwarz's proposals -- laws that strengthen unions, for example, a higher minimum wage, government child-support payments -- are not the last word. But the public debate won't take on much urgency as long as it remains simply a discussion of what economics says is feasible, without the added pressure of having to fulfill a moral obligation.

DIVIDED HIGHWAYS
 Building the Interstate Highways, Transforming American Life.
 By Tom Lewis.
 Viking, $27.95. 
 Tom Lewis sets out to offer a comprehensive account of the construction of America's superhighways, from the era when it took young Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower and an Army convoy 62 days to traverse the United States, to the bitter battles over the massive roadways that lacerated American cities under President Eisenhower's Interstate program. The story of the technical, financial and political achievements of building the highways, and the sweeping cultural, economic and social revolutions they have wrought, is simply too ambitious for the 354 pages Lewis takes to tell it. "Divided Highways" touches on several themes: the tension between urban development and preservation, the unending tug of war between the Federal Government and states' rights, the eternal struggles of man against man and of man against nature. But too often Lewis, who teaches English at Skidmore College, speeds past places in his history where a reader might like to linger and learn more. At other times, his side trips -- into the racism blacks once endured on the motorways or the climate of protest fueled by Vietnam and Watergate -- often seem beside the point. He never seems to develop his thesis beyond the idea that superhighways have brought good things (prosperity, convenience, community) and bad things (noise, pollution, conformity). Much the same can be said of the 20th century's many other technical revolutions, from the airplane to the Internet. Joseph R. Gregory

Safety Tips for Winter Driving

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
IF winter driving is your thing, there is a special school for you in Steamboat Springs, Colo., where for $225 you can get a day's instruction and practice in braking, skidding and staying alive on hills of pure ice. If, like most of us, you drive in the winter because you have no choice, there are some less difficult ways to enhance your safety.
Cars, roads, laws and drivers have all been changing rapidly in recent years. With more four-wheel-drive vehicles on the road, with a deteriorating Interstate system and speed limits again rising above 55 miles an hour, with new brake systems that may not be well understood and with the ubiquity of cell phones in cars, the old rules from driver's ed may no longer do the job. With messy weather hampering the trip to grandmother's house, this is probably a good time to improve your knowledge of road safety. 
 George Denning, an experienced teacher for Driver Training Associates of New York City, who tests and trains school bus drivers as well as others, has some suggestions that do not require driving over an iced one-mile course that would make your hair stand on end.
Since traction -- the key to control and to stopping in time -- is a main concern, Mr. Denning suggests attention to your tires before the weather gets bad. They should have an adequate tread and should be correctly inflated. Mr. Denning says it is a myth that underinflated tires work best on slippery surfaces; like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, he says that under inflated tires merely heat up, increasing the possibility of a blowout. Most experts say that the correct inflation level is specified in the manual that came with the car; if this is gone, try reading the sidewalls. A gauge is a big help in getting the inflation right in various temperatures.
If new tires are needed, the Highway Traffic Safety Administration issues A, B and C ratings on the traction abilities of various brands and models of tires. The potential life of the tread on various brand-name tires and their temperature resistance are also rated. These ratings, plus other information, are available on the highway traffic safety agency's Web site at www.nhtsa.dot.gov, and by fax through an automated ordering line: (800) 424-9393. Both of these sources have extensive information on general driving safety.
 
The Sport Utility Vehicle
A recent change in traffic safety is a result of the rise in sport utility vehicles on the road. Because they are higher and heavier, they handle differently and, Mr. Denning notes, frequently their owners are not prepared for the higher center of gravity and other changes that affect handling. An important matter in winter is that these heavy vehicles need more space to stop, and the four-wheel drive that most of them have is no help in this respect. Meantime, he points out, their drivers speed along, feeling powerful and safe.
Federal crash statistics reported this year show that in crashes involving sport utility vehicles and standard cars, 80 percent of the fatalities are in the cars. This means that drivers in cars need to use all their defensive driving techniques to avoid being in a collision with the bigger vehicles.
Mark Cox, an owner of the Bridgestone Winter Driving School in Steamboat Springs, reminds drivers of ordinary cars that they are more maneuverable and, as the sport utility vehicle is sliding, a car with tires of equal traction may be able to get out of the way. "Usually a snowbank will be softer to hit than another car, if that's the choice," Mr. Cox said.
For lighter cars with rear-wheel drive, Mr. Denning suggests some added weight in the trunk to improve traction -- it is needed where the power goes. He suggests bricks as easy to install and remove. A bag of sand is heavy, and the sand itself may be useful for getting out of a bad spot, but he says sand is nearly impossible to get out of the car once the bag is opened or breaks. At minimum, a bag of sand should be enclosed in a tough plastic bag to prevent leaks. He suggests a flasher lantern or reflective triangles that can be set up on the roadside in the event of a breakdown; he says emergency flares can burn out before the problem is solved.
The windshield wiper fluid should be checked and filled, Mr. Denning says, and an extra gallon jug should be taken along. The wipers themselves may bear replacing. This expert's packing list for an extended winter auto trip also includes a blanket. "You can't run the engine too long to stay warm," he said.
The Bridgestone school, which is sponsored by the Bridgestone/Firestone tire company, recommends driving in the cold with one window slightly open to keep you awake and the windows clear. "Avoid large bulky boots, gloves and coats," the school's teachers say, "and never drive in ski boots."
Once in motion, Bridgestone and Mr. Denning agree, proceed slowly, with caution, in changing conditions. The first part of a storm is the most dangerous.
 
How to Handle a Skid
How to use the brakes in a skid is a core question in winter driving. And of course, this depends on whether the auto has antilocking brakes or not. Mr. Denning says accidents caused by improper use of antilocking brakes have declined as drivers have been educated in their use. But if it is a rental car, the driver should learn before starting out which type of brakes the auto has. It's better than a 50 percent likelihood that the rental-car brakes are the antilock type; that's what the "ABS" emblem on the dashboard means. Antilocking brakes should not be pumped; they do their own pumping, which produces an unexpected vibration. The system is designed to avoid loss of steering control if wheels lock up.
At Bridgestone, experts teach both types of brakes; the school says trained drivers can stop a car faster by pumping hard on conventional brakes than they can with an antilocking system. Hal Clifford, an Aspen writer who wrote about the course for the physicians' magazine Diversion, said he learned that pumping the brakes was not a "subtle massaging," but meant lifting the foot and then pounding the pedal hard to the floor. Mr. Denning says this requires feet-on training that cannot be achieved in a classroom.
Bridgestone gets students from corporations and Government agencies, but will accept others for half-day courses ($125) as well as the full days. It also sells its manual and introductory video, "Why Skid?," which is replete with commercials for the school and its sponsor's tires, for $31. Bridgestone: (800) 949-7543.
 
Air Bags and Cell Phones
Driving-safety issues in general continue to focus on air bags, seat belts and child restraint. The experts concur that children are safest in the back seat and in their safety seats or, if they are large enough, seat belts. They are farther from the front windshield and not near the passenger-side air bag, if the car has one. Infants in rear-facing child seats should never ride in a front passenger seat where there is an air bag. If a larger child must ride in that seat because there is no other seat, it is imperative that the child remain in the seat belt. Smaller adults should take steps to avoid danger from the fast-deploying air bags.
At this time of year, the A.A.A. gathers data from the states about changes in their driving laws: the 1998 edition of "Digest of Motor Laws" is due out in February. Kay Hamada, the editor, notes only three major child-restraint changes in the data reported so far. In Florida children up to the age of 16 must be belted in the back seat if they are beyond the age to use a safety seat; the law formerly covered children only to the age of 6. Tennessee has also raised its top age for mandatory back-seat belt use, to 12; the law formerly ended at age 4. Minnesota has raised its age to 16 from 11. In all these cases, the law covers drivers from out of state.
Charles A. Butler, director of the traffic safety department of the A.A.A., believes that raising the age limit this way is the trend in states where the law still allows children to ride unbelted in the back seat once they are too old or too large for safety seats.
The 1997 edition of the "Digest of Motor Laws" continues to be sold by local auto clubs for $8.85; by mail it is $11.95. Orders should be sent to Kay Hamada, Mail Stop 76, 1000 A.A.A. Drive, Heathrow, Fla. 32746. The 1998 price will be the same.
An area of increased interest is the use of cellular phones by drivers. Mr. Butler and Ms. Hamada have an entry for each state under the heading "cellular phone," but so far there are no prohibitions reported, although there are requirements in some places that at least one ear be uncovered or one hand be on the wheel.
A recent study made for the Rochester Institute of Technology found the accident rate for drivers with car phones 34 percent higher than for those without. This study got attention from several legislatures.
Wisconsin was aroused by a fatal crash caused by a driver who was reading blueprints while talking on a car phone, according to Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. As a result, a coalition of public and private groups, including Mr. Nelson's group and the Motorola company, began a campaign this month to educate "distracted drivers" through public service announcements and billboards. It is called "Who's Driving?"
In summary Mr. Denning said the most important thing to remember was: "Be courteous. Treat the other driver as you want to be treated."

BYLINE: By Serge Schmemann; Serge Schmemann, the Times's bureau chief in Jerusalem, is the author of "Echoes of a Native Land: Two Centuries of a Russian Village."

 BODY:
The atmosphere is both frantic and informal at the Tel Aviv office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the sprawling Defense Ministry compound, in the best tradition of Israeli politics. Assistants in jeans and bodyguards in safari jackets mill about talking loudly; cell phones jangle, and ministers and aides in open-collar shirts dart in and out through Netanyahu's padded door, all somehow controlled by Ruchama Avraham, the Prime Minister's tall, striking secretary. There is always a crisis these days, and on this day it is the buildup to the annual meeting of the Likud central committee, whose 2,700 members want to ditch the primary election system and take back the power to pick candidates.
Netanyahu is also preparing to go to the United States, not knowing whether he will be snubbed by President Clinton over the impasse in peace negotiations, and where he is certain to catch hell from American Jews embittered at being rebuffed by the Orthodox religious establishment in Israel. This is also the second anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, and Netanyahu, the rightist Likud Prime Minister, is being thrashed daily by leftist protesters accusing him of destroying the peace that cost Rabin his life. 
 During a brief break for a sandwich, Netanyahu shows no sign of these pressures. As usual, his jacket is on and his tie is drawn tight. He does not lose his temper in public. He speaks in English, rapidly but in elaborate, complete sentences. He is known to enjoy an occasional Davidoff cigar, but seldom in public and never before cameras. This is a man who has constructed his political image carefully and maintains it studiously.
Of course, in Israel crisis is "the name of the game" even in the best of times, Netanyahu notes. Yet his 17 months in office have been about as stormy a stretch in peacetime as anyone can recall. Rare is the day without some new political or diplomatic conflagration, with charges of "incitement" or "warmongering" flung with increasing abandon. The Prime Minister's critics, and they are increasingly angry and vocal, hold him directly responsible for the malaise, assailing him for his inexperience, arrogance and incompetence. Netanyahu and his followers counter that these are the bleats of tired elites challenged by new forces.
"Israel is coming of age," he says. "It's not a pioneer society any more. The elites cannot give way; they cannot accept me as legitimate. They see the country as their natural right; they see me as a usurper." However Netanyahu's performance is rated, that notion of "us" and "them," of this Government as a coalition of outsiders -- Sephardim, Russian immigrants, ultra-Orthodox Jews -- behind a qualitatively new type of slick, media-savvy politician, represents the emergence of a new political force as a mature Israel enters its second half-century.
The clean new tenements clinging to the steep hillsides of Har Nof on the western edge of Jerusalem are Sephardi turf. You can tell by the Middle Eastern chants wafting from the Succoth huts, by the dark complexions, by the clothes, that these are Jews from North Africa and the Middle East. Here the men wear black skullcaps, but not the long sidelocks or medieval black coats of the European haredim, and the women have a touch of Levantine glitter in their floor-length gowns. And if there is any lingering doubt, there are the portraits of the most revered resident of Har Nof, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, the leader of the powerful Sephardi religious movement, Shas, hanging like religious icons in every shop and on many a door.
This is also Bibi turf, at least for now. Unlike the bourgeois residents of Rehavia or the yuppies of the German Colony who refer to Netanyahu by his nickname disdainfully, out here in Har Nof people use "Bibi" with a rough familiarity. "Bibi's big achievement is that he holds his ground," says Moshe Yaffe, a religious man in his 30's out for a smoke in the street. "Of course it angers the world and the newspapers. But it's also obvious that Bibi's line is the same as that of the Great Ones of the Torah -- peace with security. Personally? He has problems. But people don't care. The main thing is he holds his ground."
Holding one's ground, out here, means against the Arabs, against the outside world and above all against "the left" -- the elite descendants of original kibbutzniks, the secular rich of Tel Aviv, the news media. "It's only the left who won't let him get the job done," declares Avner Azulai, a 55-year-old grocer who was born in Morocco. "He's strong. He holds on to his views," says Moti Yehuda, 26, to concurring nods from a clutch of customers. "So far, nothing has budged him."
What about the bungled attempt to kill a Hamas official in Jordan, and the torrent of condemnation at home and abroad? "I don't take the criticism in the papers seriously," says Yehuda's brother Eli, 30. "It was a screw-up, that's all. They jump on him no matter what he does. If Bibi would've killed 100 Arabs like Peres did in Lebanon, they would've flipped completely." The reference was to the strike against Lebanon in April 1996, when Shimon Peres was Prime Minister, in which Israeli artillery killed scores of Lebanese civilians taking refuge in a United Nations camp; in fact, Peres did not come under heavy criticism.
There's raw political power in sentiments like these, and nobody knows it better than Benjamin Netanyahu. They are what brought him to power 17 months ago, under the controversial slogan spread by the Hassidic Habad movement -- "Bibi is good for the Jews." More and more, as Netanyahu emerges intact and combative from one seemingly fatal political tangle after another, Israelis are coming to realize that however fractious his coalition, the ethnic, religious and social minorities that form his Government are not a passing phenomenon but a hard political reality. A growing number of analysts -- some of Netanyahu's sharpest critics among them -- believe it is an alliance that could keep him in office well into the next century.
"In other countries, as the opposition here is fond of saying, a Government with so many mistakes to its 'credit' would have been toppled long ago," wrote the columnist Gideon Samet in Haaretz, a leading liberal newspaper. "Maybe in other countries, but not here. . . .The partners in his injurious Government -- the decrepit parties as well as the new ones -- will see to it that the youngest Prime Minister in our history will not also be the one with the shortest term."
Even if Netanyahu is ousted by some crisis yet to come or if he is compelled to form a "national unity" government with the Labor Party, the arithmetic of the electorate suggests the groups that dominate the Israeli Government today -- parties of Sephardim, the religious, Golan Heights residents, Russian immigrants, supporters of Foreign Minister David Levy or of Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan -- will, in various configurations, determine national policy for some time to come. That is likely to mean more efforts by the rabbis to expand their power, more infighting over shrinking Government subsidies and deep-seated suspicion in dealings with the Palestinians and other Arabs. In effect, it means that with or without Netanyahu, the next Government is likely to be very much like this one.
If further proof is needed, it is provided in Har Nof, as Ehud Barak, the leader of the Labor opposition, emerges from a two-hour call on Rabbi Yosef. Such holiday visits to revered rabbis have always been a routine courtesy. Now they have become a mandatory rite. Arieh Deri, the young political genius behind Shas, coldly dispels any doubt as he watches Barak's armored Cadillac roar off. "He knows he needs to pay Rabbi Yosef the respect he deserves," he says with an unconscious nod to "The Godfather." "Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef has 10 mandates in the Knesset, and influence far beyond that. We established in the last election that whoever went against us, or even not with us, stayed in the opposition."
Barak knows this as well as Netanyahu. There was a time when Barak might have claimed the prime ministry virtually as his birthright, as the flower of the founding Zionist elite. He is a kibbutznik-warrior anointed as heir apparent by the hallowed Yitzhak Rabin; a former Army Chief of Staff with a formidable list of martial feats and decorations, and a classical pianist with a reputation as an intellectual. But nowadays such elitist attributes are almost a handicap, in the way that his patrician birth and Yale pedigree were for George Bush. Instead of flaunting his origins, Barak recently created a stir when he publicly apologized to Sephardi Jews for their treatment by the East European Ashkenazi founders of the state. Some veteran Laborites have grumbled that Barak is hanging back in his criticism of the Likud Government policies; that instead of promoting the traditional Labor agenda, he is trying to "out-Bibi Bibi."
Paradoxically, this new power of the religious and ethnic groupings arose as a direct result of efforts to block it. Ever since Menachem Begin first mobilized the discontent of the outsiders to break Labor's grip on power in May 1977, small parties and caucuses have played a pivotal role in Israeli politics. Shas, arguably the most powerful such faction today, began as a movement of poor Jewish immigrants from Morocco, Iraq, Yemen and other Arab lands. The ultra-Orthodox haredim, whose rabbis initially opposed the formation of a Jewish state, took some decades to appreciate the power of their solid blocs of votes to gain housing and funds for their swiftly swelling numbers and control over national religious matters for their rabbis. Then came the waves of immigrants from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. When Labor under Yitzhak Rabin returned to power in 1992, it was only by virtue of Russian voters who felt they had not received their due from the Likud.
With politics more and more subject to the demands of these lobbies, Rabin's Government pushed through a new electoral system, under which the Prime Minister would be chosen directly by the voters rather than by the Parliament. The notion was to free him of constant threats to his Government by small parties. It is noteworthy in retrospect that Netanyahu broke ranks with his Likud Party to get the law through. Under the old system, it would have been Labor, with the largest number of seats, that would have formed the ruling coalition.
The greater surprise was how the 1996 election strengthened the ethnic and religious parties. The major parties, Labor and Likud, together ended up with a bare majority in the Knesset. What the new system's architects failed to foresee was how voters, having cast one "responsible" ballot for the main candidate of either major party, Netanyahu or Shimon Peres, would cast their second along ethnic or religious lines. To form his Government, Netanyahu had to cut deals with six small parties and two factions. Of the 68 seats his coalition holds in the Knesset, 36 belong to the small parties, of which two -- Shas with 10 seats and the National Religious Party with 9 -- have enough votes by themselves to bring down the Government. The result is a Prime Minister less accountable to the Parliament or his party, presiding over a Cabinet dominated by special interests, forever locked in paralyzing wrangles over spoils and policies.
Internecine fighting broke out immediately after the election over the spoils -- especially the Ministries of Housing, Religion and Education -- and has continued over every policy decision and budget cut. Foreign Minister David Levy has led the pack with regular threats to resign. In one recent interview, a Cabinet minister repeatedly referred to the Government as "them" until he was reminded that he was actually part of it.
"Obviously this is a source of instability," Netanyahu says. "What it does is to create a lot of false brinkmanship -- the Government is about to fall every five minutes. But in the end they end up passing everything. We got record budget cuts; we've privatized 30 times more than the last Government; we pulled out of Hebron, released women terrorists. And we'll reach a final settlement with the Palestinians."
Netanyahu survives the showdowns because none of the small parties are in any hurry to call new elections or to change the voting system back. Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet disident, current Minister of Industry and Trade and erstwhile friend of the Prime Minister, soon learned that political survival was far more ambivalent morally in the new Government than it was in the Gulag. When an influence-peddling scandal known as the Bar-On affair broke last winter, Sharansky indignantly declared that if even 10 percent was true, he would leave the Government. When the Attorney General eventually found that many of the allegations had substance but that the evidence was too weak to sustain indictments, Sharansky discovered that the Russian immigrants who elected him had no interest in bringing the Government down. He declared that his criteria for remaining in the Government had been satisfied -- earning, in the process, the caustic title of "Mr. 10 Percent" from disappointed liberals.
The Government survived that crisis, just as it survived the more recent ruckus over the botched Mossad attempt to kill a Hamas official in Jordan. In that affair, Netanyahu went on a snarling offensive -- as he does whenever he comes under fire -- accusing the press of a campaign to "overthrow" him (even though Israeli coverage of the Jordan blunder was relatively tame) and vowing that the war with terrorism would go on, as if the issue were the campaign against terrorism and not his mishandling of it. Infuriating as such tactics are to his critics, they work with his constituency, in part because people like Yehuda Moti enjoy it when Netanyahu "holds his ground" and in part because his coalition partners have no interest in bringing him down. As the columnist Gideon Samet wrote, "The crux of the matter is not the fact that Bibi always manages to extricate himself from his mess, but rather that his coalition partners do not want to part with him."
It would be wrong, however, to see the coalition purely as an alliance of convenience. Netanyahu and his partners do have common ground. They share a deep-seated distrust of the Oslo peace agreements and "the Arabs"; they see security as a product more of strength than of peace, and they share a resentment of what they collectively call the "left," a term that embraces those who support the Oslo agreements as well as the entrenched secular and liberal elites descended from early European Jewish kibbutzniks who still predominate in Israel's culture, economy and media.
On a recent visit to a venerable Sephardic spiritual leader, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, Netanyahu leaned over and whispered in his ear: "Leftists have forgotten what it is to be Jewish. They think they will put security in the hands of Arabs -- that Arabs will look out for us." A lurking Radio Israeli microphone caught the statement, and the left exploded in fury. Such sentiments, declared Hemi Shalev in the daily Maariv, "expose anew the dark side of Benjamin Netanyahu where cynicism, bullying and hate rule." The Prime Minister belatedly apologized. Yet he is keenly aware that such incidents bolster him with his voters. "I carry the brunt of personal attacks," he says. "It takes a big toll on my family. But it obviously creates a backlash. I only lose votes to myself."
The results of the 1996 election have led to considerable discussion among students of Israeli politics. Shlomo Hasson, professor of geography and urban planning at Hebrew University, called it a "cultural tribalism" and its manifestation an "Israeli archipelago" of separate identities -- the Sephardic Jews of Shas, the haredim of the ultra-Orthodox parties, the Russian immigrants of the Yisrael B'Aliya Party, the religious nationalists of the National Religious Party, the secular nationalists of the Likud, the secular liberals of Labor. Ehud Sprinzak, professor of political science at Hebrew University, describes Netanyahu's coalition as a new "soft right," one that does not necessarily share the nationalism or messianic Zionism of the "hard right" but that is united by a "negative identity" of suspicion for Arabs and the left.
However it's dubbed, Netanyahu's rise on this new wave has the cafe society of Tel Aviv in a rage -- along with the likes of King Hussein of Jordan, a growing number of American Jews and, behind a diplomatic veneer, the Clinton Administration. No Israeli Prime Minister, not even the unyielding hard-liner Yitzhak Shamir, has ever inspired such derision. To the Israeli establishment, Netanyahu's administration has been one relentless series of blunders, ranging from the three-day shootout with the Palestinians over the opening of an entrance to a tunnel in the Old City to the tawdry Bar-On affair to the Mossad's bungled assassination attempt. He is called the "Teflon Prime Minister" for his ability to slip away from any crisis or, in a more up-to-date formulation, the "virtual Prime Minister" for the sound bites and poses he so masterfully adopts on television. "Serial bungler," the brutal label recently stuck on Netanyahu by The Economist magazine, is regularly echoed in the suburban salons of Tel Aviv.
Columnists denounce his Government as a threat to peace and even to the very foundations of liberal democracy. Shalev of Maariv has drawn elaborate parallels between Netanyahu, with his distrustfulness and dependence on a tight group of loyalists, and Richard Nixon. Yoel Marcus, a columnist for Haaretz who probes new levels of disdain in every article, declared recently that the Prime Minister and his clutch of aides were sliding Israel toward disaster. "My hand shakes as I write these words, but the facts speak for themselves," he wrote. "Bibi's regime is a rare breed of totalitarianism. He does not rely on bayonets or secret police or mass arrests. He leans towards the Peronist technique of a regime built on demogogic populism that claims to be for the people and to work on their behalf but which, in reality, has as its central goal the concentration of power and, under which, the people are the primary victims."
Among the critics, Netanyahu is held primarily responsible for bringing the Oslo process to a halt, and maybe to its knees, and for undermining the long and arduous process of building contacts in the Arab world. The only debate is whether he did so by design or through incompetence -- whether, in the devastating image of the peace advocate Uri Avneri, he is "snake or idiot." To many, the bumbled raid into Jordan was the epitome of incompetence -- an adventure that alienated Israel's last friend in the Arab world, King Hussein, and undermined its only negotiating partner among the Palestinians, Yasir Arafat.
With Washington, Netanyahu's relations have been hurt as much by his policies as by his attitude, which he once inadvertently revealed when he referred to the United States as a "strategic asset." President Clinton was said to be especially exasperated at one meeting when, instead of candidly discussing what to do as partners, Netanyahu pulled out maps and lectured the President on Israel's security needs. "All he does at these meetings is tell us that we have to pressure Arafat to accept his plan," says an astounded American official. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was incensed recently when Netanyahu surprised her by announcing approval for 300 new housing units in a West Bank settlement, just after they had finished a telephone conversation in which he made no mention of the plan.
The attacks no longer come only from the "left" or from abroad, however. Many in the old guard of Netanyahu's own Likud Party have also turned on him. By no coincidence, the only two Ministers who have quit the Government in disputes with Netanyahu are both hereditary "princes" of the Likud, Ze'ev (Benny) Begin and Dan Meridor. With Shamir and other veteran Likudniks, they have joined in assailing Netanyahu for arrogance and inexperience.
To Netanyahu, these attacks are not a reflection of his record but the rear-guard action of sworn ideological foes dedicated to his overthrow. "It would be an understatement to say that there are people who don't love me and who want to undermine my legitimacy as Prime Minister," he declared in distinctly Nixonian tones after he escaped indictment in the Bar-On affair. "The attacks against me derive from one main purpose. They are an attempt to overthrow the Government because of a basic disagreement on the part of our rivals with our path.. . . They will not succeed." He argues that the sorry state of the peace process is not his doing but the result of an ill-conceived step-by-step plan in which the easy steps were taken before he came and the difficult or impossible steps were left to him.
"I'm always impressed with the speed at which history is rewritten," he says with deep sarcasm. "You'd have to think that the Israeli people are absolutely crazy. Why did they elect me after they had such a wonderful four years, when they had such an idyllic situation? It was a wonderful time. They had peace. Of course the world was patting them on the back for a while, as long as we didn't attack Lebanon or whatever.
"Apparently some 60 percent of the Jewish electorate went crazy and elected this warmonger. And there's demonstrable proof that he's a warmonger, because all the Arab states say he's a warmonger, from week one. Proof. And they're all putting on pressure and threatening war. Half the people are saying this is the case, the press is saying it, the opposition is saying it, the Arab world, even the Europeans are saying it. We had a wonderful four years by making unilateral concessions and also degrading our military defenses. Now a change is in the making. I tell you I can make a better peace, a more stable peace."
He insists that his critics, the Clinton Administration among them, do not give him credit for what he has achieved in the Oslo process despite his conservative coalition -- for the withdrawal from Hebron or the release of women prisoners or for having a strategy for the future. Even more strongly, he insists that no left-wing government could bring the process to an end. "Only a government of the right can make peace with the Palestinians," he says. "Look at Hebron: they couldn't do it."
Whatever the degree of Netanyahu's personal responsibility for the state of affairs in Israel -- and it is difficult to overlook the inexperience, defensivenes and manipulativeness of his Administration -- it can also be argued that Netanyahu represents a maturing of the Zionist dream. The poet Chaim Nachman Bialik expressed that dream most memorably when he said, "We will be a normal state when we have the first Hebrew prostitute, the first Hebrew thief and the first Hebrew policeman."
There is little question that Netanyahu is representative of a new Israel -- tough, brash, skillful with the media, free of the complexes of the old shtetl. Born in 1949, a year after the establishment of the Israeli state, he is of a generation that matured with the Six-Day War in 1967 and views the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem not as "occupied territory" but as inherently Israeli lands that the Jews can keep or swap for security as they see fit. Distinctly secular in his personal life and thrice married, Netanyahu shares the native Israeli's freedom from the identity crises of Jews in the Diaspora. Like most Israelis, he does not view the monopoly of ultra-Orthodox Jews on marriages, burials and conversions as a challenge to his identity as an Israeli or a Jew. He said in a conversation once that he never personally experienced anti-Semitism.
The details and scandals of Netanyahu's life have been endlessly rehearsed in the Israeli press: his schooling in the United States; his architecture and business degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; his authoritarian, bitter and ultraconservative father; his service in an elite commando unit; the death of his brother Jonathan leading the legendary raid to free hostages in Entebbe, Uganda; his admission of infidelity and his three wives; his rapid rise through the foreign service, and his meticulously executed conquest of the Likud. Yet for all the scrutiny, Netanyahu remains something of an enigma. Indeed, a gossipy new biography by the journalist Ronit Vardi is coyly titled "Bibi: Who Are You, Mr. Prime Minister?"
The question arises at least in part because of his carefully sculptured image -- the creation, his detractors scornfully claim, of the American political consultant Arthur Finkelstein, who is said to have urged Netanyahu to eliminate his history and personality in the campaign and to focus exclusively on "peace and fear." Early in his term, Netanyahu tried to project a Kennedyesque image of a vital young leader with a modern, attractive family -- he and his wife, Sarah, have two young sons -- but the effort quickly foundered. First came a tabloid story about Sarah's allegedly ruthless treatment of a nanny. Then came more tabloid tales of a rumored contract he and Sarah signed after he admitted to an affair, setting strict parameters on his behavior. In interviews now, he responds to questions about his family with an air of hurt and protectiveness. "One of the things that really bothers me is the attacks on my family and my wife," he said recently. "She's a good mother and a good wife who tries to help her children. She hasn't hurt anyone. She's actually a person in her own right with her own career."
Netanyahu also deflects questions about his relations with his father, Benzion Netanyahu, a historian and zealous student of the radical nationalist teachings of Vladimir Jabotinsky, a Russian Zionist who advocated Jewish military strength and no accommodation with the Arabs. In the late 40's, the elder Netanyahu broke with younger followers of Jabotinsky, led by Menachem Begin. As a result, he spent much of his adult life in bitter, self-imposed exile in the United States, primarily at a small Jewish college outside of Philadelphia. There, he worked on a monumental study of the persecution of Jews in the Spanish Inquisition, the central thesis of which was that even those Jews who try to assimilate cannot escape what he called "Jew hatred."
The elder Netanyahu's frustrated political ambitions and his extreme and fiercely held beliefs have generated considerable speculation about the impact of father on son, speculation that the Prime Minister reflexively dismisses. "The attributions given to my family and to my father sometimes make me chuckle," Benjamin Netanyahu says. "He's a historian, which is a particular kind of academic. The assessment of my father as a one-dimensional ideologue is funny. Even if he was, and he isn't, he is what he is and I'm a different person. It's all psychobabble."
While there is indeed nothing deterministic, as the Prime Minister says, about one's upbringing, the imprint of the father on his second son is unmistakable. The vision of the Jew as perennial target who can never entrust his security to anyone, who must surround himself with what Jabotinsky called a "steel wall," has figured in much of Benjamin Netanyahu's writing and actions. After the death of his brother Jonathan -- to whom Benjamin Netanyahu was very close and who until his death was held up by the family as designated primary standard-bearer -- the future Prime Minister organized a conference on international terrorism, followed by books on the same subject.
That focus on terror has been reflected in much of Netanyahu's criticism of the Oslo agreements, as well as his dismissive attitude toward the Palestinians. "How can you adapt yourself to making peace if you were born and raised on ideas conceived and formed in conflict?" asks Uri Dromi, the Government spokesman under Rabin. "Take away the conflict, and what do you have? He has to have conflict, to beat the competition."
In his book "A Place Among Nations," Netanyahu argues that making peace with the Arabs is like keeping fish in a glass bowl until they learn not to bump against the glass ---- a notion distinctly different from Peres's vision of a "new Middle East." Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab and an adviser to Yasir Arafat, has noted that Netanyahu came to office bearing a notion of the Palestinians as "the Arabs of Judea and Samaria," as foreign interlopers on Jewish lands. In interviews, Netanyahu refers to the biblical Land of Israel as "part of who we are and what we are" and speaks emotionally of the centuries in which "the Jewish people yearned for, lived for, dreamed about, prayed for, shed so many tears for the land." To those who believe that the Jewish return to Israel was divinely ordained, it is unthinkable to "return" the cities of the Book, and it is mockery to believe that anyone has an equal claim to them, least of all "the Arabs" who have vowed to destroy the state of Israel.
Publicly, the Prime Minister accepts his obligations under the Oslo agreements but has never concealed his contempt for them, and he has generally treated Arafat as an adversary and even a foe, holding him responsible for all terror attacks. At the same time, Netanyahu has given the green light to a vigorous revival of construction in West Bank settlements. In place of the staged Oslo process, he has sought to move directly to negotiations on a final settlement.
Security and the Arabs, however, are not subjects Netanyahu seems to enjoy in interviews. Whenever possible, he steers the conversation to his plans to privatize and deregulate the economy and to his vision of Israel as "the Silicon Valley of the Eastern Hemisphere." Despite the slowdown in the peace process, he notes with pride, American investments remain high, and the stock market was hitting record levels before the Asian crash. "There are more high-tech start-ups here than anywhere, more in absolute terms," he declares enthusiastically. "You no longer have to be large; you have to be smart. Our national psyche is good for that."
Such enthusiasm may well be one of the major legacies of Netanyahu's American upbringing, and in particular his business degree from M.I.T. At one point, he apparently considered a business career in America. Yet he spent his summers in Israel, making close friends and, eventually, joining his two brothers in one of the most elite commando units -- under the command of Ehud Barak, his likely challenger in the next election.
Unquestionably, the turning point in Netanyahu's life was his brother's death in the Entebbe attack. The conference on terrorism he then organized brought him to the attention of Israeli leaders. Moshe Arens, then Ambassador to Washington, made Netanyahu his No. 2; next Peres, then Foreign Minister, appointed him chief delegate to the United Nations, where his eloquent English and skills pressing the Israeli case on television made him a familiar face to Americans and the favorite Israeli of American Jews. That armed him with rich backers, like Irving Moskowitz, the bingo magnate, and Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir, as well as influential friends in the media and Government.
According to various accounts, once embarked on a political career, Netanyahu plotted a direct course to the top. When he made his bid for leadership of the Likud after its loss in the 1992 election, it was through the political equivalent of a hostile takeover from contemptuous competitors like Meridor, Benny Begin and Ehud Olmert, the Mayor of Jerusalem. In that bitter fight, he relied upon a tight clutch of loyal followers like Lieberman, a tough immigrant from Soviet Moldova known behind his back as "Rasputin," and Tzahi Hanegbi, who was renowned for his political dirty tricks before he became Justice Minister.
Once in office, Netanyahu likewise formed a small and tight group of close advisers, including Lieberman, Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Communications Director David Bar-Illan, a former concert pianist, newspaper editor and right-wing publicist. For negotiations with the Palestinians, he has increasingly used the services of Yitzhak Molcho, a prominent Jerusalem lawyer who is also his cousin.
It was as an outsider that Netanyahu found common language with the various ethnic, religious and nationalist groups that also grew up "strangers in their own country," in Ronit Vardi's phrase. "Labor was always the party of the satisfied, and Likud was the channel for every protest, the house of the disaffected," says Shlomo Ben-Ami, a Sephardic Jew who now sits in the Knesset and is regarded as one of the Labor Party's most popular politicians. "Now the new parties have taken over and they want to recreate Israel in their own image -- more religious, more traditional, more controlled in their attitude toward the outside world, more cultural than political. Netanyahu doesn't have to speak about social issues to them. He is Likud."
in this society of immigrants, the latest and most politically volatile are the Russians. Since Mikhail Gorbachev first opened the gates, more than 700,000 new immigrants have flooded into Israel. All told, immigrants from the former Soviet Union now constitute more than a fifth of the Israeli population. Their absorption has been hailed, justifiably, as one of the great Israeli success stories. But it has been accompanied by considerable tension on both sides. Older Israelis are irritated by what they perceive as a weak identity as Jews or Israelis among the newcomers and have stereotyped the immigrants as "mafiosos" and prostitutes. (It is, in fact, true that the Russian crime syndicates use Israel as a transit station and that many prostitutes in Israel are Russian.)
Even so, the new immigrants understandably resent these stereotypes and chafe at their treatment as second-class citizens. After the suicide bombing in Jerusalem in July, one victim, a Russian youth, was denied burial in a Jewish cemetery because rabbis concluded he was not a Jew according to strict Jewish law. Above all, many Russians have been frustrated at not finding jobs in their specialties.
In a telling recent poll, Russian immigrants were asked to rate their favorite among fellow Russians. They did not give the biggest vote to Sharansky, whose perceived failure to garner concrete benefits for the Russians has lost him some of their suppport, but to Lieberman, whom they much appreciated for his toughness and his ability to deliver. The Russians also gave a hefty in-your-face vote to Zvi Ben-Ari, the former Grigory Lerner, a millionaire immigrant from Russia who has been under investigation for bribery and purported links to organized crime in Russia and who is viewed as a victim of stereotyping.
Their number and their disaffection have made the Russians a political wild card, whose tendency so far has been to vote "against." In the 1992 election, frustrated by what they saw as neglect under the Likud Government, they shifted a winning margin to Labor. In 1996, they swung back to the right. According to Eduard Kuznetsov, editor of the main Russian-language daily, Vesti, the vote could shift again. "The electorate of this party is largely people interested in shares of the national pie," he says. "It's very concrete -- they want housing and work. Naturally, no party, especially a brand new one like Yisrael B'Aliya, can fulfill these expectations, so there's a lot of disillusion."
But material considerations aside, the large majority of Russians --Sharansky included -- have gravitated to the right, and to Netanyahu. "The very fact that he's attacked by the same left that calls them 'mafia' earns him the support of the Russian street," Kuznetsov says. "Then they're descendants of an imperial attitude. Land is sacred. And though only 1 percent of them live in the occupied territories, they have an instinctive hatred of Arabs and see no reason to make any concessions."
At the other end of the spectrum from the Russians in Netanyahu's coalition are the ultra-Orthodox religious parties. As hungry as the Russians or the Sephardic Jews are for housing and jobs, the rabbis have an equally strong religious agenda, which is basically to safeguard and institutionalize their traditional monopoly on religious affairs. Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, a member of Parliament from the United Torah Judaism faction and a spokesman for the ultra-Orthodox, makes no bones about the goals of the religious parties. "When the left was in power, they did all kinds of things," he said in a recent interview with The Jerusalem Post. "They opened malls on Shabbat, they opened markets around the city on Shabbat, in the kibbutzim. They didn't use their power? Now we are trying to turn the wheel back."
This agenda has created a major rift with American Jews, whose Conservative and Reform denominations are ostracized by Israel's Orthodox authorities, and with secular Israelis, who perceive it as a challenge to civil liberties. "Their criticism of the Supreme Court as not representative of the public at large is the beginning of the delegitimation of the whole democratic system, which is very serious and getting worse," says Emanuel Gutman, a specialist in Israeli politics at Hebrew University. "The Law of Conversion is one little example of this. They're testing their power. If they get their way, they'll start trying to change the composition of the Supreme Court."
Between the challenge of the religious, the antiestablishment and antiliberal leanings of the Sephardim, the alienation of the Russians and the policies of Netanyahu, many old-line Israelis and American Jews have fallen into despondency. On concluding his tour as United States Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, a specialist on the Middle East who had been intimately involved in the politics of peace, abandoned diplomatic discretion to express a despair heard with growing frequency in the suburbs of Tel Aviv and the liberal press: "Increasingly, people have the sense that we are headed back towards conflict, that peace -- real peace -- with the Palestinians is somehow no longer a realistic expectation."
The misgivings extend to domestic politics as well. "After a certain ripeness of Israeli politics and society, there is a feeling of a turnback, of a regress to the politics of identity," says Azmi Bishara, a professor of philosophy and an Arab member of the Knesset. "And you never know if Israeli society has enough civic tradition to endure it."
What frightens Avner De-Shalit, a 40-year-old professor of political science at Hebrew University, is a sense that this perceived antiliberal bias is reaching to younger generations. "In my day, the expression was 'shoot and cry' -- you fought because you had to fight, but you cried because you knew it was terrible," he says. "The students today are much more cynical. They were born in the Land of Israel; they believe occupation by force is natural; they take for granted the violation of human rights."
Such sentiments may be excessively defeatist. After 50 years, Israel has a sophisticated economy, a security apparatus that can withstand almost any threat and a population that has survived extraordinary challenges. Much of the unease could reflect the same disorientation felt throughout much of the post-Communist world, where nationalism and xenophobia have rushed into the void left by the loss of a shared threat. Israel has not been immune, and the Oslo peace was both a consequence and a catalyst of this change. "For better or for worse, whoever becomes leader of this country will have to understand the new direction," Kuznetsov says. "First is the death of Zionism, and with it the lowering of idealism and sacrifice and the rise of mercantile interests. Then there is a fatigue with conflict that will compel all leaders to search for peace, but with it a sense that all talks are useless, that we are surrounded by undemocratic regimes, that Oslo was too fast, too insecure. So there will always be division and hysteria on the subject of peace."
Ben-Ami says: "It's not that the peace process failed. It's that Labor did not have wide enough shoulders to carry it. The peace process opened a debate about identity. Once Israel had an alternative to war, it became clear that an existential threat was not central to Jewish life. Many Jews now understand that they have the option of being independent, of saying 'Yankee go home.' Some no longer share the values of America -- religious freedom, the civility of political discourse, democratic values. That's what the election of 1996 was about. It was the victory of Judaism over Israel; it was an election of identity, not process."
To Netanyahu, at least, that came as no surprise. He had identified the new forces early on, courted them when mainstream politicians ignored them, brought them to power with him and is convinced their Government will stay intact. More than that, he repeats to everyone who will listen that he can reach a peace settlement "as soon as Arafat realizes that we're not going to disappear, that we're committed and able.
"The 'crisis' is overplayed. I tell you what, it has got a measure of brinkmanship, but they all want to stay in," he insists. "There are individuals who for personal reasons may wish otherwise, but there's more stability than instability in this system. The fact is that in this system there are interest groups, the haredim, the Russians, Shas. The perception that Israel is one homogeneous melting pot is about as true as it is for American society. You begin as a melting pot, but then you have all sorts of clumps in the stew."

HEADLINE: On Language;
The Non-Crash

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
Like the conservative New Year's Eve celebrator who wanted to purchase a noisemaker that wasn't too loud, headline writers were recently faced with a challenge: how to deal with a precipitous ("steep," not precipitate, "abrupt, rash, headlong") decline in the stock market without encouraging a panic. (Come to think of it, precipitate would be accurate, too, if you wanted to describe the behavior of the professional investors rather than the graph showing stock movement. Celebrator is New York Times style for celebrant.)
The onomatopoeic crash was a word that Wall Street Journal editorialists were unafraid to use, but the front page of that publication chose a verb less evocative of 1929: "Stocks Plummet 7 Percent." (That verb was formed in this century from the noun plummet, a weight used to sound, or fathom, the depth of water; in Shakespeare's "Tempest," Prospero says, "Deeper than did ever plummet sound/I'll drown my book," a sentiment quoted by excessively modest authors.) 
 "Massive Sell-Off" was the choice of USA Today. The adjective massive lent urgency to the stock-market term sell-off, a noun first reported in 1937 by the Baltimore Sun and still specialized enough to retain its hyphen in most citations. The New York Times disagrees; the bank, or infixed subhead, of its Hong Kong article read, "The Hang Seng sets the scene for a global selloff," unhyphenated. USA Today also used the noun rout (military origin) and the verb dived (from swimming, with that past tense preferred to dove). Its columnist, Walter Shapiro, later used a less-alarmist word picture: "Watching the Dow snow-plow down the mountain."
Plunge (from a 1380 use about baptism by immersion) got a nice play in the Baltimore Sun (but if I first reported the use of sell-off, I'd stick with it proudly). In Newsweek, C. K. Binswanger and Lucy Howard noted the panic prevention in newspapers: drop (International Herald Tribune), tailspin (Jiji Press Ticker of Tokyo), tumble (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) and tremble (Montreal Gazette).
In the synonymy of the bears, decline, sag, sink and slump are mildest; drop, more sudden; tumble, not shocking; dive and plunge, precipitous; plummet, precipitate; sell-off, technical; correction, interpretive or euphemistic; free fall, alarming; collapse, sudden and steep, and crash, better lock that window.
Television journalists, who could immediately affect the market with their demeanor, were careful; NBC called it "the Big Drop" and Fox chose "Blue Monday."
Now we are into the color of the day. Oct. 19, 1987, was called Black Monday on the analogy of Black Thursday of Oct. 24, 1929, and Black Tuesday of Oct. 29, 1929. These were antedated by Black Friday of Sept. 24, 1869, when Jay Gould drove brokers into bankruptcy with his attempted corner of the gold market. It all began with Blue Monday in the Middle Ages, supposedly the first Monday before Lent, when revelers felt hung over from pre-Lenten flings; later, it became the day to feel depressed about returning to work after a weekend. Several commentators dubbed last month's sell-off (in retrospect, that seems the best word, but who knew at the time?) to have happened on a less-than-calamitous day: Gray Monday.
I confess to having used the euphemistic correction two months before October's financial fibrillation. My technical analysis went, "You're going to see a correction one of these days that will curl your hair." This was an obscure allusion to a figure of speech that sent a shiver through the financial markets 40 years ago. In a 1957 news conference (in those days called a press conference), Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary, a former steel man named George Magoffin Humphrey, was asked if he saw any hope of cutting defense spending in the coming years. He replied that such spending was "a terrific tax take we are taking out of this country," and that if we did not reduce defense expenditures, "over a long period of time, I will predict that you will have a depression that will curl your hair."
I enjoy making arcane allusions like that; a few in the codger crowd catch them. One such is Herbert Stein, who once noted how a fellow economist, Sol Fabricant, described a period of less-than-robust expansion by calling it a growth recession. Stein satirized this at the time with an imaginary conversation:
Stein: That's a handsome dog you have there, Sol.
Fabricant: That's not a dog. It's a horse.
Stein: But Sol, it's so small.
Fabricant: It's a growth horse.
Since that time, just as brokers have eschewed the word crash, economists have avoided the word recession, especially those in which hair is curled to depression levels. In 1982, I asked a couple of economists how they would define depression. Alan Greenspan said, "A depression is either a 12 percent unemployment rate for nine months or more, or a 15 percent unemployment rate for three to nine months." Prof. Alfred Kahn of Cornell defined it as unemployment above 10 percent with two quarters of consecutive decline in real G.N.P.
When serving in the Carter Administration, Kahn was chastised for even using the word depression in public. He vowed to White House spinmeisters that whenever he had to refer to such a calamity, he would substitute the word banana.
I still think the market is due for a hair-curler one day, but not so severe as to lead to anything like the Great Banana.
 
WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
"As I travel around the country," said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, "people ask me, 'What's in the water in Tennessee these days, with so many Presidential contenders?"' These include Vice President Al Gore for the Democrats and Senator Fred Thompson and the former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander for the Republicans.
That led to the metaphor of the month from the former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, a Tennessean who now lobbies in Washington: "If Al Gore runs for President," Baker said, "and Lamar Alexander and Fred Thompson run for President, we'll pump so much money out of Tennessee that the surface will subside and the Mississippi River will run in and flood us all."

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Balanchine's Baby Reaches a Certain Age

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
FOR 10 YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH IN 1983, George Balanchine advertised the premieres in his company, the New York City Ballet, as Ballet No. 1 and Ballet No. 2. The troupe's new season, which opens on Tuesday at Lincoln Center, has the same number of nontitles, and for the same reason, one that has nothing to do with secrecy. The company simply wants to keep its options open until the last minute.
But ask Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, about the big picture and he will disclose wide-ranging thoughts about plans for the company's 50th-anniversary season in 1998-99, new concepts about touring, money and programming. 
 Tributes are also on his mind. In an interview at the New York State Theater, he reflected on the special contributions of Stanley Williams, a great teacher and mentor who died recently, and of Merrill Ashley, one of the company's most popular stars, who will retire soon. This winter's season will honor both in different ways, just as in the spring Mr. Martins hopes to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jerome Robbins's association with the company.
Economic realities have forced Mr. Martins to consider less expensive ways to present City Ballet at home and on tour. The question he often asks himself these days, he said, is, "Do I want to be a puritan or a businessman?" And the reply, he said in exasperation, is, "I feel like a Gemini."
The opening gala on Tuesday is a special event, having been transformed into a farewell to Ms. Ashley, who is retiring after 31 years with the company. But it is also an event isolated in its splendor; it will be followed by the annual "Nutcracker" run (Nov. 28 through Jan. 4) rather than by mixed programs (they resume on Jan. 6). Mr. Martins regrets that the company can no longer afford the one or two weeks of repertory programs that had preceded "The Nutcracker" until three years ago.
Mixed bills at the start of the season do not sell as well as "The Nutcracker," which for the second year will be extended to five weeks from four. Nonetheless, with 21 weeks at the State Theater, City Ballet still has more performances in its home city than any dance company in the world. Lopping off the two weeks in November helps keep the company in the black, and major projects are possible "because we always end up in the black," Mr. Martins said.
Recently, he has had more personal concerns, however. Mr. Martins has been deeply affected by the death last month of Mr. Williams, the teacher to whom he was closest in his native Denmark. Balanchine saw Mr. Williams teach at the Royal Danish Ballet and invited him, in the early 1960's, to the School of American Ballet, City Ballet's school. For the last decade, Mr. Martins and Mr. Williams were chairmen of the faculty. Now Mr. Martins will pay homage to his mentor on Jan. 22 with the premiere of a ballet set to Pergolesi. As usual, it is called Ballet No. 1. Ballet No. 2 that night will be by Richard Tanner, who frequently choreographs for the company.
For his part, Mr. Martins wants to honor the "quality" that Mr. Williams instilled in City Ballet's dancers. "When you see New York City Ballet, it is Balanchine who comes to mind, and rightly so," Mr. Martins said. "What does not come to mind is Stanley Williams: he is the unsung hero in both the school and the company."
While giving other teachers their due, Mr. Martins asserted that Mr. Williams, with the dancers he trained, had refined the company's look. "He was not your all-around teacher," he said. "Balanchine was the expert on toe work." But prize pupils like the young ballerinas Gelsey Kirkland and Darci Kistler flocked to Mr. Williams's men's classes, which had guests like Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov. "When you pare things away, you get to the essence of classical dancing," Mr. Martins said. "What Stanley Williams taught was more pure and distilled. It has taken eight teachers to replace him at the school."
As for Merrill Ashley, he said, her effect was primarily on Balanchine himself because she brought out something new in his choreography. "There was a side of Balanchine that was fascinated with dancers who could do more -- more turns, more everything," Mr. Martins said. "It was a turning point for Balanchine to find a female virtuoso in Merrill."
Asked about his plans for the company's silver anniversary, Mr. Martins took a step back by noting that the troupe split in half for an international tour in September. Forty-two dancers went to Brazil and 42 to Korea, Taiwan and Australia. Each group had three conductors, an equal number of principal dancers and some of the same ballets. "This was the full New York City Ballet, but cloned," Mr. Martins said.
In his view, the experiment was a success and is a model for a projected 50th-anniversary national tour. By halving the company's usual weekly fee, about $500,000, local sponsors might be able to present City Ballet in American cities that have not seen it in decades, if at all.
In New York, Mr. Martins plans "a huge bash," an alumni party for all staff and dancers employed by the company since its founding in 1948. After the opening, "The Nutcracker" will incorporate willing and able alumni dancers in its cast.
Six to eight premieres are scheduled for 1998-99. Three by Mr. Martins will have commissioned scores by, respectively, Wynton Marsalis, John Adams and Charles Wuorinen. The version of "Swan Lake" that Mr. Martins rechoreographed for the Royal Danish Ballet last year will be danced by City Ballet in the spring of 1999.
THAT PRODUCTION WILL BE PART OF A weeklong Tchaikovsky Festival, with two more weeks devoted to Stravinsky ballets and three to American composers. For the first time, viewers will be offered a joint subscription to the winter and spring seasons; no ballet in the spring will repeat works from the winter.
The January 1999 season will, in fact, open with a series of Balanchine works that Mr. Martins calls "black and white ballets" because they are danced in leotards and T-shirts. An inside joke will be the inclusion of "Symphony in C," with its women in white tutus and men in black tights. Later there will be a selected overview of 50 years of works by other choreographers.
In the meantime, Mr. Martins will encourage new choreographers to use music as a springboard. Unlike American Ballet Theater, which recently presented a ballet based on "Othello," City Ballet focuses on plotless works. "No, I don't want 'Macbeth' or 'Hamlet,' " Mr. Martins said. But he voiced no objection to narrative as long as the story was told through the classical vocabulary. "That is our language," he said.
Laughing, he recalled how the French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj "went his own way" in creating "La Stravaganza" for the Diamond Project last spring. "I asked him to use pointe work, an orchestra and to cut down on costumes and scenery," he said. "He disregarded all this and ended up with a work that was strange and quite beautiful."
Is there a moral here? "I don't think we have rules," Mr. Martins said. "I think we have preferences."

HEADLINE: Peekskill Group Rallies to Stop Development of a Battle Site

BYLINE: By ANNE C. FULLAM 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL

 BODY:
IN 1777, Colonial militia unsuccessfully defended Peekskill against a British invasion. More than two centuries later, citizens' groups are fighting to prevent the battle site here from being developed.
Rallying around Fort Hill, the 47-acre Hudson River bluff where the Battle of Peekskill took place, is a consortium of preservation and conservation groups. 
 "We were organized to stop development of the Fort Hill area and to gain official recognition for Fort Hill as a historic site,"said John McAndrew, co-chairman of Friends of Historic Peekskill. "We envision a historic park being established to draw tourists to the area."
The organization said it hopes to stop a plan by the developer, River View Partners, to build 258 luxury apartments and 20 single-family dwellings, which would destroy part of the hill and cut down 22 acres of trees. River View Partners, owned by Louis Cappelli, is based in Valhalla. The company has extensive holdings, including the Summit office park in Valhalla.
"River View's plan would create a blacktop scar on the hill," Mr. McAndrew contended. "With 560 parking spaces, it would destroy the beauty and historic significance of this site forever. Once it's gone, you never get it back."
The historical significance of Fort Hill is not a question to Col. James Johnson, who teaches military history at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Colonel Johnson called the Fort Hill site a seat of the war. Recently, he spoke at a meeting of residents here on the role the fort played in defending the Hudson Highlands.
Musket balls and uniform buttons have been found at the site and correspondence and maps belonging to both the Patriots and the British have survived, but archeologists, who will be chosen by the city and paid for by the developer, will search for more artifacts.
In a letter to the editor in The Peekskill Herald this summer, Marge Schneider, a spokeswoman for River View, said that archeologists hired by the developer to search the site in 1984 -- when a permit to develop the area was granted -- reported that there was "no evidence of prehistoric occupation within the site."
The letter continued, "No structures or roadways of prehistoric or historical significance were discovered." Ms. Schneider contended that the River View development would help the city's economy by providing housing for residents with an average annual income of $60,000, with the total population of the project having an annual disposable income of $4 million. The letter also said that the developer's plan called for preserving half of the property as open space.
In an interview, Ms. Schneider said that Fort Hill could have been a pasture. "We've just redone the archeological study," Ms. Schneider said. "Our report determines that there is no historical significance. There are no artifacts to prove there was any kind of fort there; the rubble wall could be boundary for a pasture."
The City Historian, John Curran, said that a large pile of semicircular rocks, which have caved in toward the center, were once the back wall of a foundry where musket balls were made.
As for concern about the removal of trees for the development, Ms. Schneider said: "If you do any kind of development, you are cutting down trees. There will be a tree preservation plan."
Patrick Garvey, the Peekskill City Manager, said: "How much of it can we preserve? What can we get the company to do in terms of prospective development? There could be a very clever design with a fort and observation decks. They could preserve historic redoubts if we could reconstruct them.
"A private party owns the property. It's not a question of whether the city is going to allow development. That decision was made several years ago that development could take place there. There's an existing permit. We're not in a position to buy it. We can't just take it." He said the developer had spent $1 million to buy the property. The question is how to do this intelligently.
"The issue of the historic site is only part of the problem; the other is density," Mr. Garvey added. "The traffic generated by the complex is a great concern. A road in and out would have to be constructed. It would be expensive."
Besides the cost, new roads would change neighborhoods, Mr. Garvey said. "Those are quiet streets now. They're talking about jitneys to take people to the railroad. This is a city with 4.5 square miles. We have no more acreage. We have more greenscape and parks than anybody can imagine. We need green -- the other kind that pays taxes."
Residential development of the kind envisioned for Fort Hill could end up costing the city revenue rather than providing it, according to a study published in June, which was commissioned by Scenic Hudson, an organization formed in 1963 to protect and enhance the Hudson River Valley's ecosystem and landscapes.
"Peekskill is a city in renaissance," said Jeffrey Anzevino, a waterfront specialist and planner at Scenic Hudson in Poughkeepsie. "There's a lot of new interest in the city related to its history and perch on the Hudson River. The density of the River View proposal warrants a hard look at just how much of the scenery and Fort Hill encampment would be compromised and whether any compromise is acceptable.'
In the Battle of Peekskill, which lasted three days, starting on March 23, 1777, more than 500 British soldiers attacked Fort Hill, which was defended by about 250 soldiers. Retreating, the Continental troops burned their workshops, mills and warehouses. A Patriot and 13 British soldiers were killed, and in October 1777 the British returned to destroy the village of Peekskill.
Involved in the battle were Col. Pierre Van Cortlandt, Gen. George Clinton, later to become New York's first Governor; Gen. Alexander McDougall and Col. Marinus Willett, whose silver sword is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. Black soldiers, including John Jacob Peterson, a cannoneer, and Lieut. William Moshier also took part in the battle. In 1990, Lieutenant Moshier's family dedicated a cannon in his name, which was placed in front of the Peekskill Museum in downtown Peekskill.
As for saving the site, Mr. McAndrew of the Friends of Historic Peekskill, said: "We feel that the city of Peekskill has an obligation not just to its citizens but to anyone who lives in or visits the Hudson Valley to preserve Fort Hill as a part of our history and our part of the Hudson River Greenway."

HEADLINE: Suit in Oyster Bay Stymies Redevelopment

BYLINE: By VIVIEN KELLERMAN 

 BODY:
A SUIT between the Town of Oyster Bay and an oil company operating in the hamlet appears to be the only flaw in an otherwise ambitious plan to revitalize the downtown harbor.
The plan includes the recent purchase of a 200-year old shipyard, plus an adjacent piece of land, extensive work by the Long Island Rail Road, which would provide more access to the downtown shopping district, and a proposal to build a railroad museum. 
 Although the litigation will not hamper those efforts, the town is concerned about future implications if the oil company's request to dredge its basin should prevail.
"The entire wetlands project is designed to revitalize the area," said Anthony Sabeno, the Oyster Bay deputy town attorney. "The expansion of a fuel oil company is not consistent with that." Nicholas Damadeo, the lawyer for the oil company, Commander Oil, contends there are no plans to expand.
Commander Oil has been operating in Oyster Bay since 1929. Until 1995, the company had a lease with the town that allowed it, among other things, to conduct maintenance dredging in the vicinity of its dock. When the lease ran out, the company applied to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the Army Corps of Engineers for a dredging permit. On March 28, 1995, the Department of Environmental Conservation granted the permit.
Believing that the department should not have issued the permit, the town sued the agency. It also sued the Department of State, which manages the state coastal plan arguing that the it should have stepped in to prevent the dredging, citing Commander Oil as a co-defendant. The suit against the Department of Environmental Conservation was ultimately dismissed.
On April 7, 1997, the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of Commander Oil. In his decision, Justice Geoffrey J. O'Connell wrote, "consideration was given to the environmental concerns implicated in the project, including those which would be entailed in alternative home heating oil delivery systems for Nassau and western Suffolk Counties."
The town has appealed that decision.
In addition to the environmental agency permit, Commander must secure a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, which is being withheld until further testing of the material to be dredged has been completed.
Despite rumors to the contrary, said Mr. Damadeo, Commander has no plans to expand its operation. "It simply wants the right to have access to its dock," he said. A right, he continued, the company has enjoyed for 70 years.
But the town believes that Commander's request to dredge both sides of its dock basin, when in the past it only dredged the western side, proves that it plans to expand. "The only reason Commander wants to dredge both sides is to bring more oil into the harbor," said Mr. Sabino. "They don't need two basins for what they are bringing in now."
Moreover, he said, in the 20 years since the basin was last dredged, an entire sand spit with marine life and a potential for ecological impact on the rest of the harbor, has been deposited. "This fact itself is evident that this is no longer maintenance dredging," he said.
Mr. Sabino argues that the town owns the underwater land by virtue of a colonial patent granted in 1677, and therefore has the right to control mooring, shellfishing and dredging. "We say that Commander should have come to us for permits," he said.
Michael Deering, the director of Friends of the Bay, a volunteer group concerned about development of the harbor, said that even as the litigation with Commander Oil proceeds, the other pieces relating to the harbor's future continue.
One is an agreement with the Long Island Rail Road, which has a maintenance yard in Oyster Bay, the last stop on the line. With only two streets crossing the tracks, said Mr. Deering, the downtown shopping district and the harbor are essentially divided.
After much negotiation, he said, the railroad has agreed to renovate the entire yard, consolidating its equiment, to allow for more access from the downtown. Moreover, the northeast corner of the yard will be turned over to a local historical group, which hopes to create a railroad museum and to display an old railroad engine on the property. This project, which recently went out to bid by the railroad, will begin next year.
The recent acquisition of the 5.2 acre Jakobson Shipyard property, said Mr. Deering, came about after several years of effort by state and town officials, who secured $5 million towards the $6 million purchase price using funds from the 1972 Environmental Quality Bond Act. The remaining $1 million was paid for by the town.
Senator Carl Marcellino, who is chairman of a steering committee for the development of the harbor, called this purchase the linchpin that links together the existing 45-acre Roosevelt Memorial Park and Beach with other town property, to create a half-mile stretch of public waterfront land.
Mr. Marcellino said that before any decision on development of the property is made, the town will hold several public hearings. At the first hearing in October, he said, so many people showed up, they had to be put into small groups in order to be heard.
Representatives of several organizations put forth an idea that included an educational center, a fire department water-rescue training center, off-season boat mooring for baymen, a regional office for the Department of Environmental Conservation, a fish and wildlife office and a maritime museum, with a proposal to bring in a destroyer to be on permanent display. After the hearings, a written comment period will allow for further input.
"This is the first time to my knowledge that the public has been invited before any plans have been made," Mr. Marcellino said. "Despite the range of ideas, there are no preconceived notions. Whatever we decide, we want it to be something that the public has selected."
Mr. Marcellino said that a decision on the property will be made in March. Mr. Sabino said that a decision on the Commander Oil litigation could take a year or more.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/866 Third Avenue;
For One Building, Three Uses: Retail, Medical, Hotel

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
A LARGELY vacant office building at 866 Third Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets, is about to be converted to an unusual mix of uses as a result of a complex agreement announced last May and made final in recent weeks.
The transaction demonstrates how creative use of a property can add previously unrealized value. The process by which it happened also illustrates the complexities of the tangles of negotiating strategies and interests among buyers, sellers and the brokerage companies who sometimes find themselves on both sides of the negotiating table. 
 When renovations are complete, the former Macmillan building will be divided three ways. The top floors, 14 to 31, will be converted to a 320-room hotel to be operated as a Marriott Courtyard. The first two floors will be used for retail purposes. The Witkoff Group, which bought the 454,000-square-foot building in October 1996 for $50 million, will retain ownership of the upper and lower units, which are condominiums.
On the floors between those operations, a condominium unit extending from the 3d through 11th floors has been purchased by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for providing outpatient care.(The 12th floor is mechanical; there is no 13th.) The hospital, which paid $24 million for about 220,000 square feet of space, plans to spend $30 million to convert office floors into doctors' offices and examination, diagnostic and treatment spaces.
Hospital administrators said the new facility would enable them to provide services in a location more central than the main campus on the Upper East Side between First and York Avenues and 67th and 68th Streets. Officials of the hospital said they would offer radiology and chemotherapy treatments at the center as well as screening programs for people at risk of developing cancer.
"Most treatment is done on an outpatient basis today," said Clarice Albright, the hospital's administrator. "People getting chemotherapy need to make frequent trips to their doctor." Since many current treatments do not have as pronounced side effects as older approaches had, patients can integrate treatment with their regular activities, she said.
"People will go in for a few hours and then get on with their lives," she said. Because of the more central location, she said, "we can get them in and out faster."
The additional space will also allow the hospital to offer "wellness" programs that would include screenings for those genetically disposed to cancer. The program would provide the screenings without requiring a hospital visit.
"We will have screening programs, nutrition programs and patient and public information programs," Ms. Albright said.
. To keep hotel guests separate from outpatients, the hotel and the treatment center will have separate entrances, lobbies and sets of elevators. The hotel is expected to front on Third Avenue, while the treatment center will face 53d Street.
Hospital officials and real-estate executives said the path to an agreement was a rocky one. When Metropolitan Life, the previous owner, announced that it would auction the building, the hospital was one of the bidders, in association with Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies. But Steven Witkoff, then a partner in Stellar Management Company, bid higher and was able to complete the purchase in association with Credit Suisse First Boston. Stellar has since split into residential and commercial operations, with the Witkoff Group owning and managing the commercial portion.
Mr. Witkoff said he had had applications other than office use in mind when he offered his bid. "When we bought that building, the New York office market had not recovered enough that you could justify paying $110 a foot for office use," he said. "We needed to find other uses, and the economics of a hotel looked favorable."
Knowing of the hospital's interest in the building, Mr. Witkoff contacted the administrators within weeks after completing the purchase and asked if they were interested in purchasing a condominium in the building, which he was planning to convert into condominium usage. Because of the hospital's status as a nonprofit institution, he said, it pays no real estate taxes on property it owns, while a landlord would have to factor taxes into the rental rate if the space was simply leased.
Hospital officials describe in negotiations in late 1996 as difficult, with Witkoff Group executives demanding a higher price than the hospital was willing to pay. "The economics did not make sense, so we walked away," said John R. Gunn, executive vice president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering.
OFFICIALS of the hospital note that executives of Insignia/ESG, the current name for the Edward S. Gordon Company, were representing both Mr. Witkoff and the hospital in the negotiations and suggest that this was at least part of the reason for the initial lack of progress. "It was a very curious situation," Ms. Albright said of the initial negotiations with Mr. Witkoff. "My suspicion is that Gordon felt we wanted the space so bad that he had a tenant."
Steven Simkin, the lawyer for Memorial Sloan-Kettering, said that the Gordon firm, in addition to being on both sides of the table in the talks with Mr. Witkoff and the hospital after the sale, had represented both Met Life and the hospital in Sloan-Kettering's original bidding for the building. He said hospital officials were uncomfortable with the Gordon firm's position.
"I think there was a conflict given these multiple roles," Mr. Simkin said. "It is hard to effectively represent parties on both sides of a transaction." Nevertheless, the hospital was required by contract to continue with Gordon until the expiration of the agreement early this year.
Executives of the Gordon concern vigorously reject any suggestion of conflict of interest, saying that there is a clear distinction between the company's property group, which represents building owners, and its brokers. They say the property group's executives are paid salaries to represent owners, while the brokers receive a commission only if a transaction closes.
"Is it an arm's-length negotiation?" said Mitchell E. Rudin, an executive managing director of Gordon and head of its property group. "Absolutely." He noted that it is commonplace to have executives from the same firm representing buyer and seller.
"Some owners engage us to sell properties because of our ability to bring in a buyer," Mr. Rudin said. "It happens all the time, and we are very forward about it."
When Gordon's exclusive right to represent the hospital expired, the hospital, at Mr. Simkin's recommendation, signed Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, to find another location for the care center.
Mr. Gosin said he became convinced that the location on Third Avenue made sense if the financial terms could be changed, and went back to Mr. Witkoff. "I was able to convince Steve that he was better off selling to the hospital rather than trying to rent the space in the commercial market," Mr. Gosin said. "We were able to get a good price for the hospital, and Steve will do well with the hotel on top."
Mr. Gosin said that on a per-square-foot basis the hospital paid a little less for its condo than Mr. Witkoff paid for the entire building. He noted that the floors the hospital purchased were the least valuable in the building, since they did not have the views available in the tower and did not include the first two floors of retail space, which rent for far higher rates than middle floors.
Ms. Albright said the revised transaction cost the hospital $12 million less than the original proposal. Mr. Witkoff said there was never a set price, and noted that the second floor was included in the hospital's space in the original plan, but was withdrawn so the first and second floors could be combined to lure big-box retailers.
Mr. Gosin agreed that the terms changed as the negotiation went forward, with the amount and location of the hospital's space different at the end than the beginning. Although the transaction only closed recently, demolition work has been under way, and Ms. Albright said interior construction for the hospital's space would start in January, with the opening scheduled for October. Hospital officials said the new facility would help attract international patients, many of whom could be expected to stay in the hotel part of the building.
Carol Nelson, a Gordon broker who first showed the space at 866 Third to hospital officials, said the neighborhood has a residential component that should make it less intimidating for first-time visitors to New York. In addition, she said, parking is available nearby, and the traffic patterns in the area make for easy access.
Despite the successful carving up of the building, real estate executives say they do not expect to see many other mixed-use conversions, as the market for office space continues to heat up. "It was an opportunity in time," Mr. Witkoff said, that is not likely to be repeated.

HEADLINE: Scientist Says Sleepy Teen-Agers Aren't Just Tired

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
MORNINGS are not pretty for 15-year-old Lizzy Schulzinger, a high school sophomore. On school days, her parents begin her day by waking her at 6 A.M. Usually, she falls promptly back to sleep. Sometimes, Lizzy's parents sit her up in bed and then make sure her feet are on the floor. On really bad days, her little sister pries her eyelids open.
By 6:45, Lizzy staggers onto the school bus, where she joins dozens of other sleepy teen-agers on their way to Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, which begins at 7:45. There, as in other high schools starting from 7:15 to 7:50 A.M., teachers, students and administrators describe early morning classes where teen-agers sit bleary eyed while trying to focus on biology, math and other first-period subjects. Students arriving late, toting cups of coffee and slumping with their heads on their desks are not uncommon in the early hours of the day in high school. 
 To be sure, every age group has its share of "morning people," and there are students who are bright eyed and ready to learn soon after sunrise. Nor is it startling news that teen-agers are not their best in the early hours. But now sleep researchers are discovering that adolescent sleepiness in the morning has a physiological basis. And educators are beginning to take notice of the research and questioning whether the school schedule -- originally based on an agrarian economy when students were needed home in the afternoon to do farm chores -- is optimal for teaching today's teen-agers. When Dr. Mary Carskadon, director of chronobiology/sleep research at E. P. Bradley Hospital in Providence, R.I., and a professor in the department of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University School of Medicine, began researching adolescent sleep patterns, she assumed that teen-agers stayed up at night for psychological and sociological reasons. Factors ranging from teen-agers needing to assert themselves to increased academic and social obligations all tend to push bedtime later. But after more than a decade of study, Dr. Carskadon has discovered that most adolescents sleep differently than children or adults.
In studies, Dr. Carskadon found that as children move into puberty, their biological clocks undergo a shift, pushing their preprogrammed period of wakefulness about an hour later than it was in their early teen-age years. Older teen-agers secrete melatonin -- a hormone that regulates the body's circadian rhythms, or biological clock -- about 10:30 P.M., whereas younger teen-agers release the hormone roughly one hour earlier. Dr. Carskadon's findings were published in 1996 in the medical journal Sleep Research.
Not only is the onset of sleep delayed for older teen-agers but also the various phases of the sleep cycle are pushed back -- including an important final hour of dreaming, known as REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep. Researchers say that this final phase of sleep -- which in older adolescents generally does not end until 7 A.M. -- is critical to the feeling of being rested and refreshed.
When Dr. Carskadon brought teen-agers into her sleep lab and woke them up at their usual times -- between 5:30 and 6:30 A.M. -- and then measured their brain waves at 8:30, which is roughly the time of second-period classes in most high schools, she said she found, "these kids' brains weren't fully awake." The teen-agers also quickly fell back into REM sleep, another sign that they were not adjusted to early rising, Dr. Carskadon said, adding that this was true of 40 to 60 percent of teen-agers.
The findings have several implications for high school students. First, since biologically sleep comes later to teen-agers, the obvious solution of putting tired teen-agers to bed earlier is not always the answer. Tara Speisman, 14, a freshman at Irvington High School said, "Even when I'm really tired and I can get to bed earlier, it's hard for me to fall asleep before 11 P.M."
Further, since teen-agers must awaken for school before the final phase of sleep is complete, grogginess in early classes is nearly inevitable. "They're being asked to be in school when their brain essentially is still asleep, so it's not surprising they sleep through first and second period," Dr. Carskadon said in a phone interview. "There are some youngsters who do adjust and seem to manage O.K., but we also have data showing that many teen-agers are awake at the wrong time, because their brain hasn't adjusted its temporal time phrase."
Dr. Carskadon said that, optimally, adolescents need about 9 hours and 15 minutes of sleep a night. She added that 8 hours and 15 minutes is considered a reasonable amount. But in her studies, she found teen-agers getting an average of seven hours of sleep, so that by the end of the week, they had "an accumulated sleep deficit." This is why so many teen-agers sleep until noon on weekends.
Researchers have not yet quantified the academic cost of sleep deprivation by charting waking times with grades or test scores. But it is known that sleep deprivation interferes with cognitive functioning -- particularly that part of the brain needed for creative thinking. It is also established that lack of sleep affects reaction time. Not only is this relevant to teen-agers' studies but also to their safety when driving. Exhaustion and alcohol are another dangerous mix.
Also in question is how sleep deprivation affects an adolescent's already turbulent emotional state. Initial studies have shown that sleep deprived teen-agers report more negative feelings, like anger, fear and sadness, than well-rested ones, Dr. Carskadon said.
Of course, biological sleep rhythms are not the only reason adolescents are so tired. Teen-agers lead busy lives. Many spend hours at sports practice. Students returning from some games do not get home until 8 P.M. and then begin their homework. Then there is student council, play practice, dance class, community service, jobs and more.
"We know that most competitive colleges will tell the student that it's not good enough to have high SAT's and grade point averages," said Dr. Robert Maher, principal of Briarcliff High School, where classes start at 7:50 A.M. "They have to be well rounded. They have to participate in sports, have work experience, community service, co-curricular activities. And there are only so many hours in the day."
Brenda Smith, principal of Mount Vernon High School, which opens at 7:40 A.M., said: "When you have juniors and seniors who have a need to work, and they're getting home from work at 10 P.M. and then they have homework, it's difficult. And some of those individuals go straight from school to work."
Dr. Carskadon said she has heard from school districts nationwide that are interested in her research. But moving school openings is problematic, and for reasons that go beyond after-school schedules. Primarily, it is a financial issue. Few districts can afford to transport their students without double or triple "tripping" their buses -- that is, districts stagger school starting times so they can use the same school buses more than once to save money. Rather than have elementary school children out at a bus stop at 6:45 A.M., when it is often dark and even more dangerous for them, schools choose to send their older students in early.
Other issues come into play. Several years ago, Chappaqua considered having middle and high schools open after elementary schools. Some parents objected because they counted on their teen-agers to be home earlier to baby-sit their younger siblings after school.
Last year, in Katonah-Lewisboro, where John Jay High School opens at 7:15 A.M., the school's planning team of parents, teachers and administrators identified the start time of school as an issue they wanted to address, partly based on the research on teen-age sleep patterns. But when the district proposed a plan that would have allowed the high school to open later but would have cost the community more in transportation costs, it was voted down.
Dr. Maher of Briarcliff said that despite all the seemingly immutable features of the current school schedule, he believes that the issue merits examination. "I think there needs to be a consideration of a later start time despite some of these issues which dictate an early start, because you really do need to think of what our mission is, and of course it's academic," he said. "If you keep that in the forefront, maybe you start school at 8:30 A.M."
That would be good news to one of his sophomores, Rachel Suna, 15, and her friends. Rachel, who uses two alarm clocks to wake up, so she can be on time for her 7:50 A.M. global studies class, said, "When I think about it, just about everyone I know is tired."

HEADLINE: Rare Voice, Gracious Neighbor

BYLINE: By JAY AXELBANK 

 BODY:
ON a cold Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, Marian Anderson, standing at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington before 75,000 people, sang her way into history. She was already acclaimed as the greatest contralto of her time. Now her fortitude and serenity, in the face of exclusion from Constitution Hall on account of her color, would touch millions of hearts around the world.
The road to legendary status had been arduous: Childhood poverty, discrimination, lost musical opportunities. In 1928, Marian Anderson had begun touring Europe to find the recognition denied her at home. It was in Salzburg, Austria, in 1935, that the conductor Arturo Toscanini heard her and said, "Yours is a voice such as one hears once in a hundred years." That same year she returned in triumph to America. 
 From then on, until she retired in 1965, everywhere Marian Anderson appeared, she sang to thunderous, packed houses. Music critics ran out of superlatives rhapsodizing about her soulful delivery, nearly three-octave range (low D to high C) and immense dignity, on and off stage.
From Franklin D. Roosevelt to George Bush, Presidents paid homage to her, as a singer and as spiritual symbol, as did the Empress of Japan, the kings of Sweden and Denmark, Albert Einstein and a host of musical greats including Jan Sibelius, Isaac Stern and Vladimir Horowitz. She toured the world as a good will ambassador. Dozens of universities, including the University of Connecticut in 1987, conferred honorary degrees. Cities gave her their keys.
But behind the legend of the singer there was another legend, one rarely glimpsed except by those closest to her: the homespun Marian Anderson, the woman who lived on a farm in Danbury for the better part of 50 years. Now it is in Danbury that a decision must be made on how to best honor her -- a decision centering on the studio built for her that is threatened with demolition or relocation.
The people close to her in Danbury knew a soft-spoken, shy woman who shopped in town for fabric to make into curtains and slipcovers -- and who took along a portable sewing machine on tours to finish projects. She also insisted on waiting her turn like any other customer in stores and restaurants, and was never too busy to stop and chat in town or at the Danbury State Fair.
Despite the demands of her career, Miss Anderson made time for Danbury and for Connecticut. She sang at Danbury City Hall for the lighting of the Christmas decorations and at the Danbury High School; she appeared in recitals throughout the state. Miss Anderson served on the board of the Danbury Music Center and supported the Charles Ives Center for the Arts. She was host to gatherings for the Salvation Army and other causes and contributed to the Danbury chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. She served on the State Commission on the Arts and testified in Hartford for more support of the arts.
It was at the time of her Lincoln Memorial recital that Marian Anderson was searching New York State and Connecticut for a retreat from the tumult of fame. Bigotry blocked some plans, but she finally found what she was looking for in 1940 in the Mill Plain section of Danbury: a 100-acre property with pastures, wooded hills and a swimming pond. It came to be known as Marianna Farm.
Miss Anderson and her husband, the architect Orpheus (King) Fisher, whom she married in 1943, gardened, raised cattle and sheep, and kept and rode horses. She surrounded herself with dogs, cats, birds and fish. Marian Anderson said she found freedom and peace at Marianna Farm, where she had a view of a distant ridge across what is now Interstate 84. Unlike many celebrities who live in gated estates or secluded residences, Marian Anderson was accessible at her Danbury home when she was not touring.
There were always visitors, youngsters and aspiring singers among them. Miss Anderson spent more and more time at Marianna Farm as the years went by; after retiring in 1965, she lived there quietly, devoting herself to the farm and philanthropic and community activities.
Miss Anderson and Mr. Fisher resided in a three-bedroom ranch house that they had built after selling half the original 100 acres; it was decidedly not a mansion, marked only by a weather-beaten rural mailbox and a sign, Marianna Farm. Mr. Fisher -- who is said to have pursued Miss Anderson for more than 20 years before they married -- built a 25-by-30-foot cottage for her studio; it nestled among trees overlooking the pond, not far from the main house.
Now half a century later, and four years after Marian Anderson's death, a campaign is underway to move the cottage and preserve it as a memorial and museum at another location. The 50-acre Marianna Farm itself was named last year as one of 60 sites on the Connecticut Freedom Trail.
It was in the studio that Miss Anderson would sing for her own pleasure and rehearse without "bothering people," as she once put it.
They weren't bothered. "I will never forget that haunting voice," says Max Brownstein, 87, of Waterbury, who rented a guest cottage for 30 years on Marianna Farm. "You could hear her singing from Joes Hill Road," he recalled. "Sometimes people would stop their cars to listen."
As he strolled sadly around Marianna Farm on a recent afternoon, past sagging fences, a crumbling white barn and piles of firewood and debris, he sighed.
"If Marian saw her farm now, she would be terribly sad," he said. "She worked so hard to keep it neat and beautiful."
The home itself and the music studio, however, are still in good repair, and, in fact, are now temporarily occupied.
For a while last year it appeared that the studio, with its concave, acoustical ceiling, fireplace and picture windows, could be a casualty of development plans by the farm's present owner. A proposed road would have gone straight through the studio.
But a group of Danbury residents, including the developer, moved in to save it, led by Danbury Mayor Gene Eriquez and State Senator Mark Nielsen and State Representative Lew Wallace, who represent Danbury. In April a bill to allocate $250,000 for the project stalled in committee. Now Mr. Wallace is looking for support from the Department of Economic and Community Development and the State Commission on the Arts. Proposed sites for the studio are the headquarters of Scott-Fanton Museum and Historical Society on Main Street or next to the Charles Ives home, both in Danbury.
But before the studio is moved, a dispute over housing development plans must be resolved. The development firm, led by Robert H. Wilder Jr. of Elmsford, N.Y., is at loggerheads with the city of Danbury over the length of the driveway that will go through the cottage site. The owner has offered to pay for moving the studio. But as long as the impasse continues, the cottage stays put and the one-room structure runs the risk of deterioration.
Deborah Grover, a Danbury lawyer and board member of Scott-Fanton Museum, and Daryle Dennis, president of the greater Danbury chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., are leading a fund-raising drive. "We want to honor the memory of this great singer who lived in our community," says Ms. Grover. "We especially need a beacon to show young women that they can excel in our society."
June Goodman of Danbury, one of those who first expressed concern over preserving the studio, speaks reverently of Marian Anderson, not only as a great singer but as the "most unassuming and gracious person I ever knew" -- a description echoed by all who knew her. Ms. Goodman, who first met the singer in the 1940's, is chairwoman of the Marian Anderson Award Foundation that annually presents a $20,000 prize to promising singers in mid-career.
Virginia Wren, of New Fairfield, who lived a stone's throw from Marianna Farm in the 40's and 50's, said "The first thing you noticed about her was that she almost never used the pronoun I, but always we or one in referring to herself. She was the one great singer you would never call a prima donna." Mr. Brownstein says that in all the years he knew her, "I never once, not once, heard her say a bad word about anybody. Not even about racists."
Even though her Lincoln Memorial appearance became a clarion call in the civil rights movement, Miss Anderson, in her 1956 autobiography, "My Lord, What a Morning," said she strived to lead by the impression she left as an artist and as a human being. She said she did not consider herself a "fearless fighter."
As a teen-ager in Philadelphia she was rejected by a music school, which did not take "colored" students; she was excluded from certain hotels and restaurants at a time when she was received by royalty and heads of state; she was barred from pursuing the operatic career she always dreamed of because the Metropolitan Opera would not admit blacks, until she became its first black soloist in 1955. Among those who acknowledge their debt to Marian Anderson are Leontyne Price and Jessye Norman, for whom she was a trailblazer.
Allan Keiler, a professor of music at Brandeis University, who is completing a biography of Miss Anderson, says, "Without diminishing her greatness as a symbol of freedom, I try to refocus in my book on her neglected musical reputation. Beyond her incomparable voice, she had the artistry to capture any vocal style, from Schubert lieder to a spiritual."
When Marian Anderson retired from the concert stage at the age of 68, Professor Keiler attended one of her farewell concerts in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1964. He recalls: "She walked on stage to begin the recital wearing a white dress that lent her a regal aura. Before she sang a note, the audience immediately rose as one and gave her a long, standing ovation. There were few dry eyes in the house."
Professor Keiler says he has reservations about making the Marianna Farm studio a museum.
"This only accentuates a trend," he says, "to mythologize Marian Anderson as a symbol, to distance her from us as a singer whose art we know less and less about as the years go by. Many of her important recordings haven't been available for decades. Let's remember her through her vocal art."

HEADLINE: Labor's Story in Wartime Bridgeport

BYLINE: By JARRET LIOTTA 

 BODY:
BRIDGEPORT was a different city in 1944. Many of the men were overseas fighting the war. Though industry, particularly war-related production, thrived, the labor shortage demanded that women go into the work force.
Marjorie Nordstrom Schneider was part of all that. She became a safety advocate for the women workers at the Bridgeport Brass Company, which, among other things, produced shell casings for the Navy. 
 "Bridgeport was a mecca for all kinds of industry," she said. "Because of the war, different jobs were created that didn't exist before. Industry was hiring anyplace you wanted to go."
It took the then-23-year-old Marjorie Nordstrom about 20 minutes to walk the six or so blocks down East Main Street to the factory, where she would change into coveralls, safety shoes and peaked mesh hat.
"East Main Street in those days had some good restaurants," she said. "They had department stores that were top quality."
The experiences and impressions of Mrs. Schneider will not be lost. Thanks to a project at the Bridgeport Library, the history of labor and the working class in the once-great industrial city will be documented. The relationship between Bridgeport's development and that of the United States during the 20th century will come alive through an oral history, available through a interactive Web site.
"This is something that I've been thinking about for years, so I'm really excited," said Mary Witkowski, head of historical collections at the Bridgeport Library. "My interest is in urban geography and the histories of cities and the growth of cities." Ms. Witkowski came from the Detroit area, where she worked in urban planning before earning a master's degree in library science.
Since 1986, Ms. Witkowski has entertained a regular procession of Bridgeporters who visit at the library. "They would drift into my office and tell me their personal stories and I would wish I had a tape recorder," she said. "The only thing that everybody had in common was that they all came for work."
Ms. Witkowski sees several parallels between Bridgeport and Detroit, including the rise and ultimate failure of the local industries, not to mention the influx of immigrants that continued even after the jobs were gone.
"In many ways I think of Bridgeport about 10 years behind Detroit," she said. "Detroit has seen a bit of a renaissance, while I think Bridgeport has just gotten to the cusp of that."
The project will span the entire century, with a list of about 30 residents set to be interviewed.
"For the Web site we'll probably only be doing 10 or less," she said, "but we want to get the process in place. That way if someone interesting comes along we can go out and interview them."
Ms. Witkowski will be working closely with Cecelia Bucki, an associate professor of history at Fairfield University who is a specialist in labor and social history. Several of her students will help conduct interviews as part of their course work.
"Bridgeport has some very unique qualities to it that aren't readily apparent today," said Dr. Bucki, a Bridgeport native who did her doctoral dissertation on the city's labor movement in the 1920's. "It was a very dynamic industrial center, even though it was very small."
She spoke of the importance of oral histories as providing valuable documentation for scholars, as well as preserving the culture. "What we're trying to get at is ordinary people's lives," she said.
Jeremy Brecher, a West Cornwall writer who has done numerous oral history projects, wrote the book "History From Below: How to Uncover and Tell the Story of Your Community, Association, or Union." a guide for conducting oral histories. He recently gave a workshop for those participating in this project.
"Oral history often opens a window into the lives of working people and other non-elite groups," he said. "You're getting the experience of people who lived through historical events, what they saw, what they felt, what it meant to them."
Unlike major historical figures or groups, the histories of working people can't usually be obtained through conventional sources. "There's generally no video tape or oral tapes, and often much less in the way of correspondence," he said.
City librarian Nancy Johmannsaid of the Bridgeport project: "One of the things that I think is unique about it is this concept of making it available on the Web. It permits a lot of people who wouldn't get that interested to tune in and see a living piece of history."
"Many individuals will not pick up something in writing," she said, "but if it flashes on a computer screen or on a television set they'll read it."
The site will feature an audio element, as well as photographs and text. While a similar Web site exists involving oral histories, which was done through Brown University in Rhode Island, Ms. Witkowski said hers would be more of an exhibition.
The Connecticut Humanities Council gave a grant of $9,500 for the first phase of the project and probably will assist with the Web site.
"This is a project we like and will carefully monitor," said Laurie Rayner, associate director. She said the council has never had a request to fund a Web site project and reasoned that it would be an accessible and efficient venue for teaching the humanities.
Another $5,000 came from retired Superior Court Judge Margaret Driscoll, 82, a Bridgeport native who, before this project, had wanted the library to do a labor exhibit in memory of her husband, John Driscoll, the head of the Connecticut State Labor Council A.F.L.-C.I.O. from 1968 to 1985.
"I wanted them to do a history of labor in Bridgeport because I thought that would be appropriate," said Judge Driscoll. "I think it's important for people of the younger generation to know what happened, how they got the benefits they got" -- including pensions, job security and safety regulations.
"They don't know what unions brought with them," she said.
The interview process began last week and will probably go through the end of January. Ms. Witkowski said she hoped to have the Web site up sometime in the spring.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/ Norwalk, Conn.;
No Longer That 'Hole in the Doughnut'

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
IN the 70's the Norwalk Chamber of Commerce tried to attract business to the city by calling it "the hole in the doughnut." "They thought it would appeal to businesses as an undiscovered place on the Gold Coast -- a good area on the cheap, " said former Mayor William A. Collins.
But the phrase backfired and just emphasized the economic and social problems that set the struggling city apart from Darien, Westport, Wilton, Weston and New Canaan -- the wealthy residential towns at its borders. 
 Today, benefiting from an influx of corporations moving from or bypassing the expensive Stamford-Greenwich market, it has drawn corporate employees who found homes in neighborhoods indistinguishable from those in adjacent towns. And over the last decade, Norwalk has established an urban, diversified cachet all its own.
Estates on the wooded, rocky waterfront, handsome back country colonials and Tudors, luxury condominium complexes and a rash of smart new clustered, single-family houses cost some 20 percent less than their counterparts in neighboring towns. Condominiums and houses needing fix-up or situated in marginal neighborhoods can be found at five- and low six-figure prices.
Alfred Zellerkraut from Marseilles is typical of the new Norwalk resident. For the last three years he has worked for Swiss Bank in New York, while living in New Jersey with his family.
Last month he was transferred to Swiss Bank's new headquarters in Stamford and after much searching he bought a house from the developer's plans on North Taylor Avenue in Norwalk -- 2,200 square feet, 4 bedrooms on about a fifth of an acre -- for $250,000. It will be completed in January to his specifications. "I was surprised at prices in Westchester and Fairfield County," he said. "Houses 60 years old in terrible condition cost what I am paying. I got a bigger house for less money and I like the location, the coziness of the town."
"We have had lots of buyers from Swiss Bank," said Carol Ann Falasca, a Norwalk broker with Coldwell Banker who was not involved in the Zellerkraut sale. "Everybody wants new, and corporate people know that the houses they buy must be resalable -- no problems like old lead paint or underground oil tanks."
As of last month 532 units of housing in single-family subdivisions, cluster housing developments and multifamily condominium complexes were being built,proposed or approved for construction here.
Five homes have been sold and five more are under contract at the 29-lot subdivision at Linden Heights, off the Main Avenue and Merritt Parkway intersection. Priced from $273,000 to $311,000, they offer 42 optional features in addition to 3 and 4 bedrooms, full basements, up to 2,260 square feet and 2-car garages. On the upscale waterfront off Canfield Avenue, 1- to 3-acre building lots with buried utilities, roads and sewers are available for $965,000 to $1.1 million.
Silvermine, Wilson Point and Rowayton are some of the more expensive, established neighborhoods. Heavily wooded and secluded Silvermine has attracted celebrities such as the actress Eileen Heckart, the writers Vance Packard and Evan Hunter, the sculptor Solon Borglum and Lawrence Eagleburger, a former Secretary of State.
Wilson Point contains a private beach club and handsome homes on wooded, hilly roads overlooking Norwalk harbor. The more densely populated Rowayton, also on the water, has its own shopping district, beach, park, art center and yacht clubs. "People who can't afford Darien hop over to Rowayton," said Janet Ryducha, a broker with Preferred Properties.
LAST March John Delner moved out of Darien after his divorce and into a 3-bedroom colonial at Getner Farms in Norwalk, where homes range in price from $240,000 to $270,000. "It was affordable in my circumstances," he said. "I can stay in the same golf club and see my friends and I have room for my children to visit. The big thing in coming to Norwalk is higher taxes -- but properties are priced lower than elsewhere in the area."
Taxes vary by about $5 per thousand dollars of assessment in Norwalk's nine taxing districts, and while the mill rate, or amount of tax for each $1,000 of assessed value, is the third highest in the state, there is sufficient compensation in price to satisfy most buyers.
Norwalk's 12 elementary schools, four middle schools and two high schools, long regarded as inferior by many home buyers, have improved academically. But average SAT scores of 477 in math and 483 for verbal are still below state figures of 507 in math and 509 for verbal.
"The top 10 percent of high school graduates score in the high SAT ranges," said Dr. Susan B. Weinberger, spokeswoman for the Norwalk school system. "This year we had a National Merit Scholarship semi-finalist and six commendations."
Various steps taken to bring underperforming students up to par include a mentor program in which 800 employes from 44 area corporations invite students, one on one, to spend one day a week at the company. A school-to-work program that creates internships for high school juniors and seniors, college-bound or not, is based on their special interests and coordinated with schoolwork. Both programs have been replicated around the state, even in Gold Coast towns, according to Dr. Weinberger.
Academically and artistically gifted children are placed in special programs from grade 3, and the citywide curriculum contains a comprehensive music and art component through grade 12. Brien McMahon High School offers a year of courses in Japanese history, language and culture, culminating in a two-week trip to Japan. A large number of students from other Fairfield County towns are enrolled in the program.
Norwalk has no private schools, but there are several in adjacent towns.
Inviting to many buyers is Norwalk's emergence as a lively city, with two multiscreen movie theaters, an art moviehouse, dozens of restaurants catering to a range of pocketbooks and palates and the boutiques, restaurants nightclubs and art galleries of the Historic District on Washington Street. Other draws are the Maritime Aquarium, a symphony orchestra, the Norwalk Museum (a treasury of city history and products including the original Raggedy Ann and Andy), two large beaches and 1,200 acres of parklands, ballfields and playgrounds.
Oak Hills, an 18-hole municipal golf course, charges residents $14 and $15 a day for weekday or weekend play, and $4 or $5 an hour to use one of 40 city tennis courts.
Cove Marina and Rex Marina, typical of many public marinas, fill up quickly for the coming season, charging from $45 to $90 a foot for boats of various sizes and around $40 for winter storage. The city maintains a boat launch at Veterans Park.
The city's several private clubs include Silvermine and Shorehaven golf clubs and the Norwalk and Rowayton yacht clubs.
Norwalk Brewhouse -- a microbrewery, restaurant and brew museum -- opened a year ago near the historic district for lunch and dinner, serving its own beers. Dinner for two runs around $50. Amberjacks on Washington Street features dry aged steak and seafood. Dinner for two is about $60.
ONE of several new South Norwalk nightclubs is called The Loft, where cigars, 20 flavors of martinis and a live band are the principal attractions.
Commuters have a choice of three railroad stations and easy access to the Merritt Parkway, Route 7 and Interstate 95. The South Norwalk station redevelopment was completed last year at a cost of $13 million.
A total of 50,860 people, more than half Norwalk's population, hold cards at the city's four libraries. Residents get their area news from The Hour, a daily newspaper, The Norwalk News, a weekly, and the WNLK-AM and WEFX-FM radio stations.
Each year thousands of visitors flock to the Scottish Games in July, the SoNo Arts Festival in August and the Oyster Festival in September. Antique car shows, one of the largest in-water boat show on the East Coast, hot-air-balloon races and sailboat races, concerts in the parks and on the beaches are other seasonal events. At the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion, a Victorian-Gothic National Landmark, splendidly restored, residents and others may attend lectures, concerts and outdoor festivals.
Norwalk was founded on land bought from the Indians by Roger Ludlowe in 1640 and declared a town by the General Court of Connecticut in 1651. "The British burned 135 patriots' homes and two churches there during the Revolutionary War, but the patriots burned Loyalist homes in retaliation and used traitors' portraits for target practice," said Ralph Bloom, the city's historian.
The city thrived on agriculture for two centuries, until the arrival of the New York & New Haven Railroad in the mid-19th century, stimulating manufacturing and leading to the construction of summer homes for wealthy New Yorkers. "We had a huge hat industry," said Mr. Bloom, "downtown shops and theaters."
But from the late 50's through the 70's South Norwalk became a haven for drugs and prostitution, damaging the city's reputation. And according to Mr. Bloom, the ubiquitous automobile encouraged people to work, shop and ultimately live elsewhere.
Beginning in the 80's, however, the redevelopment of South Norwalk turned this around. Residents and shops returned as drug dealers and prostitutes all but vanished. And the neighborhood's prosperity has helped bring about the city's recovery.

On East End, a Transfer Tax for Land Preservation?

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
SHOULD property buyers on the East End be required to pay a 2 percent tax on a portion of the purchase price as a contribution to future land preservation?
If state enabling legislation is adopted, the five easternmost towns would each have the option of putting that question to voters next year. A bill to be submitted to the Legislature in January is being drafted. 
 The enabling legislation that would permit a so-called real estate transfer tax would apply only to East Hampton, Southampton, Riverhead, Southold and Shelter Island. Revenues would be placed in a special fund that could be used only for land acquisition or other preservation measures, such as the purchase of development rights.
Each town would hold a separate referendum and a majority of voters would have to approve before a town board could impose the tax.
With the revival of the real estate market, farmland on the East End is being developed at an alarming rate, said Kevin McDonald, vice president of the Group for the South Fork, a nonprofit land preservation organization in Bridgehampton, which is advocating the transfer tax.
"The history and the character of an important part of Long Island are being lost," he said. "We need a funding coordination strategy and a land protection strategy, or the East End as we know it will be gone forever."
Although the transfer-tax proposal has the backing of many East End business and civic leaders, there is concern that such a measure could set a precedent and be used elsewhere in the state for other purposes.
"The only way we see not opposing this is if it's really restricted to the East End and preserving the East End," said Robert A. Wieboldt, executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute. "But opening up this new funding source in general is a frightening proposition."
The proposed legislation, which would expire in 2007, could generate $80 million to $100 million over the 10 years if adopted in all five towns, said Mr. McDonald of the Group for the South Fork. And, he added, it could raise enough money to protect 10,000 acres either through outright purchase or through the purchase of development rights.
Under a new law that allows municipalities to pay for land purchases in installments over several years some land could be immediately purchased and paid for out of future income, Mr. McDonald said.
Towns would appoint advisory committees to select the most appropriate land, with emphasis placed on scenic vistas and maintaining contiguous farmland.
A previous bill affecting only East Hampton was approved by the State Legislature in August. Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed it on the basis that it should have applied to all the East End towns and that it should have exempted farmland sold to farmers and land already protected by conservation easements. The bill now being drafted includes those provisions.
To protect low- to middle-income buyers, part of the purchase price would be exempted from the tax, with the amount left up to each town. This year's East Hampton bill would have exempted the first $250,000 on improved property and the first $100,000 on vacant land.
In such a case, the buyer of a house costing $250,000 or less would pay no tax, the buyer of a $500,000 house would incur a $5,000 tax and the tax on vacant land selling for $500,000 would be $8,000.
"There is so much going on so quickly, that if we don't get in and buy open space in a hurry we'll lose the battle and we'll become the same place as everywhere else," said Edwin M. Schwenk, the co-director with Richard Amper of a nonprofit organization in Southampton called East End Forever. Mr. Schwenk formerly was executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute.
To illustrate the pressure of development, he noted that the number of permits issued for new construction in the Town of Southampton and its incorporated villages increased from just 380 in 1993 to 1,344 in 1994. Last year, 3,009 permits were issued in the five towns -- 1,621 permits in Southampton alone.
"Out here is the last bastion of the way it was," said Paul Brennan, vice president of Sotheby's International Realty in Bridgehampton. "There is no place else to go, so if people want to maintain the rural character that this area has enjoyed all these years, something has to be done."
WHILE maintaining that they are not against land preservation, critics of the proposed tax call it unfair because it singles out a small group of people -- new buyers.
"I've always supported land conservation," said Fritz Mayer, the owner of Boxwood Realty in Bridgehampton. "But it's the method of paying for it that I am opposing. If I move to California or Utah should I have to pay a tax because I'm moving there? What kind of nonsense is that?"
"It's a soak-the-rich tax," said Richard Pellicane, a Southampton lawyer who organized a successful opposition to a transfer tax in 1984. "And to compound that, you are soaking a class of people from another area. If the objectives are good, then the money should come from the general tax base."
In past years, funds raised locally for open-space acquisition have been derived from a .25 percent sales tax imposed on Suffolk County residents and separate bond issues approved by voters in the five towns. Voters in Southampton and East Hampton, for example, approved $50 million in bond issues over the last eight years. Last year, Southampton voters also approved a special assessment in addition to property taxes.
Nevertheless, more funding sources are needed, said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning group based in Manhattan. "There is so much subdivision activity on the East End that we simply don't have the funds in place right now to stay ahead of the bulldozers on important conservation properties," he said.
Noting that a real estate transfer tax had worked successfully for years in Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Block Island, he said, "People who buy into a resort community are buying an amenity package and part of that package is open space, countryside and farmstands."
Long-term residents have already paid to preserve those amenities, he said, insisting that a transfer tax on buyers was fair. "People are buying in because it's a really nice place," he said, "so they should pay their fair share."
Nantucket was the first place in the nation to create a land bank with a real estate transfer tax. The 2 percent tax in effect since 1985 has so far raised about $37 million and has enabled the town to purchase about 1,600 acres of land, said John D. Pagini, the director of Nantucket's Planning and Economic Development Commission. "It's had a very big effect on the efforts to preserve community character here, which is the reason why it was first proposed," he said.
ALTHOUGH some real estate brokers fear a transfer tax would hurt sales, others say it would have no effect. "People are willing to make a commitment because land and beauty is very important to them," said Michael DeSario, a partner of the Cook Pony Farm brokerage in East Hampton.
Others warn that the downside of taking so much land off the tax rolls is the danger of keeping out people with moderate incomes.
"Every time you add such a tax, you do two things," said William W. Esseks, a Riverhead lawyer. "You increase the cost of land and, by using the money to buy permanent open space, you further increase the cost and reduce access for middle- and lower-income people."
But Stephen M. Jones, director of planning for Suffolk County, said open space programs help preserve the area's way of life. "Historically people of all income groups have lived on the East End and we see these programs as preserving the type of life that has existed out there," he added.
The county has had a farmland preservation program in effect since 1977. Most of the $32 million spent so far has gone to preserve land on the East End where most of the farms are situated. A Farmland Protection Plan adopted by the County Legislature last year recommended increasing the level of spending. The issue of development pressures on the East End will be discussed in public meetings to be held Dec. 6 in Southold High School and Southampton College.
If a transfer tax comes to a vote next year, will local residents support it?
Speaking for Southampton, Town Supervisor Vincent J. Cannuscio said:
"If history is a guide, where environmental matters have been placed before the voters in the Town of Southampton they have overwhelmingly supported them."

HEADLINE: RELIGION;
From Different Paths, Muslims Seek Common Ground

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY

 BODY:
On Friday afternoons, the parking lot of the new Muslim Center of Middlesex County is often jammed. Once the white-lined spaces are full, the cars double up in the driving lanes.
Inside the brick building, built by Muslims who met in a Piscataway ranch house for the last 10 years, several hundred men pray aloud, together, in the main chamber. Upstairs, a few dozen women, hidden by screens and draped in cloth from head to ankle, silently follow along. Most are Pakistani or Indian immigrants. A few are blue-eyed American converts. There are almost no black worshipers here. 
 This is the face of Islam in New Jersey, the state with the fourth largest Muslim population in the nation.
Islam, which is believed to have at least 5 million adherents in the United States, draws on two main sources in this country: immigration and the heritage of conversion among black Americans. Both are strongly represented in New Jersey, which has at least 37 masjids, or mosques, and more than 20 Islamic schools. Estimates of the number of Muslims in the state range from 200,000 Muslims to 1 million.
Whatever the number, it is growing, with immigration -- from South Asia and other Muslim strongholds -- abreast or ahead of growth through conversion and heredity. And that highlights the gap that often exists between indigenous Muslims and immigrant Muslims, a divide neatly expressed over Labor Day weekend in two national conventions. One, in Secaucus, drew 20,000 Muslims, mainly black; the other, in Chicago, drew 22,000, mainly immigrants and their descendants.
"That definitely pulled some people who would have come to Secaucus," said Ayesha K. Mustafaa, the editor of the Muslim Journal, a Chicago-based national weekly newspaper serving black Muslims. "There is some talk to trying to have them together next time."
Part of the separation has to do with the Nation of Islam. Many Muslims, black and immigrant, see its tenets, including its central idea of black supremacy, as antithetical to orthodox Islam. The organization, founded by Elijah Mohammad in 1933, split after his death in 1975. His son has taken the larger faction, now called the Muslim American Society, in the direction of orthodox Sunni Islam, while the Rev. Louis Farrakhan kept the name Nation of Islam for his smaller group and continued its separatist teachings. But many people do not realize that the Nation of Islam is not the mainstream of American black Islam.
That mainstream has a patchwork history. In the 1500's, some Africans imported as slaves were practicing Muslims; Moorish explorers and settlers also brought Islam. A few decades after the Civil War, Edward Blyden encouraged black Americans to turn to Islam. In the early 1900's, Muslim emigres from the Ottoman Empire begin arriving. And in 1913, Newark took a leading spot in the nurturing of Islam in America with the establishment of the Moorish Science Temple of America, which was dedicated to black conversion to Islam. During exactly the years the Nation of Islam was forming, some of the Moorish members, including Muhammad Elzadeen, were studying Sunni Islam in Egypt.
Heshaam Jaabar, 66, an imam in Elizabeth, was an Elzadeen protege. "I did Malcolm X's funeral," he said. "It was we that helped pull Malcolm out of the Nation of Islam."
The civil rights movement, both a cause and an effect of growth in black Islam, indirectly helped bring more Muslim immigrants to the United States. In 1965, with calls for racial equality ringing in its ears, the nation scrapped longstanding immigration policies preferential to Europeans.
Black Americans, coping with the bitter history of slavery and social inequity, have sometimes seen these immigrants as interlopers. W. Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Mohammad, found it necessary specifically to combat that attitude. "I have on my mind the way some of you treat immigrant Muslims," he wrote in a book based on his speeches, "Al-Islam Unity and Leadership." "You look for an excuse to write them off. And that is really ugly."
Economic disparity was a clear cause. "Someone comes in and runs the store successfully and does something progressive in the same physical environment that another couldn't progress in," he wrote. "So they are hated simply because they have shown up your bad record. That same weakness may be motivating us to say, 'Brother, don't trust those old Arabs!' "
And, even absent bad feeling, economics can easily separate the immigrant Muslims, who are often professionals, from the struggling black communities in which mosques were often first founded. Immigrant communities sometimes build their own, as with the Muslim Center of Middlesex County. As a result, mosques are often either black or immigrant.
"I don't think its willful," Ms. Mustafaa said. "But where you live dictates where you go to worship. There are economic variants that will always make a difference. And God blesses whom He pleases."
For their part, immigrant Muslims have been slow to acknowledge the leadership of black Muslims or to mingle socially. Zakiudin Sharfi, an imam who came from Pakistan in the late 1970's and who, as chairman of Islamic Educational Services, a religious center based in Mount Holly, visits mosques throughout the state, said few black Muslims knew Arabic as well as immigrants. And in a faith dedicated to heeding and preserving the exact language of the Koran, he said, that is a huge obstacle.
Socially, Imam Sharfi said, there are subtle and powerful gaps that time will bridge. "Immigrants have very strong family backgrounds and are often coming from tribal groups," he said. "They have not undergone industrialization and all these pressures."
Some New Jersey mosques do have blended congregations. In Elizabeth, where the center on Salem Avenue is undergoing renovation, Imam Jaaber said, "We have Egyptians, Afghans, Anglos, Pakistanis and Palestinians."
Jimmy Smalls, an East Orange Councilman who attends a mosque in Irvington, said he was involved in several initiatives to bring black and immigrant Muslims together. One, the Majlis Ashura of New Jersey, is a monthly gathering of Muslim leaders meant to solve problems collectively. "When we meet, there is a mutual respect at the table," he said. "Doesn't matter if you're a white Turk or a black American, or are of an Indian background from the Caribbean or an Arab from Egypt itself."
He said both black and immigrant Muslims were deeply concerned with the problems their teen-age children were facing. The agenda at a recent meeting included a discussion about a proposed state oversight committee composed of three sheiks: one black, one Bangladeshi and one Arab. And he said one of his constituents, Earl Sadiq, with the New Jersey Muslim Business Association, was trying to put together a mini-convention in which successful immigrant business owners would teach black Muslims about enterprise.
Some leaders say the non-Muslim world discriminates between black and immigrant Muslims more than Muslims do.
"We are all Muslims," said Armiya Nu'Man, imam at the Masjid Mohammad in Jersey City. "We look at our immigrant brothers as that, as brothers. They see us as their brothers in the West." But after the World Trade Center bombing, he acknowledged, immigrant Muslims suffered a more painful backlash from the general public. "We've been pretty fortunate," he said, "because they don't look at us with the same eye that they look at the immigrants."
And at the Muslim Center of Middlesex County, the pain of stereotyping was as raw as the eagerness to portray Muslims in a positive light, as a devout people with a faith that could solve America's worse social problems.
"Islam is the most misunderstood religion," Imam Sharfi said. "People think of the long beards; They think maniacs!" Protesting such prejudice, he shook his head and said, "Was it not enough, the Crusades, one after another?"

HEADLINE: And Now, the Next Four Years

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
ON the morning after her narrow re-election victory, Governor Whitman stood before the television cameras, appearing unfazed by her near-defeat and promising to tackle the two problems that dominated the campaign: auto insurance and property taxes.
But two hours later, one floor above her State House office, came the first sign that the Governor could encounter some turbulence pushing her agenda through the Legislature even though her fellow Republicans remain firmly in control. 
 The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, announced that the plan Mrs. Whitman had promoted throughout her campaign to lower auto-insurance rates was dead. The next day, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins agreed. And a few days later, both Republican legislative leaders joined Mrs. Whitman at a State House news conference to announce that a newly created legislative committee, not the Governor, would come up with the way to lower premiums sometime next year.
So began the unofficial start of Governor Whitman'ssecond and final four-year term. Of the eight governors elected since the revised state constitution of 1947 set four-year terms, Mrs. Whitman is the fifth to gain a second term.
What can voters expect from this lame duck who won with only 47 percent of the vote? Will she have the vision to formulate an ambitious agenda and the clout to push it through the Legislature? Since both Mr. Collins and Mr. DiFrancesco are said to be jockeying for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2001, will it be Mrs. Whitman's agenda or theirs that will dominate state government over the next four years? What role will a vanquished Democratic Party play: spoiler, deal maker or both? And will her own political ambitions, as yet unclear, draw her focus away from the state, or persuade her to stick close to home?
For now, it appears that the balance of power has tipped a bit toward the Legislature. Unlike Mrs. Whitman, most lawmakers escaped voter wrath over paying the highest auto-insurance rates in the nation. Overall, they fared better on Election Day than the Governor, whose razor-thin victory over the Democratic challenger, State Senator James E. McGreevey, has weakened her political standing within the State House and in the national Republican Party.
But Mrs. Whitman can easily reclaim much of her standing in January when she will have three chances to outline her hopes for a second term in her inaugural address, her annual State of the State speech to the Legislature, and her fifth state budget.
Former Governor Thomas H. Kean, whose two-term administration ended in 1990, said that a second term offered Mrs. Whitman opportunity to impose policies and programs that might not have been politically possible during her first four years. "You don't have to run for re-election," he said. "You don't have to worry about the politics. You can have your own agenda.
"If she comes out of the box with a State of the State address that has some exciting things and you see the popularity cliff moving, the Legislature will come along," he said. "The more the state is with you, the Legislature is with you, too. They don't want to take you on."
Every governor wants to leave a legacy, and lowering auto-insurance premiums is not something historians are likely to cite as a major accomplishment decades from now when they review Mrs. Whitman's tenure. What voters can expect to hear Mrs. Whitman talk about in January, as she formally begins her second term, is education.
Mrs. Whitman said in an interview last week that she hoped her legacy would be that of a Governor who improved education beyond the needs of the State Supreme Court order to resolve the decades-old dispute over the spending disparity between the state's richest and poorest school districts.
In May, the Whitman administration met the court's demand that the state send an extra $248 million to 28 urban school districts. The court has also ordered the state to identify more programs to help students overcome disadvantages and find money to pay for them. Last week, state officials estimated the cost of rebuildings dilapidated school buildings in urban districts alone would be about $1.8 billion.
"I would like to be recognized for having established the best educational system," Mrs. Whitman said. "We will have addressed the court's concerns. We will have gotten the core standards and early childhood education programs in place.
"To me, a solid educational footing helps with all the other problems that we have to deal with, whether it is unemployment or crime," she said. "If people don't have the education, they can't get the jobs. We know the relationship between jobs and crime. So cracking the nut on education is the top priority, not just for the 28 special-needs district, but across the state."
Mrs. Whitman may not wield as much political clout with the Legislature as she did in her first term, but she remains undaunted by all the talk that she will face considerable trouble winning approval of her legislative agenda in her second term.
"We work together well," she said, referring to Mr. Collins and Mr. DiFrancesco. "I don't worry about that."
For the most part, there is agreement among Mrs. Whitman, and the Republican leaders about what challenges need to be addressed, and improving education, lowering auto-insurance rates and reducing property taxes is on everyone's list.
As she starts a second term, however, Mrs. Whitman might find herself, playing more of the role of politician than chief executive if she wants her agenda approved. Lawmakers have long complained that her administration has not been responsive to their needs and concerns They have also said she has not always brought them into the process and consulted with them before announcing major policy initiatives.
"I think it is going to be a little different, but that we will be together, pretty much as we have been," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "I think that the education issue will loom large again, not necessarily around standards, but rather people will be looking for ways to deal with the educational funding system and how it is tied to local property taxes. I think it is our intent, as a group, to address property taxes so that we can provide some kind of financial help."
Mr. DiFrancesco said he expects that there will be more give and take. "If she has ideas, I want to be on board with her," he said. "But I think it is going to be more wide open and that she will be more open to suggestions from us."
Mr. Collins said that he expected much will be accomplished in the coming months. For one thing, he noted, Assembly members are up for re-election in two years, unlike their colleagues in the Senate. "We have a shorter time frame," he said. "We have to be right on top of the program."
Also, Mrs. Whitman may have to bring Democrats to the table for the first time because she may not always be able to rely exclusively on Republican support for her programs. It will be interesting to see if Democrats, who now wield little power in the State House, participate or lay in wait until their next chance to regain control.
Although Mrs. Whitman said that education would be the primary focus, she also said that she was determined to address concerns about local property-tax rates. The state, of course, does not set property tax rates, but more state aid for school districts, for example, could keep rates low.
In her first term, Mrs. Whitman kept state aid to municipalities flat, and increased spending for schools only this year. However, she offered local governments several new tools to control spending, such as making state budget officials available to make recommendations on how local spending could be curtailed.
Now, Mrs. Whitman said, she does not think that an increase in a statewide tax, like the income tax or the sales tax, is what voters want to reduce their property tax bill.
Mrs. Whitman said that she has no "magic solution" to ease the property-tax burden on homeowners. But, she said, there will be no solution until New Jerseyans understand that they will have to be make some tough choices regarding the state's cherished home-rule tradition, before homeowners see some relief.
"If we are going to be serious about property taxes, we have to talk about serious civil service reform," she said. "We have to get serious about sharing services and changing the way we reward municipalities. It is just frightening when you look at all the layers of government that we have. You cannot just nibble around the edges. We have already done a bunch of things that have had an impact, and that is why the rate of increases have gone down, but there is much more to be done."
In New Jersey, she points out, there are 566 municipalities, 21 counties, 611 school districts, 225 local authorities and 188 fire districts.
"One of the consequences of our strong tradition of home rule is that our public services are not always delivered in the most effective or cost-efficient manner possible," she said. "Who pays for the overlapping and overlaying of services? The property taxpayer."
But before tackling property taxes, school financing, and auto insurance, the most immediate problem that Mrs. Whitman and lawmakers have to address is charity care. They need to find up to $400 million a year for hospitals that are required under state law to provide free medical treatment to uninsured people. The current system, which relies heavily on payroll taxes deposited into the state's Unemployment Compensation Fund, expires on Dec. 31. Both business groups and organized labor fiercely oppose continued dependence on this fund, and hospitals are insisting that the state provide them with a permanent financing solution.
There are also other areas of concern that more than a dozen public policy experts identified in interviews last week that range from solving the solid-waste disposal crisis to campaign-finance reform to maintaining strong environmental protection laws to reviving the state's cities.
Then there are relatively new problems that need to be addressed. Tremendous growth in some parts of the state has put new pressures on municipalities to build schools, as well as to cope with traffic congestion along two-lane country roads that were not designed for heavy commuter travel. And how does the state replace disappearing manufacturing jobs that provided good wages and benefits to workers?
"How do we grow our prosperity and how do more people participate in our prosperity?" said Dr. Saul K. Fenster, the president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology. "I believe that an awful lot of this has to do with the maintenance of business in the state, and the growth of small business in the state."
What Mrs. Whitman and lawmakers have not discussed is the prospect that the economic expansion will come to an end. Every challenge facing the state, with the exception of lowering auto-insurance rates, carries a hefty pricetag. The bill for rehabilitating and building new schools across the state stands at almost $10 billion, according to one estimate last week.
During Mrs Whitman's first term, a strong economy poured a steady stream of unanticipated tax dollars into state coffers that economists say will dry up as soon as the state hits an inevitable economic downturn.
Then Mrs. Whitman and Republican lawmakers will be faced with the prospect of tearing programs apart rather than proposing new ones.
"We are going to have a recession sometime in the next four years," said James Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Policy at Rutgers University. "The national expansion is now 80 months long. The average post-war expansion is 50 months. We are two and a half years beyond the average expansion. There will be a downturn, which will then put us under real strain.
"What normally happens is that state revenues fall short of the budgetary requirements," he said. "That means means raising taxes or massive cuts. And that is going to be a crisis when it comes."
For now, the state's economy is adding more jobs. And if some of Mrs. Whitman's advisers have their way, she will be out of the State House before a state fiscal crisis looms. They would like to see her run in two years against Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who vows he will run for another term. Then, maybe, think about running for President in 2004 or 2008.
But after her bruising campaign this fall, Mrs. Whitman may not be looking forward to the prospect of another race. And before any talk resumes about Mrs. Whitman's national ambitions, she first needs to take care of business at home.

Newark's Science Park Takes Another Step Forward

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH $60 million in state financing and leases from three tenants in place, plans are moving forward on a 161,600-square-foot medical research building that will anchor the second phase of development at the 50-acre University Heights Science Park in Newark's Central Ward.
Half of the $66 million International Center for Public Health, which is expected to be completed in two years, will house the new headquarters of the Public Health Research Institute, a private organization now based in Manhattan that conducts research on infectious diseases. 
 It will also be home to the National Tuberculosis Center and the department of microbiology and molecular genetics, both part of the Medical School of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
The university is one of the four institutions of higher education in the city's core that 12 years ago began discussing turning the ramshackle neighborhood in their backyard into a university-related science park. The others are Rutgers University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Essex County Community College.
The three entities in the International Center for Public Health track, treat and seek to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, from tuberculosis to AIDS. The existing two smaller buildings totaling 45,000 square feet, which were completed last fall, house offices, the New Jersey Center for Biomaterials and Medical Devices and incubator space for 17 start-up technology companies. They alsoinclude a day-care center for 100 children.
The newbuilding is to rise on three acres -- the site is yet to be determined --within a 14-acre area bounded by Lock, Warren and Norfolk Streets and Central Avenue that will be acquired under the state financing. The land acquisition will cost $12 million.
Dennis E. Lower, executive director of University Science Park Inc., the nonprofit entity created in 1992 to develop the park with the city, community and private industry as partners, said the remaining $18 million needed for the project was expected to be secured from public and private sources by next fall.
The $350-million park is intended to draw emerging high-technology and biotechnology companies to Newark by forging links to the 35,000-student, faculty and employee population of its academic neighbors and, in the process, promote economic development.
The park, which will need additional financing for land acquisition and construction, could take as long as 15 years to build. And the project will include demolition of commercial buildings and housing.
Eventually, the park will consist of one million square feet of office, laboratory and incubator space, as well as housing and shops.
If fully realized, the park could produce 6,000 jobs, including 700 at the International Public Health Center, Mr. Lower said.
EXPLAINING the significance of the new building, the result of 16 months of discussion among industry, local, state and Federal Government leaders, Stanley S. Bergen Jr., president of the University of Medicine and Dentistry, said: "This gives us credibility and proves a science park can be created in Newark."
Apart from the building itself, the park also will gain something Mr. Lower said it never had before -- the ability to market 11 acres of developable land on which three more structures could be built, with up to 150,000 square feet of space each.
"This project," he said, "breaks the park wide open for private investment."
Before year's end, Mr. Lower said, a developer also will be named to turn two blocks adjacent to the new building into up to 80 new and renovated mixed-income residences. And by next spring a site, outside of but close to the park, will be selected for the science and technology high school, which is expected to have 800 students.
The announcement of the International Public Health Center is the latest bit of good news for Newark, whose slow revitalization has recently gained momentum. Glenn A. Grant, the city's Business Administrator, said that about $1 billion had been invested in Newark in the last four and a half years in developments that are beginning to bear fruit.
Last month the $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center was completed, and ground was broken on Oct. 16 for a 100,000-square-foot speculative industrial building that will be called the South Ward Industrial Park. Two weeks later the St. Barnabas Medical Center of Livingston announced plans to build a commercial laundry on an undetermined site, which will employ 400 people. Additionally, hundreds of mixed-income residences have gone up in Newark's neighborhoods.
"The Science Park project, like the others, marry housing with jobs and economic development," said Mr. Grant. "To revitalize the city we cannot have a single-development oasis, but communities where people can live, work and shop."
There are 140 such research parks in the nation, including two others in New Jersey, according to the Association of University Related Research Parks, a trade group in Washington, D.C. The two others in New Jersey are the 2,200-acre Princeton Forrestal Center in Plainsboro and South Brunswick and the 50-acre state-sponsored Technology Center of New Jersey in North Brunswick.
The majority of such parks are in suburban centers, so launching one in Newark, with its checkered redevelopment history, carried its share of risks. But the sponsors felt in 1985, as they do now, that the city's central location and mass-transit links, with access to Manhattan, combined with the $100 million in research done annually by the universities would attract science-based companies to the park.
THOSE factors are what attracted the Public Health Research Institute, said Lewis M. Weinstein, president of the 56-year-old biomedical research group. It will relocate from the 60,000 square feet it has occupied for 30 years on First Avenue, at East 26th Street, in Manhattan to 80,000 square feet at the new building.
"We needed to grow," said Mr. Weinstein. "And the advantage of the Newark building is that it provides us with the space and the intellectual environment we need in a location close to New York."
The institute now employs 115 people, a number that is expected to grow to about 200 in the next five years, he said. Other factors, he added, were the potential for interaction between his group and the building's other tenants and the state's $60 million commitment to the science park.
The National Tuberculosis Center and the department of microbiology and molecular genetics, both of which also need to expand, will fill the remaining space in the building. They will occupy 33,600 and 48,000 square feet, respectively.
Under the terms of the financial agreement, the state will provide $18 million in grants and $42 million in loans, the latter raised through the sale of bonds. The state loans initially will be repaid through lease payments, which will be kept at or below the $30-a-square-foot market rate for new lab space, said Mr. Lower.
At the end of its 12-year lease, the Public Health Research Institute will purchase its space for $12 million. The other two tenants will rent for 30 years and then assume ownership of their space. Since his group will retain ownership of the land tenants will also pay a yet-to-be-determined ground-lease payment, Mr. Lower said.
Science- and technology-related companies are considered a growth engine for the state, whose large concentration of pharmaceutical firms conduct 85 percent of the industry's research, providing a strong resource for young companies. The state is home to some 500 biotechnology, biomedical and health-care-related firms as well as 6,000 software and information technology concerns, according to the New Jersey Technology Council, a Princeton-based nonprofit trade group.
In a statement, State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr. said that the International Center for Public Health would "enhance New Jersey's reputation for being a leader in the field of biomedical research."
"It not only provides an international research magnet," said Mr. Lower of University Heights Science Park Inc. "But it primes the pump and sets up a level playing field for us to compete head to head for our share of technology-based companies in the region."

HEADLINE: Report Projects Fuel Savings From More Efficient Vehicles

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The average New Jersey family could save more than $500 a year in gasoline costs if tighter fuel-efficiency standards were in place, according to a study by environmental groups.
Automakers countered that the report was flawed because the bigger vehicles that American drivers prefer would become prohibitively expensive under the standard advocated in the study. 
 The report, released on Thursday by the Environmental Working Group and the Surface Transportation Policy Project, based its savings estimates on standards of 45 miles a gallon for cars and 34 miles a gallon for light trucks like sport utilities, mini-vans and pickup trucks. Current standards average 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 20.7 miles a gallon for light trucks.
Congress annually sets the Government's fuel economy standard, known as the corporate average fuel economy.
The study said the higher mileage requirements would cut nearly half the amount of gases needed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels between the years 2008 and 2012 -- a goal that the Clinton Administration plans to take to next month's global warming summit in Japan.
Critics of the Administration effort say it will drive gasoline prices skyrocketing.
But the report said the average family in New Jersey would save $1,975 with more fuel-efficient vehicles over a 10-year period of phasing in the new standards. The national average was calculated at $2,160.
Once the standards were fully in place, the average annual savings in New Jersey would be $540 a family from current annual spending, which averages $1,039. Projected savings in New Jersey range from $460 a year in the Atlantic City area to $648 in the Trenton area.
"American automakers have fought virtually every Government-mandated improvement in automobile safety, fuel efficiency and pollution control proposed or adopted over the past 30 years," the report said. "In every case they were wrong. And in fact, Detroit automakers now brag about the benefits of safety, fuel efficiency and pollution control features that they once vehemently opposed."
Automakers say a larger car that gets 45 miles a gallon would be too expensive to make in today's market.
Some smaller cars do exceed 40 miles a gallon, but they account for fewer than 1 percent of vehicle sales.
"We would be at those levels if it was cost-effective and efficient to be there," said Mike Stanton of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, talking about larger cars that get better mileage. "There's no free lunch."
Car companies also say they must take into account the safety concerns of making lighter-weight vehicles that would get better mileage but fare worse in accidents.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
The High Cost of Education Means Fixing Schools, Too

BYLINE: By Abby Goodnough; Abby Goodnough reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Shortly after Jack Collins became Speaker of the Assembly last year, he proposed raising the cigarette tax to provide $6 billion for repairing dozens of old schools and building new ones. The Assembly went along with the plan, even though Republicans are reluctant to raise taxes of any kind these days. But the Senate rejected the proposal, and Governor Whitman offered only lukewarm support.
Now, as part of its response to the State Supreme Court's order to end the disparity between rich and poor school districts, the Whitman administration acknowledged last week that at least $1.8 billion was needed -- and soon -- to refurbish school buildings in the state's 28 poorest districts. 
 No sooner were legislators gasping over that news than Mrs. Whitman announced that the cost would actually be significantly higher. While the court has ordered the state to address the needs of urban districts, the Governor and Republican legislative leaders recognize the political impossibility of ignoring their suburban counterparts.
Education has long been an issue that decides the political fate of lawmakers who represent the suburbs, where tax-weary voters want top-notch schools but do not want to foot the entire bill for maintaining them. Last fall, when the Legislature was scrambling to pass a court-ordered school financing law that would equalize spending between the richest and poorest districts, suburban legislators went to great lengths to make sure the schools in their districts would not be shortchanged.
And the Governor, who was facing re-election, repeatedly assured suburban voters that in meeting the court order, she would not take money away from their schools.
Mrs. Whitman may not have to worry about running for governor again, but she said last week that education would be the primary focus of her second term. She said she wanted her legacy to be a better quality of education for all the state's 1.2 million schoolchildren. Both Mr. Collins and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco have long been committed to addressing the needs of all 600 districts. They have a particular interest in doing so because both are considering running for Governor in four years.
"As a state, we cannot limit our view to only 28 districts," Mrs. Whitman said on Tuesday, one day after the Department of Education released its report on construction needs in the poorest districts. "As Governor, I have to be concerned about the infrastructure needs of every school, not just the special-needs districts." If Mrs. Whitman and the Senate had gone along with Mr. Collins's proposal last year, they might have avoided this problem.
Mr. Collins's plan would have provided $2 billion for urban schools, with the remaining $4 billion targeted to school districts across the state.
Now, thanks to the court order, they have no choice but to come up with another plan. The first sign that Mrs. Whitman was eager to do so came last month, when she ordered the Education Department to conduct a study assessing the needs of every district. And last week, with the department's report and another, from the Public Affairs Research Institute, hot off the press, legislators turned their attention to the problem once again.
With cost estimates for school construction needs statewide ranging from $3 billion to $16.4 billion, taxpayers are facing what could be one of the largest capital investments in the state's history. Where will the money come from?
Mrs. Whitman said last week that the state would seriously have to consider issuing bonds to pay for school construction, a move that would provide a large amount of money but sharply increase the state's debt. Senator Robert J. Martin, a Republican who is to become chairman of the Senate Education Committee in January, said bonds were the surest source of revenue, especially if the construction is to be completed in 10 years or less.
"It always becomes problematic when you tie up revenue and make decisions for future generations of taxpayers," he said. "But with education, it's not a problem that's going to go away."
Senator Robert Littell, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he opposed using bonds to pay for school construction because it would increase the state's debt too drastically. He said he would rather depend on the annual growth in state revenues to pay for school construction from year to year, a questionable solution, given that the state's economy is always in flux.
As for Mr. Collins, he said he would once again consider raising the cigarette tax to help pay for school construction. But both Mr. Littell and Mr. Martin said that proposal was still unpalatable. Mr. Martin said he did not think it was appropriate to build schools with revenue from cigarette sales because there was no link between smoking and education. He said it would be wiser to use such revenue for a health-related program, like charity care in the state's hospitals.
Mr. Collins begged to differ.
"The link is that it's money," he said.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Over There, Monetary Union. Over Here, an Opportunity.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN HAKIM; Jonathan Hakim is a managing director of Lehman Brothers.

 BODY:
WITH less than 14 months to go before European monetary union, much of the American business and investment community has still not awakened to the big changes and opportunities it will create.
A single currency will bring with it a fundamental reshaping of Europe's financial markets. The markets themselves will become much bigger. To keep deficits under control -- a continuing requirement of monetary union -- governments will be obliged to cut social spending, thus opening the door for private pension funds. This will lead to a substantial new class of equity investors. In turn, these investors will bolster European stock markets, which, apart from Britain's, remain less than half the size of the United States' market in relation to their economies. 
 The new unified market for government bonds will rival the United States Treasury market, both in size and liquidity. The euro will become the world's second reserve currency, behind the dollar. And European investors will be obliged to shift away from their traditional focus on currencies and look instead at credit risk -- leading to the growth of a European junk bond market.
Over all, the new single market will look much more like the United States market, complete with a powerful central bank whose every move will be scrutinized for its impact on world interest rates.
The coming events provide an enormous opportunity for American banks and fund managers to capitalize on their strength and experience. The Americans, after all, have the advantages of a fiercely competitive and professional fund-management industry, the most sophisticated trading expertise and a long familiarity with assessing credit risk in bond markets.
The opportunity in Europe is especially timely because monetary union will create its own difficulties for European banks. Europe is "overbanked" -- bloated retail branch networks mean that their costs are high and profitability low. Many banks are still state-owned. Despite rigid employment laws, which make layoffs expensive, a wave of American-style mergers is under way. Only last week, the third-largest banks in the Netherlands and Belgium agreed to combine to form Europe's 12th-biggest bank. Similar consolidation is occurring in insurance and other financial services.
While the big American investment banks are strengthening their operations, many people in the investment community still doubt that monetary union will occur on time -- or that it will prove very durable. But Europe's leaders have invested too much political capital to contemplate failure. Moreover, the French and German economies are beginning to pick up steam. Exports are growing strongly. (The mark has quietly fallen by more than 10 percent against the dollar in the last 12 months.) As growth resumes, deficits will drop, unemployment will start falling next year and the transition to the new currency will be far less painful than now seems possible.
The single currency will bring a new market for European pension plans and the expertise to manage them; the big customers will initially be large corporations. Monetary union will also open up retail financial products like mutual funds, insurance and credit cards. Until now, currency barriers have enabled local operators to maintain cozy cartels. The new market will offer economies of scale and the potential for high-volume, low-cost direct selling.
Europe's retail investors, accustomed to a steady diet of bond funds and simple savings accounts, remain conservative and relatively unsophisticated. The equity culture will eventually take hold, but it will require patience and local marketing partners to overcome popular prejudice on the Continent against British- and American-style financial products. An avalanche of junk mail is unlikely to yield results.
A FEW American companies -- retail brokers and investment managers -- are already betting on this vision of the future. And the local European knowledge that they acquire will also serve them well back home. As Europe's capital markets unify, the new-found liquidity and transparency will make them much more accessible to American investors. The rise in European stock markets this year (in terms of local currencies) has been significant. Even after the recent selloff, the German market is up 37 percent; the Dutch market, 39 percent, and even the beleaguered French market, 23.5 percent.
With a big single market, a wave of corporate consolidation and the start of an economic upswing, the potential for continuing gains in Europe will be hard to ignore.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Lexus GS 300 and GS 400;
Now What the Devil Has Gotten Into Lexus?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
A COUPLE of years ago, over dinner with Jim Press, the general manager of Lexus, the conversation turned to passion -- the kind stirred up by a handful of high-performance luxury cars.
While complimenting Mr. Press on the quality and technology of his products, I pointed out that they arouse little passion, a sentiment I share with many people who test-drive new cars. While Lexus models are fine machines, I said, they seem cold -- bordering on sterile -- and lack the soul of the German cars on which they are modeled. 
 With a knowing smile, Mr. Press politely nodded, indicating that he understood my point. He knew something I did not: My criticisms were being addressed. The 1998 GS 300 and GS 400 were in the works.
Indeed, the two new GS models represent a radical departure from any past Lexus. Every bit as luxurious and comfortable as the flagship LS 400, the GS models are also packed with the power and spirit to go head-to-head with the E-Class Mercedes and, even more directly, the BMW 5-Series. More than simply competitive, the GS 400 outperforms its rivals on virtually every count.
To herald this new breed, which began arriving in dealerships in October, Lexus is running a mischievous advertising campaign that draws on the Gothic imagery and Elizabethan syntax of Shakespeare. The GS models stir up a tempest wherever they go, whether on a gentle tree-lined road or an otherwise calm lake. Using as its theme the line "Something wicked this way comes," from "Macbeth," the ads are aimed at an intellectual baby-boom crowd whose youthful vocabulary used "wicked" to mean awesomely good.
After spending nearly two weeks driving both GS models, I have to agree that they are ba-a-a-d -- in the good sense, that is.
The GS 300 replaces an easily overlooked model of the same name. That car sold poorly because of its tepid performance, lack of personality and hefty sticker price.
The new GS 300 goes directly against the six-cylinder BMW 528i and Mercedes E320; the GS 400 faces off with the V8-powered BMW 540i and the Mercedes E430, which will replace the E420 next year. Both GS models are priced between the entry-luxury ES 300 and top-of-the-line LS 400. But the GS models are aimed at an altogether different buyer than the people who have driven Lexuses until now.
The buyers are likely to be younger than LS 400 owners. They wear Armani instead of Brooks Brothers, one Lexus executive said.
Lexus seems to be hitting its mark. In the new models' first month on the market, 3,500 have been sold, putting them well on the way to meeting an annual sales target of 25,000.
The GS 300 and GS 400 sit on an all-new, rear-drive Lexus platform. Only the battery, the basic front suspension components and the engine crankshaft are carried over from the previous GS 300, Lexus says. The general proportions and profile, however, are similar to that of the previous car but are bolder and more aggressive. Six inches shorter than the car they replace, the GS 300 and GS 400 have virtually no front and rear overhangs, which give them a compact, ground-hugging, muscular look. In fact, the GS models have the same general proportions and stance as the BMW 5-Series.
Still, I was surprised by how much attention the test car, a royal blue GS 400, attracted. On a sunny Saturday afternoon in the ritzy Detroit suburb of Birmingham, Mich., a car full of young men in their early 20's honked and hooted in approval as I wheeled into a parking spot. Earlier that day, my GS 400 had caught the eye of a 30-something man, who quickly pulled a U-turn in his Lexus SC 300 coupe to follow me into my friend's driveway for a closer look.
Inside, the new GS has more space than the car it replaces, including additional headroom and legroom. The five-passenger sedan is swathed in creamy leather and trimmed in real walnut, as one would expect in a Lexus. All of the luscious luxuries are there, too: comfortable 10-way power front bucket seats, dual climate controls, express up-and-down windows, an outstanding sound system, an integrated electronic opener for garage doors and security gates, and an automatic hydrocarbon air pollution sensor that switches the air to re-circulate when certain levels of outside air contamination are detected. A satellite navigation system is optional and features touch-screen controls for navigation as well as for adjustments to the climate and audio systems.
The location and feel of the controls were first rate. My favorite feature was the optional CD changer in the glove box. It eliminated the bother of loading a trunk-mounted changer before starting a trip, yet left plenty of storage space in the glove box.
The instrument panel is innovative and functional, with the gauges housed in three circular indentations. The gauge markings and needles are backlit for a three-dimensional quality. Unusually bright and constantly illuminated, the gauges are easy to see in any kind of light, automatically dimming when you drive through a tunnel or parking deck.
The GS models feature dual air bags that deploy with less force than their predecessors to help prevent air-bag injuries, particularly to small women who sit close to the steering wheel. Side-impact air bags are integrated into the front seats.
The trunk, at 14.8 cubic feet, is generous, larger than that of the previous GS 300 or the current BMW 5-Series.
The GS models, particularly the GS 400, differ most from other Lexuses in the way they perform. While sitting at the wheel, you get an overwhelming sense that you are in a Mercedes, and once on the move, the Lexus shows the responsiveness of a BMW. Only the Lexus actually performs better, according to the numbers.
No matter which enthusiast magazine has conducted the testing -- Car and Driver, Road & Track or Motor Trend -- the numbers show the GS 400 outperforming the 5-Series and the E420 in virtually every category. It races from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in about 6 seconds. As for braking, the GS's world-class stopping distance is shorter than that of a Ferrari F355, Motor Trend notes.
And the GS 400 certainly feels quick and agile. The car is powered by a new generation of Lexus's 4-liter, 32-valve V8, rated at a whopping 300 horsepower and 310 foot-pounds of torque. It is the first V8 to be equipped with continuously variable valve timing, a system that controls combustion so that the car has both a strong takeoff from a standing start as well as solid power in passing-lane maneuvers at highway speeds. Yet the overall fuel economy of about 24 miles per gallon is respectable for a car of this substance.
While BMW still offers a manual transmission on the 5-Series, the GS 300 and 400 do not. Lexus figures that too few buyers would choose one. Instead of a manual, the GS 400 offers a clutchless five-speed automatic that can be shifted manually. The setup is similar to that of Formula One race cars and Porsche's Tiptronic. The console-mounted shifter has the normal park, reverse, neutral and drive positions. A second gate, marked "M" for manual, allows the driver to shift by pushing buttons on the spokes of the steering wheel. The button to downshift is on the front of the spoke; the button to upshift is on the back. I fooled with it for a while, but found the car shifted before I would have anyway, so I simply left the shifter in "D."
Though not nearly as brawny as the GS 400, the GS 300 also performs with spirit. It is powered by a 3-liter twin-cam engine that produces 225 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque. It, too, has continuously variable valve timing and gets an overall economy rating of about 25 m.p.h.
Both GS models have standard anti-lock brakes and traction control. Tied into both systems is vehicle skid control, similar to Mercedes' ESP and Cadillac's Stabilitrak. The system senses whether the vehicle is behaving as the driver wishes. If it is not, the system transparently employs the anti-lock brakes and traction control to help avoid skids and spins in quick lane changes or emergency situations.
At the wheel of both GS models, I had the sense that these cars were firmly planted on all fours, in keeping with their ground-hugging look. Both had plenty of grip in hard cornering, yet maintained Lexus's signature smooth ride.
A GS buyer can expect a nearly bulletproof car. Lexus models are recognized year after year for outstanding quality and long-term durability in surveys conducted by J. D. Power & Associates.
In addition to the improvements and the new-found personality, the GS 300 costs nearly $9,000 less than the car it replaces. starting at $37,395 including delivery. The GS 400 starts at $45,295. Options on both cars are few: a power moonroof, CD changer, upgraded tires and the $2,300 navigation system.
Never before have I had so much fun in a Lexus. While I haven't driven the 1998 Mercedes-Benz E430 due out next year, I'd easily select the Lexus GS 400 over the previous Mercedes E420 for performance and personal comfort. Would I pick it over the BMW 5-Series? That's a tougher choice. The 5-Series has a rich sporting heritage that Lexus lacks. Still, the GS combines outstanding sports-car performance with luxury sedan comfort and practicality at a competitive price. It is a wicked combination indeed.
 
INSIDE TRACK: A Lexus as you like it.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The GS 400 lights a fire in Lexus's coldly competent line. The sport sedan feels like a Mercedes and outperforms the BMW 5-Series. Inside, the GS 400 has illuminated, backlit gauges and an optional navigation system. Six-cylinder GS 300 lacks a rear spoiler.

"OH my goodness, lucky me!" Judith Re exclaimed. "Everyone is coming!" The 15 children before her stared.
"Can you learn and have fun at the same time?" she chirped. The boys shifted in their chairs, looking miserable. 
 Welcome to of "A Day of Social Savvy With Judith Re" at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. For the next 11 hours these children, ages 8 to 12, would learn everything from table manners to flower arranging to the art of small talk, led by Miss Judith, as she prefers to be called. As her charges eyed each other and sipped their cocoa, she watched them.
"I can see now who's a leader, who needs assistance," she said in an aside, dropping the chirp while three girls played once-twice-three-shoot at the end of the table.
"There's a method to this," she continued. "It's like going on a blind date with 15 people."
The cost for the complete day is $245, though some children come courtesy of grandparents or aunts if their own parents can't afford it. The program is now in its 10th year, and Miss Judith said, "No one even bats an eye at the cost -- it's a proven product."
In fact, she adds, the current demand for her services is so great that she would need to clone herself to meet it. The reason may be the booming economy when people have time and money for the niceties, she said, or perhaps it's that so many children are growing up in homes where both parents work and neither can supervise mealtimes.
But when these parents want to travel with their children or present them to long-distance grandparents during the holidays, they want them -- somehow -- to know how to do the right thing.
Though Miss Judith used to conduct the program nationally, she now has children of her own and spends the majority of her time teaching socially challenged corporate executives, both American and Japanese. Her book, "Social Savvy" (Fireside, $11), is in its seventh printing.
As the children finished their cocoa, Miss Judith walked behind their chairs. With her black bangs and lacquered flip, she looks a little French, a little proper, but not quite forbidding. Even though she addresses the group as "ladies and gentlemen," she makes liberal use of "honey' and sweetheart" as well.
Though this Saturday's participants were mostly from the Boston area, Jessica Johnson, 11, and her sister, Diana, 8, came from Eagle Springs, N.C., where they are schooled at home.
Erin McGaffigan, 8, of Groton, Mass., was there with her cousins Megan and Shauna Twohig of Stoneham, Mass. "Our grandmother is into tea," Erin explained. "She thought if we came here, we'd have better manners."
Miss Judith called for attention. "Ladies and gentlemen," she began. "Today we will be learning about social savvy, which means respect, responsibility, sensitivity and compromise. It's about treating other people as you want to be treated yourself. I believe children should be seen and heard. Today is about being heard."
Everyone listened closely. "First, we will be taking a tour of the hotel," she said. "Ladies first, then gentlemen." As she led them out, the boys dutifully hung back. The girls were thrilled, each reveling in the chance to be Eloise for a day.
The tour continued through the dining room, lobby, boardroom and ballroom. Then it was time for flower arranging. Gathered around a long table strewn with flowers, each child was given a bubble bowl. The girls worked quickly and intently, cutting the stems to fit the bowl. The boys' stems were all longer, especially Dan Adair's. "It's not stable," he warned as Miss Judith picked it up.
"It's an architectural delight," she said cheerfully.
"It's an architectural dilemma," Dan, 12, retorted.
Miss Judith smiled gamely. "I think it's a high-maintenance floral arrangement," she said, setting it down.
Sam Barcelo, 11, moved toward it for a closer look. "Touch it and die," Dan said.
Once everyone's bouquet was applauded by the group, it was time to set the table for lunch, complete with fish forks and knives. Then the class folded the napkins like accordions before putting them in water glasses and fanning out the pleats. Except for Dan, who used his as a blindfold.
"I am going to be your hostess today," Miss Judith said. Across the table, Max Rausch, 11, leaned his head on his hand, elbow on the table. She shot him a look. The elbow came off. "When your host or hostess places their napkin on their lap, everyone follows," she said. They did.
The waiters served the appetizer, shrimp cocktail, ladies first. Small fingers poked suspiciously at the tails. "Please don't touch your food, folks, thank you," Miss Judith said.
The children picked up their forks, Neanderthal style, in clenched fists. "Your index finger is your power finger," Miss Judith said. "You place it at the stem of the fork." They complied. "How many mouths do you have?" she asked.
"One," they answered.
She nodded. "You cut one piece at a time. Think of your plate as a clock. Once you cut, you place the tip of the knife at 12 o'clock, the handle at 3. And bring the food all the way to your mouth. In this culture, we don't lean over the plate, going to it."
Suddenly the room looked less like a school cafeteria and more like a restaurant. "Freeze! freeze!" Miss Judith called out. Two or three hapless souls had reverted to cave manners, forks in fists. A quick review of the power finger was in order, followed by a discussion of turning one's head away from the table to cough and sneeze. This led to a round of coughing.
The main course was chicken breast, tortellini and vegetables. The tortellini, which required only a fork, disappeared first.
Someone soon dropped a fork on the floor and was instructed to leave it there and ask the waiter for another. "Are you supposed to hop up and get a fork from another table?" Miss Judith asked.
"Yes!" came the reply.
"No!" she said, exasperated. "This is fine dining, folks."
Erin mumbled under her breath, "Sometimes my dad tells me to."
Miss Judith then instructed the children on the final signal -- placing the fork and the knife together at 4 o'clock on the plate to show the waiter they were finished.
Paul Chamandy-Cook, 9, from Montreal, who was there with his cousin Emily Forse, 9, of Brookline, Mass., raised his hand. "We didn't talk about burping," he said.
Miss Judith raised her eyebrows. "Didn't we?" she said. "Well, if you burp, just say, 'Excuse me,' and don't draw any more attention to yourself."
Before a round of burps could begin, Henri Boubee, the Ritz-Carlton's general manager, stopped in to offer a treat: a surprise visit to the hotel's Presidential Suite, which includes a living room, dining room and superior view of the city. The children swarmed into the bathroom.
"There's a phone in here!" someone called out excitedly.
Finally, the class was ready for the pastry workshop, where they would make the pastries they would eat during afternoon tea, which followed. Tea was also time to learn the art of small talk.
"Would you use politics for small talk?" Miss Judith asked. "No," they chorused. "The movie you last saw or music you like?" "Yes," they agreed.
"It's like a volleyball game or a tennis game," Miss Judith said. "If you're asked a question and just say yes or no, does the ball drop? It sure does."
She paired up the students. Monica Niedermeyer, 9, asked Diana Johnson, "Who's your favorite band?"
"I don't have one," Diana said.
Monica stared. "Now you have to," she prompted, but to no avail. Silence.
She tried again. "Who's your favorite singer?"
"Garth Brooks," Diana said while Monica waited. Silence. "Who's your second favorite?" Monica asked. Diana shrugged. "I don't know."
Across the table, Max asked Shauna, "How do you feel about being here?"
Before she could answer, the girl on Max's other side whipped her head around. "Are you copying me?" she demanded.
Monica sighed out loud. "This is hard," she lamented.
After tea came social correspondence, or as Miss Judith put it, "Writing thank-you notes for gifts you don't like without lying."
"Let's say you got a green sweater from your neighbor," she said. "Now, if you didn't like it, what would you say?"
Diana raised her hand. " 'I'm not wild about it'?" she offered. Miss Judith looked distressed.
"Uh, no, dear," she said. "There is not a golden rule that says anyone has to give you a gift. It is a choice. It would hurt someone's feelings to say that the gift wasn't so good."
Dan volunteered, "You can say it fits perfectly and then small talk in a letter." Miss Judith nodded, and everyone wrote a thank-you note.
A lesson followed in proper introductions, meaning a firm handshake, making eye contact and smiling. When Miss Judith properly introduced herself to Dan and asked him a question, he answered by saying, "Yeah."
"Yeah?" she repeated. "What are we, Swedish? It's yes, yes, yes. Humor me please, everyone. Repeat after me."
"Yes, yes, yes," they all said.
"Music to my ears," she murmured.
After the introductions and a visit to the health club to exercise, the children repaired to the restrooms to change for dinner in the Ritz-Carlton Dining Room. Everyone looked spectacular. The boys were in jackets and ties, the girls in satin and velvet.
They all sat up straight in their chairs, almost instinctively. "Good evening," the waiter said. "Would you like a cocktail before your dinner?" They ordered Shirley Temples and Roy Rogerses. A piano played in the background, and other diners came in, looking approvingly at the well-behaved group.
The first course was soup. Before entering the dining room, everyone had been instructed to move the spoon from 6 o'clock toward 12. They did so carefully, with great concentration.
Next came Caesar salad, prepared tableside. Miss Judith kept the conversation moving, asking the children about their interests. Emily Forse said, "I enjoy reading," and started to describe her favorite book. Her companions listened, and suddenly, a real conversation began. It seemed as if the low lights, the clink of glasses, the women's perfume floating by from other tables all inspired them. Bread was buttered over the bread plates, heads were turned to cough, without anyone's even asking. These children seemed to be having a marvelous time.
Following the main course, some of the ladies went to the restroom, and when they returned, some of the gentlemen stood, unbidden, and pulled out their chairs. All of them blushed.
The dinnertime glow lasted into the elevator as they went upstairs for ice cream sundae-making and social dancing. But as they neared the room and learned that social dancing meant slow dancing, they started to nervously gauge each other's height. The glow disappeared. They were kids again.
Emily sat at a table with Diana, while her cousin Paul hesitated, looking where the other boys were sitting.
"Sit here, Paul," Emily said, but Paul stayed standing, undecided.
"Sit or I torture you," she hissed.
He sat.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Looking For Cheap Stocks? Try Japan

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Japan's policy toward one of its most important economic issues is reminiscent of the old saw about New England's weather: If you don't like it, wait five minutes and it will change.
As a result, last week saw a series of wild swings in Japanese stock prices as the Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, first indicated he would favor doing something to bail out sick banks, then reversed and reversed again. If this goes on much longer, someone will begin to suspect that the governing Liberal Democratic party is raising campaign funds by playing the stock index futures market just before Mr. Hashimoto changes his policies. 
 It would be nice if the Government ended up doing what is needed: letting the sickest banks fail, with the Government eating the loss for at least some depositors, and allowing the banks that can survive to do so without being forced to take the risk of bailing out their dying brethren. But that is not the most important question for investors.
Nor are all the other things that scare people now. Japan is suffering from the weakness of its Asian neighbors. Its Government made a big mistake in tightening fiscal policy. Absurdly low interest rates have led to excessive capital investment. More financial firms will go bankrupt. None of those are good things for Japan's economy.
But the question faced by an investor deciding whether to put money into the American stock market or the Japanese one is not which country has a brighter outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. The United States wins hands down on those issues. It is the extent to which share prices reflect those outlooks. In this country, share prices reflect a very rosy outlook. But in Japan, stock prices are generally below where they were in 1986, and some companies, particularly smaller ones that cater to domestic customers, seem to be trading as if disaster is imminent. "If they manage to avoid a depression, there is opportunity in Japan," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
"Almost half the companies in Japan are trading below book value," added David Briggs, the research manager for Peter Cundill & Associates, a Canadian mutual fund manager that has bought a lot of Japanese stocks this year. Nearly a quarter of them, he figures, are trading below liquidation value. He points to stocks like Mitsui Marine and Fire, trading for little more than the value of stocks it owns in other companies -- and at 13 times earnings under American accounting rules -- and to the Fuji Electric Company, a profitable company that trades for less than the value of its stake in Fujitsu.
Some managers with a bent for value -- the growth and momentum players long ago abandoned Japan -- are still dubious, wondering what will unlock the stocks' intrinsic worth. But there are signs of progress. Some companies now hand out stock options to executives and some are buying their own shares, tactics that are new there. Mr. Briggs predicts that Japanese shareholders are going to get more aggressive in forcing managements to act in investors' interest.
He knows his views are unusual. "There is a lot of pessimism," Mr. Briggs said. "Everybody you talk to in Japan, or among global money managers, is worried. Nobody wants to buy Japan."
Yet fear produces opportunities. Even with gyrations, the Nikkei 225 went up 11 percent last week, and there are still plenty of bargains. For long-term investors, Japan looks good.

HEADLINE: Democratic Values;
Clinton's Way Isn't His Party's

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WILL Clintonism outlive Bill Clinton?
In fits and starts across his Presidency, with a lurch to the left and a tack to the right, Mr. Clinton has tried to fashion what he once described as a "different kind of Democrat." This was a Democrat who would heed middle-class concerns about crime and welfare and family values. A fiscally responsible Democrat. A Democrat who would embrace the information age and the new global marketplace as engines of economic growth. 
 But in his fifth year in office, despite national prosperity, Mr. Clinton is still having trouble persuading his fellow Democrats to follow his mantra. "Now we can't turn back," he implored recently. "And our party can't turn back. We need a new economy for the 21st century, a Democratic Party for the 21st century to lead the way."
When most House Democrats answered by bucking him on "fast track" trade legislation, they were delivering a warning: Mr. Clinton's party is already looking beyond him. And that party is facing deepening divisions over whom Democrats should represent and what their philosophy should be.
The split isn't precisely the liberal-moderate divide of old, for the debate does not extend to social issues. The Democrats gathering around House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt accept Mr. Clinton's focus on family values, but want to represent those left behind in the new economy. Allied with organized labor, they want another minimum-wage increase, expanded health care coverage, and a trade policy that does more to protect American workers from competitors in developing nations.
Vice President Al Gore, Clintonism's standard-bearer, in a clear shot at Mr. Gephardt, derided the "huffing and puffing of out of shape and out of date dogmas trying to keep up with the dynamism of the new economy." But in some ways these Democrats sound like Mr. Clinton in 1992 -- before his economic stimulus package died, before his national health care plan perished.
Some of the Democrat ferment is positioning for the 2000 election. But much of it is driven by a paradox of the Clinton era: as he has prospered, so have Republicans.
 
Losing Control
 Yes, Mr. Clinton brought Democrats out of a 12-year drought to win the White House. Yes, he was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win re-election. Yes, most Democrats agree, he helped the party shed an image dating from its 1968 convention and the Vietnam war years that it had lost touch with mainstream America.
But Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress in 1994. Even riding Mr. Clinton's coattails in 1996, Democrats could not regain either chamber. Now only the House is considered even contestable in 1998.
At lower levels of government, Democrats had 31 governorships in 1993. Now they have 17. The election day just past was another black Tuesday for them.. And with the party buffeted by controversy over Mr. Clinton fund-raising in 1996, the Democratic National Committee is $15 million in debt.
Just as troubling to House Democrats was a recent briefing by Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. He told them that national polling data shows the Democrats' traditional advantage with voters on issues like education, Medicare, and the environment is narrowing, while Republicans are starting to lose their image as the party of the rich.
The blurring of party images is a logical outgrowth of Mr. Clinton's cooperation this year with the Republican Congress. "The problem is that these bipartisan deals have blocked the Democrats in Congress, and other Democrats, from being heard," said Stanley B. Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's 1992 pollster. "It's that all the Democratic angles are smoothed out and ruled out and Democrats are left with no defining purpose, which electorally weakens them."
With an eye to next year's fight for control of the House, Democrats want to re-emphasize differences between the parties. This doesn't mean they reject all that Mr. Clinton has taught them -- most Democrats this year voted for the balanced budget. And Congressional leaders are working with the White House to assemble a "families first" agenda for 1998 that will emphasize health care, education and family issues.
But many Democrats are restless for something bolder and more muscular than Clinton policies like voluntary national education testing. And it is over the economy -- Mr. Clinton's proudest achievement -- where the left-middle divide is reopening.
Mr. Clinton has tried to tilt his party toward upscale suburban independents and an embrace of the global economy. For those displaced by the changing economy, he prescribes education and training. Mr. Gephardt and his wing look toward those who have been left behind and a more interventionist economic policy.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gephardt can sound like they are speaking of different countries. Mr. Clinton boasts that "America is stronger than it has been in a long time -- our economy the healthiest in the world."
Mr. Gephardt, assessing what has hurt Democrats in recent years, says, "The average American is working much harder and longer and not making enough money. The standard of living is down so people quite naturally are very upset about their own economic situation and about taxes. And the Republican message ---- to the extent there is one -- is about taxes. So I think we have to be addressing those issues."
 
Wooing the Working Class
 Some of the most fervent opponents of Mr. Clinton's bid for authority to negotiate free-trade deals believe that their call for a trade policy that emphasizes labor and economic conditions will help them win Republican working-class support. "You're not going to see a complete realignment," said Representative Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. "But more Republicans -- not country club Republicans, but Main Street Republicans -- will be voting for Democratic candidates."
Moderate suburban Democrats fear that this kind of thinking guarantees the party permanent minority status. "If the legislative branch of the party ever hopes to gain a majority, it has got to go in the direction that Clinton has led us instead of the direction that labor and the Democratic caucus is pulling us," said Representative James P. Moran, a Virginia Democrat.
For now, Congressional Democrats have enormous incentives to heal their breach with Mr. Clinton. His ratings are high. They need him to use the singular pulpit of the Presidency to plead their case next year and to help them raise campaign money.
But whether they think they need Clintonism is another question. The battle to define the post-Clinton party has begun.

Big, Beautiful Numbers: 820, 834, 960

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
NANCY RICHARDSON, a longtime Fifth Avenue resident, calls it a "juste milieu." That, she says, is "a silly French phrase" that means finding the right tone or happy medium for her way of life.
To some, a happy medium can be found at 960, 834, 820, 740 and 720. For some, these are meaningless numbers; for others, they constitute a code -- what Tiffany stationers call "beautiful addresses." They are the addresses of Fifth and Park Avenue apartment houses -- A-plus buildings -- that signify that you are wealthy and social, that you have made it to the pinnacle of what many consider world society. 
 To live at one of these addresses is "a privilege and congenial way of life," said Ms. Richardson, who was recently divorced from the financier Frank Richardson.
What exactly is an A-plus building? And what happens in them at the height of a real estate boom, when the stock market has multiplied people's wealth enormously? A new genre of apartment-seeker bidding into "the teen millions" (as real estate brokers put it) for homes like Ms. Richardson's is desperately trying to get behind the velvet rope. But supply and demand is making it very difficult.
"It's the same amount of product," said Louise Beit, a vice president at Stribling & Associates. "But there are more customers than ever. More than even the height of the 80's." Standing in apartment at 820 Fifth Avenue, surrounded by paintings of French landscapes, she said that about one or two apartments come available each year.
The facts of life are these: Even when apartments do come up, sellers first turn to their own friends (they are rarely advertised). Co-op boards are feeling more powerful than ever, rejecting people with $60 million to $100 million in assets. It takes the veto of only one person you've crossed. (The chairman of Revlon, Ron Perelman, did not make it into 820 Fifth Avenue.)
A list of A-plus buildings circulates among what the primary gatekeepers -- so-called social brokers -- who size up clients before showing an apartment. "I call their bank officer," said Hall Willkie of Brown Harris Stevens, a real estate firm. "That is, of course, if they have a bank officer."
What are the criteria for getting into an A-plus building? Payment in full in cash; impeccable social credentials (private clubs, schools and the location of your summer home counts); substantial philanthropic contributions (tithing scores well) and having $60 million to $500 million in assets, a substantial portion liquid.
Rest easy. Buildings on the East River require a bit less. (There are ways, with a bank's help, to arrange your finances so that co-op boards do not know the source of your cash.)
What goes into the rating of an A-plus building? First, location: all of the Upper East Side, especially Fifth and Park Avenues between 60th and 79th Streets, and the East River. West Side apartments do not make the list, although devotees of the Dakota, Beresford and San Remo consider those buildings A-plus.
Then there is the "quality" of tenants like Lawrence Rockefeller, Ann Bass and Cynthia Phipps. And, finally, there's the architecture: the magic name is Rosario Candela, a 1920's architect known for grand flowing apartment layouts.
Most A-plus apartments have 8 to 20 rooms and features like wine cellars, walk-in vaults, linen rooms the size of studio apartments and extensive servants' quarters.
There is a certain irony at play. In the early 1900's, when some of these buildings were built, they were closed to anyone who was not born or did not marry into the right families. But economic ups and downs opened the doors. Now some of the very people who bought floor-through Park Avenue apartments for perhaps $80,000 in the early 1970's are trying to close the doors, even tighter than before.
Why? Exclusivity sells. "Buildings are making a conscious choice to become more unreasonable so they will appear more exclusive," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates and a co-chairman of the board of the residential division at the Real Estate Board of New York. "It's really infuriating."
But it is working. But this time tenacious buyers, with enough financing, are trying even harder than their predecessors to climb in. "I tell people they are not going to make it past the co-op board, but they want to try anyway," said Sharon E. Baum, director of the exclusive property division at the Corcoran Group, sitting in her Rolls-Royce on her way to show an apartment at 19 East 72d Street. "Before, people were embarrassed if they didn't pass. Now when they get turned down, they want to try again." She has had two board decisions reversed.
There are people who do not want to live on Park and Fifth Avenues because they find the screaming status of the address like wearing a label on the outside of a dress. They prefer to live in what are considered more discreet social buildings, like 1 Beekman Place, 1 Sutton Place South or even 19 East 72d Street (the building famous for turning down Richard Nixon, though it is rated A-minus because it is on a side street).
"It's a great way of life: You go home and never feel like you're in New York -- just the wind off the river," said Juliet Hartford, 27, the daughter of Huntington Hartford, the A.& P. heir, who lived at 1 Beekman Place for 35 years, later selling the duplex to Philip Niarchos, the son of the late Greek shipping magnate Stavros S. Niarchos. That high-luxe building has a swimming pool, gardens and private rooms at its base, all overlooking the East River, and apartments with servants' quarters the size of some Connecticut homes.
Deluxe apartments on Fifth Avenue were started in 1911, at 998 Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, according to Andrew Alpern, the author of "Luxury Apartment Houses of Manhattan" (Dover Publications, 1992). Builders, he said, "Touted the fact that it was more convenient to live in an apartment because you could very quickly close up shop and go off to your country place or Europe. When you came back, the service people in the building would get the apartment ready for you."
The builders and architects also billed apartments -- mansions stacked on top of each other -- as more practical, secure and even a more economical way to live than in separate homes.
When Ms. Richardson was looking for a place, she said, "I just wanted as nice things as we could afford put in a cozy setting, and this was the best value for the space." She added, "The market was nothing like it is now." And, she said, "While these buildings have this reputation of maybe being exclusive, it's really all about who would make a congenial neighbor and getting enough of space."
The great apartments are truly palatial, with sweeping entrance ways downstairs and upstairs, endless numbers of rooms and museum-quality design detail on the ceilings, windowsills and doorknobs. The Picassos and Renoirs on the walls do not hurt the ambiance. Still, even then some lives within those walls do not always find that juste milieu.

Walking into these apartments brings to mind stepping into a hotel particulier, or private mansion, in Paris. The building was constructed in 1916 as a 12-story version of an Italian Renaissance palazzo, and the rooms make you feel as if you're in a country estate.
 
CACHET: Each floor contains one 18-room apartment, 7,000 square feet, with four rooms overlooking Central Park. The elevator opens onto each floor. In one apartment visited recently, seven miniature dachshund puppies ran over the front rooms' herringbone floors, all overlooking Fifth Avenue.
The apartment opens onto a gallery, 12 feet by 43 feet (the size of many Manhattan studio apartments), which displays 19th-century French paintings. This gallery, or hallway, leads into what is called the reception rooms: the living room, sitting room, dining room and conservatory. And these open into each other along the line of windows, as in many Parisian homes. There are his-and-her bedrooms and his-and-her bathrooms.
 
REQUIREMENTS: A potential owner must have at least 10 times the net worth of the apartment, which can cost in the mid-teen millions. Maintenance is about $14,000 a month.
 
960 FIFTH AVENUE, at 77th Street
 
What's especially interesting about this building, besides the wealth of the residents (most are worth over $100 million), are the amenities. The staff includes an in-house chef, and there is maid service and laundry service (shirts are washed, ironed and brought to the back door within two hours).
 
"It's the premier building in Manhattan," said Louise Beit, a vice president at Stribling & Associates.
 
CACHET: Room size. Duplexes run 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. One even has a ballroom with a 16-foot ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows.
 
Behind the lobby is the Georgian Suite, formerly a private dining room, where all the residents dined together. The room can be rented out by residents for private parties, and once a month the chef prepares dinner for the tenants to dine together.
 
Tenants can order up picnic basket for the weekend or a casserole to tide them over (the chef doesn't work weekends).
 
COST PER APARTMENT: Around $15 million. About one apartment comes on the market every year. Maintenance runs about $8,000 to $10,000 a month; food is extra.
 
834 FIFTH AVENUE, at 64th Street
 
Several doormen in white gloves descend on the visitor who steps one inch inside this building, either to help with packages, check a coat in the cloakroom or see if you belong in the lobby (which looks dark and unassuming).
Past the gate, the apartments upstairs are huge. In one visited recently, Renoir paintings hung on the walls and a red-carpeted staircase looked as if Norma Desmond were going to sweep down at any moment.
 
CACHET: The size of the apartments in a building designed by Rosario Candela. A duplex can run 7,000 to 8,000 square feet: five bedrooms, five maids' rooms and a walk-in safe in the kitchen (for the silver). Some maids' rooms could be turned into bedrooms. ("Oh, no, you would never do that," said one broker.) Oh, well.
 
REQUIREMENTS: No financing. All cash. Required net worth: $50 million to $100 million. A duplex costs about $10 million, with a $12,000 monthly maintenance fee. "Look, anyone can afford the maintenance," said Sharon E. Baum, director of the exclusive-property division at Corcoran Group. "It's not about that."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Heavy Bets on a Few Stocks Pay Off

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN

 BODY:
ON a list of the 100 best-performing domestic stock funds of the last 12 months, those that buy the shares of small and midsize companies dominate. Only a handful that focus on large companies are scattered throughout this stratosphere. But flying highest among these, and eighth on the overall list, is a young fund that hails from an insurance company family and favors big, fast-growing businesses.
Transamerica Premier Equity, the largest of seven funds started since October 1995 by the Transamerica Corporation, has returned 52.9 percent for the 12 months through Thursday, well above the 31.3 percent gain of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the average 24.0 percent total return of its peers in the "large growth" category, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund research firm in Chicago. Since its inception on Oct. 2, 1995, it boasts an average total return of 33.9 percent a year through Thursday, compared with 28.9 percent for the S.& P. 500 and 23.2 percent for its peers. 
 Behind the numbers is an investment philosophy that runs counter to common wisdom: the fund concentrates holdings in a few stocks rather than broadly diversifying to reduce risk. "People invest in our fund because they want to outperform the market," said Glen E. Bickerstaff, portfolio manager of Premier Equity. "If we owned several hundred stocks, the fund would behave like an index."
Mr. Bickerstaff says he generally owns from 30 to 40 stocks, far fewer than the average of 125 for a large-cap fund.
The powerful moves by some stocks in his portfolio explain why Premier Equity has done so well this year, even as big companies in general were being outperformed by the smaller segment of the market in the third quarter. Dell Computer, its biggest holding, is up 223 percent this year through Thursday. Other big gainers include Pixar, up 78 percent; Charles Schwab, 86 percent, and Franklin Resources, 105 percent.
"Dell Computer -- that will do it right there," said Russel Kinnel, equity editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. "You don't need too many of those" to beat the averages, he added.
Yet Premier Equity, a $105 million no-load fund, is not the only achiever in the Transamerica family, which is spending about $1 million on advertising this year, up from $4,000 last year. Premier Balanced, with $25 million in assets, leads its group of funds that invest in both stocks and bonds with a total return of 34.8 percent this year through Thursday, according to Morningstar.
Their common fortune is not surprising, considering that the fund family shares research and a growth-oriented investment style, a foundation that has also helped its two newest funds. Since their start-ups in July, Premier Small Company has returned 28.8 percent through Thursday, compared with 13.4 percent for its small-growth group, and Premier Aggressive Growth is up 23.4 percent, versus 14.3 percent for its mid-cap growth peers.
In addition, all but these newest Transamerica funds are clones of pension accounts run by the insurance parent. That experience figures into the funds' success, said Mr. Kinnel of Morningstar. "An insurance company has a lot of money-management experience," he said. "They have huge portfolios of their own to invest. It's not like a new fund from Transamerica started off the same as a mom-and-pop fund."
Still, he and other fund and insurance analysts said there was no evidence that insurance companies like Transamerica enjoyed any edge over mutual fund companies in investing. "It's just the skills of the manager," said Arthur Fliegelman, a senior analyst at Moody's.
THAT seems to be the case for Premier Equity. As the bull market has gained ground, Mr. Bickerstaff's policy of placing large bets has paid off. But if big companies sputter again, the fund may find its approach tested.
"Concentration is more likely to take you to an extreme performance," Mr. Kinnel said. "You are more likely to end up in the top quartile or the bottom quartile."
Mr. Bickerstaff argues that his fund's performance is no fluke, pointing to the 25 percent compound annual return he has earned managing its twin pension account over the last decade through Sept. 30, versus 14.7 percent for the S.& P. 500.
"Our portfolio is protected by the fact that we own great businesses" that share several traits, he said, including fast growth rates, dynamic leadership and strong advantages over rivals. One such company is the fund's second-largest holding, Mirage Resorts. Mr. Bickerstaff said Mirage's management built superior properties in places like Las Vegas, Nev., insuring a steady stream of traffic. "Visitors to Las Vegas go by the Mirage just to see it," he said.
In assessing growth, the fund focuses on a company's excess cash flow. Mr. Bickerstaff's logic is that companies able to generate excess cash flow can finance growth by expanding product lines or making strategic acquisitions or it can return capital to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks or increased dividends.
But companies must also have an edge over rivals. In the technology stocks that make up the biggest portion of his fund -- 21.3 percent -- Mr. Bickerstaff likes Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Cisco Systems because each dominates an important niche in the computer market. Dell is a low-cost computer distributor; Intel is the industry's leading hardware supplier; Microsoft is its biggest software maker, and Cisco, he said, represents "the best way to participate" in the trend toward linking personal computers. Perhaps because technology is so heavily represented in the portfolio, the fund's average price-to-earnings ratio of 33 is 5 percent above that of the average growth fund.
In the final test of a stock, Mr. Bickerstaff meets with management to determine its ability to handle change. Once he makes an investment, he sticks with it unless its price rises above his most optimistic projections. On average, he holds stocks about four years. "One of the biggest mistakes investors make is to sell too soon," he said.
Although Premier Equity does not restrict its holdings to large companies -- the median market capitalization of its holdings is currently a midsize $4.5 billion -- Mr. Bickerstaff is unapologetic about his belief that bigger is better in today's economy. Big companies have the capital to invest in technology, which improves productivity, he said. They also have economies of scale, enabling them to bolster profits through cost cuts rather than price increases.
But, ultimately, size is only one factor. "The best way to get superior returns," Mr. Bickerstaff said, "is to own companies that consistently exceed your expectations."

Charts: "Trends in 401(k)'s: How Does Your Plan Compare?"
Overall employee participation in 401(k) plans has remained fairly steady at around 77 percent over the last five years, but new investment options have been emerging, more plans are offering loan options and plan participants increasingly find them-selves talking to electronic voices when they call for information. These are some of the findings by Buck Consultants, a human resources consulting firm based in New York, in its latest survey of 401(k) plans. The survey includes inform-ation on 668 organizations with 401(k) plans and is based on year-end 1996 data.
 
EQUITY FUNDS LEAD THE OPTIONS
While 97 percent of respondents offer stock funds or other equity investments in their 401(k)'s, a few employers provide options that throw the door wide open to employee choice. A mutual fund window offers participants access to a fund supermarket or a fund family; a self-directed brokerage account lets participants to buy securities or funds through the account. Both are being offered most often in the plans of professional practices, like law firms, whose participants may have more investment knowledge and more money to invest.
 
MOST COMPANIES MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS
Eighty-eight percent of the respondents make contributions to their 401(k) plans to match employee contributions. The rate varies by industry but the average company match is 60 cents per employee dollar.
 
Industry AND dollar contributed
Mining 82 cents
Communications 69
Insurance 66
Real estate 66
Utilities 66
Health care 64
Transportation 63 cents
Financial 61
Retail 58
Manufacturing 55
Wholesale 50
Other 49
 
HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS ARE PREVALENT
The vast majority of 401(k) plans allow participants to withdraw a portion of their account before retirement. Indeed, 93 percent of companies allow withdrawals for hardship reasons, but they differ on the reasons.
 
Hardship reason AND Companies permitting withdrawals
Medical expenses 98%

'HELLO. PLEASE PRESS 1 FOR YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE'
The number of plan sponsors using voice-response technology has grown each survey year.
 
MOST PLANS PROVIDE LOANS
Eighty-six percent of companies say their plans have a loan feature, but requirements vary.
 
* 76 percent of plans require the loan be at least $1,000; only 3 percent have no minimum.
* 53 percent allow only one loan to be taken out at a time.
* 66 percent charge a transaction fee for taking out a loan.

HEADLINE: Land Rich, but Cash Poor, in the West

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN

DATELINE: DUGOUT RANCH, Utah

 BODY:
HEIDI REDD is living out a cowgirl's dream in a Technicolor landscape.
She plays the part to the hilt, dressed in jeans and denim shirt, dirty leather chaps, boots and a cowboy hat pulled low over a tanned, weather-lined face. And at 55, she does the work, too: riding, roping, branding and herding. 
 Ms. Redd's Dugout Ranch is a perfect setting for a Western dream come true. The ranch embraces 5,167 acres of privately owned pastures and 250,000 acres of grassland that she leases from the Federal Government for cattle grazing. Ensconced among steep, red-rock cliffs on the edge of Canyonlands National Park in southern Utah, Dugout is about an hour's drive south from Moab, a boomtown bulging with tourists and second homes.
The ranch got its name from caves that the first settlers dug in the sandy banks of Indian Creek for shelter from the scorching summer sun and winter snow. A parade of people from around the world now drive past the ranch in rental cars and recreational vehicles on their way to Newspaper Rock and the Needles district of the park. And though the value of her property has skyrocketed, as the West's open spaces have lured yuppie emigres from the cities, Ms. Redd wants nothing more than to keep ranching here.
"I've always figured cowboys and cowgirls have the best jobs," she said, saddling a horse one day recently to round up cattle. "They probably have the lowest wages, but they don't have to wait till the weekend to enjoy life."
This free-spirited way of life almost ended for Ms. Redd in the wake of her bitter divorce from Robert Redd, her husband of 23 years, and the ensuing need to sell the ranch. That it did not end took a combination of true grit, sophisticated tax and estate planning and the donations of more than a thousand people from around the country who did not want to see Dugout -- and other places like it -- fall into the hands of developers.
The ranch, which has been a favored setting for movies and commercials, was the couple's only home together and their main asset. Over the years, it had soared in value as big-money buyers swarmed into the area, looking to turn places like Dugout into rustic private playgrounds or patches of sprawling condominiums.
The ranch's sale to outsiders seemed inevitable, too. Neither of the Redds had enough money to buy the other out, and they and their two sons needed to get on with their lives. The family was not only facing the loss of its homestead, but also a big chunk of the sale price, which would be eaten by capital gains taxes.
What kept Ms. Redd riding and roping was the creative intervention of the Nature Conservancy, one of a number of environmental groups around the country that works to protect private property as open space and nature preserves.
Often these groups buy land only to turn around and sell it to a Government agency for a park or wildlife refuge, thus getting money to make more deals.
But like Ms. Redd, the Nature Conservancy did not want to change Dugout. So the group is buying the property and making a commitment to maintain it in perpetuity as a working ranch, ecological preserve and a model for how cattle grazing and conservation -- at odds throughout the West -- can go hand in hand.
Last month, the nonprofit conservancy, based in Arlington, Va., closed on a complicated deal to buy the ranch for $4.6 million, raised from donations by individuals, foundations and corporations. The deal permits Ms. Redd to spend the rest of her life at Dugout. Public visits will be limited to researchers and tours arranged by the Nature Conservancy, beginning next spring.
The closing, which followed intensive negotiations among the four family members and their lawyers, came three years after Ms. Redd approached the conservancy for help and eight years after her divorce put the ranch's future in play.
While the arrangement may have been bad news to the likes of Christie Brinkley and Ralph Lauren, both of whom once made overtures for the property, it was a sweet moment for the conservancy and the Redds. Indeed, at a time when pressure is growing to develop what is left of the wild West, the deal demonstrated many of the sophisticated financial tools that environmental groups are increasingly using to keep the land pristine while giving owners a way to cash out. The tax advantages will allow the Redds, who are partners in the ranch, to clear about as much as they might have from a commercial sale, even though the ranch was recently appraised for $6.3 million.
By selling for less, they not only reduce their taxable capital gains on the transaction but can also deduct their share of the difference between the appraised value and the sale price -- $1.7 million -- from their income taxes over the next five years as a charitable contribution to the Nature Conservancy.
In addition, a third of the sale proceeds will go into separate charitable remainder unit trusts for Ms. Redd and her former husband. (Ms. Redd's share was reduced by the value of her lifelong tenancy and of a 10-year lease for cattle grazing.) The trusts will produce taxable income for them during their lifetimes. But the principal will go to the Nature Conservancy upon their deaths, allowing them to deduct the value of the principal from their income taxes for the next five years. The structure also ultimately reduces the conservancy's purchase cost and effectively recycles the money for other land deals.
FOR the conservancy, the purchase is a cornerstone in its efforts to preserve "representative ecosystems" within the canyon lands of the Colorado River. It will also keep a spectacular gateway to a remote national park from being cluttered with commercial and residential development.
"The Dugout was begging to become a resort or golf course/condo complex," said Bill Hedden, a former supervisor of Grand County, which includes Moab. "It would have completely ruined that incredible entrance" to the park.
"The Nature Conservancy threw itself into the breach," added Mr. Hedden, who works for the Grand Canyon Trust, a group trying to buy out and retire grazing leases held by ranchers in the nearby Escalante-Grand Staircase National Monument.
The Nature Conservancy has gained a reputation for helping keep family ranches from being broken up in environmentally sensitive areas in the West. But it has also been busy elsewhere, including the Northeast, buying private parcels of undeveloped land. With 1,340 properties in the United States, Latin America and the South Pacific, the group owns the largest private network of nature sanctuaries in the world.
The conservancy is sometimes called the real estate arm of the conservation movement, but it seldom waits for property to be listed on the open market and it rarely deals with real estate brokers. The group prefers to work directly with landowners on package deals that address estate and tax planning in tandem with land preservation.
The hottest area for such environmental wheeling and dealing may be the West, where property values near popular tourist destinations have multiplied and families face difficult decisions about how to pass on their new wealth to the next generation. Some 60 percent of ranches in the West will change hands in the next 20 years, according to Utah Open Lands, an organization advocating preservation of these properties.
Because about half of the land in Western states is owned by the Federal Government and is thus out of the reach of developers, it is the private land that is likely to be built up over the next couple of decades in a process of "rural gentrification," said William Riebsame, editor of the "Atlas of the New West" (W. W. Norton).
"There seems to be a real estate demand for ranch land even in deeply rural areas," said Mr. Riebsame, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado. As rising real estate values eclipse potential profits from farming, the land is "being carved into smaller and smaller pieces," he said.
Like many other ranching families, the Redds were "land rich and money poor," Ms. Redd said, "because everything was tied up in the land."
Ms. Redd moved here 30 years ago when she and Robert were married. They raised two sons, Matthew and Adam, in a modern ranch house they built beside Indian Creek, under the forbidding prow of a petroglyph-pocked red mesa, 35 miles from the nearest town and with no electricity or phone.
Heidi Redd had dreamed of being a cowgirl since she was a child in Blackfoot, Idaho, watching Roy Rogers in Saturday matinees. She took to the remote ranch life with zeal. Even today, a cardboard cutout of Roy Rogers stands by her fireplace; she calls him "the man of the house."
After the couple divorced in 1989, Mr. Redd remarried and moved to Virginia. Matthew, now 28, and Adam, 23, also eventually moved away.
But they all wanted a piece of the ranch, and Dugout was almost torn apart as the family fought over what to do with the property, which had cost only about $350,000 when Robert's father bought it in 1962.
The ranch is a naturalist's prize. It is home to rare wild flowers, like the kachina daisy; natural sanctuaries atop steep mesas that have never been grazed, and 42 miles of free-flowing creek, a rarity in this dry land, where most streams are dammed and diverted for irrigation.
In their divorce settlement, the Redds turned the ranch into a partnership in which each family member held shares, and Ms. Redd then created a company to lease the ranch from the partnership. The company ran about 700 head of cattle, bringing in $100,000 to $150,000 a year in gross revenue, depending on beef prices. The ranch, in turn, earned modest profits from the lease and from serving as a location for movies like "City Slickers II" and advertisements including numerous Marlboro ads.
BUT it became clear that the ranch had become both an emotional battleground and an underperforming asset. The Redds agonized about whether to sell it and split the proceeds or divide the property. That is when Ms. Redd approached the Nature Conservancy.
It took delicate negotiations to close the deal -- talks, Ms. Redd said, that were as much about "family counseling" as about finances and land. Each family member brought a lawyer to the meetings.
At the first meeting, Dave Livermore, the Utah state director of the Nature Conservancy, said he asked Matt if he wanted a cup of coffee. Matt turned to his lawyer and asked, "Can I answer that question?"
Ms. Redd said Mr. Livermore "related to my two boys and what they were going through and let them talk to him about what they wanted," while his colleague, Chris Montague, focused on the parents. "We were real jerks," Ms. Redd said. "There were many times I would have thrown my hands up in the air and said, 'I've had it.' "
Mr. Livermore said "the love of the land" was "the thing that kept us going."
Robert Redd added that the same love "also made it hard to get where we are."
"If it wasn't for Dave and Chris playing good cop-bad cop, we never would have made it," he said.
In some ways, resolving the fate of the ranch brought the family back from the brink of completely splitting apart. Heidi and Robert Redd still don't talk to each other. But Matt Redd works for his mother. And Mr. Redd is moving back to Salt Lake City from Virginia to be closer to his sons and the land he loves.
"For 30 years, the Dugout was my life," Mr. Redd said. Selling the ranch "gives me a sense of loss," he said, "but also a sense of gift."
"I'll have financial benefits I haven't had for eight years. For eight years the property I inherited from my family has been of no benefit to me, and quite a drain because of the legal bills," he said.
"I always assumed the boys would have the ranch someday. But I think the land and the ranch would have been damaged the most by a division. The next thing to be damaged would be the lives of all four of us. Now Matt and Adam can be independent. That's a good thing. And the ranch won't have condos."
The sons say they still would rather have inherited the ranch. When the Nature Conservancy bought an option to buy Dugout a year ago, the sons issued a statement that spoke of their "poignant loss." They tried to negotiate a deal to sell the conservancy a scenic easement, restricting further development of the land, for around $2 million; that way, the property could be passed down to them and used for cattle ranching but never subdivided. But that plan fell apart over thorny issues such as the sons' future development rights and Mr. Redd's right to visit the ranch.
Matt Redd compared selling the ranch to "selling your sense of place and losing your soul." He returned to the ranch to help his mother with the fall roundup. Dressed in dirty khaki riding pants, boots and a cowboy hat, he seemed very much at home on the range as he discussed the coming transfer.
"Land isn't valued anymore for agriculture or its production value," he said. "It's valued for its esthetic or mythical value," a change that he blames on the "gentrification of the West."
But, he said, "I'll admit I'm very spoiled growing up here; there's no place like home." Matt hopes to move back to the ranch with his wife, Kristen, and someday work as its foreman for the Nature Conservancy.
Adam is now in college in Salt Lake City. "Early on, I wanted to be on the ranch and stay on it and work on it," he said. "I still think it's the perfect job. But I have a house in the city now. And there's a lot of things I like to do. I'll try to build up some finances before putting everything into a ranch."
THE Nature Conservancy is still raising the money to pay for the deal, which is six times bigger than any of its previous purchases in Utah and ranks among the organization's biggest preserves nationwide.
It made the Dugout a centerpiece of a national fund-raising drive, pulling in 1,200 individual contributions from around the country. But most of the money has come from Utah. The George S. and Dolores Dore Eccles Foundation of Salt Lake City, based on the Eccles family's fortune from Utah's First Security Bank, contributed $1.3 million.
As he drove out some weeks ago to visit Ms. Redd at a remote corner of the Dugout Ranch, Mr. Livermore returned fund-raising calls on a cellular phone.
"This is a property we always dreamed about," he said, scanning the horizon. "We were worried it would be a Coney Island, 7-Eleven, Imax theater. What we're protecting it from is all this," he said, pointing out "trophy homes, or as a friend calls them, 'starter castles,' " on the Moab outskirts.
"Imagine a home site every 10 acres here," Mr. Livermore said as he approached the ranch headquarters. The Nature Conservancy hopes Ms. Redd can be "an ambassador to the livestock community" in the "war for the West," which these days, he said, is not between ranchers and environmentalists, but between "cows and condos."
He found Ms. Redd gathering cattle in a mountain pasture. From there, she, Matt and a hired hand, Whit Hill, would herd the cows about 20 miles to the home ranch. The calves would be weaned from their mothers and sold.
As she discussed the transfer of her property, Ms. Redd sported a nasty black eye from chasing a cow through the oak scrub thickets the day before. She rides every day. "I'll never lose my awe at how gorgeous it is and how very lucky I am to be here," she said.
And she is happy with the deal. "I got out of it what I want: to stay here till I die, and when I'm gone it won't be subject to development."
Ms. Redd also believes that the deal is good for her sons and her former husband. "Financially, it gives them a lot of freedom to do what they choose," she said. "They ended up with money enough to pursue whatever in life they want. We're all in charge of our own lives now."

Charts: "Open Space Under Assault"
Since the early 1980's, population growth and the sprawl of urban and suburban development have been drastically altering land use in the states of the Far West and Southwest. Farmland is under the most direct assault, but forest and range lands are steadily shrinking in many states as well. Map of U.S shows population growth outside of metropolitan areas.

"Location, Location, Location"
The Nature Conservancy is in the forefront of efforts by environmental groups to buy ecologically valuable properties threatened by development. The group often structures its deals to provide tax benefits to the sellers while ultimately returning all or part of the purchase price to the conservancy for future acquisitions. Here are some prominent examples.

Germany the Unloved Just Wants to Be Normal

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
IMAGINE the political cartography of Europe a decade from now: at its hub, the reunified Germany, encircled by lands it once occupied yet locked in peaceful step with them by a common European currency and by common membership in the NATO alliance.
That is the utopian vision of strength and normalcy that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would like to mold as his legacy -- a goal, he is given to saying, that will decide between war and peace in the 21st century. 
 Yet, as Germany teeters between prosperous postwar introspection and the unfamiliar assault of economic globalization, a question intrudes: how will Germany achieve normalcy on a continent that still defines its relationships by caricatures drawn from the same history it seeks to overcome?
For most nations, one measure of normalcy is their relationship with the past. And as the so-called Nazi gold affair in Switzerland and France's acknowledgment of its ambiguous wartime history have displayed in recent months, historical truth has become a spectral force across Europe.
 
History, History Everywhere
 On the surface, Germany has all the trappings of a "normal" post-industrial society. A traveler from the United States initially finds Frankfurt or Dusseldorf perfectly familiar: the highways and high-rises, talk shows and discos, businesses and churches.
But then come the subtexts that are not so familiar.
Every manifestation of late 20th-century life in Germany finds a counterpoint in the past: the point of reference for the nation's record postwar unemployment of 4.5 million is the mass joblessness that preceded Hitler's rise to power in 1933; the fear of inflation that propels Germans' misgivings about the planned European currency harks back to the ruinous inflation of the Weimar Republic.
Indeed, German society is latticed with taboos -- some evident, some less so.
At the most obvious level, displays of Nazi insignia and gestures -- swastikas and stiff-arm salutes -- are illegal. It is a criminal offense to trivialize the Holocaust. In more subtle ways, the past plays itself out in responses that sometimes strike outsiders as bizarre.
German officials rail against the Scientology movement, for instance, because they fear it is a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings -- even though the official response smacks of the Nazi era's authoritarianism. In a low-key debate about smoking in public places, the authorities are said to be reluctant to be too stern because the Nazis frowned on public smoking, especially by women.
It is that tracery of unspoken taboo and inhibition that some, to the political left and to the right, now depict as the greatest barrier to normalcy, a source of self-doubt and even self-loathing.
"One almost has the impression that Germans have set out not to be loved at all," Peter Schneider, a left-wing author, wrote recently in Der Spiegel. "Or do they not love themselves? Is this absence of self-love a result of Hitlerism, or, conversely, the cause of Hitlerism?"
The argument gets more complicated because, throughout the postwar era, Germany rebuilt itself on a notion of consensus designed specifically to swallow the extremes of the past in a society of checks and balances, and, above all, in the denial of nationalism in favor of a broader Western identity.
That was simpler to achieve before reunification seven years ago, but since then another Germany has returned -- Europe's most populous land, with 82 million people, that was once the crucible of hegemony.
And, according to some on what is called the "new right," a loose assembly of writers, intellectuals and historians, that huge, geopolitical shift has opened the way for a self-assertive Germany to eschew the reflex of contrition for the past, a reflex they blame on such stalwarts of the left as the author Gunther Grass and the philosopher Jurgen Habermas.
That conflict between national pride and historical shame now defines the "German question": how can Germany draw a line under its history without seeming to discard it?
In the 1920's, the deadly mix of World War I humiliation and repressed nationalism nurtured Nazism, albeit under completely different circumstances.
Even today, many younger Germans chafe at being held accountable for history. Virtually all of Germany's neighbors (except Switzerland) were occupied, annexed or invaded at some point during World War II; all harbor stereotypes of an aggressive Germany strutting through the generations.
In fact, no other European country has done as much as Germany to confront its history. Of 700,000 visitors each year to the former concentration camp at Dachau, 350,000 are Germans, many of them schoolchildren sent there to reinforce the message drummed home in schools and politicians' speeches: never again. Germany has spent some $58 billion in reparations and is still called upon -- by former slave laborers, for example, or by victims of Nazi persecution in Greece -- to pay more. But does any of that make the past any easier to live with? The answer is no, simply because there is no statute of limitations for the Holocaust.
Two years ago, Chancellor Kohl commemorated the 50th anniversary of the end of the war by seeking to cast ordinary Germans as the victims of a Nazi occupation of their state. Just one year later, though, "Hitler's Willing Executioners," by the American writer Daniel J. Goldhagen, sought to prove exactly the opposite: that ordinary Germans were the perpetrators of genocide.
The debate has left contradictory strains in German society. Among the intellectual elite, the preoccupation with history remains: the two major art shows in Berlin this fall, for instance, deal with German division and with the work of artists forced to flee by the Nazis.
In less public circles, though, the inhibitions seem to be weakening. When Germany's generals discovered recently that, three years back, foot soldiers had made home videos showing themselves giving Nazi salutes, their conclusion was not just that taboos were being eroded in the barracks, but that they were weakened in the homes and schools where the soldiers grew up -- particularly in East Germany, which never accepted the same responsibility for the past as West Germany.
 
A Plea for Assertiveness
 And, increasingly, the postwar inhibitions collide with Germany's need to reinvent itself in a global economy that challenges it to tap hidden reserves.
In his essay in Der Spiegel, Mr. Schneider recalled Germans' "courage, boldness, spirit of discovery and invention." Had Germans forgotten, he asked, that they were co-inventors of cars, telephones, faxes, rocket technology and computers? "Should these positive energies and talents of the Germans remain suspect as Nazi virtues," he wrote, "all in the name of an effort to overcome the past that is more obedient than actual?"

The Stock of 'Asian Values' Drops

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS Asia's economic ascendancy in the 80's and early 90's moved from the astounding to the mildly terrifying, the world began to look for the magic formula that built such prosperity from poverty. Asian leaders themselves were the first to give the recipe a label, writing about "the Pacific way" and lecturing about "Asian values."
Even those who doubted there was an answer to the miracle conceded that there was something different about the way Asians were organizing themselves for the next century. It struck anyone watching Thai workers singing a Japanese company song after calisthenics in the Toyota factory near Bangkok. Or anyone who watched young mothers in Seoul quiz their children with math problems as they waited for the school bus. 
 Economists pointed to Asia's phenomenal savings rates, sociologists to its low divorce rates. Business schools offered case studies of firms that guaranteed lifetime employment and built low-cost housing for workers. One of Singapore's top diplomats gushed in Foreign Affairs only two years ago that modern Asia had "emerged as the most dynamic region of the world" because it fused "the best practices and values from many rich civilizations, Asian and Western."
 
The Dark Side

Underneath all that fusion, though, was a good deal of fraud. While the world was enthralled with the best of Asian values, phenomenal growth rates obscured the worst: crony capitalism, corruption and secrecy eating away at the region's accomplishments like termites in a forest of fast-growing bamboo. In the name of "cooperation" between governments and the businesses that supplied them with ready cash, no one would be forced to disclose embarrassing financial information, give shareholders real power, or expose powerful friends to true global competition.
Now, as the International Monetary Fund races in to clean up the wreckage and put together bailout packages -- last week South Korea became the latest erstwhile juggernaut to plead for its help -- it is clear that the darker side of Asian values helped turn the Asian miracle into the Asian mess. As Daniel Tarullo, President Clinton's international economic adviser, noted before Mr. Clinton's departure this weekend for an inopportunely scheduled annual meeting of Pacific Rim leaders, "The Asian miracle did not repeal the laws of economics."
South Korea now knows this only too well. It is still a world-class producer of steel, semiconductors and cars, and its economy is still growing impressively. But it is suffering an acute cash crisis because its banks lent billions mindlessly -- often at government insistence -- to projects and companies that are now collapsing left and right. The banks, in turn, were depending on a river of foreign cash. And they are failing because that river has been abruptly rerouted as investors have begun to steer clear of Korea -- and the I.M.F.'s other wards, Indonesia and Thailand.
In South Korea as in Indonesia and Thailand, the darker Asian values encouraged politicians to use national banking systems as their personal kitties. They ordered up loans for projects that enriched their friends. They dotted the skyline with ego-gratifying symbols of modernity: the world's tallest buildings, highways through rice paddies, the next Silicon Valley. Until disaster loomed on the horizon, governments and corporate titans together managed to cover up bad news that might warn investors that some of that dynamism was really a lighted bundle of dynamite.
 
'European Values'
 The fear of criminal libel suits kept a tight rein on what the press said about politicians. While it was hardly a secret that the family of President Suharto of Indonesia had swept up most of the nation's lucrative businesses into its own government-protected monopolies, it was unhealthy to explore in public how corruption could undermine Indonesia's future.
Fraud, deception and influence-peddling are hardly uniquely Asian; it was less than a decade ago that all three contributed to America's savings and loan crisis. In fact, there may be no such thing as "Asian values," good or bad: even at the height of Asia's boom it seemed improbable that a salaryman trudging off the train in Yokohama shared much of a world view with an ethnic Chinese executive in Indonesia. Think what it would take to get a German and a Frenchman to agree on "European values."
But in Asia the talk about common values contributed to arguments that there was something unique, perhaps even innate, about the region's material success. And that bred an overbearing arrogance in the business world. Business leaders boasted in the early 1990's that Asia would soon be generating enough wealth to become the world's banker. The Americans could staff the global granary. And Europeans would run a series of national boutiques, so that the rest of the world had somewhere to drink wine, buy art and go skiing before returning to the important business of making a fortune.
"There was a great deal of myth-making throughout Asia about the real sources of prosperity," said John Dower, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "They believed their own spin, and we believed it too, because who could argue with success?"
One question now is whether Asia's present and no doubt temporary humbling will lead to any fundamental reassessment of the link between its authoritarian ways and its success. Until now, Asia's need to keep building prosperity -- putting "economic rights" first, in the lingo of the "Asian values" argument -- has been used as a justification to keep a lid on individual freedom.
 
Helping Themselves
 President Jiang Zemin of China used a muted version of that argument during his visit to the United States last month. And that argument has been the constant subtext as the founder of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, has jousted with the West over the relationship between economic progress and the "Asian value" of "respect for authority."
The roots of Asia's economic troubles, however, make a pretty convincing case that authoritarians can mess up the operations of fast-growing economies as skillfully as anyone can. They did so chiefly by trying to manipulate markets to help themselves and their friends.
The toughest job facing the I.M.F. may be changing that culture -- convincing countries that they have to reveal financial figures that could expose the dealings of the politically well-connected. The I.M.F. will undoubtedly insist on austerity, which means canceling big dams and family-owned car projects.
No doubt many in Asia will declare that the I.M.F. is acting as a proxy for the Americans. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, has already warned against "re-colonization." What is really happening, though, is the true "fusion" of Asian and Western values. And it may not make for a very pacific time.

For Iraq, a Dog House With Many Rooms

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
WHAT if Saddam Hussein really means it? Suppose all the doors in Iraq, even those in sumptuous presidential palaces, open to United Nations weapons inspectors and all that anthrax and VX poison, those stashed warheads and secretly imported missile parts, are carted away into history. Iraq is then free of sanctions, right? Not exactly.
Over the last few years, to the consternation of European, Chinese and Japanese members of the Security Council, the Clinton Administration from time to time has reminded the Iraqis and anyone else listening that the omnibus Security Council Resolution 687, which served as a cease-fire agreement ending the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, has other requirements. 
 The resolution, which established the Special Commission that has been disarming Iraq ever since, swept up a list of other demands on Iraq that had not been met. Among them: accounting for 604 missing Kuwaitis and others of various nationalities who disappeared during Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in August 1990.
Iraq also had to return stolen Kuwaiti property and to make good on "any direct loss, damage, including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources, or injury to foreign governments, nationals and corporations, as a result of Iraq's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait." A compensation commission in Geneva has been working on that, using confiscated Iraqi assets and money from the limited oil sales that Iraq is allowed to make. But over the last few years, only $727 million has been paid on claims totaling $220 billion.
When President Clinton said this month that "the sanctions will be there until the end of time, or as long as he lasts," Mr. Clinton may have been referring -- as aides hastened to explain later -- just to Mr. Hussein's recent challenge to American arms inspectors, but the phrase had a familiar ring at the United Nations. When Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was the United States representative here, she left the impression among other Security Council members that the Clinton Administration had its own measures of Iraqi compliance that went beyond destruction of its weapons.
 
Sanctions for Eternity
 Other Security Council members said the Clinton position went beyond what they had agreed to accept when the Bush Administration was in charge. Other nations' understanding of Resolution 687 is that the embargo on oil sales is linked directly to the weapons destruction, and not to other issues.
Diplomats say that this vague threat of eternal sanctions by the Americans has only fueled Iraq's sense that it might as well be troublesome. There is only one reward Iraq wants: the freedom to sell oil. A number of diplomats here believe that the United States, too, has a single priority: the end of Saddam Hussein.
Fortunately for Washington, the Iraqi President is prone to making things worse for himself at critical moments, and any hopes of seeing the Special Commission declare him weapons-free are very dim for the foreseeable future.
There has long been a feeling among Europeans and others that if Iraq met all the requirements of the weapons-elimination program, the United States would be in trouble in the Security Council if it tried to prolong sanctions by other means. This was previewed only a month ago when the Americans failed to pile new sanctions on Iraq. But the situation was reversed after the Iraqis, true to form, overreached and disrupted the work of investigators, and were punished with travel bans on their officials.
It would come as no surprise if the United States were to appear quite generous in coming discussions on allowing Iraq to sell more oil under the emergency measure known as the "oil for food" resolution, which went into operation early this year after years of Iraqi indecision on whether to accept the limited program. Washington is aware of the growing pressure to relieve the suffering of Iraqi citizens, whose economy has collapsed around them during seven years of sanctions. Even United Nations agencies, among them the World Health Organization and Unicef, the children's fund, have been critical of the harsh sanctions.
No one sitting in the Security Council in April 1991, when the cease-fire resolution was adopted, expected sanctions to last this long. Richard Butler, who took over last summer as executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, said recently that inspectors had thought they would accomplish the task in a matter of months. There is ample evidence that Iraq also believed that if it gave up a little of this and a little of that -- and then hid the rest away -- the inspectors would leave and Mr. Hussein could resume building his illegal arsenal.
 
The Luxury of Stalemate
 It did not work that way. Because of the dogged sleuthing of the Special Commission, the Iraqis have been exposed as major stockpilers of some of the most lethal biological and chemical weapons known to science. They have been shown to have been secretly working on nuclear weapons, and they have never ceased trying to convert their permitted defensive missiles and warheads into longer-range threats.
And Washington has enjoyed the luxury of not needing to develop alternative policies. From the vantage point of some other countries, the two sides will not be able to maintain this equilibrium forever. The alternative, however, could be grim. As recent events have demonstrated, Iraq is capable of serious challenges to the Security Council. The United States, now the lone superpower, with dwindling support for a military option, may have to take on the Iraqis alone next time.
Or, if Iraq should be declared free of weapons, the Americans may have to accept living with Saddam Hussein.

A Century Later, Letting Africans Draw Their Own Map

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo

 BODY:
FROM the earliest days of Africa's postcolonial era, a critical pair of thoughts have been virtual articles of faith for generations of African intellectuals.
Africa must unite in order to prosper, according to the first tenet, most famously associated with Kwame Nkrumah, the founding father of Ghana whose brand of Pan-Africanism went so far as to prescribe a United States of Africa. 
 The corollary, which has taken on ever greater prominence as contemporary Africa's political woes have multiplied, is that the European partition of the continent at the Berlin Conference of 1885 is at the root of much of Africa's instability.
Guided by their own conservatism -- and a will to hold onto power and a fear of an even greater instability -- most of the continent's early independence leaders recoiled from Mr. Nkrumah's vision. In its place, they enshrined among Africa's most widely accepted political rules a pledge of non-interference in one another's affairs.
As a result, Africa's political elites have spent much of the last 40 years insisting that the current hodgepodge of states be maintained at all costs, even as African intellectuals curse their borders as the creation of arrogant outsiders who took no heed of this continent's ethnic, historical or economic realities.
Gaining little notice at first but recently acquiring dramatic force, events in this decade are shaking Africa's old geopolitical order as never before. With the implosion of Somalia, the breakup of Ethiopia and the narrowly averted disintegration of Liberia and Sierra Leone, Mr. Nkrumah's challenge to Africa's acceptance of its inherited fragmentation has assumed renewed relevance, even urgency, in the 1990's -- just as Europe is blurring its own political and economic boundaries.
Moreover, with the end of superpower alliances that helped keep the map of Africa neatly frozen during the cold war, African states have clearly abrogated the old non-interference axiom and openly challenged precolonial borders.
The stiffest challenge to Africa's old state system has come in a string of Central African conflicts that began with the nine-month war in Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo). Congo's war ended in May with the victory of Laurent Kabila, the leader of an insurgency, who was heavily supported by troops from Rwanda, Uganda and Angola.
That this war would be radically different from the continent's many other post-independence conflicts was announced at its outset a year ago when the Rwandan President, Pasteur Bizimungu, openly called for a "Berlin II, so that we can reflect on the disorders created by Berlin I."
The immediate complaint of Mr. Bizimungu's Government was that Zaire, led by the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, was harboring Hutu militiamen who mounted constant attacks against Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated Government. But many saw in the President's outspoken invocation of the Berlin Conference the reflection of another grief, this one with its roots in the colonial history of Belgium, which once defined and possessed both Rwanda and Congo. Tiny Rwanda has one of the world's highest population densities, and may never find a way to accommodate the warring Hutu and Tutsi within its confines. Next door, meanwhile, Congo is a geographic colossus with one of Africa's lowest population densities.
Rwanda's intervention in the former Zaire was followed last month by an Angolan blitzkrieg in the neighboring Congo Republic, decisively ending that country's four-month civil war in favor of Denis Sassou-Nguesso, a former dictator who has now been returned to power. And this month Angola reportedly helped plot a narrowly averted coup in Zambia, its southern neighbor, because of Zambia's suspected assistance to Angolan rebels.
 
On Its Own Behalf
 As Rwanda did in Zaire, Angola was intervening out of coolly calculated national interests. In the Congo Republic, these included knocking out rear bases of support for long-smoldering Angolan rebellions and securing the strategically precarious Cabinda enclave -- a tiny land mass sandwiched between the two Congos that ranks as one of Berlin's most perverse constructions, but which also happens to contain two-thirds of Angola's vast oil wealth.
For many who specialize in African affairs, unless this continent's leaders can peacefully rethink the map of Africa together, wars like these, driven by population pressures or competition for scarce resources, will be the wave of the future.
"A certain number of principles that date from the independence era are already being shattered, notably the principle of non-interference," said Edem Kodjo, a former Prime Minister of Togo and former Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity. "The intangibility of borders is likely to be next, because many of our states are inviable, either for economic or political reasons, or because of their population or ethnic composition."
Mr. Kodjo, a lifelong Pan-Africanist who has written about the need to reconfigure the continent's states, says Africa is bound to move toward what he called larger political ensembles in a process that risks being bloody. "Perhaps we can spare ourselves the violence, but if you look at history most political units have been built through war," he said. "Take the example of Germany and Bismarck, or of Italy, or of the United States itself."
Other African intellectuals fear that any sweeping reconsideration of Africa's borders would prove too costly to the world's poorest continent, threatening gradual gains in economic development and institution building. And, citing the bloody breakup of India and Pakistan at independence in 1947, they say no one can predict the cost in lives.
 
The Ethnic Spaghetti
 Then comes the vexing problem of ethnicity. Europe's imperial cartographers have been criticized for more than a century for casually drawing up borders that separated ethnic groups or placed longtime rivals in the same colony. Africa's ethnic complexity, however, makes doing any better on this score an almost insurmountable challenge.
Some experts in African affairs say any change to political geography is unlikely to come through costly European-style wars of conquest or ethnic-based redrawing of the map. Africa's reconfiguration, these experts say, is already well under way but involves a more subtle process in which regional economic and military powers emerge and express their hegemony without seeking to extend outright sovereignty beyond their borders.
Some of these new powers -- like South Africa within its region, Nigeria in West Africa, Angola in Central Africa and a tandem of Uganda and Rwanda in the east -- are already known. Others that may emerge in time could include Congo, Kenya and Tanzania, and the Ivory Coast.
In a scenario of this type involving regional powers and tributary states, an already powerful Nigeria will continue to consolidate its influence in a collection of West African states that would, at a minimum, include Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.
"A lot of Caribbean leaders don't sneeze without first consulting Washington, and I suspect that things could become much the same in parts of Africa," said Will Reno, an Africa specialist at Florida International University, referring to such emerging regional powers.
"In 15 or 20 years, the map of Africa is going to look pretty much as it does today, but a visit to Africa could feel very different," he added. "By then, Benin, Niger or Chad could feel like mere extensions of Nigeria, in the same way that when I travel 50 miles east from Miami, the Bahamas feel like a county of Florida."

THE ECONOMY
A Yawning Trade Deficit
The United States trade deficit grew to $11.1 billion in September, the widest in eight months, the Government said, with Asia's financial problems worsening the gap. Other economic reports were far less worrisome. Consumer prices rose by a modest two-tenths of 1 percent again in October, helping limit inflation over the last 12 months to 2.1 percent, the lowest level since oil prices collapsed a decade ago. United States industrial output advanced in October for the 15th consecutive month, although at an unexpectedly subdued rate of 0.5 percent, indicating an absence of any inflationary threat. 

MARKETS
The Bull Is Back
Markets rallied strongly, fueled by a growing optimism that the turmoil in Asia would not subvert Wall Street's spectacular bull market and by indications that a conflict in the Persian Gulf might have been averted. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 4.1 percent last week, pulling it well above its level just before the 554-point drop on Oct. 27. It ended the week up 308.59, at 7,881.07. The Nasdaq composite index rose 37.24, to 1,620.75. The bond market also enjoyed a strong week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hovering near a 21-month low at 6.03 percent.
 
TEAMSTERS
A Blow to Carey and Labor
The nation's labor movement, on the ropes since the Reagan Administration delivered a knockout punch to striking air traffic controllers, seemed on the verge of a comeback, particularly since Ron Carey, left, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, led 180,000 United Parcel Service workers in a successful and popular strike in August. Now a court-appointed union monitor has delivered his own punch. Kenneth Conboy, a former Federal judge, barred Mr. Carey, who had long been considered a leading crusader against corruption, from running for re-election, contending that he had diverted members' dues to his campaign coffers in last year's nullified election. That leaves James P. Hoffa, the son of the legendary teamsters' leader, as the clear favorite in the coming election.
 
ADVERTISING
P.& G.'s $1 Billion Move
Procter & Gamble made the biggest assignment in the history of advertising, consolidating responsibilities for planning and buying television commercial time in the United States -- with an estimated $1 billion to $1.2 billion in annual spending -- at a single agency, Televest, a unit of MacManus Group. Televest specializes in media services, and the P.& G. decision is the most recent in a skein of consolidations by giant advertisers that have come to view media buying as a specialty that needs its own expertise, just like creative work.
 
TECHNOLOGY
A Nation of Nerds?
Digital technology -- often defined as both computing and telecommunications, along with a variety of consumer electronics products -- is now the nation's largest industry, ahead of construction, food products and automotive manufacturing, according to a study sponsored by the American Electronics Association and the Nasdaq market. Sales in the field have grown 57 percent in the 1990's, to $866 billion. The businesses generated 6.2 percent of the nation's output of goods and services in 1996 and employed nearly 4.3 million people. The study represents perhaps the most comprehensive statistical portrait to date of what is called "the new economy" -- one populated by high-technology companies that generate new wealth, new work practices and new challenges in public policy.
 
DEALS
Merrill, on Winged Feet
Merrill Lynch & Company agreed to acquire Mercury Asset Management Group. of Britain, one of Europe's largest investment firms, for $5.3 billion in cash. It would be the most expensive acquisition ever in the money management business and reflects a push by financial service companies, including banks, brokerage firms and investment companies, to move into the rapidly growing business of money management.
 
BANKS
The Big Get Bigger
Accepting the richest price ever for a United States bank, Corestates Financial of Philadelphia agreed to a $17.1 billion offer from acquisition-minded First Union of Charlotte, N.C. The combined bank would have the largest share of deposits in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and a branch network spanning the East Coast from Florida to southern Connecticut. The deal would leave Philadelphia, the nation's first banking capital, without a major bank that calls it home. . . . An even bigger bank merger is being discussed in Britain. Barclays and National Westminster were said by people close to the talks to be weighing a $20 billion deal.

HEADLINE: The Fortunate Seven

BYLINE: By Gene Jones; Gene Jones is the director of the Des Moines Coalition for the Homeless.

DATELINE: DES MOINES

 BODY:
The birth of septuplets here in Iowa last week has produced a reaction that reveals the strange, perhaps even warped character of American compassion and obligation.
These babies are special. They are special because of the odds against their conception. They are special because of the mix of faith and medical skill that sustained their gestation. They are special because, after birth, they are vulnerable. They are special because all at once there are seven new lives in the world, with all the joys and all the sleepless nights that seven new lives promise. 
 But all babies brought into this world, no matter what the circumstance of their birth, are special. All children are special.
This fact brings into focus the contradictory mix of private compassion and public scorn that characterizes American moral sensibilities today.
With the birth of these babies came offers of food, diapers, a new Chevy van, furniture, even full college scholarships. All this is wonderful. These acts of kindness are, by definition, "good," given our moral sensibilities, because the compassion is immediate, uncalculated, a matter of personal choice.
But these compassionate acts also reveal moral contradictions. The best example of this is the offer by Iowa's Governor, Terry Branstad, to provide a house for this family. The Governor has already assured us that this is a matter of private compassion, that he has simply used his office to secure private donations to make this offer a reality.
The paradox of this is that Mr. Branstad has been Governor for nearly 15 years, a period in which homelessness has increased so that there are at least 9,000 homeless children in Iowa, according to a study that is three years old. The study, conducted by the state Department of Education, found that 52 percent of the homeless people in Iowa are children. This is one of the highest proportions in the nation.
Every child is special.
Governor Branstad has presided over a state with an astounding number of low-income households -- up to 200,000 in all -- that are "shelter poor," meaning that they are paying so much for their housing and utilities that they do not have enough for food or clothing or transportation. The Iowa Department of Economic Development has estimated that it would take an investment of at least $3 billion to resolve this crisis.
This is the point: there are too many poor, single women with children living in Iowa who every month face the cruel choice of what not to buy for their children so that they can pay for rent and utilities. And it is this Governor, who celebrates private compassion and who has been identified as a leader in so-called welfare reform, who adamantly stands in the way of every effort made by nonprofit housing groups to dedicate a meager $8 million to $10 million in real-estate transfer taxes to the building or rehabilitation of low-cost housing.
Every child is special.
In the last two years, more than 2,000 families -- with 6,000 to 8,000 children -- have been disqualified from welfare and placed in Iowa's "limited benefits program," which gives some aid, including food stamps, for a maximum of one year. A recent study of this program found that 49 percent of the 137 families surveyed that had been disqualified from welfare saw their incomes drop an average of $384 a month within eight months of being placed on limited benefits.
The study does not identify the average income of the disqualified families. But given the national average for families on welfare, the average loss of income would have left the families with about $5,500 a year, or $460 per month. These families are experiencing nothing less than economic destitution within eight months -- that is, shortly before they drop completely off society's radar screen, since the state so far has not been tracking them after the year of limited benefits runs out.
Every child is special.
Our moral sensibilities are hypocritical. Private compassion is good; public compassion and responsibility are bad. Every governor, indeed every President elected to "end welfare as we know it," is complicit in perpetuating this moral hypocrisy.
Only when we acknowledge that, yes, private compassion is good, but it can never match the need, only when we refocus on public compassion, can we truly acknowledge the wonder of all new lives. Yes, every baby, every child, is special.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Vote Could Backfire on West

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Acrid cigarette smoke hovered in the room of the Book Lovers' Club of Banja Luka, with its worn wicker chairs, steady clink of small coffee cups, noisy chatter and shelves of well-thumbed Serbian literature.
Groups of unemployed teachers, unpublished writers, journalists and others who pass for the intellectual lights of a small Bosnian city, most in threadbare coats, gathered to ward off an unseasonable chill and to escape from the political debacle that has engulfed Serbian-held Bosnia. But with rival Serb leaders facing off in this weekend's election, discussion inevitably reverted to politics. 
 "We hope the power struggle will end this weekend with the parliamentary elections," said Divna Damjanovic, 43, a reporter for a small magazine. "But we expect not. It may have only begun. People are frightened, tired, burned out. It is as if the war just refuses to end."
The latest round in the battle by Washington to replace Radovan Karadzic, the powerful former Bosnian Serb president who has been indicted on war-crimes charges, with his rival and successor, Biljana Plavsic, turns on a parliamentary vote this weekend.
But the vote, given Ms. Plavsic's waning support, appears increasingly likely to backfire on its Western patrons. To the chagrin of many Western diplomats, who feel that Ms. Plavsic is more likely to cooperate with them in carrying out the 1995 accords that ended the Bosnian conflict, the likely beneficiaries may be the extreme nationalists in the Radical Party, led by Vojislav Seselj, a Serbian paramilitary leader.
Radical Party leaders condemn Ms. Plavsic for "selling out" to the West and have promised to ally themselves with the Bosnian Serb hard-liners if elected.
"Plavsic's support is eroding," said Dorde Latinovic, 36, the parliamentary candidate from the Liberal Party, the only party in the Bosnian Serb republic that has doggedly condemned the nationalist movements that fueled the war. "The party officials she denounced as corrupt have not been arrested, but instead have switched sides and now run her party, making a mockery of her promises to clean up the government. Corruption and smuggling continue.
"Worst of all, she is perceived by most Serbs as a stooge of the West."
"There is little chance that Plavsic will control the new parliament," Mr. Latinovic added. "The elections will boost the authority of the one man the West seems to hate as much as Karadzic, Vojislav Seselj," the ultranational who is the leading contender in next month's presidential elections in Serbia.
If Dr. Karadzic's governing Serb Democratic Party, which expelled Ms. Plavsic last summer, and its allies in the Radical Party retain a majority in the 83-seat assembly, it will be a humiliating defeat for the United States, which has helped orchestrate the election in an effort to bring about a parliament free of Dr. Karadzic's dominance.
NATO troops, in moves that have antagonized many Serbs, have seized police stations in towns in the western part of Serbian-controlled Bosnia and installed police officers who have pledged loyalty to Ms. Plavsic. The troops have also taken over key television transmitters that allow a studio in Ms. Plavsic's office building in Banja Luka to dominate the airwaves, often with propaganda as crude as that of her rivals.
"Our best hope now is that Plavsic gets enough votes to build some kind of a coalition with other parties, perhaps the Socialists, who are closely linked with Milosevic," said a Western diplomat, referring to the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. "If this does not work it will be a disaster."
The Social Democratic Party remains in control in the eastern half of Serbian-held Bosnia. Last Saturday, the police refused to allow Ms. Plavsic to cross the border from Serbia until NATO troops intervened.
Ms. Plavsic's newly formed party, the Serb People's Party, suffers from poor organization. And because it is dominated by former Social Democratic leaders it has been largely discredited. Rallies have failed to draw more than a few hundred lukewarm supporters and Ms. Plavsic's fiery denunciations of Dr. Karadzic and his allies for corruption, along with her vows to improve the economy, have yet to be matched by results.
The election campaign, which is being financed with $1.4 million from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has been marred by violence and threats of intimidation, including the arrest on Wednesday by police officers loyal to Ms. Plavsic of a woman they said was trying to hire an assassin for $3 million to kill the president. Also this week, a bomb exploded under a car belonging to a pro-Karadzic editor of the state-run Glas Srpski daily in Banja Luka.
Last week, Ms. Plavsic's campaign headquarters in the eastern town of Bijeljina suffered severe damage when two gunmen fired off more than 90 rounds at the building and tossed smoke grenades inside. No one was inside at the time.
The United States' special envoy to Bosnia, Robert Gelbard, quietly moved last month to prevent the balloting from also including a vote for the presidency, believing that Ms. Plavsic could not be re-elected, Western diplomats said.
Nikola Poplasen, 48, leader of the Radical Party in Serbian-held Bosnia, is a close protege of Mr. Seselj.
Before the war, the two men taught together in the political science department at Sarajevo University. They went on to lead Serbian paramilitary units accused by human rights officials of widespread atrocities against Muslims and Croats, as well as looting and extortion.
"We did very well in the local elections this fall and will do even better in these parliamentary elections," said Mr. Poplasen, sitting with several burly bodyguards in a large wood-paneled office in the Hotel Bosna.
"We have six seats in this parliament and expect that number to triple. People know that we are not tools of the Americans. We stand for a Greater Serbia, but one free of corruption. When Mr. Seselj takes power in Serbia, the border along the Drina will disappear, if not in name then in reality. We will all live in one state."
The Radical Party was given $40,000 by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for its campaign. Varying amounts were given to other parties depending on their size, organization officials said.
The election was called by Ms. Plavsic after she dissolved the Karadzic-dominated Parliament in July that voted to oust her from office. The United States then worked to persuade her political rivals to join in the election.
Whatever the election's outcome, some voters simply long for an end to the struggle within the Bosnian Serb leadership.
"Most people are sick of this political squabbling," said Stana Danilovic, 36, who has been unemployed since the war and sat with friends in the Book Lovers' Club. "There is a deep desire for one, strong party that can lead us out of this morass."

HEADLINE: To the U.S. Envoy in Hanoi, the Future Is Paramount

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Nov. 17

 BODY:
For Pete Peterson, a former Air Force pilot who spent six and a half years as a prisoner here during the Vietnam War, coming to Hanoi six months ago as the Ambassador of the United States was "the final act in a cathartic process."
"You have to make the decision to heal after an experience like that," he said of his long incarceration in Hoa Lo Prison here after his plane was shot down in 1966. 
 Both the United States and Communist-ruled Vietnam made a similar decision to heal by establishing full diplomatic relations in mid-1995, 20 years after the collapse of the American-backed South Vietnamese Government ended a war in which 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese died.
Mr. Peterson took up his post in May after a long Senate confirmation process.
The young generation of Vietnamese that has grown up since the country's struggle for independence will succeed, he clearly hopes, in putting the past behind them and moving their country into the global economy. As the Communists allow business to flourish here, Mr. Peterson is confident that greater freedoms will follow.
"If they can get a strong economic engine going, that will allow the Vietnamese to improve the quality of life across the board," Mr. Peterson said in an interview in the new American Embassy, which is being jury-rigged in a tall building far from the elegant chanceries of the main diplomatic colony in Hanoi's colonial-era French quarter. He hopes negotiations may eventually allow the embassy to move to more attractive quarters.
The Ambassador, now 62, was shot down on Sept. 10, 1966, on his 67th mission over Vietnam. He bailed out over the Red River Delta, landing in a tree beside an irrigation ditch in the village of An Doai, halfway between Hanoi and Haiphong.
Two village militiamen captured him, made him take off his uniform, and forced him to walk to a local storehouse until military authorities could pick him up and take him to Hanoi.
This past Sept. 10, he said, four months after his arrival, he traveled to the village to meet again with the men who captured him.
"They had wanted me to go right away, but I was reluctant to go out there," he said. "It gave me some butterflies. It brought back memories. It was useful. I had tea with members of both of their extended families, and, mostly, we talked about how we as combatants were able to reconcile."
"Your life becomes so much more clear and unburdened -- you're not always lamenting the past," he said of the healing process. "I am reconciled to all of the past. If I hadn't been, when I went home, I would have wilted away."
A cease-fire agreement in 1973, which failed to end the war, ended imprisonment for him and the rest of the Americans in the prison, which became infamous as the "Hanoi Hilton." A new hotel called the Hanoi Opera Hilton is now under construction near the beautifully restored 19th-century Opera House in the French colonial center of the city, to be operated by Hilton Hotels International.
"When I left the 'Hilton' that day, I essentially said, 'I've got to leave hate at the gate here,' " Mr. Peterson said. "But I was a real Rip Van Winkle -- I had to catch up with an awful lot of things I missed, and I finally said I can't reconstruct the entire six and a half years."
He had never seen his youngest child, 7 years old at the time. His two other children, teen-agers by then, felt he had abandoned them, he said. He and his wife, the late Carlotta Ann Neal Peterson, had to become reacquainted, and he had to try to resume his military career.
"All those things were stressful," he said. "Some of those things I accomplished successfully, and some I did not."
Mr. Peterson ended his military career as a colonel in 1981 and, a decade later, was elected to Congress as a Democratic from Florida. President Clinton nominated him to be the first United States Ambassador to Vietnam early in 1996, but Senate confirmation of him was delayed by debate over whether the Vietnamese were cooperating with the American effort to determine the fate of more than 2,000 soldiers then listed as missing in action.
American concern about prisoners of war and other soldiers listed as missing was long the driving force of American reluctance to move beyond suspended hostility to engagement with Vietnam, but, Mr. Peterson said, "we are now able to certify significant progress on the part of the Vietnamese in that area."
Though about 1,560 Americans are still listed as missing, the Ambassador said that identification of remains had been established conclusively for about 150 men whose families and military superiors believed might have survived into captivity, despite Vietnamese assurances that all surviving American prisoners were released in 1973.
"Of 194 discrepancy cases, only 38 to 40 remain to be determined," he said. And, he added, American records and testimony by individual American veterans had enabled the Vietnamese to find remains of some of their own missing in action, a legion that totals 300,000.
"As we come to a more normalized relationship with Vietnam, it becomes much more complex," Mr. Peterson said.
With American investment here now over $1 billion even without a bilateral trade agreement, snagged in complex negotiations, Vietnamese-American trade has the potential for tremendous growth, he said.
"Our focus is now on moving toward economic issues, and we have more than 500 American companies and more than 30 universities working in one way or another in Vietnam today," he said.
The way the Vietnamese handle emigration of those who want to leave, and the return of emigres who agree to come back, is one of the main criteria Congress will use before granting the low-tariff trade status most countries have with the United States. Before Congress will lift the remaining restrictions on trade between the United States and Vietnam, American officials say, Vietnam will have to live up to a promise to speed up exit permits for the 7,000 people who still want to leave. Earlier this year, Vietnam had issued far fewer than the 1,500 permits a month it had promised.
But Mr. Peterson said some applicants may now be starting to think about staying instead. "A lady who ran a restaurant I visited in Can Tho recently told me she had a friend who couldn't get documents," he said. "But she told me, 'That's O.K., living in Vietnam now is O.K.' We're seeing a number of applicants now who are no-shows," he said.

HEADLINE: 10 Heroin Deaths in Texas Reflect Rising Use by Young

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: PLANO, Tex., Nov. 18

 BODY:
This suburb of about 190,000 people hardly looks like a place where young people regularly die of heroin. Plano, 20 miles north of Dallas's forlorn downtown, is all big and new, with similar sprawling houses crammed side by side.
It is a modern Texas boom town, having grown from a population of under 4,000 in 1960. People move here to avoid inner-city schools and urban crime. Many arrived for well-paying jobs at companies like the computer services concern EDS, which has its headquarters here. In 1989, Plano's median household income of $53,905 beat the national figure of $30,056 by 79 percent. 
 But since January 1996, nine young people living or going to school in Plano have died of heroin overdoses, and another young person died at a party here.
Although the number of heroin deaths is startling for a city of this size, drug experts say that the rising use of heroin among young people is a growing phenomenon. The number of high school students nationally who have used heroin almost doubled last year -- rising to 2 percent of all students -- as what was once considered a narcotic for down-and-out junkies became fashionable and moved to the suburbs, said Alan I. Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Heroin coming into this country is now much purer, allowing it to be snorted like cocaine, ingested in a capsule or smoked with marijuana, Dr. Leshner said, adding, "Kids who would never inject themselves will snort it." At the same time, Dr. Leshner said, the price of heroin dropped and some fashion industry advertising seemed to glamorize the use of heroin.
The city's Police Chief, Bruce D. Glasscock, said: "It's not just Plano. It's a national problem."
He pointed to the 48 people who died in the Orlando, Fla., area in 1995 and 1996, 10 of them 21 or younger. Only six died from heroin overdoses in the same area in 1994, said a medical official in Florida.
The latest Plano victim was a 16-year-old Plano Senior High School student, Erin Baker. She was found dead on Nov. 9 after staying all night at a friend's apartment in nearby Denton. The youngest heroin victim was a 14-year-old boy who was found dead in April in a church parking lot where friends had dumped his body, officials said.
More than 1,500 parents and students came out for a town meeting last week to discuss the problem and to search for ways to prevent more deaths. Some parents were surprised that they had to deal with heroin at all, that teen-agers reared in comfortable homes, with nice cars to drive and money to spend, would turn to such a a hard drug.
"It's very bizarre," said Henry Kliman this week as he picked up his daughter, Aliyah, 16, a classmate of the dead girl, at her high school. "We grew up in the 60's. Heroin was the taboo. We played with marijuana and booze."
But then he saw another parent picking up a child in a Porsche and said that Plano might be a town where parents had "a little too much money and too little time." Mr. Kliman told of friends of his daughter who spent the night with her with their parents seemingly unconcerned about where they were.
Some residents here recall the national attention Plano received in 1983 when seven of its young people committed suicide.
"Parents need to spend more time with their kids," said James Russell, as he trimmed a customer's hair at his Plano Barbers shop, one of a long block of turn-of-the century storefronts that hint at downtown Plano's quaint past. "My kids don't go out and run the streets. I'd be standing in the doorway."
In 1994, the Plano City Council realized there was a problem and passed a curfew to keep young people under 17 off the streets at night. Parents were grateful, Chief Glasscock said. For the last several years, school officials have used drug-sniffing dogs on school campuses, and two drug counselors were added to the high schools this year.
Few of the young people interviewed seemed surprised by the presence of heroin in their community. "It started with my friends last year," said Aliyah Kliman, 16, who said that she did not use the drug and that it was stupid to do so.
"It's like, 'Oh, I only do it once a week,' " she said, mimicking some drug users. " 'I know what I'm doing. I'm only taking it in capsules.'
"No matter how you take it, that stuff will kill you," Aliyah said.
Jarrett Watkins, a 15-year-old 10th grader at Vines High School in Plano, said he had seen an eighth grader with heroin. "Last year was when the scene got a whole lot bigger," Jarrett said, an assessment seconded by Chief Glasscock.
Trey Watts, 17, was a friend of Miss Baker. He and some others had been playing pool at a friend's house that night and had tried repeatedly to reach the girl on her pager. The next morning, he said, her parents called the home where he was, looking for their daughter, only to learn later that she was dead in another friend's apartment in Denton.
"We tried to stop her," Trey said of his friend and her heroin use. "But she got back with other dealers. She was nice. She got hooked on a bad drug."
George Malina, 48, a consultant for business development, whose son, Milan Malina, died of a heroin overdose in Plano when he was 20, said the family had moved to one of Plano's gated communities on a golf course "to get away from these things." Milan was 17 when his father noticed something wrong.
"He became lethargic," Mr. Malina said. "He became argumentative. He became unemployable." Before that, he said, his son had been "extremely warm, loving, caring -- nicest kid in the world."

HEADLINE: How Tough Questions and Shrewd Mediating Brought Iraqi Showdown to an End

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
As an unarmed U-2 spy plane soared high over central Iraq two weeks ago, President Clinton was poised to order the biggest military operation of his Presidency.
In a military command center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, senior American and Saudi officers nervously tracked the progress of the flight, ready to unleash an overwhelming barrage of bombs and missiles against an array of targets if President Saddam Hussein carried out his threat to shoot down the plane. 
The United States would have considered an Iraqi attack on the high-flying U-2 "an act of war," a senior Pentagon official told reporters. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said in an interview that American retaliation would have meant a "horrendous result" for Iraq.
But by last weekend, even as more American warships steamed toward the Persian Gulf, Mr. Clinton was on the telephone with the Russians, French and British in search of a diplomatic solution.
In the end, the crisis did not get resolved on the battlefield but in a predawn meeting with officials from five countries in the glittering Palais des Nations in Geneva after a diplomatic initiative by a most unlikely mediator: Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia, a wily former spymaster and longtime friend of the Iraqis who has never been trusted by the United States.
During the three-and-a-half-week standoff over United Nations weapons inspections, Mr. Clinton and his national security advisers veered between the desire to hit Mr. Hussein hard for forcing the withdrawal of a United Nations inspection team and fear of the risks. Mr. Clinton longed to find concrete ways to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people after seven years of economic sanctions -- including the possible dispatch of more food and medicine -- but without looking soft on Mr. Hussein.
 
A Situation That Needs 'Constant Tending'
Along the way, amid the Administration's discussions of how best to punish Mr. Hussein, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright raised a provocative question intended to obtain a realistic answer: if the United States was going to use force, was it prepared to use the force necessary to solve the Iraq problem once and for all by overthrowing Mr. Hussein?
By far the most important lesson for the Americans was that even the most immense strikes against Mr. Hussein would not necessarily destroy Iraq's ability to make chemical and biological weapons or produce the desired political result, forcing Mr. Hussein to reverse his decision to expel the American weapons inspectors.
Although the crisis was averted -- or at least postponed -- when 75 weapons inspectors flew back to Baghdad on Friday morning to continue their mission to destroy Iraq's remaining weapons of mass destruction, Mr. Hussein won at least one point: a commitment by Russia to argue his case with the goal of lifting crippling economic sanctions as soon as possible.
The situation in Iraq "clearly requires constant tending in terms of keeping, making it clear to Saddam Hussein that he is not going to get out of his box," Ms. Albright admitted to reporters on Friday. "It's going to require a long-term view. He does have some staying power."
Iraq had been frustrating the United Nations inspectors for months, denying them access to some sites and hiding and moving materials and documents. But the situation became untenable at the end of October when Iraq branded American weapons inspectors spies and ordered them to leave the country.
In a meeting of President Clinton's national security advisers on Oct. 30, followed by their meeting with the President the next day, the Administration defined its primary objectives with Iraq: to contain Iraq so that it cannot threaten its neighbors militarily and to achieve the return of the weapons inspectors without granting Iraq any concessions.
After Ms. Albright asked that the group discuss whether American policy ought to be directed at removing Mr. Hussein from power, Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, replied that it should not. Such a plan would require a huge commitment of American ground troops to Iraq, an unthinkable option.
"Cohen and Shelton were strong on one point: one should assume that short of the use of ground forces you cannot get rid of Saddam," said an official who took part in the discussions, referring to the Defense Secretary and the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton.
Even at this early point, Mr. Clinton was not optimistic that the standoff could be resolved without the use of force, although he shared the frustration of his team that there was no clean, effective military option.
General Shelton, a gulf war commander who had been in his new job for only six weeks, presented charts and maps to make the case that if it came to the use of force, it would be a broader use of military power than President Clinton had ever made.
A strike would have required "many more than dozens" of targets, he said. These included not only Mr. Hussein's palaces and command and control centers, but also known weapons production sites and the infrastructure supporting them: military bases, roads, power plants, industrial sites.
General Shelton also explained the potential for civilian deaths and destruction of nonmilitary property. Particularly ominous was concern that hitting a chemical or biological weapons depot could spread a toxic cloud that could kill thousands of innocent people.
 
What Five Pounds Of Anthrax Can Do
The White House decided to prepare the country for war. In a meeting of Mr. Clinton and his top aides on Nov. 14, the decision was made to begin a public campaign through interviews on the Sunday morning television news programs to inform the American people of the dangers of biological warfare.
The most vivid show-and-tell came when Mr. Cohen placed a five-pound bag of sugar on the table, proclaiming that if the sugar were anthrax, it could kill half the population of Washington.
More important, Mr. Clinton made an impassioned plea to his advisers in that Friday meeting to come up with concrete steps the United States could take to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.
Mr. Clinton was painfully aware that continuation of tough sanctions had been a crucial part of the American strategy -- albeit unstated -- to destabilize Mr. Hussein's Government. But now the sanctions were doing more to erode the international coalition that had once stood firm against the Iraqi leader.
And Mr. Clinton knew that the collapse of the Middle East efforts had robbed him of much of his clout.
Although Washington's allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf agreed that Mr. Hussein must allow the United Nations inspections to continue as before, most were opposed to using force to make it happen.
The Administration launched a diplomatic blitz, with Mr. Berger and Ms. Albright making dozens of phone calls to their counterparts in Europe and the Middle East to drive home the message that the Iraqi action was not just against American members of the inspection team, but against the United Nations and the world.
The results were mixed. After days of consultations, there was only enough support to pass a modest resolution at the United Nations on Nov. 12 limiting travel by senior Iraqi officials.
In a meeting at the White House two days later, King Hussein of Jordan told Mr. Clinton that finding a peaceful solution was particularly important because of Arab rage at the United States over the collapse of the Middle East peace process, which Arab leaders attributed to Washington's support of an intransigent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
"A military solution at this time will not help the United States," a participant in the meeting paraphrased King Hussein as saying.
Other allies, particularly Presidents Jacques Chirac of France and Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, wanted to find a formula to lift economic sanctions against Iraq eventually.
Both were said by aides to have been alarmed when Mr. Clinton seemed to toughen United States policy by saying that Mr. Hussein's actions against the United Nations inspectors insured "that the sanctions will be there until the end of time or as long as he lasts."
Mr. Clinton softened his line in telephone calls the next day.
He tried to assure the French and Russian leaders that the United States did not want the sanctions to last forever, French and Russian officials said. He also asked them to use their long-standing ties with the Iraqi leader to persuade him to readmit inspectors.
President Chirac said that there had to be some light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Hussein, that it was necessary to have some sort of carrot approach, said a senior French official. Mr. Yeltsin made the point even more strongly, arguing that "now is not the time to use force," said an official familiar with the conversation.
The Saudis, meanwhile, gave no indication that they would be willing to allow American warplanes to use bases on their soil to launch air strikes if they became necessary.
In its zeal to find a diplomatic solution, the Administration violated its own pledge not to negotiate with Mr. Hussein. To help the Russians and French in their diplomacy, the United States, working with Britain, drafted a joint position paper that offered a plan to allow Iraq to buy more goods with its oil.
American officials said they would consider a number of incentives: increasing the amount of money that Iraq could raise through oil sales, extending the agreement so it would not be subject to review every six months, and allowing Iraq to buy more goods, like spare parts and civilian vehicles.
The resolution of the crisis would probably not have happened without the intervention of one man: Mr. Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister.
 
The Man at the Heart Of the Negotiations
Mr. Primakov -- Arabist, former journalist and spy -- had never been trusted in Washington, even less so after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 when he presented the Bush Administration with what Washington considered a ludicrous proposal: to allow Mr. Hussein to keep two Kuwaiti islands and part of its main oilfield in order to prevent a war.
But Mr. Primakov had known Mr. Hussein for more than 25 years. So there he was last Tuesday, seated next to Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow, negotiating with Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, with the blessing of the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Aziz had one main concern: winding up the inspections and getting the sanctions lifted, Russian officials said.
But the Russians made the point that throwing out the inspectors or prompting a confrontation with the United Nations was the wrong way to go about getting the sanctions lifted.
Mr. Primakov and Mr. Aziz negotiated a joint Russian-Iraqi text with the same passion and precision of an arms control treaty. "Russia, for its part, will energetically promote the speedy lifting of sanctions against Iraq on the basis of its compliance with the corresponding U.N. Security Council resolutions," it said.
Mr. Primakov was so eager to get on with a long-planned trip to Latin America -- and perhaps keep the spotlight on himself -- that he threatened to meet with his counterparts from the other permanent members of the Security Council without Ms. Albright, who was in India. "Yevgeny, this isn't the way to do business," she told him. He finally compromised, summoning them to Geneva at 2 A.M. on Thursday.
Mr. Primakov announced that Iraq would allow United Nations weapons inspectors, including the Americans, to return. No strings attached. In return, he said, he had given his word that Russia would use its influence to speed up the work of the inspectors.
"Yevgeny, you must understand our red lines," Ms. Albright said, warning him that any commitments he made were only on Russia's behalf.
"I speak on behalf of no one except Russia," he assured her.
After he read his version of a draft communique, Ms. Albright insisted on changes. She demanded that the text refer to the "unconditional return" of the inspectors. She insisted that it also include a mention of Security Council Resolution 1137 because it specifically states that the inspectors can be as intrusive as they see fit.
Even after the five officials had agreed on the text and it was being typed, she demanded another condition: that any change to the work of the inspectors had to be approved by the Security Council.
On Friday, United Nations weapons inspectors returned to Baghdad. In the Persian Gulf, the United States continued its huge military buildup.
At the United Nations, the Russians began their pitch on behalf of the Iraqis. As a first step, they believe the United Nations should certify Iraqi compliance on disarmament of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, officials said.
The Russian approach already had some success, shifting the subject from Iraqi noncompliance and forcing the United States to explain how long the sanctions have to be maintained and why.
"I consider this a great success of Russian diplomacy recognized by all, absolutely, a great success of President Yeltsin first of all, who's been in the lead of everything that's been done recently," Mr. Primakov said after the Geneva meeting.
But in Washington, there was no celebration. During the inspectors' absence, Iraq may have been able to hide evidence, destroy monitoring equipment and produce new weapons or toxins.
"The President was cautious about what the implications would be," a top official said. "He can't say he even now feels this is necessarily over."
As for the eventual lifting of economic sanctions, Ms. Albright made clear on Friday that full destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was not enough. There were other resolutions to be obeyed, including one that requires Iraq not to repress its own people. That may mean sanctions indeed will stay as long as Mr. Hussein continues to be the President of Iraq. Or perhaps forever.

HEADLINE: Clinton Rejects Call By Russians to Ease Sanctions on Iraqis

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton today rejected Russia's call for an easing of sanctions on Iraq, saying Baghdad continued to impede United Nations weapons inspectors.
Mr. Clinton said he was grateful for Russia's diplomatic help in defusing the three-week crisis, which began when Iraq barred the American members of a United Nations weapons inspection team on Oct. 29. The entire team then left Iraq, raising fears of a new military confrontation between that country and the United States. 
 Today, the President said he remained wary about the willingness of Iraq's leader, President Saddam Hussein, to abide by the international arms monitoring regime and said a strict inspections program must continue.
Mr. Clinton called President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this morning, and the two leaders spoke for 40 minutes, according to White House officials. Mr. Clinton relayed his opposition to any immediate relaxation of the onerous economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
"The United States is concerned about the welfare of the people of Iraq," Mr. Clinton said in an airport statement on arrival here today for a pair of Democratic fund-raising events. "We don't want to see them suffer unnecessarily. We took the lead in putting in place a policy in the United Nations that permits us to expand humanitarian assistance there.
"But the most important thing is that those inspectors need to be back at work and they need to work without impediment," he said.
He cited a report today from the leader of the United Nations inspection team, Richard Butler, that Baghdad continues to block access to suspect sites. Mr. Butler recommended a "more robust" inspection regime.
"That is what we need to focus on," Mr. Clinton said.
He thanked Mr. Yeltsin for Moscow's role as an intermediary this week in persuading Mr. Hussein to readmit the arms inspectors "at least temporarily."
Mr. Yeltsin has argued that the inspections have demonstrated Iraqi compliance with demands to end its development of nuclear weapons and medium-range missiles to deliver them, thus justifying a partial lifting of the sanctions. He told Mr. Clinton that Iraqi progress should bring a speedier end to the sanctions, according to a White House official.
But Mr. Clinton said not enough had been done.
"Keep in mind, it is more difficult for these inspectors to do their work with regard to biological and chemical weapons than it is with regard to missile and nuclear issues under their jurisdiction," Mr. Clinton said. "And we have to do more."
He said the ultimate judgment about Iraqi compliance must be made by the technical experts of the inspection teams, not diplomats or politicians.
The inspectors reported that Iraq is near compliance on scrapping its nuclear program, but not on biological, chemical or missile programs.
"What I emphasized to President Yeltsin is we have come a long way by working together, and we have to continue to work together," Mr. Clinton said. "And the decisions about what to do with the inspections should be made based on the evidence, the facts, and the professional judgment of the inspectors. Neither the political inclinations of the United States nor of our allies should control these decisions."
A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected Mr. Hussein's appeal to exempt certain "presidential sites" in Iraq from weapons monitoring. He said the United Nations inspectors, not Baghdad, would dictate what sites come under scrutiny.
"I would just note here, when talking about presidential palaces, that Saddam Hussein has 47 presidential palaces, at least one of which is as large as the District of Columbia in land mass," the official said. "So we're not talking here about little country homes."
Mr. Clinton was in Denver on his way to the annual Pacific Rim economic summit meeting, which is being held this year in Vancouver. His planned stopovers in Denver and Seattle en route to Vancouver were to raise more than $1 million for the Democratic Party.

HEADLINE: Hotel Business Is Growing Bigger, Busier and Faster

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The American Radiator Building, the Gothic tower on 40th Street whose gold crown was once lighted to resemble a hot radiator in a tribute to the automobile age, is being recast as a hotel in the midst of an extraordinary rush by developers to meet the soaring demand for hotel rooms in New York City.
Philip Pilevsky and Brian McNally, owner of 44, the restaurant at the Royalton Hotel, have signed a $16.5 million contract to buy the landmark 1924 building at 40 West 40th Street, which overlooks Bryant Park and the New York Public Library, and plan to convert it into a luxury, 170-room boutique property called the Bryant Park Hotel. 
 In addition, an Atlanta hotelier is buying the adjoining structure for a residential hotel, for long stays, with about the same number of rooms. The company, Homestead Village, plans to retain the existing facade and add a 32-story tower behind the building, which was originally an annex to the American Radiator Building, also known as the American Standard Building.
The two deals at the American Radiator Building bring the number of hotel projects announced or begun this year to 18. Hotels are often jammed to capacity these days and the average room rate has soared 30 percent to $174.71 since 1994, so investors and hoteliers are spending more than $1 billion to add nearly 6,000 rooms to the city's inventory of roughly 60,000.
Memories of the industry's last recession seem to be lost in the rush to build on the rare development site or to convert stray warehouses and old office buildings to hotels.
"The price for existing hotels has gotten so high that it justifies the new construction and renovations that are springing up all over the city," said Jonathan Mechanic, the real estate partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, who has worked on a number of recent hotel deals. "It's fueled by a resurgence in New York City, both by business and tourism.," he said. "Rates are moving up because there's a scarcity of rooms in the city and that's why everyone's looking to do hotels."
The average occupancy rate at New York hotels will likely be about 86 percent for 1997, up from 74 percent in 1993, according to Coopers & Lybrand Lodging Research Network, meaning that during peak seasons there are few, if any, rooms available in the entire city.
The rush to build is far from over. On Tuesday, the developer Robert Gladstone and Intell Real Estate Investment are to close on a deal to build the first Planet Hollywood Hotel, a 50-story, 500-room property at Broadway and 47th Street.
Early this year, Sofitel, a French hotelier, announced plans for an $80 million, 400-room hotel on 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, while Marriott, the city's largest operator of hotels, is building a modest 244-room Courtyard Hotel on 40th Street, near Seventh Avenue, as well as a new 384-room hotel in downtown Brooklyn. Embassy Suites is building a 400-room hotel at the north end of Battery Park City in lower Manhattan.
"Even with all the hotels opening up, it still may not be enough," said Daniel H. Lesser, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield who specializes in the hotel industry.
Euphoria surrounds the current hotel market, but hoteliers, consultants and investors have overlooked the boom-and-bust nature of the business in the past. Six years ago, many hotels were left with empty rooms and heavy debts, as the recession, layoffs and the war in the Persian Gulf cut room and occupancy rates.
"Unless somebody is buying, building or renovating very judiciously, you could get banged very easily," said Bernard Goldberg of Gotham Hospitality, which owns five midmarket hotels in Manhattan.
Nine of the hotel projects announced this year involve conversions of existing buildings, which is far less expensive than new construction. Unlike the projects of the 1980's, when a number of very large hotels went up in midtown, many of the new projects are aimed at smaller niche markets.
"We're seeing some fundamental differences with the boom in the late 1980's," said Arthur Adler, lodging partner at Coopers & Lybrand in New York. "We're seeing smaller hotels and properties built in emerging parts of town, like lower Manhattan and Times Square."
The Ritz-Carlton chain plans to operate a five-star, 325-room hotel in a former office building at 17 Battery Place, at the foot of Manhattan, aimed at chief executives and wealthy tourists. The Cipriani restaurant family has similar plans for 55 Wall Street, where it announced plans for a banquet hall and 160-room luxury hotel.
In contrast, Ian Schrager, a partner of Mr. Pilevsky in the chic Royalton and Paramount hotels and now his competitor in New York and Miami Beach, recently bought the headquarters of WNET-TV, once known as the Henry Hudson Hotel, on West 58th Street for conversion to a 1,000-room hotel where rates will run about $75 a night.
Mr. Pilevsky and Mr. McNally, who no longer see eye to eye with Mr. Schrager, hope to replicate the upscale success of the Royalton and the Paramount at the American Radiator Building, which will cater to entertainment and fashion clients.
"There are so many things going on for hotels right now," Mr. Pilevsky said. "People are coming in from out of town who need to eat and stay in midtown. And this building is really spectacular."

HEADLINE: Asia Nations Limp Into Fiscal Talks As Turmoil Rages

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Since first meeting as a group in 1993, the leaders of the United States, China, Japan and other nations of the Pacific Rim have swaggered into their annual gatherings, almost arrogant in their confidence that the region would be the 21st century's economic engine and the new locus of world power.
But as they assemble here this weekend, President Clinton and his counterparts from 17 Asian and North and South American members will nearly all be limping, wounded by global economic forces beyond their control and, in Mr. Clinton's case, undercut by domestic political defeats. 
 On Friday, the financial turmoil that has been coursing through Asia claimed its largest victim, South Korea, the nation with the world's 11th-biggest economy. The Government in Seoul was forced to call on the international community for a financial bailout, a humbling step that has already been taken by Thailand and Indonesia.
The upheaval has also hit hard in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and could even dent Japan. As a result, the turmoil and how to stop it will no doubt dominate the discussions among the leaders, although they are unlikely to take any action beyond offering reassuring words about their determination to restore calm in financial markets and prosperity throughout Asia.
But the problems in Asia will have some concrete effects on American policy and on Mr. Clinton's ability to use the two-day gathering, which formally convenes Monday, to advance his own economic agenda championing free trade. The United States, particularly since Mr. Clinton became President, has based its approach to the region largely on expanding trade, a strategy embodied in a 1994 agreement with the Asia-Pacific countries to create a free-trade zone as early as 2010.
Asia's economic woes are already reducing the region's demand for American exports and are showing signs of sending the trade deficit in the United States to new highs. Consumed by their domestic economic problems, and by their associated political difficulties, few of the Asian leaders here will have much stomach for new market-opening initiatives that might bring objections at home.
Moreover, having failed this month in his all-out effort to win new trade-negotiating authority from Congress, Mr. Clinton clearly has less standing to demand that other nations take politically painful steps to drop their tariffs and other trade barriers.
And if Mr. Clinton cannot quickly convince liberal Democrats in Congress to change their position and grant him the negotiating power, his opportunity to pursue new trade deals in many product categories will be all but closed off, even if Asian trading partners are willing.
Mr. Clinton is also still smarting from Congress's rejection last week of his request for $3.5 billion in additional financing for the International Monetary Fund, the vehicle through which the bailouts of South Korea and other nations are being coordinated.
Mr. Clinton has been pressing for more I.M.F. financing all year to deal with exactly the kind of situation that has now erupted in Asia. Although Administration officials are confident that Congress will approve the financing next year, some foreign officials said the situation hurts the United States in its efforts to maintain its effective control over the terms of the international bailouts.
The mix of difficulties make this year the first real test of the annual gathering, known as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or Apec. Founded in 1989 as a way for lower-level officials of Pacific Rim countries to discuss common interests, it was elevated to the status of a regional summit meeting by Mr. Clinton starting in 1993 as part of his effort to shift the nation's sights toward the economic opportunities and security challenges presented by a rapidly growing and modernizing Asia.
The leaders "face the most critical and difficult series of issues in the history of this young institution," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics. "Their ability to respond effectively and decisively will go far toward determining whether Apec will become a central player in resolving regional and global crises."
White House officials, while acknowledging the difficulties the Administration faces here, said the gathering would still be an effective stage on which to exert global economic leadership and, in particular, to highlight the benefits of trade and the need for Mr. Clinton to be granted so-called "fast-track" trade authority by Congress. With such authority, he can negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but cannot amend.
They said the meeting was expected to give formal approval to the policies at the heart of American strategy in the region: that nations need to take responsibility for dealing with their financial problems by adopting more prudent economic policies, that the I.M.F. should take the lead when a bailout plan is necessary, and that countries should still work toward freer trade even while coping with economic difficulties.
That policy was embodied in an agreement worked out by American and Asian officials in Manila this week. The agreement effectively scuttled an idea first floated by Japan, and strongly opposed by the United States, to create a bailout fund for Asian nations that would operate outside the I.M.F., which typically requires stringent austerity programs in return for its financial assistance.
"In the past four years, obviously, with the enormous success of economies in Asia, there's been a good deal of emphasis upon what more can be done and how to take advantage of the rapidly growing economies," said Daniel Tarullo, Mr. Clinton's adviser on international economic affairs.
"Obviously, this year, with the recent turmoil in a number of East Asian financial markets, there is a different tone and different atmosphere," Mr. Tarullo said.
But he added the annual summit meeting would prove to be "a good instrument in trying times as well as good times."
American officials said that while they did not expect any big new trade deals, they were confident of winning agreement to drop trade barriers among the Pacific nations in one or two product categories ahead of the general deadline they have set of 2010 for the more developed nations.
There is also likely to be some discussion with Asian countries of their willingness to agree to a proposed World Trade Organization plan to allow banks, investment firms and other financial services providers more freedom to do business in other countries.
Mr. Clinton will also use the gathering to meet individually with leaders of several other countries, including Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan. Analysts and government officials are increasingly concerned that Japan's weak economy and the huge number of bad loans weighing down its banking system leave the country vulnerable to the spillover effects of the troubles in South Korea and Southeast Asia.
Mr. Clinton may also meet with President Jiang Zemin of China. American officials said they would like to build on the Chinese leader's release last weekend of the prominent political dissident Wei Jingsheng and to discuss Mr. Clinton's planned visit to China next year.
The leaders will also exchange ideas about how to deal with global warming in advance of an international meeting on the topic next month. And they are likely to consider inviting several new members into Apec, including Peru, Vietnam and Russia.
The current members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

Stocks Plummet in South Korea
 SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 22 (Reuters) -- Stocks plunged more than 4 percent here today in response to South Korea's decision to seek a loan from the I.M.F.
"Investors turned skeptical as they realized the I.M.F. bailout package would not be like a free lunch," said Choo Hee Yup, a broker at Dongwon Securities. The composite stock index shed 4.08 percent, or 20.64 points, to close at 485.43.
South Korea said late on Friday that it had asked the I.M.F. to provide about $20 billion in standby credits to overcome the country's financial crisis.

Scott, Rejected by Cardinals, a Stalwart for Giants

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON 

 BODY:
Lance Scott was having a really bad Monday. It was 6 A.M. last Aug. 18. The phone rang in his bedroom. "Bring in your playbook," the voice on the other end of the line said. "Coach wants to see you."
Lance Scott knew his third season as a center with the Arizona Cardinals was about to end. 
 He walked into the room of his son, Tucker, who was 5 weeks old that day. There Scott found his wife, Stacy. She had spent the night in the nursery to be near Tucker, who had been having trouble keeping any food in his stomach.
Lance told Stacy about being cut by the Cardinals. He went to work, came home unemployed and then was told Tucker would need emergency surgery to correct a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis.
It took Tucker's doctors two days to schedule the surgery. "That was hard," Scott said. "Watching your baby with an IV in his head, lying on the bed crying."
During that time, Scott's agent, Neil Schwartz, called other National Football League teams, trying to draw interest in his client.
"People told Neil, 'If he can't make the Cardinals, how's he going to make our team?' " Scott said.
On Thursday, Aug. 21, Tucker had surgery to expand a muscle in his stomach, alleviating most of his eating problems. He began a recovery that is happily on schedule three months later.
The same day, the phone at home rang for Lance. The Giants wanted him to fly to New Jersey for a tryout.
Four days later, they signed him to do the long snapping for punts and field-goal attempts.
Five weeks later, he was the starting center in the Giants' pivotal victory over the Dallas Cowboys.
Tonight against the Washington Redskins, he will make his seventh consecutive start. And as team officials have privately conceded that neither the veteran center Brian Williams, who has an eye injury, nor Williams's replacement, Derek Engler, who has a broken ankle, will return to play this season, Lance Scott is the Giants' center of the present and future.
A guy the hapless Cardinals did not want and other teams passed on is the center of the Giants' attack in a late-season playoff chase.
No Giants play tonight can begin until Scott points his right index finger at the Redskins' middle linebacker, then barks out coded blocking assignments. Even the wide receivers do not know what pass patterns they may have to run until they hear the orders from Scott.
As the Giants' offensive line coach John Matsko said: "At one of the most important positions on the field, we're playing with a guy we pulled off the street. And he's playing really well."
Scott, meanwhile, looks back across the past 14 weeks and smiles at the wonder of it all.
"My wife and I talk about it every day," he said, sitting in a room off the Giants' locker room. "It is amazing how well things all worked out."
But then, Lance Scott's Giants journey is full of coincidences and happenstance that would seem the product of destiny.
For example, do you know how Giants Coach Jim Fassel knew that Scott might be able to help his team?
He remembered Scott as the 15-year-old camper at the Jim Fassel Football Camp in 1987. Scott was a high school sophomore in Salt Lake City. Fassel was the head coach at the University of Utah.
"I remember he was a tough, aggressive player," Fassel said of Scott after practice Friday. "We recruited him at Utah."
Said Scott, "Oh, sure, I've known Coach Fassel forever."
Fassel left Utah before Scott arrived there. Scott nonetheless had an honor-filled collegiate career. When he became eligible for the N.F.L. draft in 1995, however, he was worried that a senior-year injury might keep him from being selected.
"I was thinking I'd call Coach Fassel, who was then with the Oakland Raiders," Scott said. "But I figured that would be kind of tacky."
Said Fassel, "I had kind of lost track of him."
Scott, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 300 pounds, was a fifth-round draft pick of the Cardinals. But he never played a down for Arizona, spending time on its developmental squad and on injured reserve. This year, the Cardinals cut Scott, 25, after their third exhibition game.
But Fassel had briefly re-entered the picture. In Scott's second year in Arizona, Fassel was the offensive coordinator. "I saw that he could do the long snapping even if they didn't ask him to," Fassel said. "And he learned my offensive system."
When Scott's name appeared on the waiver wire last August, Fassel knew what he wanted to do. "It could have been a permanent case of out of sight, out of mind," Fassel said. "But when I saw he was cut, I remembered that he was a tough kid even as a teen-ager. I knew we needed a long snapper, and I had confidence he would be the right fit."
Scott did the long snapping for four games. Then came Engler's broken ankle on Sept. 28, and a week later, Scott's first N.F.L. start, against the Cowboys. "My grandpa dialed up that game on his satellite dish for my family and friends in Utah," Scott said. "People were pretty excited because I hadn't played a game since college. But there I was playing in the N.F.L., just like I pictured it as a kid. And I was going against America's Team. And I played well, and we won. I've been getting calls from friends I haven't heard from for years ever since."
Said offensive tackle Scott Gragg: "That is the dream of everyone who is waiting for his shot -- you finally got your chance, you start, you play well, you start for the rest of your life. You never know how it's going to happen. You just wait and hope."
Said Matsko, "I've always believed that guys of high character who get second chances usually make the most of them."
Tucker Scott, meanwhile, is gaining weight, and, like his father, is doing well. Tucker, in fact, was on hand for a heavyweight exhibition in dining last week when Scott and Toni Gragg had all the offensive linemen over for dinner. "Yeah, we had a little steak fry," Scott Gragg said. "Well, it wasn't so little. We probably ate up the whole cow."
Lance and Stacy Scott had a good time. "It was a nice day," Lance said. "When you think of it, and we do all the time, everything has turned around pretty nice."

Pacific Rim Leaders Meet In a Humbler Mood
Pacific Rim nations gathering in Canada do not have the swagger they showed at past meetings. Instead, President Clinton and most of his counterparts will be limping, wounded by global economic forces beyond their control and, in Mr. Clinton's case, undercut by domestic political defeats. On Friday, the financial turmoil that has been coursing through Asia claimed South Korea, the world's 11th-biggest economy. 1 

U.S. Opposes Russia on Iraq
President Clinton rejected Russia's call for an easing of sanctions on Iraq, saying Baghdad continued to impede United Nations weapons inspectors. The President said he remained wary about the willingness of Iraq to abide by the international arms monitoring regime. 1
 
In the end, the crisis with Iraq did not get resolved on the battlefield but in an unusual predawn meeting after an initiative brokered by an unlikely mediator, the Russian Foreign Minister, who is a longtime friend of the Iraqis but who has never been trusted by the United States. 8
 
Uphill Task in Bosnia
Western efforts to shift power from Radovan Karadzic, the powerful former Bosnian Serb president who has been indicted on war-crimes charges, to his rival and successor, Biljana Plavsic, turn on a parliamentary vote this weekend. But support for Ms. Plavsic is waning. 10
 
Back to Vietnam, to Heal
Pete Peterson, who spent six and a half years as a prisoner in North Vietnam, is now the United States Ambassador there, in what he hopes is an act of catharsis, both personally and symbolically. 6

Reno's Loner Image Belies the Reality
The popular impression of Attorney General Janet Reno is that she is an individualist unfettered by the constraints of high office. But it fails to elucidate one of the most inscrutable, difficult and driven personalities in Washington because it does not distinguish her persona from her performance. 1
 
World of Embryo 'Adoption'
Kathy Butler, a 47-year-old New Jersey woman, is pregnant with triplets. But the babies are growing from ready-made embryos that she and her husband, Gary, selected and paid for at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. The Butlers are part of a quiet but fast-emerging new world of assisted reproduction in the United States. 1
 
A Brother's Regrets
David Kaczynski, who turned in his brother, Theodore J. Kaczynski, as the suspected Unabomber, said in an interview that he had been misled by investigators and prosecutors into believing that they saw his brother as a mentally ill man who would "be happier in jail." His brother's psychiatric condition has become the central issue at his trial on four of the string of mail bombings that began in 1978. 22
 
Texas Heroin Deaths
Plano is a modern Texas boom town, having grown from a population of under 4,000 in 1960, to 190,00. People move here to avoid urban schools and crime. But since January 1996, nine young people living or going to school in Plano, 20 miles north of Dallas, have died of heroin overdoses, and another did so at a party there. 30

Language Barriers
As the population of the United States becomes ever more diverse and the languages spoken multiply, growing numbers of hospital patients who speak no English are being isolated by language barriers. And hospitals have begun searching to find ways to communicate with them. 1
 
Tactical Retreat
For civil rights advocates, the decision by black leaders to help settle a reverse discrimination suit against a school board in Piscataway, N.J. represented a tactical retreat to avoid a larger legal catastrophe. 37
 
Detective as Executive
As part of an investigation into mob ties to New York City's garbage-hauling industry, a police detective posed as the vice president in charge of running 55 Water Street, one of the largest privately owned buildings in the nation. He did such a good job that the owners hired him as the real vice president in charge of the building. 37

The Corner
 A Year in the Life
 of an Inner-City Neighborhood.
 By David Simon and Edward Burns.
 543 pp. New York:
 Broadway Books. $27.50. 
 Your average American is far more likely to spend a weekend in Paris, Moscow or even Beijing than two days or nights in one of America's slums. Consequently, discussion of America's urban underclass is typically so statistical, ideological or otherwise abstract as to amount to little more than an educated guess: how the other half probably lives. Being there, of course, is only the first, insufficient step to understanding a place, but even many writers on issues like welfare, race, poverty or drugs have spent scant time in the ghetto and some show no evidence of having been there at all. (Why do the hard work of reporting when everyone already knows what to think?) As A. J. Liebling once put it, "When information becomes unavailable, the expert comes into his own."
Just what the experts are missing is illustrated by "The Corner," a brave, unblinkered and heartbreaking look at the residents of a few blocks of West Baltimore's ghetto from the winter of 1992 to the fall of 1993. David Simon, the author of "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets," about Baltimore's Police Department, and Edward Burns, a former police detective who appears in "Homicide," don't just parachute into the neighborhood once every two or three months. Practicing what they modestly call "stand-around-and-watch journalism," they camped out on the corner of Monroe and Fayette almost every day for more than a year.
Their title pays homage to "Tally's Corner," Elliot Liebow's 1960's study of street-corner life, but a better comparison might be to "Rosa Lee," Leon Dash's book based on his Pulitzer-Prize-winning series for The Washington Post. (For four intense years, Dash trailed Rosa Lee Cunningham, a destitute, drug-addicted mother of eight in Washington.) "The Corner" isn't as good as "Rosa Lee," but it's still so far above most reporting on the underclass as to demand attention. In one sense, Simon and Burns's subjects remain uncooperative: their lives don't hew to liberal pieties, or conservatives' often pitilessly reductive arguments, about the poor. But in every other respect, the authors engender a trust that enables them to witness the kind of private moments -- a teen-age mother with her newborn, an addict injecting heroin, an officer roughing up a suspect -- that few outsiders see. Their intimacy is earned the way all intimacy is earned -- by the amount of time they devote to their subjects. "If we, as a society, are ever to come up with viable solutions to poverty," Dash wrote, "we must agree on what the facts are, regardless of our political viewpoints." Simon and Burns's achievement is to demonstrate again just how short of such facts we are.
There is a moment in "Homicide" where Simon acknowledges the almost inescapable perspective of his middle-class readers. The police have descended on a gutted West Baltimore row house, without electricity or running water, that is home to some two dozen glue sniffers, heroin addicts and prostitutes. Stacks of soiled diapers, discarded clothes, plates of weeks-old food and pans filled with urine litter almost every room of the roach-infested house. The stench is oppressive. The detectives' disdain for the residents has nothing to do with their poverty or potential criminality, Simon writes, but derives from an unspoken "standard," which says that "even in the worst American slum, there are recognizable depths beyond which no one should ever have to fall." Armed with such details and a tidy moral, most other reporters would have retired for the night. But Simon sticks around. After painstakingly searching the house, the police begin hauling suspects to the precinct. A child asks an officer if he can get something from his room before they go. It's well after midnight. "What is it you need?" a detective asks. "My homework," the kid replies. The cop is incredulous. But sure enough, the boy trundles upstairs and pulls a third-grade reader and workbook from the rubble. Suddenly, the moral is more complicated.
"The Corner," in essence, is the book-length version of such moments. Told from the point of view of the drug addicts and ordinary poor folk who populate West Baltimore, it explodes stereotypes of the ghetto poor and dispels some of the myths that even many of its residents hold dear. Tyreeka, 14 years old, gets pregnant not to obtain a government handout but in a desperate bid to keep a straying boyfriend. DeAndre, a young drug dealer, doesn't find fast-food work demeaning; it's part of a workaday world he scarcely comprehends. When he lands a job at Wendy's, he's so proud that he parades his new uniform in front of his mother and girlfriend. On the eve of quitting heroin, and the neighborhood, an addict named Mike waits to kill a dealer who's dissed him; the dealer doesn't show. Chance, as much as resolve, assures Mike's escape. Ella Fitzgerald, a saintly woman who runs the local community center, struggles to retain the double vision required of all corner residents: "DeAndre and R. C. and Tae are not drug dealers; they are her children . . . their possibilities still before them. And Smitty and Gale aren't beleaguered addicts; they're neighbors. And Ricky Cunningham," who volunteers at the center, "wasn't creeping past the high-rises, where he went to cop vials . . . he was a bystander caught up in someone else's evil."
The book's real protagonist, however, is the corner itself -- a menacing, malign presence that rules the neighborhood with ruthless logic. All its laws, the authors contend, derive from two axioms: "get the blast," or high, and "never say never." It is a code that allows for "a fiend's theft of the television set from the recreation center, of chalices from the corner churches, of the rent from his mother's bedroom." Addiction's toll on the neighborhood is often startlingly concrete. The United Iron and Metal Works, a local company, essentially underwrites the dismantling of the neighborhood by paying cash, no questions asked, for scrap metal -- copper piping, aluminum roofing, rain spouts, steel boilerplates, refrigerators, even cars -- most of it pried or stolen from the surrounding blocks. And like an abusive spouse, the corner isolates its victims. Several residents express their belief that if they stray even a few blocks from the corner, they will be lynched by the Klan. Few, however, have much direct interaction with whites; their fear is at least in part a product of their extraordinary remove from mainstream American life.
Although the drug trade drives the community's economy, most of the people who live here, of course, are not addicts. And at the heart of the book is three generations of the McCullough family: William and Roberta, a working-class couple, married some 50 years, who have lived near the corner all their lives; their 15 children, many of whom have escaped to middle-class suburban lives, and one of them in particular, Gary, a heroin addict who lives in the neighborhood's abandoned row houses; and DeAndre, Gary's son, a once promising student who, at 15, is a penny ante drug dealer and all but a junior-high dropout. By every conservative or liberal light, Gary should have lived the American dream. Raised in a loving family, he held two union jobs, managed a lucrative investment portfolio, owned a Mercedes and his own home. But "the corner," the authors write, "best serves the hard core." Gary slips, almost inexorably, into heroin addiction. (He dies of an overdose in 1996.) Still, his humanity remains intact: he reads Thoreau, takes time out to see "Schindler's List," which he finds deeply affecting, and even secures occasional employment -- working so hard at the local crab house that he's regarded as the "John Henry" of crabs. But it was Gary, the authors observe, who taught his family "to fear their neighborhood the way it ought to be feared." Many people assume that we understand the ghetto's problems, if not always the solutions to them, when the opposite is as often true. The McCullough children who escape do so, in large part, through well-worn paths: the public schools, community colleges, the civil service, affirmative action, the Army. The reasons for Gary's fall, however, remain stubbornly elusive.
Despite the obvious virtues of "The Corner," it remains, finally, a deeply frustrating work. The authors have a fine ear for dialogue, but the book is much too long, mired in detail and filled with policy analysis delivered in a cursing street patois that seems wrongheaded where it's not embarrassing. Still, Simon and Burns display an almost religious regard for individual human lives; it is a respect backed up not by cheap sentiment or easy moralizing but by the dangerous, backbreaking labor of intrepid reporting. They do not always condone their subjects' choices; sympathy is not the same as support. But they prove, as Auden once wrote, "that the first criterion of success in any human activity, the necessary preliminary, whether to scientific discovery or to artistic vision, is intensity of attention or, less pompously, love."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficits Won't Ruin Us

BYLINE: By Laura D'Andrea Tyson; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor of economics and business at the University of California at Berkeley, was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council in the first Clinton Administration.

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
There is widespread agreement that the American economy has been performing far better than expected in the last year. Growth has been stronger than predicted, inflation has been weaker, and the unemployment rate has hit lows that most economists doubted they would ever see again. Moreover, popular measures of the economy's performance -- for example, the growth of gross domestic product and changes in the consumer price index -- almost certainly understate just how well the economy has done.
But one popular and politically charged economic indicator is getting worse: the nation's trade imbalance. The September trade deficit in goods and service jumped to $11.1 billion, its highest reading since January. Based on results so far, the 1997 deficit will reach an all-time high, and China is poised to emerge as our No. 1 trade headache. 
 This growing trade imbalance has become a rallying cry for a diverse collection of opponents of globalization, a group drawn from the labor, environmental, human rights and religious organizations. And concern over the trade deficit has produced a disturbing paradox: even as our economy enjoys its soundest expansion in 30 years, political support for trade liberalization has ebbed to a dangerous low, as reflected in Congress's recent failure to pass "fast track" negotiating authority for the President. This trend threatens our leadership of the global economic system.
Before we embark on a self-defeating path of isolationism in a vain attempt to reduce the imbalance, we should at least recognize its many flaws as a gauge of economic health.
First, the absolute size of the trade deficit measured in dollars is irrelevant. A preferable measure is the size of the deficit compared with the overall size of the economy.
Measured in dollars, the 1997 trade deficit promises to be the largest in the nation's history, but that is also true for all of the other aggregate measures of the economy -- gross domestic product, consumption, profits, investment and labor incomes. The American economy is simply getting bigger over time -- isn't that supposed to be good news? -- and relative to the size of the economy, the trade deficit has actually declined sharply from its 1987 peak. In 1997, it stands at just less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, hardly a sign of economic duress, whether the barometer is our own economic history or that of other trading nations.
Second, in a world in which modern technologies are breaking down national borders, the trade deficit, which purports to tally exchanges between independent nation states, is an increasingly archaic concept. What is the significance of the United States trade deficit when nearly 40 percent of American imports represent intra-company transactions by American multinational corporations?
If the health of the American economy is tied to the health of its multinational producers -- if, in fact, "they are us" to a significant extent, as their large shares of the nation's capital stock, exports, sales and employment suggest -- then their imports should not be interpreted as a sign of our weakness.
The globalization of production has also blurred the meaning of our trade deficits with individual trading partners. Sure, our trade deficit with China has skyrocketed in recent years, but this trend has been largely offset by a decrease in our trade deficits with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. We're continuing to import labor-intensive products like toys, shoes and apparel from Asia, but the same multinational companies that once produced in the Asian tiger nations have moved their factories to China in search of lower labor costs.
If we blocked imports of such goods from China to reduce our bilateral trade imbalance there, production would not move back to the United States. The companies involved would seek low-cost locations elsewhere in the world.
And, lest we be tempted to do something foolish to contain our trade deficit with China, we should also recognize that our official numbers overstate the actual amount by as much as 25 percent because we can't -- or don't -- adequately distinguish between our trade with Hong Kong and our trade with China that is routed through Hong Kong.
Third, the composition of trade matters to the nation's prosperity. Our living standards depend on our ability to compete in high-wage, high-productivity industries, and the trade deficit masks our strengthening position in them.
The trade gap may be substantially larger today than it was during the 1980's, but so are our net exports of high-technology and capital goods. We may be importing more of our tomatoes from Mexico and our toys from China, at the expense of low-wage jobs, but we are also exporting more automobiles and jet aircraft, to the benefit of high-wage jobs.
Finally -- and most important -- there is no simple link between a nation's net trade position and its overall economic health. During the last four years, the United States has run a trade deficit of about 1.4 percent of its domestic product, while Japan has run a trade surplus of about 2.8 percent of its domestic product. The United States has been enjoying its strongest expansion in 30 years, while Japan has been suffering from the lingering effects of its deepest recession since the end of World War II.
Economic strength in the United States has been reflected in both the enhanced competitiveness of American exports and stronger import demand, while economic stagnation in Japan has had the opposite effects. There is no debate about which country has done better -- it is the one with the growing trade deficit.
Next year, our trade deficit with Japan and the rest of Asia will balloon -- not because of American economic weakness but because of painful slowdowns and currency devaluations in Asia triggered by recent convulsions in financial markets. That will mean slower growth for American exports and an increase in our imports as prices of Asian products fall. That is why it is in the interest of the United States to support International Monetary Fund programs to get the Asian economies back on track.
All this does not mean that there are no real trade challenges confronting the United States. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders, many of them in countries with government and business practices that impede American companies from competing for their sales. The playing field of the global marketplace is not level -- access to the American market is far more open than access to almost any other market in the world.
Our major trade challenge is to break down barriers to international trade, and that requires tough, often prolonged negotiations. Unfortunately, the ability of the United States to conduct such negotiations has been curtailed by Congress's failure to grant fast-track authority to President Clinton.
As Emily Dickinson noted more than 100 years ago, sometimes belief without evidence is dangerous: "Faith is a fine invention for gentlemen who see, but microscopes are prudent in an emergency." We must interpret the trade deficit with the help of a powerful analytic microscope, or we will undermine our economy's health by misguided isolationism.

HEADLINE: A Wedding Of Theater And Social Issues

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Anna Deavere Smith, the playwright and performer who invented her own form of theater and has used it to explore matters like race and class, will head a new summer institute at Harvard University devoted to finding ways in which the arts might enhance the public discussion of social issues.
The institute, to be announced by Harvard today and to be financed initially by a $1.5 million Ford Foundation grant, is intended to serve as a kind of laboratory where professional artists in theater, dance, film and other fields will come together for six weeks each summer to develop new work. 
 Organized with the help of Henry Louis Gates Jr., the scholar and critic, the institute will also bring in academics, journalists and community leaders, not only to serve as sources of information and ideas but also to help investigate ways of engaging the interest of a broad and diverse audience. As many as four "master artists," with 40 "collaborating artists," are expected to spend their days working independently, then to meet over dinner for seminars and workshops with professors, civic leaders and others.
The institute is likely to resemble a hybrid between an artists' colony and a think tank, with some of the attributes of places like the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire or the Eugene O'Neill Center in Connecticut. But its mission will be to encourage artists and work that might take the lead in initiating public discussion.
"In my own performances, I was always grateful to get a standing ovation," said Ms. Smith. "But what if instead they jumped to their feet and said, 'What can we do?' That's the beginning of a different kind of democracy. And that's what I would like the goal of this institute to be."
The undertaking comes at a time when many people believe that economic and political forces have conspired to trivialize or marginalize the arts, and that theater, in particular, no longer plays the role it once did in bringing people together to confront problems.
Ms. Smith said she hoped to increase the contact between artists and others, to make "the tower less ivory" and to create an atmosphere in which audiences approach art with the same readiness with which people approach a public discussion, feeling they have something to say.
"There has been a lot of talk about this kind of work," said Robert J. Orchard, managing director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., which will help administer the institute. "Can artists change society? What is the relationship of the artist to ideas? What are the responsibilities of institutions in connecting to different communities?
"All these are very important questions and a lot of good thinking and a reasonable amount of talk has gone into it. But this interests me, because we're going to be able to try it."
The idea for the institute arose out of a series of conversations initiated since 1992 by Ms. Smith, 47, who is also a professor at Stanford University. She has been trying, she said, "to use the ambiance and techniques of the theater to inspire discussion about the events of our time."
In her 1991 one-woman show, "Fires in the Mirror," she played 27 people she had interviewed about the racial violence between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that year. In "Twilight: Los Angeles 1992," her 1994 production, she took a similar approach to the Los Angeles riots. Her current production, "House Arrest," investigating the American national identity as it has been embodied in the Presidency, opened on Thursday at the Arena Stage in Washington.
Ms. Smith's conversations over the last few years included officers of the Ford Foundation, which had underwritten the videotaping of "Fires in the Mirror" for public television; it had become interested in the idea of encouraging other artists to undertake similar work.
Last spring, while Ms. Smith was its first artist in residence, the foundation solicited proposals from institutions to set up an institute. They were looking for a forum where artists could work at using the arts to explore questions like identity, community and the relations among social groups. Harvard seemed to offer an excellent theater laboratory through its ties with the American Repertory Theater, links to the world of public policy through the John F. Kennedy School of Government "and an academic setting with a deep commitment to issues of race and gender," said Alison Bernstein, a vice president of the foundation.
Harvard also made the case that the Boston area would make a suitable setting, since it is large enough to have a complex array of urban communities and issues but small enough that any work developed at the institute and given public exposure might resonate deeply.
The three-year grant will be administered jointly by the theater, which operates out of the Harvard-owned Loeb Drama Center and offers theater courses, and by Harvard's W. E. B. DuBois Institute for Afro-American Research, of which Dr. Gates is the director. Ms. Smith called him "a perfect partner, because he's a master at creating conversations."
The financing plan for the new Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue will also include another $1 million that the theater and the institute intend to raise. The institute will begin accepting applications next month for the summer's projects, and plans to focus on theater, dance, music, film, video and fine arts.
Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater, described Ms. Smith as nonideological. "She doesn't impose her conclusions on the audience," he said. "That's what I think makes for great drama. What was it that Chekhov said? It's not my job to solve the problems, it's my job to present them correctly."

HEADLINE: Talking Stage

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Trying to reshape a dry monthly Government report on wholesale prices into an interesting radio news piece, David Brancaccio took a production crew into the gritty streets of Los Angeles.
With the roar of traffic as a backdrop, Mr. Brancaccio went no farther than a parking lot outside a windowless studio. He called out, as if to a passers-by, "Any sign of inflation over there?" 
 "No. Not a trace," a crew member answered.
"What about over there? Any sign of inflation?" Mr. Brancaccio repeated.
"Nope. Not here."
Undaunted, he tried again. "What about over there? Any inflation?" "Umm, maybe . . . Well, no," another answered.
Listeners have come to expect such snippets -- salted with dashes of creativity, mockery and detachment -- from "Marketplace," a half-hour business magazine that is one of public radio's fastest-growing programs. Now an independent production of the University of Southern California, the program was started by Public Radio International, the No. 2 distributor of public radio programs.
"Marketplace" is now as much a programming cornerstone to many of the nation's 1,200 public radio stations as the much better-known drive-time shows, "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered," the flagship broadcasts of National Public Radio, the largest distributor of public radio programs.
The programming troika was singled out as the most responsible for bringing in listeners, donors and corporate underwriters to public radio in a recent study, which helps explain why the two programming rivals began merger talks last month. A decision is pending.
Fresh, innovative programs from Public Radio International -- like "Marketplace," Ira Glass's "This American Life" and the BBC co-production "The World" -- have sharpened the distinctions between the two competitors in recent years.
"We aren't locked into a couple of big news programs, which have sucked up a lot of resources," said Stephen Salyer, Public Radio International's president. "We worry that our audience will gradually gray if we don't push the boundaries."
Public Radio International, or PRI, began as American Public Radio in 1981 and was known as the "prairie network" for its first offering, Garrison Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion." Its founding members were five public radio stations, led by Minnesota Public Radio, with ambitions to distribute their local shows nationally. Renamed in 1994, the distributor has grown with help from the federally financed Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Public radio has doubled its audience over the last decade by successfully exploiting niches in news, foreign affairs and culture largely abandoned by commercial stations. It is a coveted audience, affluent and educated. At the same time but on the opposite end of the radio dial, commercial radio stations were consolidating into national broadcasting companies as ownership rules have been relaxed.
Public stations, too, have come under pressure to consolidate. They were threatened by a proposed cutoff in Federal money for public broadcasting by Congress in 1994. About 3 percent of National Public Radio's budget is from Federal funds; PRI's is 4 percent.
With that scare as a backdrop, the two rivals began considering a merger as a means to solve looming threats to their business. Besides financial constraints, technology is expected to affect radio listening as the Internet allows radio-on-demand, Mr. Salyer said. "The real competition may not be between NPR and PRI, but others," he said.
Delano Lewis, president of NPR, agreed. "It's where audio fits in a competitive world," he said. "I've got to figure out where I fit." He noted that NPR was discussing a possible deal to provide information for America Online Inc.
A merger would require a two-thirds majority vote of NPR's 600 member stations and approval by PRI's 10-member board. The potential benefits are still being explored and any vote is a long way off, Mr. Lewis said.
Robert Unmacht -- publisher of the M Street Journal, a broadcasting trade publication -- said that most stations would rather have the two programming distributors competing because it gives them more choice and generates price pressure.
Skeptics say a merger is unlikely because of the potential culture clash between PRI's entrepreneurism and NPR's centralization.
PRI has an $18.5 million budget and has 46 employees. Its 591 members pay fees for 400 hours of programming weekly, most of it created by local stations. The distributor pays the producer a licensing fee, based on the number of stations that carry the show, and solicits corporate underwriters, public radio's equivalent of advertising. Stations pay for programs based on the size of their market.
By comparison, NPR operates on a $63 million budget, has 580 employees and has 635 members. Its two self-produced trademark shows consume 40 percent of NPR's budget.
NPR's news programs attract 27 percent of public radio's listening audience, compared with PRI's 10 percent for all of its programming, said David Giovannoni, an audience researcher in Derwood, Md.; local programming accounts for the rest of the audiences. "Marketplace," carried by 215 stations and heard by three million people a week, draws 1 percent of the public radio audience but 4 percent of corporate underwriting money.
That gives "Marketplace" the highest underwriting income in public radio, based on cents per listener hour, he said.
In a commercial talk radio, on average six minutes of each half-hour are sold to advertisers. By comparison, "Marketplace" inserts the credits of its corporate sponsors, which support the show's production, within its 28.5 minutes of content, leaving 90 seconds for local sponsors. The show's content is so appealing to businesses that some stations, like KPBS-FM in San Diego, run the program three times a day. "The revenue we bring in at 3 and 6 more than covers the cost of the program. The 7:30 broadcast is free," said Bruce Bauer, development director of the station.
The $4 million "Marketplace" budget is one-third underwritten by corporate sponsors like the General Electric Company and the A. G. Edwards brokerage firm, said James B. Russell, the general manager of USC Radio/Marketplace Productions and the first executive producer of "All Things Considered." The rest is from station payments, foundations and in-kind services, he said.
"We like the audience," said James R. Harman, G.E.'s corporate advertising manager. "This subject attracts corporate decision-makers."
Mr. Brancaccio, the show's 36-year-old host, said "Marketplace" appealed to a younger audience by avoiding what he described as the "earnestness" of NPR and offering his own brand of cheeky storytelling and explanatory journalism.
The show's crew also produces short morning and hourly news updates. Texture comes from 11 bureaus and commentaries from traditional sources, like Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary, and the less traditional, like welfare mothers.
Mr. Russell says "Marketplace" owes its success to being far from New York, the nation's traditional business center. That plan initially was scorned as "Business News from the Hot Tub." Now, Mr. Russell is proud of the sobriquet, while striving to give the program wit and substance. "In L.A., you're free to think a little bit differently," he said.
Mr. Brancaccio agreed. "The goal just isn't to make an audience of three million into four," he said. "It's to reflect ideas that aren't commercially driven."

HEADLINE: Clinton Expresses Optimism on Asia's Economic Future as Pacific Rim Meeting Opens

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton used a gathering of Pacific Rim leaders here to reassure the world today that the current financial turmoil in Asia is temporary and that leaders were acting aggressively to stem it.
The President also said that the United States would exercise its economic muscle to promote sound economic policies in the region and to pry open global markets for a range of goods and services. 
 Mr. Clinton, appearing at a news conference with Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, said that despite the sharp strains being suffered by a number of Asian countries, the overall economic future of the region remained promising.
"I think this is a time for confidence in the future of Asia and confidence in the future of our relationship with them," Mr. Clinton said. "We have a few little glitches in the road here; we're working through them."
Those "glitches" include South Korea's call last week for a huge loan from the International Monetary Fund to stem a spiraling financial crisis, as well as earlier bailouts for Thailand and Indonesia. Currencies in the region have plummeted and markets around the world have gyrated in recent weeks as investors worried that the Asian contagion might spread.
As if to signal that he felt that the Asian financial problems could be contained without a large-scale economic meltdown, Mr. Clinton spent the afternoon today playing golf with Mr. Chretien and Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of Singapore.
In what is likely to be the most concrete outcome of the three-day economic conference of Pacific Rim nations, the President also hailed new, American-backed market-opening initiatives as evidence that Asian nations remain willing to work with the United States to liberalize trade.
Mr. Clinton passed up a chance to use the trade proposals -- potentially covering $1.5 trillion in trade in items from toys to medical devices -- to renew his call for new negotiating authority known as "fast track."
His aides said that Mr. Clinton cannot hope to achieve the tariff reductions outlined here unless Congress grants the President the new trade-negotiating authority that it withheld from him earlier this month. Fast-track authority would allow the President to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could approve or reject, but not amend.
But these aides said the potential deals outlined here would show recalcitrant Democrats in the House of Representatives how much the United States has to gain from pushing other nations to drop trade barriers.
The trade initiative is "the best possible argument to the United States Congress as to why we have to stay engaged," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman.
Trade ministers from the 18 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or Apec, agreed late on Saturday to work to phase out tariffs on nine categories of products and services within two years, and to persuade the European Union and other major trading partners to go along as well.
The largest categories, from an American perspective, are chemicals, which accounted for $61.8 billion in exports from the United States last year; energy-related goods and services, which had exports of $51.6 billion; and medical equipment, which accounted for $20 billion in exports.
The ministers also agreed to work in coming years to reduce tariffs on other types of goods and services, although they did not immediately set a timetable for action. The categories include rubber, food, fertilizers, cars and civil aircraft.
American officials had been concerned that Asian nations would be unwilling to take steps to open their markets and expose their troubled economies to more competition.
But officials said that at a meeting of trade officials on Friday, representatives of Thailand made a strong plea to other Asian countries to agree to more free trade as a way of reassuring investors that they were committed to economic reform. That plea, they said, helped bring along nations that might otherwise have been reluctant to commit themselves to further trade deals.
Still, it remains unclear whether either the United States or the other nations here will be able to follow through and reach final agreements. In nearly all of the biggest product categories discussed here, the Administration would need fast-track authority to complete a deal, and despite the optimism expressed here by Administration officials, there is no assurance that the White House will have the votes it needs in Congress.
Moreover, some nations, including Japan, said they would not go along with the tariff reductions in all categories. And any further economic problems in the region could lead governments to postpone or reconsider their trade commitments.
In a matter unrelated to the conference's agenda, Mr. Chretien today again lobbied Mr. Clinton to join a global treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. Canada has been a leader in calling for the abolition of the weapons but the United States has resisted, saying it needs mines to protect its troops along the border between North and South Korea.
Mr. Clinton noted that the United States was rapidly destroying obsolete mines and those intended solely to kill people, rather than to slow the advance of tanks and artillery.
However, he said, "My first responsibility, since I may have to send our troops into conflict situations on behalf of a lot of the nations that have signed on to this treaty, is to make sure that if I do that I can protect them. Now, that is my position."
Mr. Chretien vowed goodnaturedly to "keep the pressure, gentle pressure, on the President."
Mr. Clinton said that while global warming is not on the list of formal Apec topics, he would take the occasion to offer reassurance to developing nations that the industrial world would not seek to cripple their growth by imposing harsh limits on emissions of greenhouse gases.

HEADLINE: Jorge Mas Canosa, 58, Dies; Exile Who Led Movement Against Castro

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Jorge Mas Canosa, who came to the United States as a penniless refugee from the dictatorship of Fidel Castro and built the Cuban-American National Foundation into one of Washington's most effective lobbying groups, died here this afternoon at home. He was 58.
Mr. Mas died of lung cancer, officials of the foundation said at a news conference this evening. But they also mentioned pleurisy and renal failure as causes of death and said he had also been suffering from Paget's disease, which causes the bones to degenerate. 
 From the moment he arrived in Miami in 1960, Mr. Mas dedicated himself to seeking the overthrow of Mr. Castro, first as a conspirator in various armed plots and then, for the last two decades, in the halls of Congress. His organization became a familiar presence on Capitol Hill and over the years earned a reputation as single-minded in purpose and generous in its donations to officeholders willing to endorse its objectives.
For more than a decade, three American Presidents have sought his advice on Cuban affairs to such an extent that many critics of Mr. Mas considered him the principal architect of an American policy they regarded as excessively rigid. Every significant piece of legislation on Cuba since 1980 has borne his imprint, from the establishment of Radio and TV Marti to last year's Helms-Burton Act tightening the economic embargo of Cuba.
At a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner in Miami in 1992, President George Bush declared, "I salute Jorge Mas." He called Mr. Mas the living embodiment of the success of Cuban immigrants in the United States. By then, Mr. Mas had already become a millionaire many times over in the communications and construction businesses.
To advance his cause, Mr. Mas also traveled extensively around the world, trying to form alliances with anyone he thought useful in the struggle against Mr. Castro. He was an early patron of Boris Yeltsin, energetically supported the Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi and encouraged Latin American leaders like Carlos Menem of Argentina to speak out against Mr. Castro.
But his many detractors in the United States and abroad saw in Mr. Mas the same dictatorial streak, relish for power and intolerance of opposing views that characterized Mr. Castro's rule. Over the airwaves of Spanish-language radio stations in Miami and in letters to the editor and public debates, Mr. Mas repeatedly questioned the patriotism of those who disagreed with him and threatened, in some cases, to ruin their lives or careers.
His death leaves a power vacuum among Cuban exile groups in Miami and will surely be greeted with relief, if not outright glee, in Havana, where the state-controlled news media for years have regularly reviled him as the main leader of "the counterrevolutionary Miami mafia." Mr. Mas had neither named nor groomed a successor and held the many fractious currents of the exile world together largely through force of personality and tenacity.
Foundation officials today named Alberto Hernandez, a physician who is the organization's vice chairman, as Mr. Mas's temporary successor. They said a permanent replacement would be elected at their group's congress next July.
Jorge Mas Canosa was born in Santiago, Cuba, on Sept. 21, 1939, the third of six children of a veterinarian in the Cuban Army. In some respects, his upbringing was much like that of his future enemy, Fidel Castro, who was 13 years older: Both had stern fathers, both were initially educated at private schools in Cuba's second-largest city, and both would later be remembered by their former classmates as fiery orators and aggressive, natural-born leaders.
During Mr. Castro's guerrilla struggle against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in the mid-1950's, Mr. Mas was sent by his father to the United States to study at a college in North Carolina. He returned home in January 1959, just days after Mr. Castro seized power, plunged into student politics, soon got in trouble with the new authorities and in mid-1960 returned to the United States, this time for good.
He quickly joined the exile force being trained by the Central Intelligence Agency for the Bay of Pigs invasion but ended up being put aboard a vessel that was kept offshore during that April 1961 debacle. A brief stint in the United States Army followed, ending with Mr. Mas leaving after it became clear the Kennedy Administration had no further plans to invade Cuba.
Back in Miami, Mr. Mas held a succession of blue-collar jobs, working as a milkman, stevedore and shoe salesman while devoting his free time to the anti-Castro movement. According to his associates of that time, he helped raise money, obtain weapons and scout possible sites in the Caribbean and Central America from which Cuba could be attacked or invaded.
By 1971, Mr. Mas had, with the aid of a $50,000 loan and recommendations from fellow exiles, acquired a small company, Iglesias y Torres, that did work for the telephone company in Puerto Rico. He renamed the business Church & Tower and within a year had won contracts to lay cable and install telephone poles for Southern Bell in Florida.
Over the years, Church & Tower became the foundation of a telecommunications empire that transformed Mr. Mas into one of the wealthiest Hispanic businessmen in the United States, with a net worth of more than $100 million at the time of his death. The family business, now called Mastec, today has interests in the United States and in telephone companies and other ventures throughout Latin America and in Spain.
But even as he was building his fortune, Mr. Mas remained active in exile politics in Miami. He abandoned his advocacy of armed struggle, arguing that ill-organized invasions of Cuba and acts of violence in the United States damaged the cause more than they helped, and he urged exiles to shift their attention to Washington and focus their efforts on using American foreign policy to cripple Mr. Castro.
After Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, Mr. Mas became an American citizen and, at the suggestion of the new President's staff, founded the Cuban-American National Foundation. The organization, which today has 50,000 members, soon made its influence felt in Washington, funneling generous campaign donations to Republicans and Democrats alike and pushing for one bill after another to intensify the diplomatic and economic isolation of Cuba.
One of Mr. Mas's early triumphs was the establishment of Radio Marti, an American Government station intended to provide an alternative source of news for Cuba's 11 million people. By the end of the 1980's, that service had expanded into television, and Mr. Mas had been named chairman of the advisory board of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which oversees both stations.
Mr. Mas's critics, as well as several former Radio and TV Marti employees who had clashed with him, maintained he used the broadcasts to advance what they described as his ambitions to succeed Mr. Castro as president of Cuba. But each year Congress brushed off those criticisms, and to date has spent more than $250 million on programming for the stations.
In 1992, Mr. Mas was instrumental in passing legislation that tightened the economic embargo against Cuba in all areas except telephone communications. That triumph was followed four years later by the Helms-Burton Act, which embroiled the Clinton Administration in a complicated dispute with some of its closest allies and trading partners by allowing Cuban-Americans to sue foreign companies investing in or using expropriated properties in Cuba.
All the while, Mr. Mas's influence in Miami and Dade County politics was also growing. He and other leaders of the foundation gave generously to candidates for municipal and county office.
Mr. Mas also became known for personal feuds and lawsuits that were numerous and colorful. In one celebrated instance, he challenged Joe Carollo, who just last week lost his re-election bid as Mayor of Miami, to a duel, saying, "Your bullying has ended because you have encountered a man with a capital M."
Given a choice of guns or swords, Mr. Carollo defused the situation by suggesting water pistols be used. But he continued to criticize Mr. Mas and the Foundation, once calling them "a little clique of millionaires who have made a very profitable business of combating Communism."
In another instance, Mr. Mas lost a libel suit brought by an estranged younger brother, who testified that Church & Tower had won several of its contracts by dispensing bribes. But perhaps his longest-running dispute was with The Miami Herald, which he accused of harboring Cuban spies on its reporting staff and of encouraging "hate, disinformation and reckless disregard" of the Cuban exile community.
That feud reached a peak in 1992 when Mr. Mas and his supporters paid for advertisements on city buses that proclaimed, "I don't believe The Miami Herald" and organized a boycott of the newspaper that lasted for several months. At the peak of the dispute, some of the newspaper's vending machines were filled with excrement, and death threats were made to some of its employees, actions that Mr. Mas disavowed.
The apogee of his influence probably came in the summer of 1994, when President Clinton invited Mr. Mas to the White House to discuss how to stem the flow of refugees then coming across the Florida Straits in rafts and adopted several of his recommendations. Mr. Mas continued his efforts into the Clinton Administration's second term, but the pace of his activities slowed as his health gradually worsened.
Mr. Mas is survived by his wife, Irma, and three sons, Jorge Jr., who has for several years run the family business, Juan Carlos, a lawyer, and Jose Ramon.

HEADLINE: Cuban-Americans Promise to Carry On Leader's Efforts

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Jorge Mas Canosa, the Cuban-American businessman and political stalwart who died today, was mourned as an irreplaceable figure in the fight for the democratization of Cuba, but officials of his Cuban-American National Foundation vowed to double their efforts to accomplish his goals.
"For those concerned about the future of the Cuban-American National Foundation, don't be concerned," a teary-eyed Francisco J. Hernandez, the foundation's president, said at a news conference. "This institution counts on men and women who were close to Jorge Mas Canosa from the beginning and were nurtured by his thoughts and his bravery," he said. 
 But the death of Mr. Mas is a significant blow to the hard-line majority in the exile leadership, in no small part because it is a strong reminder that Fidel Castro is still in power in Cuba after 38 years, outliving many of his opponents.
Mr. Mas, in fact, was among the youngest in the old guard of conservative anti-Castro leaders, and certainly much younger than Mr. Castro, 71, and his brother Raul, 66, the revolutionary leader's anointed successor.
The death of Mr. Mas, who assembled a political and economic empire in exile, also leaves Cuba without a favorite target of blame for the island's difficulties. Most recently, the Government in Havana had blamed Mr. Mas's Cuban-American National Foundation for a string of bomb explosions in Havana's hotels and other tourist spots.
Foundation leaders said that Alberto Hernandez, the vice chairman and a member of the organization for 15 years, would take over the chairmanship until elections take place in July.
Allies in the Cuban exile cause, like Senator Robert Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, predicted a difficult transition but said that Mr. Mas had left a more united, organized and powerful exile community than when the foundation was formed in 1981, including like-minded Cuban-Americans as members of Congress.
"If Fidel Castro takes some comfort in the passing of Jorge Mas Canosa, he's very mistaken," Senator Torricelli said. "At some point the movement for Cuban freedom became larger than the man and is now irreversible."
In a statement released by the White House tonight, President Clinton said: "Jorge was a born leader and organizer whose tenacity, strength of conviction and passion I greatly admired. He galvanized his community, his adopted country and people around the world for the cause of freedom and democracy in Cuba."
Although Mr. Mas's son, Jorge Mas Jr., 34, has taken over the family's telecommunications business, it is less clear who will succeed him in the political arena. Polls have shown that the elder Mr. Mas's public approval rating, particularly among older Cuban-Americans, was unparalleled, as was the combination of his vast economic resources with political power.
Max Castro, a sociologist with the University of Miami's North-South Center and a critic of Mr. Mas, said, "He was able to create an organization that was the only Cuban-American organization to insert itself into the structure of American political power."
"I have to recognize that he was effective," he continued. "The problem was how that power was exercised, and in my view the policies he pursued were not effective in bringing democracy to Cuba and aggravated the suffering of the Cuban people."
Experts on Cuban-American affairs say that Cuban-American elected officials like Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican member of Congress from Miami, are likely to increase their roles as spokesmen. Political moderates, too, may find an opening to assume greater influence in advocating a more conciliatory stance toward Cuba.
One of these moderate leaders, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, founder of the exile group Cambio Cubano, or Cuban Change, today called Mr. Mas "a dynamic leader and organizer of proven intelligence" that he would have liked to debate "in a politically civilized climate" he said Miami lacked. In a written statement, he called for Cubans to restore the tolerance "that would allow us to disagree without hate."

HEADLINE: The Mayor and the River

 BODY:
Historically, New York City has done a poor job of opening up its extensive waterfront to its citizens. So when an opportunity comes along to improve the city's marine environment, New York's political leaders are duty-bound to seize it.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is in danger of letting just such an opportunity slip away. It lies in a grand plan to rescue the tawdry Hudson River waterfront from 59th Street south to Battery Park from years of decay, and replace it with an inviting mix of walkways, open spaces, playing fields and enough commercial development to sustain the park in future years. 
 Gov. George Pataki, after some dithering, has endorsed the plan. His economic development czar, Charles Gargano, is on board. So are most environmental groups. But Mr. Giuliani has not taken a leadership role. His staff spends more time raising concerns about the plan than seeking solutions. His economic advisers are entertaining proposals for commercial development on land that was originally targeted for open space.
Part of the problem arises from the split ownership of the land. The city owns the northern end, between 35th and 59th Streets. The state controls the land south of 35th. Five years ago, the city and state pledged to contribute $100 million each, and later established an agency, the Hudson River Park Conservancy, to draw up a master plan, take title to both city and state property along the river and oversee the park's creation.
This agency is the main reason for the Mayor's foot-dragging. The conservancy is legally a subsidiary of Mr. Gargano's Empire State Development Corporation, and Mr. Giuliani -- who has long resented quasi-independent authorities that do not answer to City Hall -- simply does not want to turn over city land to a state agency he cannot control. The city and the state are equally represented on the conservancy board, an arrangement that gives Mr. Giuliani plenty of power. But he cannot get over the fact that the conservancy is technically Mr. Gargano's child.
There is an answer to this. A bill soon to be introduced in Albany would establish a truly independent agency with equal state and city membership to oversee the park's construction and operation. Mr. Pataki endorses this approach. Mr. Giuliani should too. If the city does not climb aboard this project, New Yorkers will wind up with half a park, or maybe no park at all.
That would be a a great loss. The alternative to the park is further decay and shapeless privatization. But if Mr. Giuliani can see his way clear to working with the Governor, he could be remembered as the Mayor who gave New York's most majestic river back to its people.

Backlash

BYLINE: By THOMAS FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
It is not yet clear how the Iraq crisis will end. But it's already clear what it has exposed -- the serious tensions just beneath the surface of the U.S.-Russia relationship. Last Friday night, I found myself in Moscow watching CNN report from the White House that some U.S. officials suspect that the Russians and Iraqis may have cooked up the whole Iraq crisis in order to help Baghdad escape from U.N. sanctions. Wow. That's a serious charge. We haven't heard that kind of conspiracy talk since Khrushchev was pounding his shoe at the U.N. But after meeting here with Russian officials and analysts I can report that such charges certainly reflect the prevailing mood of U.S.-Russian ties. The U.S.-Russia relationship has gone in the last seven years from a strategic partnership, to a pragmatic partnership, to a relationship of benign neglect, to a relationship heading for malign neglect. Is it time to break out the reruns of "Seven Days in May" and "From Russia With Love"?
Not yet, but several factors are combining to push Russo-American relations downhill. One is a global phenomenon: There is a growing backlash against America's overwhelming economic and military superiority. America's allies and enemies are increasingly united in resentment of the U.S. Do you know what Iran calls America today? Not "the Great Satan." Iran calls America "the Capital of Global Arrogance." Unfortunately, that's also what the French, the Malaysians, the Russians, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Germans call Washington behind its back. 
 Saddam Hussein is tapping into this undercurrent of resentment against the U.S. In the 1990 gulf war, Saddam played the Arab Robin Hood, stealing from the Arab rich, Kuwait, to give to the Arab poor. This time he's playing Luke Skywalker standing up to the American Evil Empire. Saddam's Foreign Minister regularly complains that the U.S. behaves as if it were "the last days of the Roman Empire." A Baghdad man in the street whom CNN interviewed just happened to refer to America as an "international Dracula that sucks the blood of people around the world." This sense that America wants to decide everything but pay for nothing resonates far and wide. Russian commentator Aleksei Pushkov said that "the attitude here now is that Russia should be a balancing force to correct situations where America gets infatuated with its own power."
It's not that France, Russia or Malaysia wants to confront America. They just want to irritate it -- even though they know they need America to deal with the world's bad guys, indeed because they need America. Every time Boris Yeltsin meets with the Chinese or Europeans he now warns about the dangers of "hegemonism." He doesn't mention the U.S. He doesn't need to.
At the same time, the termites have been eating away at the core U.S.-Russia relationship. Arnold Horelick, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, remarked that in America "Russia is viewed more and more as a problem and less and less as an opportunity" -- a problem because of its loose nukes, mafia crime and all-too-free market for arms buyers. The growing attitude in Washington is that Russia's elites are not entirely competent to manage their own affairs.
From the Russians' side, there is still resentment at the way NATO expansion is being shoved down their throats -- a brain-dead Clinton move that has put the most pro-American Russians on the defensive. And there is deep concern about America's growing economic and political influence in the oil-rich former Soviet republics on Russia's southern frontier. There is a feeling, says the Russian strategist Sergei Rogov, that "Russia is being eased out of areas of the globe where we have our vital interests."
Yes, there still are cushions. Mr. Yeltsin still believes in the U.S.-Russia relationship and still delivers in the crunch. And there is now a web of economic ties between Russia and America, which is the largest foreign investor in Russia. Still, if the relationship doesn't become more positive soon, it will become more negative, and as Russia recovers its strength, it will become more difficult.
Now is precisely the time when the U.S. should be taking advantage of Boris Yeltsin's continued leadership to set a new course in the relationship. It's not too late, but it will be soon, or, as Mr. Horelick put it: "Just letting the forces of inertia run free will lead us toward mutual alienation -- if not something much worse."

HEADLINE: U.S. Pushes Israel for 'Credible' Withdrawal Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton and his Administration are turning up the heat on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to produce substantial progress with the Palestinians in talks in December, senior American officials said today.
The officials, speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here, said Mr. Clinton's refusal to see Mr. Netanyahu in Washington last week, his welcome of former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's recent meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in London were all designed to increase the pressure on the Israeli Government. 
 The move comes at a time when the crisis over Iraq has demonstrated weakened support for the United States in the Arab world.
The United States wants Israel to announce a "serious and credible" withdrawal of troops from the West Bank, originally scheduled for September under existing peace accords with the Palestinians.
The officials denied threatening Mr. Netanyahu, saying that the American relationship with him and the Israeli Government "does not involve the invocation of threats.
"Threat is not the way we do business with Netanyahu, as a rule," a senior official said carefully, implying that the usual rules may be broken, in time.
"It is clear that the President is increasingly frustrated and impatient," another senior official said.
Ms. Albright, said another senior official, "does not threaten Mr. Netanyahu."
But the official added, "She has made it clear to him that she will 'tell it like it is' on the Middle East, and she will continue to do so, and she has definitely made it clear to the Israelis that the past 11 months have not been productive, and that we need to do some serious work in December."
The officials denied an Israeli press report that Ms. Albright had warned Mr. Netanyahu in London that without rapid progress, she would announce an "American position" on what an Israeli troop withdrawal ought to be. They also denied Israeli press reports that she specified to Mr. Netanyahu a percentage of West Bank territory that the United States wanted to see turned over to the Palestinian Authority in this second of three withdrawals called for under the Oslo accords and last January's Hebron agreement. Mr. Netanyahu postponed the second withdrawal for security reasons after the last suicide bombings.
"We want to see rapid progress on the troop withdrawal and other issues," one official said. "As to an appropriate percentage, we've only made clear it has to be serious and credible." But the officials did not rule out publicizing an American position.
The first Israeli withdrawal, after Hebron, involved 2.7 percent of the occupied territories, a percentage that the Palestinians criticized as ridiculous and that some American officials also thought was too small. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be examining a second withdrawal of 3 to 5 percent, which the United States would not regard as "serious and credible."
Last Friday, in Washington, President Clinton warned Israelis and Palestinians that "the window of progress will become smaller with time" as he accepted a peace award at the White House from Leah Rabin, the widow of the the slain Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and from Mr. Rabin's peace partner and successor, Mr. Peres. Mr. Clinton warned of the growing frustration of "ordinary people, both Israelis and Palestinians."
The Israeli press today carried accounts that claim to describe Mr. Clinton's private conversations at the award ceremony luncheon expressing his own frustration with Mr. Netanyahu. According to Yediot Ahronot, Mr. Clinton said: "Netanyahu has made all sorts of promises to me and hasn't lived up to them," including a promise for a timeout on expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank, "but it hasn't happened." Mr. Clinton is then reported to have asked: "So how can I believe him?"
A senior White House official denied today that Mr. Clinton uttered those words, and said, "That doesn't sound right." But it is also true, an official said, that the Iraqi crisis has pointed up to Mr. Clinton the erosion in Arab support for American positions, resulting from stagnant peace efforts and the perception that Mr. Clinton will not pressure Mr. Netanyahu to keep his promises.
In London on Nov. 14, at a joint news conference with Mr. Netanyahu, Ms. Albright made the link explicitly, saying, "I made clear that for the sake of the Middle East peace process and for our broader mutual interests in the region, it is time for us to move on the peace process."
With America's moderate Arab allies distancing themselves from Washington at a time of crisis in Iraq, she called for "a greater sense of urgency" on the part of Israelis and Palestinians.
A senior American official said today: "Although we recognize no justified link between Iraq and the peace process, the reality is that it does make it harder to sustain Arab support for our positions in other areas, including the need to confront Iraq on weapons of mass destruction."
The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Dore Gold, interviewed by telephone from New York, rejected the link, saying, "The notion that there is a connection between the peace process and the ability to form an anti-Iraq coalition is baseless."
In October 1994, he said, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq "massed Iraqi armor in southern Iraq and not a single Arab coalition partner, with the exception of Kuwait, was willing to back American action. And this was at a time when the Oslo peace process was racing ahead and Israel was signing new agreements with Jordan."
But a senior American official disputed Mr. Gold's version of history, saying, "We deployed forces to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during that crisis, which we didn't do now, and there is not the kind of Arab criticism of our actions then as there is now."
History aside, the disagreement points to the increasingly public nature of the relationship between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Clinton, who has in general kept his criticism quiet or has tried to attribute it to both Palestinians and Israelis.
Other Israeli officials confirmed that Mr. Netanyahu is feeling more pressure now from Mr. Clinton.
They say that the Hebron accords in January -- both a public "note for the record" and a private side letter at that time to Mr. Netanyahu from Warren Christopher, who was then Secretary of State -- explicitly link further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank to the Palestinian commitment to "combat systematically and effectively, terrorist organizations and infrastructure."

Top Aid Quits After Likud Revolt
JERUSALEM, Nov. 23 (Agence France-Presse) -- Prime Minister Netanyahu today accepted the resignation of his chief of staff, Avigdor Lieberman, who quit apparently in an effort to defuse a revolt by top members of the ruling Likud party.
Many analysts viewed the resignation as a significant concession by Mr. Netanyahu, who has in the past dealt with threats to his position by brazenly attacking his opponents. "I express great sorrow over this resignation of a good, trustworthy friend who stood by me for many years," Mr. Netanyahu said.
Several ministers had demanded Mr. Lieberman's dismissal after a Likud party meeting earlier this month when he was accused of waging a campaign to strengthen Mr. Netanyahu's position at the expense of potential rivals.

HEADLINE: Ex-Official Now Looks To Church For Solace

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Va., Nov. 23

 BODY:
This morning, the former Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary walked to the front of her mother's Presbyterian church in nearby Newport News, which she described as "a groovy place," and came to God.
"I'm very old and I just joined church today," said Mrs. O'Leary, who is 60, her eyes filling with tears when she talked about it. "I hopped out of my seat and went down and thought, 'Maybe this is what the last two years has been about.' " 
 That is two years of scandals, most recently accusations that she solicited a $25,000 donation for her favorite charity, Africare, in exchange for an agreement to meet with some Chinese clients of Johnny Chung, the lobbyist and prolific political donor. Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce a decision as early as Monday on whether to appoint an independent prosecutor in the case.
Mrs. O'Leary is not, however, confessing and asking for forgiveness, because she feels she has done nothing wrong. "When I look at the phenomenon of guys born again in Washington -- what's the toe-sucker's name? -- yeah, Dick Morris, he followed the recipe," she said, referring to President Clinton's fallen political adviser. "He sinned and was saved, but I haven't. I don't regret a moment of it. I regret the pain it caused my mother. She asked me, 'Are you going to jail?' And she said, 'I thought it was over.' "
It is not quite over, with uncertain signals from the Justice Department about the likelihood of a special prosecutor in the case. All Mrs. O'Leary, now an energy consultant, will say about the accusations is: "I know I didn't -- No, I can't talk about it. My high-priced lawyer would kill me."
Stylish and striking, she is full of fun today, telling stories with great relish and a theatrical sense of timing. But she is a sad figure, too, a woman known in her field as easily the best prepared energy secretary in the brief, 18-year history of the department, who nonetheless wound up the butt of jokes.
She played a significant role in paving the way for a nuclear test ban, but got more attention for the controversy surrounding her $4.5 million in foreign trips. She was widely praised as the first energy secretary to acknowledge cold war radiation experiments using Americans as guinea pigs, but also got a public spanking from the White House after news that her department had spent $43,500 of money to figure out which reporters were writing favorable articles.
She stood up for whistle-blowers at nuclear plants, announcing a policy of "zero tolerance" for retaliation against them and personally taking the perceived troublemakers under her wing. But she stood out for excesses like taking an entourage of 76 to India and leasing a plane that had also been used by Madonna. She won the Cavallo Foundation's award for moral courage and ethical resistance, but lost the public relations war, and came off looking like someone who was in charge of making nuclear weapons but could not be trusted with a gold card.
Almost a year after leaving office, when asked if there was anything she would have done differently, Mrs. O'Leary answered, "It doesn't matter, does it?" Forthright and flamboyant, she favors hot pink over gray and talks like a refugee from Esalen, using expressions like, "I own that," for "I'm responsible." Conservative Washington winced, and many observers saw racism and sexism in the way she was treated.
"She's an African-American woman, and every African-American woman in the Clinton Administration got a lot of heat," said Tom Carpenter, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project who represents workers at bomb plants and has criticized Mrs. O'Leary on safety and cleanup. "This Congress goes after anyone they see as an uppity woman. I looked pretty carefully at the travel brouhaha and thought it was a tempest in a teapot. Some trips were bloated and probably unwise, but as scandals go it just doesn't rate."
Former aides say she was routinely undercut by her own staff as she struggled to change the internal culture of a traditionally super-secret department and got only feeble support from the White House.
"Except for Clinton and Gore, the White House staff didn't like her," in part because she refused to hire some of those they had recommended, said Bob Hanfling, an old friend who served as her first chief of staff. "The Republicans on the Hill sensed she was vulnerable."
There were also times, even those close to her acknowledge, when Mrs. O'Leary seemed her own worst enemy. The results are on display on the "O'Leary World Tour" web page, posted by the Congressional Republicans who investigated her travel expenses. It features the "O'Leary World Tour Quiz," gives a list of the five-star hotels she patronized, from the Hotel Meurice in Paris to the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay, and a rundown of the staff she took along, under the heading, "How many staff does it take to make an entourage?"
One of her chief critics, Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican, sums up the rap against her this way: "She was good at the press conference but not good at the details. We never had reason to suspect she was personally corrupt, but it was more management ineptitude than anything."
Even her friends suggest there is at least some truth in the criticism that she is pretty handy with a checkbook.
"Africare isn't even her favorite charity,' Mr. Hanfling said. So what is? "Probably Saks Fifth Avenue," he said, and laughed. "Kidding, I'm kidding. But she is not averse to contributing to the economy."
She says that it is ridiculous (actually, she used a little spicier word than that) that she was blamed for the blunders of the junior staff who plan trips.
"A lot of my friends say I should have done a better job of schmoozing the Hill, and people say I should be less arrogant," Mrs. O'Leary said. "This behavior in a man would not be called arrogant. I've just been at this too long to be uncertain."
Mrs. O'Leary was born in Newport News, the daughter of two doctors, and was largely raised by her stepmother, a former teacher. Because Virginia schools were then still segregated, she was sent north to live with an aunt and graduated from the High School of Fine and Performing Arts in Newark. There she sang, did poetry readings, and knew Connie Francis, she said, bursting into a few bars of "Where the Boys Are." She went on to Fisk College in Nashville and soon married, "because I was so tall I just kept catching the bouquet."
She had a son, Carl, now a Washington lawyer, and when he was still a toddler, she was in the grocery store one day when she saw a clock on the wall, saw it was 2 P.M. and shrieked, "Ohmigod, it's time for young Dr. Malone!" She rushed home to her soap, then realized she badly needed another outlet and called Rutgers Law School, where she enrolled the next fall. She went on to become a prosecutor in Essex County, handling some organized crime cases. Much later, after a brief, second marriage to the news anchor Max Robinson, she met her third husband, Jack O'Leary, at the Department of Energy, where they both worked in the early 1980's.
When he died of cancer, she moved to Minnesota and worked as a utilities company executive until Mr. Clinton invited her back to Washington as his Energy Secretary. Quite soon after taking the job, she startled everyone by refusing to sign off on a decision to continue nuclear testing.
"I looked down the table at all these guys, these white guys, some of them in uniform, and said, 'What the hell is wrong with zero testing?' "
"I made many enemies in the process" of pushing for a test ban, she went on, "and I'm O.K. with that. I'm at peace now. I'm really O.K."

HEADLINE: Job Climate Improves With More Public Transit

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Poor Without Cars Find Trek to Work Is Now a Job" (front page, Nov. 18) calls attention to a critical problem. While the New York City region's poor rely heavily on mass transit to commute to work, the most rapid job growth is occurring in areas that are only accessible by automobile. In grappling for answers, we must not lose sight of our most powerful asset. Unlike other metropolitan areas, the region's extensive mass transit system gives most low-income residents access to many thriving downtowns in the area. 
 Enhancements to this network could bring thousands of additional jobs within reach of the poor at locations like Kennedy and Newark International Airports, the Roosevelt and Mitchell Fields retail complex in Nassau County and other suburban downtowns. Long-term, mass transit improvements are an essential component of strategies to create jobs in urban areas and accessible suburban centers.

Making Work Pay

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your article on welfare reform in Oregon (front page, Nov. 20) points out that low unemployment, brisk job growth and decent entry-level wages are helping some Oregon welfare recipients make the transition to work. An important complement to these positive developments is Oregon's minimum-wage policy. Its minimum is now $5.50, 35 cents above the Federal level, and will rise to $6.50 by 1999. 
 Clearly, Oregonians have made the connection between a higher legislated wage floor and the goal of "making work pay" for low-wage workers. What's more, the state's strong labor market belies claims by minimum-wage opponents that increases lead to job losses.

HEADLINE: Albany Cuts Effort to Urge Conservation

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 23

 BODY:
New York State, once a national leader in promoting energy conservation, has, with little public notice, cut its conservation effort to about one-fourth its former size, even though the program has been highly praised by environmentalists.
The conservation program, begun in the late 1980's, requires the seven regional power companies in the state to reimburse their customers for some of the cost of replacing light fixtures, electric motors and appliances with more energy-efficient models. Reducing the demand for electricity cuts down on air pollution by lowering the amount of fuel burned in power plants. 
 The amount the state has required the utilities to spend on the program has fallen to $73 million this year, from $280 million in 1993, and is set to drop more over the next few years. The utilities' expenses are ultimately borne by ratepayers, but the savings from conserving energy typically cover those costs in the long term.
The program's decline began toward the end of the Cuomo administration, which inaugurated the program, and has continued under Gov. George E. Pataki. It has coincided with the growth of similar programs in other states, so that New York, once a model that others followed, now ranks below the national average in energy efficiency spending, and far behind most other states in the Northeast.
The cuts have angered and perplexed conservation groups, which often view the Republican Governor as an ally. Democratic lawmakers say they see the administration's treatment of the program as a potential weak spot for the Republican Governor in a re-election campaign in 1998.
"This governor's record on energy efficiency has been a total failure," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The Governor's office declined to discuss the matter, referring questions to the State Public Service Commission, the agency that governs utilities and sets the level of conservation spending. The commission's members are appointed by the Governor.
Rather than requiring energy efficiency spending, "The commission believes that the market should be allowed to develop innovative programs and cost-effective energy conservation measures," said David Flanagan, the commission's spokesman.
The commission is moving the state away from the traditional system giving utilities a monopoly on power distribution, and toward a competitive market in which customers can choose among competing electricity providers. When that happens, Mr. Flanagan said, some energy companies will try to attract customers by offering conservation services.
But there is not yet any electric competition in New York, and under the current plan, most consumers will not be able to choose their supplier until the year 2002. It is not clear how many customers would voluntarily pay more for their power to gain access to a conservation program.
Although the program is paid for by slightly higher bills for every electric user, consumer groups have not opposed it. The utilities generally have not been hostile to the program, either, as long as the state set high enough rates to guarantee their profits.
The only organized opposition to the efficiency program has come from a coalition of heavy industries, which has protested that high electric rates hinder economic development, and has urged the state to lower them by any means possible. Manufacturers use large amounts of power, and so stand to gain from even a small drop in the price of electricity. Also, they have generally not been able to take much advantage of the rebate program.
This year, the industrial coalition's lobbying helped defeat a bill on energy policy that would have increased the level of conservation spending. The bill passed the Democratic-controlled Assembly, but was stopped in the Republican-led Senate.
"This is an example of the schizophrenia on environmental matters in the Pataki administration," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat and chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee. "They're very good on some things, but when there's a corporate interest involved, they fold."
For power consumers in New York, whether home or business, 0.7 percent of the average monthly electric bill now goes toward the conservation program. In nearby states, the current average is 5.5 percent in Connecticut, 4 percent in Massachussets and 3.4 percent in Vermont, according to a recent study by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
The utilities and environmental groups estimate that the new equipment installed under the program saves more than 5 million megawatt/hours per year, or 3 percent of the electricity consumed statewide, about equivalent to the output of two medium-sized power plants. That translates to almost $500 million a year in savings on electric bills, far more than the amount spent on the rebates.
Reducing the demand for power is a cherished goal of environmentalists because power plants are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gases. They produce two-thirds of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions, one-third of the carbon dioxide and one-third of the nitrogen oxides.
At the peak of New York State's program, a power user, usually a business, that wanted to replace its fixtures with energy-efficient ones could apply to the local utility for a rebate that would, in many cases, cover the entire cost of the new equipment. Often, the customer would hire an energy consultant to determine what changes were needed, install the equipment and prove to the utility that the work had been done. The customer had to pay the consultant's fee and labor charges for installation, but often earned it back within a few years through lower electric bills.
"In a typical office building that's 20 to 30 years old, we could find cost-effective measures that would reduce energy usage 20 to 40 percent, and it's primarily because new, modern equipment is more efficient," said Dennis T. Wilson, president of Manhattan-based Enersave, the largest consultant on energy use in New York City.
Today, the utilities are obliged to pay only a fraction of equipment costs, 20 percent in Consolidated Edison's case. With the smaller rebate, it takes customers longer to recover their expenses, so the program is less attractive to them. Also, the pool of money for rebates has grown so small that applicants are often turned away.
"Our business has been cut almost in half, which gives you some idea of what's going on," Mr. Wilson said.
Most users of the program have been office-based businesses, whose energy use consists mostly of lighting and climate control, which can often be made more efficient at relatively little cost. The program has been available, on a more limited basis, to homeowners, as well, but they have used it less often. Residents rarely shop for new appliances if the old ones, no matter how inefficient, are still working, and the out-of-pocket cost for new equipment and installation is often more daunting to an average person than to a business.
For factories, the program has had less to offer than for office buildings. The rebate program applies only to common uses, like better lighting and electric motors, not the more complex, often highly specialized machinery that accounts for much of a factory's power use.
In moving toward competition, the commission is making some changes in the conservation program that environmentalists welcome: the effort will be run by the state, not the utilities, and reimbursements will be based on the amount of energy saved, not the amount of money spent.
But as part of the industry restructuring, the commission is continuing to cut the program. Con Edison's spending on conservation, already down to $48 million this year, from $125 million in 1993, will drop to $30 million a year during the five-year transition to competition, and similar cuts are in the works for the other regional power companies.
