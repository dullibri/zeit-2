Washington Brags as Trade Deficit Sets a Record

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
"The chief business of the American people," said Calvin Coolidge, "is business."
Not since the 1920's has America been more supremely confident in itself as an economic machine. That may help explain why some in Congress appear to be in no hurry to conclude the impeachment fiasco. For all the talk about doing the nation's business, there does not seem to be much pressing domestic business. 
 The biggest policy squabble in Washington is over the precise method by which we Americans should invest in American business to secure our retirement. The President would have the Government buy around 4 percent of more-or-less every business that sells stock to the public, although he has not spelled out details. In addition, he would give each of us (or at least each of us who isn't deemed too rich) some money to choose our own stocks. The Republicans would let us use Social Security money to buy our own stocks. Both are certain that buying stocks is a sure-fire way to make money.
This confidence comes as the current period of growth takes its place as the longest peacetime expansion ever, a fact for which President Clinton is pleased to claim credit even if the current recovery was 19 months old when he was elected on a platform that emphasized just how badly the economy was doing under President George Bush.
The stock market has been going up almost continuously since 1982, with the 1987 crash remembered as little more than a buying opportunity that was then seen -- wrongly -- as a sign of problems in the American economy. Americans, who a decade ago bristled at sanctimonious economic lectures from Japan, now specialize in making such speeches.
If pride precedes a fall, watch out.
The country's balance-of-payments deficit is nearing a record. Imports are up and exports are down as Americans spend all that they earn, and then some. The trade deficit -- the most important part of the balance-of-payments picture -- set an annual record in the first 11 months of 1998, and will grow larger this year.
The risk is that some day there will be a balance-of-payments crisis that leads to a tumbling dollar and the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to defend the currency, no matter what the consequences are for the domestic economy. (That is, in fact, one way to explain what is happening in Brazil.)
There is no American crisis now because foreigners are happy to invest their dollars in our economy. They see greater risk in other countries and are as enamored as anyone by rising American stock prices. The dollar remains the only reserve currency for many foreign central banks, which are happy to hold large dollar balances.
If Washington were worried about the trade deficit, there might be talk about tax increases to restrain domestic demand and offset the expansionary monetary policy that the Federal Reserve adopted last year when it was worried about international collapse. Instead, the problem is all but ignored, and the only nod to it comes in the form of protectionist demands that Japan stop exporting so much steel to this country. As the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said last week, protectionism is no solution and would likely make our problems worse.
The dollar's popularity will not last indefinitely. The euro will erode its pre-eminent international position, and if Japan ever gets its economic act together, that country will attract more investment. If an American balance-of-payments crisis does develop, it is likely to come as a surprise and to be accompanied by a falling stock market, as confidence in America declines and both foreign and domestic investors try to bail out before it is too late.
Trade deficits are not nearly as interesting as lies about sex. But they may be more important.

HEADLINE: Prosperity and the Neediest Cases

 BODY:
Most of us know the charitable impulse that wells up during the holidays. The impulse may be seasonal, but the needs of the neediest persist all year long. Hunger, homelessness, disease, poverty, ignorance -- these things never waver, though our consciousness of them does. When the holidays end, we turn back to what we fondly call "our own lives" with a sense of relief. But there is no such thing as "our own lives" in that narrow sense. A mother and her children slipping into homelessness or a young man coming to the end of his senses without decent care are inescapable elements of our own lives. Whether we like it or not, the prosperity we enjoy is intolerable unless we share it with people who cannot gain even the rudiments of prosperity by themselves.
Like other charitable fund-raising drives, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is a remarkable enterprise. The people who give are as diverse as the people who receive. Small checks, large checks, checks that are never given another thought, checks that represent hardship in themselves. It is a moving spectacle. Yet it is hard to look out across this city and nation, to assess the stunning prosperity we enjoy, and not feel that, when it comes to aiding the neediest, Americans are truly parsimonious. We enjoy something of a civic renaissance in New York without really wondering who has been left out, who is worse off now than before. The welfare rolls shrink and the unemployment lines dwindle, which only makes it harder to see that some part of our new prosperity is simply illusion -- a decision to look in one direction and not another. 
 The seven agencies whose work is financed in part by the Neediest Cases Fund are the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; UJA-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. These agencies meet a responsibility that has been increasingly shunted to the private sector during the past two decades. They need generous support.
Every dollar raised during this appeal is used for direct aid in the city's five boroughs. No money is diverted for solicitation or administrative expenses. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

To the Editor:
In his essay on the connection between having money and having a good life ("Don't Be Shocked, but Money Isn't Everything," My Money, My Life, Jan. 10), Jeffrey Nesteruk said, "We ask for a raise instead of grappling with our lack of self-worth." 
 Hmmm. Imagine a Christmas Eve in London, many years ago. Ebenezer Scrooge is chatting with Bob Cratchit: "Bob, about this raise you've been wanting . . . have you ever considered going into therapy?"

HEADLINE: Social Security Investment Plan Raises a Debate

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
A proposal by President Clinton to invest some portion of Social Security reserves in stocks ignited a brushfire of criticism last week, although the attacks may have focused on easily solved problems and ignored some thornier issues.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said he strongly doubted that the plan could be insulated from political interference. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, argued that the concept would give the Government undue influence over corporate affairs. Other critics asked how the Government could pursue an antitrust case against Microsoft if it were also a Microsoft shareholder. 
 But lawyers, administrators and scholars point out that stock investments by governments and their agencies are neither new nor rare. States, cities and several independent Federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve System, have pension plans that have invested heavily in stocks for years. And those investments have not, they say, created the widespread problems critics predict.
What has proven difficult is determining who bears the burdens of any losses and who reaps the benefits of any surpluses -- a question made compelling by the difficulty of predicting market performance. Even more daunting is the challenge of providing small retirement accounts, like those envisioned by both the President and his Republican critics, without being overwhelmed by administrative costs.
Francis X. Cavanaugh has a snappy answer to the question of whether the Government can invest in stocks without becoming bogged down in political shenanigans or corporate meddling. "Can it be done? It's been done," he said. "We did it."
Mr. Cavanaugh was the first executive director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, created by Congress in 1986 to cover Federal employees, including members of Congress like Mr. Archer.
Asked about potential conflicts between shareholding and governing -- as in the Microsoft case -- Mr. Cavanaugh shrugged. Since the plan invests in a stock index fund, he said, the accounts of the Federal lawyers and the Federal judge in the Microsoft case almost certainly hold a few Microsoft shares. But because Congress designed the agency to be insulated from both the political process and the corporate battlefield, he said, no "horror stories" have emerged. The White House has also cited the protections of a stock index fund, which mimics the performance of a market benchmark like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, in defending its plan.
Strong legislation protects the agency from political pressure, he said. Corporate meddling is precluded because the commercial bank selected to manage agency investments also votes its shares on matters like takeovers and executive compensation. The only factor the bank can consider in casting its votes, Mr. Cavanaugh added, is what is best for retirees.
"The question is not can it be done. The question that should be asked," he said, "is whether the Congress, having protected three million Federal employees from political manipulation of their retirement funds, will be willing to extend that same protection to the 150 million beneficiaries of Social Security."
Not everyone agrees that the Federal retirement system's approach would work for a fund as large as a Social Security stock fund would be -- the President's proposal calls for investing about $700 billion in stocks over the next 15 years, an amount that would have made it the largest single investor in today's market.
Roy Schotland, a Georgetown law professor who helped drive the campaign to modernize the pension plan for university and college faculty, said it might be wiser to delegate the voting of shares to an independent fiduciary institution. Others said the problem could be resolved by requiring the Government to vote with the majority of other shareholders in important disputes.
Most statewide pension funds have invested in stocks for years, as have most large municipal pension programs. According to Nicholas Greifer, senior policy analyst with the Government Finance Officers Association in Chicago, only three states -- Indiana, South Carolina and West Virginia -- did not permit stock market investments by statewide pension funds as of 1997. Since then, all three have obtained legislative or voter approval to permit such investments, he said.
The state funds have a somewhat uneven record when it comes to insulating investment decisions from improper influences, several pension industry executives said. Roland Machold, who retired in July as director of the New Jersey Division of Investments, said that over the years "there is hardly a state that hasn't had some brush with scandal with its pension fund."
But most frequently, Mr. Machold said, those problems have involved the selection of outside consultants or investments in exotic assets, like venture capital investments in local businesses, substandard mortgages, and poorly understood investments like derivatives. "The states have almost never screwed up buying nationally listed securities," he said.
State legislatures have occasionally ordered pension funds to abstain from certain investments -- in companies doing business in South Africa during apartheid and, more recently, in tobacco companies. But most state pension funds with strong professional leadership have avoided interference by special interests, said Ian Lanoff, who ran the Labor Department's compliance program under ERISA, the Federal law governing private pensions, in the Carter Administration and who now specializes in pension law in Washington.
He cited the refusal by New York City's pension funds to help bail the city out in its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's and later refusal of Michigan public pension funds to help rescue the Chrysler Corporation. More recently, he said, the largest public pension funds have been largely successful in resisting efforts to ban investments in Northern Ireland and in companies involved in Holocaust reparations disputes.
ERISA requires pension funds to base investment decisions solely on the best interests of retirees, Mr. Lanoff said. "Most states have taken ERISA principles and applied them to their own plans." Similar standards would help insulate a Social Security fund even further from political interference, he said.
But public pension funds have been less successful in insulating themselves from politics in the tug-of-war over fund surpluses and shortfalls, said Gene Kalwarski, a public pension specialist at Milliman & Robertson in Washington.
There have been "vicious and bitter debates" over whether surpluses in public pension funds should be used to improve retirement benefits or to reduce the amount taxpayers must contribute the next year, he said. Similarly, if a fund falls short -- perhaps because of stock market losses -- the battle rages over whether to cut benefits or raise taxes.
It is unrealistic to expect that such battles -- already a feature of the Social Security debate -- will not continue, especially if future stock returns do not mirror recent strong gains, several legal scholars said.
Defenders of the plan assume that any shortfalls would remain the responsibility of Federal taxpayers, as they are now.
Such uncertainties persuade some that stock investments by the Social Security fund raise more problems than they solve. "My own instinct is to be very chary," said Richard Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York in Albany. "The past in the stock market is not necessarily prologue."
Donald J. Boyd, who specializes in state government studies at the Institute, shared that concern. "State funds are large, very, very large," he said, "but the Social Security fund would be huge. That makes it more visible, but more cumbersome."
But trying to give beneficiaries a stock market tonic in the form of small individual accounts -- a feature of both the President's plan and several Republican alternatives -- raises administrative problems that Mr. Cavanaugh says would be virtually insurmountable.
The cost of providing individual plans, similar to corporate 401(k)'s, to workers at businesses with 10 or fewer employees would consume most of what the typical Social Security beneficiary could afford to invest, Mr. Cavanaugh said.
The vast majority of America's 6.5 million businesses are very small, he said. And it is that factor, not the number of Social Security participants, that will determine the "economies of scale."
Already, he said, financial services companies charge about $300 for each participant in such small-scale plans. Since the average Social Security wage is approximately $20,000 a year, a worker trying to save 2 percent of that would invest just $400 a year but pay $300 a year in expenses.
While the White House and Republicans have disputed that administrative costs would be that high, Mr. Cavanaugh is not persuaded. "You would be better off putting your money in the mattress," he said.

HEADLINE: Gore Building Network in California

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
As Vice President, Al Gore has traveled to California so many times that aides have lost count. They think his latest trip this weekend, his second of the year already, is the 52d. But they are not eager to bet on it.
While the exact number does not matter much, what Mr. Gore has done there behind the scenes probably does. Over the last three years, he has built a prodigious network of constituent groups and contributors to help him win California's 54 electoral votes, the most of any state, and help him become the fifth incumbent Vice President to capture the White House by election. (The others were John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George Bush.) 
 California has always been critical in the Presidential equation. But by moving up its primary to join New York and eight other states on March 7 in 2000, just weeks after the first two election tests, the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, California's primary holds life-threatening powers over underfinanced campaigns that are still forming.
While that may suggest an urgent need to organize and tap financial sources, Mr. Gore appears to be the only aspirant from either party who has amassed a powerful array of support at this early juncture of the 2000 campaign. And the advantage appears compelling.
"Don't forget, we're just at the very beginning," said Gina Glantz, campaign manager for Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey Senator who recently entered the Presidential race. "Sooner more than later, we'll have a more formal organization in California. But we're just getting started."
That is apparently more than any other Democrat challenging Mr. Gore has done. Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, said any others who might be contemplating a run, like Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, had not significantly raised their profiles in the state.
"The fact that the primary is so early, they should have started organizing six months ago," Mr. Torres said. "If they would ask me for advice now, I'd tell them not to waste their money."
Mr. Bradley, who lectured at Stanford University after his three terms in the Senate, is not without considerable ties to California. He has campaigned for Democrats from swing districts, like Representatives Ellen O. Tauscher and Gary A. Condit, and his friendship with Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, could lead to big contributions.
"But the reality is, Gore is leaps and bounds in front," said Representative Loretta Sanchez of Orange County, a director of Mr. Gore's political action committee, Leadership '98, and an incoming chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, a position that requires neutrality.
Mr. Gore's strength in California flows directly from the power of incumbency and instant access to Air Force Two, a combination that allows him to deliver Federal largess and to campaign for Democrats whenever he wants -- and often on the same trip.
The mix worked especially well last year. On a dozen visits, he announced grants and programs worth more than $550 million, and almost every Democrat running for statewide office won in November, including Gray Davis, the state's first Democratic Governor in 16 years.
Just as he did in planning for this weekend, Mr. Gore has always made special efforts to court the same groups that twice turned out money and votes for President Clinton, including Hispanic and black voters and people in the entertainment industry.
Through science and technology issues, long a passion of his, Mr. Gore has tried expanding that base by impressing environmentalists and Silicon Valley executives with his knowledge of topics like "salmon as an indicator species" and "massive parallel computing."
In addition, he has taken unusual steps to familiarize himself with high-tech issues, meeting periodically with small groups of industry representatives at all levels -- "Gore Techs," his aides call them -- to discuss new and future technologies.
"He gave an address on forestry, water issues and clean air about a year ago at Lake Tahoe," said Ruth Hunter, a board member of the California League of Conservation Voters. "He was more informed than some of the enviros."
While environmentalists have typically supported Democrats, that has not necessarily been the case with people in high-tech fields, whose philosophies tend to be more Libertarian and Progressive than Democrat and Republican.
But Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo, the Internet portal, said he and other high-tech executives had grown to respect Mr. Gore for interest in issues vital to Internet growth, like privacy and electronic commerce.
"In one meeting I was in with him, he talked very eloquently about network economics, how decision making can be distributed in the network world," Mr. Yang said. "It's good to see that he can think about these things and not reduce himself to sound bites."
Would Mr. Yang put any Republicans in the same category as Mr. Gore? "Nobody I know as a Presidential candidate," he said.
With people of Hispanic descent now California's fastest growing ethnic group, making up 30.8 percent of the state's population, Mr. Gore has pursued them as aggressively as any group. Last year, he often appeared at campaign and issue-related events with Cruz M. Bustamante, who became the state's first elected Lieutenant Governor of Hispanic descent, and with Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the new State Assembly Speaker. In one East Los Angeles event with Hispanic union workers days before the election, Mr. Gore delivered his entire get-out-the-vote message in Spanish.
"I know George Bush Jr. is doing all he can to show support for the Latino community in Texas, speaking Spanish and all that," said Mr. Bustamante, who refers to Mr. Gore as Alberto. "But I can't think of any candidate, Democrat or Republican, who could break the bond that exists for the Vice President."
Yvonne Burke, a Los Angeles County supervisor, said Mr. Gore had developed a similar bond with many black Californians for promoting issues important to low-income people, like economic development in inner-city neighborhoods and employment discrimination.
She said the Vice President also won points when he attended events like the funeral last fall of Tom Bradley, who was a hero to many blacks as the first black Mayor of Los Angeles.
"Often, people coming to California, come to raise money and only see the more affluent communities," Ms. Burke said. "The President has always been visible in all of Los Angeles's communities, and the Vice President's approach has been very similar."
As for fund-raising, a sensitive subject for Mr. Gore since his 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple almost led to a Justice Department investigation, the Vice President is relying heavily upon people in the entertainment industry who raised money for Mr. Clinton.
They include David Geffen, the record industry executive, and Rob Reiner, the actor and director. Both said Mr. Gore had attributes certain to give him advantages over other candidates, some that made him more attractive than Mr. Clinton was before becoming President.
"In 1992, Bill Clinton had to start from scratch," Mr. Geffen said. "Al Gore is extremely well-known and well-liked. I can't imagine why he would not enjoy great support." Mr. Geffen called Mr. Bradley a "very decent and honorable guy," but a primary candidate who has "zero chance" to defeat Mr. Gore.
Mr. Reiner had Mr. Gore's help last year, leading a successful ballot initiative to raise taxes on cigarettes and use the money for children's services. He said he was impressed by Mr. Gore's enthusiasm and grasp of issues.
"He'll say that he's not as glamorous as President Clinton," Mr. Reiner said of the Vice President. "But in a strange way, that makes people even more dedicated to him. He's a policy wonk, but at least with him you get none of the extras and distractions you get with the President."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From John Paul's Message About the Poor and the Rich

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Pope's Apostolic Exhortation yesterday on the mission for the Roman Catholic Church in the Americas, as provided by the Vatican:
Among the positive aspects of America today, we see in civil society a growing support throughout the continent for democratic political systems and the gradual retreat of dictatorial regimes; this has immediate moral implications. The church looks sympathetically upon this evolution insofar as it favors an evermore marked respect for the rights of each individual including those accused and condemned, against whom it is never legitimate to resort to modes of detention and investigation -- one thinks especially of torture -- which are offensive to human dignity. . . . 
 There is an economic globalization which brings some positive consequences, such as efficiency and increased production, and which, with the development of economic links between the different countries, can help to bring greater unity among peoples and make possible a better service to the human family. However, if globalization is ruled merely by the laws of the market applied to suit the powerful, the consequences cannot but be negative. These are, for example, the absolutizing of the economy, unemployment, the reduction and deterioration of public services, the destruction of the environment and natural resources, the growing distance between rich and poor, unfair competition which puts the poor nations in a situation of ever-increasing inferiority. . . .
And what should we say about the cultural globalization produced by the power of the media? Everywhere the media impose new scales of values which are often arbitrary and basically materialistic, in the face of which it is difficult to maintain a lively commitment to the values of the Gospel. . . .
More and more, in many countries of America, a system known as neo-liberalism prevails; based on a purely economic conception of man, this system considers profit and the law of the market as its only parameters, to the detriment of the dignity of and the respect due to individuals and peoples. At times this system has become the ideological justification for certain attitudes and behavior in the social and political spheres leading to the neglect of the weaker members of society. Indeed, the poor are becoming ever more numerous, victims of specific policies and structures which are often unjust. . . .
Love for the poor must be preferential, but not exclusive. The Synod Fathers observed that it was in part because of an approach to the pastoral care of the poor marked by a certain exclusiveness that the pastoral care for the leading sectors of society has been neglected and many people have thus been estranged from the church. The damage done by the spread of secularism in these sectors -- political or economic, union-related, military, social or cultural -- shows how urgent it is that they be evangelized.

HEADLINE: A Place to See Eagles Soar

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORESTBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
Great wings outstretched, a bald eagle soared over the open water of the Mongaup Reservoir, giving the group of observers a brief, brilliant sighting before it rose behind the tall white pines. The number of eagles wintering here in the Upper Delaware watershed of Sullivan County has grown steadily in recent years. So has the phenomenon of eagle watching.
More than a dozen bundled and layered visitors, some of whom traveled long miles for a glimpse of the eagles, took shelter from the brisk January winds in a public viewing blind. Trained volunteers were directing them in using telescopes to spot the elusive birds. 
 Most of the people who make the trip do not consider themselves avid bird watchers. Instead, they are drawn by the mystique of the endangered bald eagle. And that is exactly what Sullivan County officials are counting on -- that their natural resources, including the largest wintering population of bald eagles in the Northeast, can make their area an attractive destination for people from the New York City region interested in a one-day or weekend excursion.
The tourists could provide a much-needed economic boost for the Catskill Mountain region.
Donna Schmidt has seen bald eagles before, in Nova Scotia and Alaska. Still, she chose to spend three hours driving here from Long Island with her husband, her 15-month-old son, two nephews and her sister-in-law to see eagles in flight.
"It's more special to see them here, so close to your own backyard -- and I wanted them to see them," she said, referring to her husband, Steven, and 6-year-old nephew, Kyle Delgado.
"I'll come back again when Steve Jr. is older," she said. "Next time it would be nice to stay over."
The County Manager, Jonathan Drapkin, said the county was trying to overcome the loss of many resort hotels. "So many people have a fixed memory of the large, self-contained hotels as they were," he said. "We want people to know there's some of the best fly-fishing in the Northeast here; that you can canoe or raft the Delaware."
The eagles migrate here primarily from Canada. It is the sight of open fresh water that attracts them.
They can have their fill of fresh fish, then perch in the pines among large tracts of undisturbed land, including 12,000 state-owned acres managed strictly for the eagles' protection.
"There's a general shifting and recognition by the county that our natural resources are an economic resource," said Lori Danuff-McKean, who works with the county as founder and volunteer president of the nonprofit Eagle Institute, a year-old organization dedicated to the protection of the bald eagle and other birds of prey.
As many as 15 institute-trained volunteers can be found each weekend during prime viewing season -- January through March -- beside roads and rivers and in the Mongaup blind. They act as guides for group field trips, like the one arranged by the Schmidt family. They staff popular viewing locations, equipped with binoculars and telescopes, where they help visitors who come unguided and advise on proper etiquette. They are trained to monitor eagle activity and weather conditions and to look for birds tagged and banded for identification by the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
"On a beautiful day, we can expect to see 40 to 50 people who have come on their own to a designated viewing area," Ms. Danuff-McKean said.
As of mid-January, a record 179 bald eagles were counted in the Upper Delaware watershed and its associated reservoirs. Peter Nye, who heads the state's endangered species unit in Albany, said 89 adults and 90 immature birds were spotted from the air during the annual midwinter count on Jan. 11.
Many reservoirs are very low right now, and there is not much ice-free water, Mr. Nye said. "But no matter how bad the conditions, this area still provides some amount of suitable habitat for bald eagles, and we've still recorded record numbers."
The Mongaup Valley Wildlife Management Area, just below Monticello, was created in 1990 when the state bought the 12,000 acres as a reserve for the bald eagle. It is the best place to see eagles in New York State, Mr. Nye said. But the eagles are extremely sensitive to the presence of humans, and that creates some concerns.
"We need to insure that in five or seven years we will have the habitat to support the numbers of breeding pairs," Mr. Nye said. "The new challenge is to identify enough suitable habitat, then manage and protect it."
Gene Lamoriello, president of the Sullivan County Visitors Association, said the county was working to draw visitors, but he added, "We recognize that if you overwhelm a delicate balance, you lose your attraction."

HEADLINE: Albright Starts Visit to Moscow as Russia's Wariness Grows

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright embarks Sunday on a trip to a weakened but obstinate Russia, with little expectation on either side that much will improve in a relationship plagued by disagreement on everything from Russia's economic collapse to air strikes against Iraq.
In contrast to the euphoria of the heady days when Russia was envisioned as a full member of a "Group of Eight" industrialized democracies, the hope today is to keep a dialogue alive, an Administration official said. 
 Ahead of her arrival, Russian officials were openly referring to the "sour" nature of the relationship with the United States.
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has stridently criticized the air strikes against Iraq, and his First Deputy Prime Minister, Yuri Maslyukov, was in Washington last week complaining about an economically flattened Russia being forced to live under the thumb of an American-dominated International Monetary Fund.
To this mix of problems, the Administration suddenly added a new one: the unveiling this week of its plan to deploy a new missile defense system that would require renegotiation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, a move that the Russians have historically opposed.
In pique over the air strikes against Iraq in December, the lower house of the Russian Parliament last month abruptly canceled the vote on the ratification of Start 2, the treaty that would reduce both nations' stockpiles of nuclear weapons. The Administration's missile defense system proposal would almost certainly further complicate passage of Start 2 in the Parliament, Russian arms control experts said.
The hardening of the stalemate on the strategic arms treaty, which has languished in the Russian Parliament since 1993, was further confirmation that the notion of a "strategic partnership" -- once key to the Clinton Administration's approach to Russia -- has all but evaporated.
Russia's disarray, added a senior Administration official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, made it "more than ordinarily difficult to reach decisions on even the most important policy questions."
Clearly, Ms. Albright will not be doing any business with the ailing President, Boris N. Yeltsin -- it was not even clear, officials said, whether she would see him. Instead, she will focus her energies on Mr. Primakov, whom she met many times when he was Foreign Minister before his elevation to Prime Minister in the political chaos that followed Russia's ruble devaluation and virtual default on Aug. 17.
In an indication the Clinton Administration acknowledges the Yeltsin era is all but over, Ms. Albright is scheduled to meet with three likely presidential candidates: Yuri M. Luzhkov, the Mayor of Moscow; Aleksandr I. Lebed, the former general, and the economist Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party.
Virtually all of the issues on Ms. Albright's agenda with Mr. Primakov address problems associated with Russia's economic collapse.
The week before her arrival, Mr. Maslyukov, the leading Communist member of Mr. Primakov's Government, was told by the I.M.F. and Administration officials that the assumptions in the draft Russian budget were unrealistic and not sufficient to qualify Russia for a new loan.
Russia, in its turn, is making a big issue of negotiating new troop levels under the 1990 treaty that established levels for conventional forces for a Europe still divided into NATO and the now defunct, Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. This is Moscow's way of expressing opposition to NATO's embrace of three former Warsaw Pact countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- which become alliance members in April. Both Russian and Clinton Administration officials suggest that as an area where Ms. Albright may make progress.
Ms. Albright will also stress the Administration's unhappiness over what it contends is Russia's heightened assistance to Iran on missile technology in the last six months.
Last week, the Administration slapped economic penalties on three Russian institutions after asserting that they were providing Iranian scientists with technical assistance. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that talking to Russia "in the language of sanctions and pressure is absolutely unacceptable."
Most likely, Administration officials said, Ms. Albright will tell the Russians that, if Russia does not stop assisting Iran in this way, the United States will end the joint American-Russian satellite launch program that expires next year and is worth about $1 billion to Russian aerospace companies.
Ms. Albright will also probe Mr. Primakov's position on Iraq, officials said. Mr. Primakov, who prides himself on his knowledge of the Arab world, has denounced the Administration's policy on Iraq in the strongest terms.
On Kosovo, where the Russians are traditionally sympathetic to the cause of fellow Slav Orthodox Serbs but are apparently wearying somewhat of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, Ms. Albright might achieve a little more, officials said. Russia has said it opposes NATO air strikes against the Serbs, who are fighting an insurgency of ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the Serbian province of Kosovo, but they might use their influence with Mr. Milosevic to have him comply with a cease-fire agreement reached last October.

HEADLINE: Resistance to Argentine 'Dollar'

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Argentine Government's announcement this week that it would consider replacing its peso with the dollar over the next several years has soothed the concerns of international investors that Argentina might follow Brazil's example and devalue its currency.
But sharp attacks from the opposition, which controls the lower house of Congress and leads in opinion polls before presidential elections, has dimmed the likelihood that the proposal will get very far. And American officials said today that they doubted Argentina would decide to "dollarize" its economy unless it came under dire pressure from an economic meltdown in Brazil. 
 The idea of using the dollar, as Panama and Liberia do, was discussed at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday. In what appeared to be a trial balloon afterward, the Central Bank president, Pedro Pou, told reporters that a "monetary association treaty" with the United States could eventually lead to a common currency across the Americas.
President Carlos Saul Menem has the power to decree the change. But Mr. Pou said that rather than act alone, the Government would seek to negotiate a treaty with the United States.
Such a treaty would require the consent not only of the United States Senate and both houses of the Argentine Congress but also of whoever is elected to replace Mr. Menem as President early next year.
Opposition leaders, including the Mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, the Alianza coalition candidate who currently has a healthy lead in the polls, expressed nationalistic scorn for the idea. "It's not very serious," he said.

HEADLINE: Olympic Ideals and the Raw Truth Are Now Facing Off Because Restraint Vanished

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Jan. 23

 BODY:
As senior officials of the International Olympic Committee completed a report on the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, they were met with a troubling reality. The financial revival that saved the Olympics 15 years ago has mutated into the big-money excesses that threaten to cripple the Games today.
The commission investigating the scandal met today for 15 hours but announced no further resignations by I.O.C. members, as a half-dozen officials pleaded their cases in an attempt to avoid expulsion in the largest corruption scandal to hit the Olympic movement. As many as 11 members face the choice Sunday of resigning or being suspended and eventually expelled amid allegations of accepting cash payments, medical treatment, tuition aid and other lavish benefits totaling an estimated three-quarters of a million dollars. 
 "The International Olympic Committee will not tolerate improprieties of any kind," said Kevan Gosper, a senior I.O.C. member from Australia, even as he tried to justify offers of $35,000 apiece to two I.O.C. members from Africa on the eve of Sydney's two-vote victory over Beijing to play host to the 2000 Summer Games.
 
Samaranch Faces Decisive Moments
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the 78-year-old Spanish marquis, faces the most destabilizing moment of his presidency since he assumed control of the Olympic movement in 1980, when the five Olympic rings were fool's gold.
The 1972 Summer Games in Munich shed the blood of Israeli athletes and any notion that sport and politics were not intertwined. Unwilling to finance the 1976 Winter Games with public money, Denver passed them off to Innsbruck, Austria. The 1976 Summer Games in Montreal left a debt of $1 billion. The 1980 Summer Games in Moscow were boycotted by the United States after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
"The Olympic movement was in trouble," said Dick Pound, an I.O.C. vice president from Montreal who is heading the Salt Lake City investigation. "The I.O.C. had little financing, unity was shaky at best and the Games were becoming a cold war battleground."
Los Angeles won the 1984 Summer Games in 1978 essentially because no one else wanted them. Teheran lost interest when the Shah's regime began to collapse. Islamic fundamentalism had no use for sport. The Soviets led a retaliatory boycott in Los Angeles, but what could have been a cold war disaster became a hot property.
Peter Ueberroth brought to Los Angeles an Olympics that was privately financed through television rights fees, corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and licensing agreements. Shrewdly, he gave exclusivity to various categories of corporate sponsorships. Coca-Cola was the official soft drink, IBM the official technology sponsor, Levi-Strauss the official outfitter.
"In Lake Placid, they had 50 official Band-Aid sponsors," joked Anita DeFrantz, an I.O.C. vice president from Los Angeles, referring to the 1980 Winter Games. "Peter had one sponsor per category, which created value for the sponsor and allowed him to demand larger amounts of money."
When the 1984 Summer Games turned a profit of $220 million, everyone now wanted in. "Peter added a couple of zeros to everything," said John Argue, who was president of the Los Angeles bid committee.
A year later, at an I.O.C. meeting in East Berlin, one of the most infamous food fights in Olympic history took place among cities vying for the 1992 Summer Games. Brisbane, Australia, sent in a plane full of lamb and lobsters for a party whose tab has been placed at nearly $2 million. Paris also airmailed a gastronomical feast. "It was probably the most food they had ever seen in East Berlin," Mr. Pound said.
 
An Organization That Answers to Itself
There were no rules, so there were no rules to be broken. Ms. DeFrantz heard stories of I.O.C. members being put up in one of Paris's most exclusive hotels "for a long time, with their families. It was out of control."
The 1992 Summer Games were eventually awarded to Barcelona, Spain, in 1986. That year, the I.O.C. placed a limit of $150 on gifts that I.O.C. members could receive, but like traffic rules in Italy, this limit appeared to be more of a suggestion than a law. There are no real checks and balances on the I.O.C., which answers to no one but itself.
"I always say it's better to be an I.O.C. member than a king," said Fred Ball, who was a member of Salt Lake City's bid committee for the 2002 Winter Games.
In 1994, the I.O.C. began holding the Winter and Summer Games in separate years. The Winter Olympics now stood alone, instead of in the shadow of the Summer Games. More corporate money could be raised, budgets increased and so did the projected economic benefit. Salt Lake City's expected budget of $1.45 billion is nearly as large as the budget for the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. The estimated economic impact in Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Games is $2.8 billion.
"In the past, the winner was the city willing to lose the most money," Mr. Pound said. "Now the Games are seen as having a beneficial economic impact."
The bidding process has become a sort of neurotic mating ritual in which bid cities, eager to please I.O.C. members, tend to spend money "like drunken sailors on leave," Mr. Pound said. Salt Lake City spent $14 million in private funds just trying to win the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games.
"It's a corrupt process," said Robert Helmick, who resigned as an I.O.C. member and as president of the United States Olympic Committee after being accused of conflict of interest in 1991. "It starts with first-class air tickets for I.O.C. members and their wives. That's $10,000 to $12,000. Then there is the excessive life style bestowed on I.O.C. members by the bid cities. Fur coats, jewelry. They might pay for college tuition for someone's kid. Or find him a job. It goes beyond what is appropriate."
Some I.O.C. members have been as eager to receive as the bid cities have been eager to give.
"When people from poorer countries travel to the United States, they are very impressed," said Francois Carrard, the executive director of the I.O.C. "The different level in standards can lead to temptation. The other side is generous and says, 'My dear friend, what can I do for your family?' But those people should have read the rules. Blame has to be shared."
 
Influencing a Vote, Every Two Years
Because a vote is now held every two years to name a city to host the Winter or Summer Games, there is steadier work for so-called middlemen, or agents. Mr. Pound spoke sharply this week of wanting to rid the Olympic movement of these agents, who reportedly promise to deliver a bloc of votes for exorbitant sums of money. He said there were allegations that bidders hoping to bring the Winter Games to Sion, Switzerland, were approached by an agent who claimed he could deliver 25 I.O.C. votes for $2 million.
"By the time we are through with so-called Olympic agents, I doubt that it will be a profitable business, if it ever was," Mr. Pound said.
Salt Lake City began setting off alarms at the U.S.O.C. as early as 1989, when it was attempting to become the American candidate city to bid on the Winter Games. At the time, officials were concerned about the image that drinking was not allowed in the Mormon capital. The Olympics are as much a 16-day party as a 16-day sporting competition.
U.S.O.C. officials who came to inspect Salt Lake City said they found their hotel rooms stocked with bottles of wine and cases of beer. Once, the inspection team was taken out in a horse-drawn carriage while champagne was served. "We told them that was overkill," said Sandy Knapp, who led the selection committee.
A case of beer and a few bottles of wine were penny ante stuff, but the U.S.O.C.'s initial vigilance lagged as the inducements in Salt Lake City grew to include cash payments and benefits of more than $100,000 apiece to some I.O.C. members.
Having the Olympics come to Salt Lake City was considered a paramount necessity by the U.S.O.C., whose officials feared that corporate support might swoon after the Atlanta Olympics and that the U.S.O.C.'s quadrennial budget of $400 million could shrink by as much as $100 million.
With Salt Lake City as host, the U.S.O.C. has made $54.5 million from its cut of television rights fees and expects to earn approximately $193 million more in cash and supplies in a joint marketing agreement. Not until November of 1997 -- two years after the Salt Lake vote -- did the U.S.O.C. institute a formal policy limiting gifts to officials by bid cities to $50 in one phase of the bid process and $150 in another.
"Did my predecessors fall down on the job?" said Bill Hybl, the U.S.O.C. president. "In the future, we're going to do a great deal more."
 
A Secretive Management Style
There is growing evidence that Mr. Samaranch was aware of improprieties in the bidding process. Mr. Pound said he had once been offered a $1 million bribe during television rights negotiations for the Games and had informed Mr. Samaranch. But no disciplinary action was taken. Paul Henderson, who headed Toronto's unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Summer Games, said that Mr. Samaranch approved an arrangement in which the Toronto bid committee paid the rent for the husband of Pirjo Haggman, an I.O.C. member from Finland. She resigned last Tuesday.
Mr. Samaranch has both democratized the Olympic movement by providing more opportunities for women and athletes from developing nations, and has made it more elitist with his autocratic, secretive management style. He has said that the Olympic movement is more important than the Catholic Church, and he threw a $16 million party in 1994 to celebrate the I.O.C.'s centennial congress, two years after athletes were left to swelter in an un-air-conditioned village at the 1992 Summer Games in his native Spain.
"They don't want to catch too many people," Arnold Beckett, a former member of the I.O.C.'s medical commission, said of the committee's attitude toward doping. "It won't look good."
The same criticism has been applied to corruption. His detractors believe that Mr. Samaranch didn't want to know. Or didn't want to act. He said he received only rumors. Either way, everything he built has begun to collapse.
"The I.O.C. needs to worry about losing the magic of the Olympics," said Charlie Battle, who was in charge of international relations for the Atlanta Olympic organizing committee. "As they have become such big business and have become so obsessed with being big and having the best athletes, they have lost a little of the magic of bringing the whole world together in the interest of peace. They don't think people will pay big money for that. To me, that's all they've got."

After decades of neglect and deferred maintenance that left New York City schools crumbling, leaky, shabby and sometimes dangerous, the State Legislature created the School Construction Authority in 1988 with a mandate to resurrect the vast archipelago of 1,100 aging public school buildings by Jan. 1, 2000.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo went to a Harlem school, a Gothic 1901 pile of decrepit walls and broken windows, to sign the law that stripped the Board of Education of school construction tasks and assigned the authority to restore the system and build scores of new schools. Speakers portrayed the future in rosy terms: billions of dollars to come over the next decade, a new beginning for a million pupils. 
 But 10 years and $7 billion later, critics say, the reality is still a bleak portrait of dilapidated, sometimes hazardous schools; of cost overruns and endless delays; of rapid turnover in the agency's leadership, and of waste, inefficiency and incompetence in hundreds of school projects.
And yesterday, Gov. George E. Pataki -- citing systemic failures, horror stories of children lunching in cafeterias under umbrellas, and allegations of attendance records falsified by bureaucrats to inflate their budgets -- ordered a sweeping investigation of school construction in the city.
For years, politicians, educators and parents have called for an overhaul of the school construction process, and with many projects coming in years late, millions over budget and poorly executed, they have had plenty of ammunition. Critics have pointed to many causes: unqualified contractors, poor site supervision, too little money, and policy decisions beyond the authority's control.
In a 71,000-word report this month, the Board of Education pronounced the state of the city schools generally poor -- one-third needed major exterior work and another third had antiquated electrical wiring and ancient coal furnaces -- and said that, at best, the schools might be in fair condition after a five-year, $11 billion rebuilding effort that would require Federal, state and city help.
The authority, whose three trustees are named by the governor, the mayor and the city schools chancellor, has had some successes, building 43 new schools and creating new classrooms for more than 70,000 students. By contrast, the Board of Education, starved by the city's financial crisis, built only two schools between 1975 and 1988.
Moreover, by offering incentives for early completion of work and imposing penalties for poor performance, the authority said last year that it had reduced the number of projects behind schedule to 33 percent, from a staggering 88 percent in 1996. It has replaced scores of project managers to improve supervision, and has said it could do better if burdensome rules were lifted.
Still, the authority has been plagued by problems. The Board of Education identifies projects the authority must undertake, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sets the authority budgets, which fluctuate like yo-yos, and 70 percent of the contractors who responded to a survey said they would not bid for school work.
With accounts of one bungled job after another, the renovation of Erasmus Hall, the city's oldest high school, has become a paradigm case. Design began in 1985, but construction did not start until 1992. It was a $22 million fix-up that would take three years. But asbestos was discovered, the board ordered the authority to drastically redraft its plans in 1994 and delay piled upon delay.
The project is still ongoing, the cost is now upward of $100 million and officials hope for completion before the turn of the century. In the meantime, teachers and students have been bombarded by noise and dust, plastic tarpaulins have been used to stop leaks in a computer lab and rainstorms bring out umbrellas for students eating in the cafeteria.
"It is time to demand better," the Governor said yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S TRIAL: THE CONSERVATIVES;
Where the President's Sins Aren't Winked At and a Terrible Price Is Feared

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: PENDLETON, S.C., Jan. 23

 BODY:
In this stretch of the Bible Belt where highways are punctuated with billboards about "Heaven. Hell. The Choice Is Yours," it has been one bad week.
What hurts most is the impeachment trial in Washington. It has become painfully obvious here that the Senate will not convict President Clinton. In this community that perceives itself as a fire wall against indecency, many people sound despondent. They say the nation will pay a terrible price for winking at the President's sins. 
 Almost as hurtful are Mr. Clinton's soaring approval ratings. With poll after poll reminding them that they are out of step with the rest of the country, people here say they feel isolated. Many suspect that the polls are rigged.
Johnny Landreth Jr., owner of Landreth Appliances, said he is convinced that Americans want the President removed, no matter what the polls say. "Either the pollsters are asking the wrong questions or this country is so wrong morally that we are going down the tubes," said Mr. Landreth, who was eating a fried-chicken lunch beneath the "Absolutely No Profanity" sign at Bill's Cafe on Highway 76.
Rubbing salt in the week's wounds, as people here perceive it, was that "show business" State of the Union speech that polls said Americans loved so much, along with the endless broadcasts of the President's lawyers attacking the House case against Mr. Clinton.
About two-thirds of voters here and across the state disapprove of Mr. Clinton and want him removed by the Senate, according to an early January poll by Richard Quinn, a Republican political consultant.
"South Carolina is immune to Bill Clinton's charms," said Mr. Quinn, whose office is in Columbia, S.C., and who has done Presidential polling here since 1980. "We know him too well. He is seen by voters here as the prototype of the Southern con artist."
This state is one of the most conservative in the South. Since 1964, with the exception of Jimmy Carter's first campaign, voters have not chosen a Democrat in a Presidential election. The State Legislature in 1996 banned same-sex marriages. That same year the Greenville County Council, representing one of the state's most prosperous regions, declared homosexuality incompatible with community standards.
Political antipathy toward Mr. Clinton's policies and religious outrage over his involvement with a White House intern have mingled here in the western edge of the state with home-grown pride in the case for conviction. Representative Lindsey Graham, a Republican who serves this part of the state, is one of the House prosecutors, or managers, making oral arguments against Mr. Clinton.
People here smile with satisfaction when describing Mr. Graham's just-folksy arguments against the President in the Senate chamber last Saturday.
Speaking by phone from Washington, Mr. Graham said he can feel the rage that's bubbling up across his district over Mr. Clinton's likely acquittal in the Senate.
"It is pretty tough," said Mr. Graham, who gets angry calls whenever he concedes on talk shows that the President's defenders may have a point. "They are letting me know in no uncertain terms what they think of this guy. There is probably nothing I could say about the President that would be too out of bounds for my constituents."
In Bill's Cafe, Mr. Landreth's wife, Linda, describes Mr. Clinton's probable acquittal as a frightening signal of trouble ahead.
The President's behavior, she said, is a modern-day re-enactment of the biblical story of David, king of the Israelites, and Bathsheba, a married woman not his wife.
"He looked at Bathsheba and instead of going back in his house, he sent for her and had adultery with her and the Lord made him pay," Mrs. Landreth said. "Now, why was Clinton with Monica Lewinsky when he should have been in his own house with Hillary? I think it means that this country is going to go down."
The Third Congressional District, which Mr. Graham represents, which snakes along the state's western border with Georgia, from the Savannah River nuclear power site up to the North Carolina border, percolates with of religious and entrepreneurial zeal.
"The regional economy is as good as we can remember in our lifetimes," said Burrell Nelson, head of the Economic Development Alliance of Pickens County.
Unemployment, at 2.8 percent, is far below the national average. Mr. Nelson said that a boom in metal-working, plastics and chemical industries means that just 1,500 people are without jobs in a county of 104,000. The region has also been inundated with retirement and vacation development, as well as new industrial parks and shopping malls.
But the Up County, as it is called here, has clung tenaciously amid the boom to its fundamentalist Christian roots. On every highway there are billboards and church signs warning, "Watch Thoughts Before They Become Works," and asking, "Troubled? Have You Tried Prayer?"
At the Feed Place cafe in the town of Pickens, where a "meat and three" -- that is, a choice of meat and three vegetables -- goes for $5.25, the men's room does not have condom machines. Instead, there are "salvation" brochures stacked on the toilet. They show a life preserver labeled "CHRIST" being thrown to a man swimming in a stormy sea labeled "SIN."
National indifference to sin is a nagging problem that several top students at Pickens High School say they worry about, especially as it applies to what Mr. Clinton has been up to in Washington.
"If the President can commit perjury and get away with it, does that mean the next President can do something even worse and get away with it?" asked Amy Garrison, 17, a senior who has been admitted to nearby Clemson University.
Echoing an argument Mr. Graham made on the Senate floor last Saturday, Ms. Garrison said, "If the Senate can kick out Federal judges for lying and obstructing justice, why should the President be above the law?"
In Mr. Graham's home town of Seneca, where about 80 churches serve a population of 12,000 people, Pastor Bill Rinehart of the United Assembly of God Church said his congregants are struggling to perform their Christian duty to "love and accept" the President.
That duty conflicts with the equally important Christian obligations to teach values to children, Mr. Rinehart said.
"How do you do this when the President is a sociopath?" asked Mr. Rinehart . "Anarchy has got to be somewhere down the road."
The pastor compared Mr. Clinton's future to that of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, whose execution by a firing squad was broadcast to the world in 1989.
Mr. Rinehart said that while he is "frustrated" by national polls showing that the President is more popular than ever, there are countless precedents showing that majorities can be horribly mistaken.
"The Roman Empire fell because the majority of the people were hedonistic and self-gratifying," Mr. Rinehart said, adding that he finds disturbing American parallels to Rome's fall, in particular the public's willingness to put economic good times above "honor and truth."
Irked but less apocalyptic, Ralph Gleaton, Pickens County assistant prosecutor, said the expected acquittal of the President in the Senate reminds him of criminal cases he has lost.
"It's the same frustration I felt when I believed a jury knew a defendant to be guilty and chose to let him go anyway," said Mr. Gleaton, a prosecutor for four years.
Mr. Gleaton, though, said he had learned to live with losing cases that, in a just world, he should have won. In the same fashion, he expects that he and other angry people in South Carolina will figure out a way to live with the President's survival.
"I got to tell you, in all honesty, I don't worry about it that much," Mr. Gleaton said. "If he is not convicted, the sun will still rise in the east and my dog will still lick my face."

HEADLINE: Health Programs and Education Get Help in Whitman's Budget

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
With an extra $1.1 billion to spend in the coming fiscal year, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman will recommend giving a quarter of it back to taxpayers and using most of the rest to cover increased spending for public schools, state colleges, open space preservation and expanded health care programs for children and the elderly, New Jersey officials said today.
The Governor's $19.1 billion spending plan, outlined today by senior administration officials, includes $200 million to cover the first installment of the property tax rebate plan that she announced this month. Mrs. Whitman will formally present her budget to the Legislature on Monday. 
 The strong economy and proceeds from the nationwide tobacco settlement have helped swell the state's coffers and push up revenue forecasts for the next 18 months, said State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr.
Of the $92 million that New Jersey expects to receive next year from the tobacco settlement, Governor Whitman will recommend spending $18.6 million for new programs aimed at reducing smoking among teen-agers, Mr. DiEleuterio said. The state is to collect $7.6 billion over the next 25 years as part of the settlement of a class-action suit against the major tobacco companies.
Also, Mr. DiEleuterio said the Governor would propose using $36.4 million to cover increases in the cost of health benefits for state employees. The remaining money would be used for new mental health programs for state prisoners, early cancer screening, expanded health care for elderly residents, and other programs.
Spending would rise about 4.5 percent, including money that Mrs. Whitman and state lawmakers have said they intend to return to taxpayers this year. Mrs. Whitman has also recommended that $750 million be placed in the state's so-called "rainy day" reserve fund.
In addition to the $200 million for the property tax rebate program, Mrs. Whitman's budget includes $23 million for a program that freezes property taxes for low-income elderly and disabled homeowners. The budget also accommodates a $22 million tax cut, proposed by Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican, which would excuse about 200,000 low-income residents from paying state income taxes.
In terms of new spending, Mrs. Whitman is proposing a $317.7 million increase for public schools, $70.7 million for state colleges and universities, $100 million for open space preservation, $10 million for new initiatives to help spur residential development in cities, and $30 million for expanded health care programs for low-income children and the elderly. "With this, her sixth budget, it is fair to say that Governor Whitman's vision of a government that balances fiscal prudence with social compassion has succeeded," said John Farmer, the Governor's chief counsel.
Under the proposed budget, there would be no layoffs of state workers. State aid to municipalities would also rise by $23 million, the first significant increase since Mrs. Whitman took office. The increase includes money, requested by Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican, to cover routine inflationary increases for municipal services. The budget also sets aside up to $35 million in incentives for the state's 566 municipalities to reduce costs by sharing more services, like police and fire departments.
William Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said the budget "appears to be pretty good news, but we have to fully evaluate the details."
When Governor Whitman unveiled her five-year property tax rebate plan in her State of the State address, she undercut one of the Democrats' most effective campaign weapons: the state's high property tax rates.After her bruising re-election campaign in 1997, Mrs. Whitman promised voters that she would help reduce the property tax burden.
Under the plan, Mrs. Whitman would begin sending rebate checks to homeowners this year. The checks, which would average about $120 this year, would eventually rise to $600 in the fifth year of the program at a cost of $1 billion for that year.
Some critics say that Mrs. Whitman, whose second and final term ends in 2002, should not have proposed a program whose costs will rise steeply after she leaves office. They say it is the latest in a series of moves that she has made over the last six years that push costs, like debt service payments, into future years.
Some Democratic lawmakers said Mrs. Whitman should consider speeding up the property tax rebate schedule, considering the state's rosy revenue picture. "We have enough money to do more right now," said Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr. of Jersey City.
Mr. Charles also said that Democrats are encouraged by what he called the "Governor's professed conversion" on property taxes. "But we remain skeptical about the way she is proposing to spend the revenue windfalls arising from these heady economic times and her fiscal policy of increased borrowing," he said.
Mr. Charles said he expected debate over how the proceeds from the tobacco settlement should be spent. Under the agreement, states can largely spend the money however they want.
When asked why Mrs. Whitman had proposed using some of the tobacco settlement money to pay for health benefits for state employees, Mr. Farmer said it was part of the Governor's plan to put all of the proceeds into health programs.
Mr. Collins, the Assembly Speaker, described the proposal as a "very good budget."
"It has a lot of aid to help citizens in various communities," he said. "I am particularly pleased with the increase in the higher education budget. I am also pleased that there are no layoffs."
Mr. DiEleuterio said that the strong economy has pushed up revenue estimates by $275 million for this fiscal year, which ends on June 30. He said the state, anticipating strong growth but at a more moderate pace during the next 18 months, is expecting that revenues will be $897 million more in the new fiscal year. "This has been the best two-year period, 1997 and 1998, in the last 10 years," he said.
He said most of the money is coming from growing sales, income and corporate tax collections. He said half of the increase in state income tax collections can be attributed to the Wall Street economic boom.
State Senator Bernard F. Kenny, a Democrat from Hoboken who is a member of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, said Democrats would "monitor the plan closely," considering that the budget is heavily dependent on the economy. "It would be a tragedy for the taxpayers of New Jersey if the benefits of a thriving national economy were squandered on election-year gimmicks," he said.

HEADLINE: Social Security Plan Is Too Timid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
How nice that everybody in Washington wants to save Social Security. The conservatives want to privatize it, make it voluntary or reduce its benefits. The President wants to add billions in budget surpluses to its trust fund, investing a good part in the stock market (editorial, Jan. 22). 
 But "saving" Social Security is unnecessary. Its allegedly impending bankruptcy is based on a myth concocted by the Administration: that economic growth in the United States will slow to Depression-era levels. One of the myth's originators, former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, recently called this assumption "wildly pessimistic," as indeed it is. Given a reasonable forecast of only 2.2 percent annual growth in gross domestic product, Social Security will be solvent for as long as anyone dares predict.

HEADLINE: Social Security Plan Is Too Timid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Lester C. Thurow (Op-Ed, Jan. 18) questions why Americans are feeling so rich that spending levels have risen to the point where we have a negative savings rate. He points out that "the bottom 60 percent of Americans cannot benefit from the market boom since they don't own any stock." What he doesn't understand is that people at the lower rungs of the economic ladder don't spend based on what they have but on their ability to remain employed.
While it may be true that most Americans don't directly benefit from the rising stock market, all the good financial news increases their confidence that they will have jobs six months from now. 
 They can overreach a little and catch up over time.
Unemployment may have been lower in 1961 and 1962, when savings rates were higher, but Americans didn't have 10 cable news channels and the Internet from which to get rosy financial news.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bruce Bartlett ("Why Won't Clinton Cut Taxes?", Op-Ed, Jan. 19) makes some inappropriate comparisons to buttress his case that Federal taxes are too high on working people. He compares the average Federal tax burden in 1998, when incomes were high, to the recession years 1992 and 1983, when incomes were low. Tax rates decrease as incomes fall so that they are always lower during recessions. 
 Most important, he neglects to mention that the reason why tax rates for working-class families have not declined more since the 1980's is that tax relief has been focused on the well-to-do, including the latest capital gains reduction and tax relief for college tuition payments.

ALL THE LAWS BUT ONE
Civil Liberties in Wartime.
By William H. Rehnquist.
Illustrated. 254 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $26. 
 In the early hours of May 25, 1861, a Maryland state legislator named John Merryman was arrested in connection with an attempt to disrupt the transport of Union troops from Baltimore to Washington. Merryman was held at Fort McHenry, under the command of Gen. George Cadwalader. The day after his arrest, Merryman's lawyer obtained a writ of habeas corpus, directing General Cadwalader to produce the prisoner so that a Federal court could examine the case for his detention. The general instead sent one of his officers to say that he was authorized by the President of the United States to suspend habeas corpus during the present emergency in Maryland. (What President Abraham Lincoln had actually commanded was that the resistance in Maryland was to be counteracted by "the most prompt and efficient means . . . even, if necessary . . . the bombardment of their cities and, in the extremest necessity, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.") The judge responded by ordering that the general himself be brought by force to the courtroom.
A United States marshal went to Fort McHenry to serve the writ of attachment, but -- not surprisingly -- he returned empty-handed. General Cadwalader would not receive him. The judge considered whether it would be worth forming a posse to bring the general into court but decided against it, fearing that the posse would be resisted with superior force. Instead, he delivered an opinion stating that the President did not have the authority to suspend habeas corpus. He sent a copy of his decision to the White House, reminding the President of his sworn duty "to take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Lincoln made no direct response to the court, nor did his Administration appeal the decision. (And the Army certainly did not release Merryman.) But in a speech to Congress on July 4, the President presented his critics with a challenge. The laws as a whole were being resisted in this rebellion, he said. Are "all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the Government itself go to pieces, lest that one" -- habeas corpus -- "be violated?"
In those days, Justices of the Supreme Court sometimes sat as Federal circuit judges. The judge in the case of Merryman was Roger Taney, Chief Justice of the United States, and the author of the infamous Dred Scott decision (which in 1857 had held that African-Americans could not be citizens). Needless to say, Northern opinion was as outraged by Taney's decision in Merryman as it was by the earlier infamy. The New York Times thundered that the case presented "the ungracious spectacle of . . . the soldier eager to punish, and the jurist to exculpate a traitor." Nevertheless, five years later (after the Union victory and with a Lincoln appointee -- Salmon P. Chase -- as Chief Justice) the Supreme Court reached essentially the same conclusion as Taney in a case called Ex Parte Milligan. "The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace. . . . The Government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence." Habeas corpus could be suspended, but only by Congress; and even then, the majority said, civilians could not be held by the Army for trial before a military tribunal, not even if the charge was fomenting an armed uprising in a time of civil war.
William H. Rehnquist is 16th in the line of Chief Justices that includes Taney and Chase. With "All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime," he has written a book that explores Lincoln's situation, not primarily through legal or philosophical analysis but by taking us through the variety of cases, from the 1860's to the 1940's, in which civil liberty issues in time of war have arisen.
The book is mainly narrative history, giving us an account of the Civil War cases, the cases that arose during and immediately after World War I and the cases that challenged the imposition of martial law in Hawaii and the removal and internment of Japanese-Americans in the Western states during World War II. Actually, that summary is a little misleading. There are 13 chapters on the 1860's and only five on the 20th-century cases: indeed, there are fewer than 30 pages on the World War II internments, compared with more than 60 on the Milligan case alone. That makes the book a little lopsided, the more so because the disparity is never explained by the author.
Still, Rehnquist presents full and fascinating human profiles of the major participants in these cases -- the statesmen, the soldiers, the suspects, their lawyers and the judges -- and a level of detail about the hearings and the decisions that provides the reader with some understanding of what it must have been like to grapple with these issues in a time of crisis. Not least is the sense that we get, in a case like Merryman, of what a clash between the executive and the judiciary is actually like: this provides a healthy reminder of how much we usually rely, in the last resort, on executive submission in upholding the rule of law.
In places, perhaps, there is a bit too much detail: at times it seems Rehnquist wants to write like J. Anthony Lukas in "Big Trouble," giving us a history of everything that is mentioned in the history and a background to everything that is furnished as background. Do we really need to know that the author of the majority opinion in Milligan went to stay with his uncle, an Episcopal rector, when he was 5? Or to be reminded, at the beginning of the chapter on Japanese internments, about ruinous inflation in Germany after the Kaiser's abdication in 1918? Readers will find themselves flipping rather impatiently through some of these pages.
But if they are looking for provocative opinions or predictions -- what this Chief Justice will do if a case like Milligan or Korematsu (the most famous of the World War II Japanese internment cases) ever comes before his Court -- they will be disappointed. Rehnquist is quite sparing in his commentary. He criticizes the Supreme Court majority in Milligan for holding that Congress had no power to permit trials of civilians by military tribunals in time of war, but mainly because that issue was not presented on the strict facts of the case. And the courts, he says, should not decide constitutional questions unnecessarily. He does speculate that maybe "Congress should be able to provide for trial of defendants by a judge without a jury" -- something like the Diplock courts in Northern Ireland -- "in a carefully limited class of cases dealing with national security in wartime." But this is not a suggestion he explores in any detail. He agrees with Judge Learned Hand's insistence in one of the World War I cases that the courts should resist any attempt by the Government to equate strongly worded criticism of conscription with advocacy of resistance to it. And he offers a helpful analysis of the Japanese-American cases by suggesting, first, a distinction between discrimination against groups of citizens and discrimination against aliens, and second, a distinction between a policy of evacuating people from coastal areas and a policy of continuing detention.
Most important, Rehnquist expresses concern about the alacrity with which the Roosevelt Administration accepted the military's advice about the dangers posed by Japanese nationals and citizens of Japanese ancestry. The President's approval of internment was "perfunctory," given in the course of a telephone conversation. As Attorney General Francis Biddle said later: "I do not think he was much concerned with the gravity or implications of this step. He was never theoretical about things. What must be done to defend the country must be done."
A nation that prides itself on the principle of civilian control of the military should recognize that concern for civil liberties is as much the job of the President as the courts. If it is, as Rehnquist suggests, the task of public opinion to insure that both branches take these issues seriously, then he can be congratulated for providing in a very readable form some of the material they will need for the responsible fulfillment of that duty.

HEADLINE: BEYOND THE CANAL, PANAMA PRISTINE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FINKEL; MICHAEL FINKEL is the author of "Alpine Circus" to be published by Lyons this year.

 BODY:
I WENT to Panama on a hunch last September, which was pretty much the only way I could go. Reliable travel information about the country was surprisingly difficult to find.
The nation receives no more than a thin chapter in any guidebook I could locate and an Internet search proved equally anemic. Even the most peripatetic of my acquaintances could furnish no advice. To me, this was heartening. I am a selfish traveler -- I prefer to be surrounded by as few of my fellow itinerants as possible -- and the less I was able to learn about Panama the more interested I became. 
 My hunch was that Panama was similar to Costa Rica, only without the tourists. The two nations share a 150-mile-long border and the same entrancing blend of landscapes: extensive rain forests, lush mountain ranges, reef-laden coastlines. And while Costa Rica is famed for its eco-consciousness, Panama, I discovered, has quietly established 16 national parks and 8 other natural reserves in the last 25 years.
Panama has set aside nearly one-third of its total land area as protected areas, according to the guidebooks, which makes it one of the world's most preserved countries. And yet, when I perused classified ads for tours, I counted 11 outfitters headed for Costa Rica, yet not a single offer for a Panama trip. (This disparity may soon change, as Panama has embarked on a concerted effort to attract visitors, including the opening of a tourist bureau in the United States, near Miami.)
I did have a few concerns about my trip. It was less than 10 years ago that President George Bush, in response to the killing of a United States marine by Panamanian soldiers and a declaration of war against the United States by the legislature, launched an invasion of Panama City, and a mere seven years since the end of Manuel Noriega's cocaine-financed paramilitary regime.
The State Department advised travelers that some regions near the Colombian border may be dangerous and that there is occasional anti-American sentiment in the country. But it said that crime in Panama City is typical of metropolitan areas and made no mention of the areas I wanted to see. I wasn't sure whether Panama's reputation as dangerous was warranted, but there was only one good way to find out.
I met my friend and occasional travel partner Katinka de Ruiter in Atlanta, and we caught the easy four-hour flight into Panama City. It was not the high tourist time -- December through April is the so-called summer dry season -- but even so, the airplane was eerily empty.
Panama City is an unfortunate introduction to Panama. It's a loud, unattractive metropolis, the streets dominated by buses that have been airbrushed in spasms of jarring colors, like graffitied subway cars. Each bus is independently owned and decorated, and they bolt from one stop to the next drag-race style. Crossing the street is often a death-defying sprint.
Even the colonial part of the city, established by the Spanish in the 17th century and known as Casco Viejo (Old Crown) but referred to in English as the Colonial Quarter, is seedy and charmless. At least a dozen people warned us not to venture out at night. My first impression was that I'd made a poor choice of a vacation destination.
Still, there was an intriguing vibrancy to the city. An entire district of Panama City consists of modern skyscrapers housing international banks, and the nearby Panama Canal (which will revert to full Panamanian control at the end of this year) is a steady source of employment and income. There are casinos and high-priced nightclubs and Wal-Marts. Shops and markets were bustling. Salsa music seemed to float in and out with the sea breeze.
Spanish is the national language, but almost everyone speaks a little English. Here and there, I spotted members of the Kuna tribe, the most distinctive of Panama's five indigenous peoples. The Kuna men wear standard Western garb, but the women wear dozens of beaded bracelets on both arms and both legs, thick gold nose rings and billowing blouses embroidered with dazzling, joyous tapestries called molas that reminded me of Keith Haring's distinctive painting style.
I sampled street food from a half-dozen places -- empanadas (meat-stuffed turnovers); ceviche (heavily marinated raw fish); ropa vieja (literally "old clothes," Panama's version of fajitas) -- and drank the water, safe and delicious, straight from public taps. We hopped a short bus ride to the Miraflores Locks and watched an oil tanker complete part of its 10-hour journey through the canal.
But we had come to see the countryside, not the city. The day after we arrived, that was our first order of business. We took a bus west, over the canal on the soaring, steel Bridge of the Americas, and out of the city.
Panama is an unusually shaped country, long and narrow and curled at both ends, like a tilde. Panama City is on the Pacific coast, halfway between the Colombia border, to the east, and the Costa Rica border, to the west. West of the city was a stretch of grazing lands and then the mountains rose up, gentle and treed, and the land became increasingly fertile, the roadside lined with coffee groves and fields of sugar cane.
Though the traffic was light and the Inter-American Highway was newly paved, we arrived in David, capital city of Panama's southwestern province of Chiriqui, two hours late -- the 200-mile trip took seven hours instead of the scheduled five. No one on the bus seemed even mildly perturbed.
We caught another bus north, out of David -- where, in the space of less than a block, we passed a banana seller guiding his overloaded mule toward the market and then roared by a brightly lighted Internet cafe -- and into the mountains. Both Katinka and I are amateur mountaineers (if the required equipment is nothing more than decent footwear we'll give it a shot), and our destination was Boquete, a small town an hour from David at the base of Volcan Baru National Park, site of Panama's tallest peak and sole volcano. We'd been told by several people that the summit of Volcan Baru, elevation 11,401 feet, is the only place in the world from which both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be seen, and so singular or not, that tidbit was enough to put us in a hiking mood.
Boquete is a gem. The town, population 3,000, is snuggled high in the fertile foothills of Volcan Baru. Both the coffee and the oranges grown here are purported to be the finest in Panama. The Rio Caldera meanders through, bubbling alongside pastel-painted homes and tiny cafes; flowers grow everywhere, and the air, free of the smothering humidity of the Panamanian lowlands, carries the taste of jasmine. There are hot springs nearby and a volcano overhead and the people walking the streets had the relaxed, satisfied glow of health spa denizens. It has been claimed that several residents of Boquete have lived more than 115 years, and I choose to believe it.
Katinka and I rented a simple room, with a cold-water shower and a clear view of Baru, at the adorable Pension Topas. It cost $10 a night; a generous and healthy breakfast -- homemade bread, locally grown oranges -- was an additional $3 each. (The official currency is the United States dollar, but it is generally referred to as the balboa.) The proprietor, a German named Axel who spent his first six years in Panama as a tomato farmer before opening the Topas in 1992, told me that the last few years, under the presidency of Ernesto Balladares, have been a time of unprecedented prosperity. The roads, the schools, the economy, all, Axel said, have been overhauled.
In the morning, we visited Cafe Time, a hole in the wall (literally), and fortified ourselves with rich local coffee. Then, for a couple of dollars, we hired a ride on the back of a pickup truck to the entrance of the 35,336-acre Volcan Baru National Park (and made an agreement with the driver to return for us at sunset).
I'd never been in a situation where I wanted more people to be in a national park, but there was not a single person anywhere, not even a park ranger. A field worker coming up the road, machete in hand, explained that Panama saw so few tourists in low season that many national parks were unstaffed and that any group that happened by was welcome to hike or camp, without charge. The path to the summit, he said, is simple to follow.
And so we climbed the volcano, a nine-hour round-trip hike during which we saw only two other tourists, both young men from Panama City. The first several miles were in thick rain forest, and we ascended accompanied by a pleasing soundtrack -- a jungle chorus of dripping and chirping and buzzing and squawking. Then mist began threading through the treetops and soon the forest started to steam, and finally the clouds let loose and the rain came down.
It fell with a force I had never before experienced; it was like standing under a waterfall. The hiking path turned into a roiling brown river. Our waterproof jackets became waterlogged. Then, as quickly as it started, the rain stopped. And by the time we scrambled up a steep section of boulder-steps to reach the large cross marking the highest point of Panama, the clouds were in full retreat and with only a turn of our heads we could look north or south and see the shores of the two great oceans of the world.
The next day, we took the bus down out of the mountains and then north along the highway in Bocas del Toro Province. Within a matter of hours, we were at the edge of the Caribbean Sea and in a different world. At the rough-edged fishing town of Chiriqui Grande, we hired a water taxi (about $10 each) to take us on the 40-minute trip to Isla Bastimentos, one of the larger islands of the 200 or so in the compact Bocas del Toro archipelago.
There are two major Caribbean island groups in Panama -- the Bocas del Toro, in the far west, and the San Blas, east of Panama City, home of the Kuna people, who run the islands as an autonomous province, with their own language and system of governance, and who grow what are purported to be some of the tastiest coconuts in the world. Katinka and I finished our Panama trip with a very brief visit to the San Blas (I can confirm the coconut claim), but we first went to Bocas del Toro to explore Bastimentos National Park. The park, founded in 1988 as Panama's first marine preserve, serves to protect the beaches used as nesting grounds by three species of sea turtles, as well as miles of delicate coral reefs.
There is a tiny village on Isla Bastimentos, home to maybe 200 people. A cement path connects all the houses, which are on stilts and have thatched roofs. Every family has a dugout canoe, used to travel from island to island -- fishermen deliver their catches to nearby Isla Carenero, which we were told has the finest seafood restaurants around.
There are palm trees and banana trees and bushes blooming with fireworks of huge red flowers. The local language is called Guari-guari, a crazy mixture of English and Spanish and the native Guaym tongue. Chickens ran loose; brilliant butterflies flitted about. A tiny shop sold bananas for a penny apiece. Children played on a small soccer pitch and on a basketball court, where the basket was nailed to a palm tree.
I walked the length of the village path and everyone waved hello. Two people told me they had once moved to America and didn't like it, and came right back to Bastimentos. A calypso band was jamming in the town bar. A glass of rum cost 75 cents. There were no souvenirs for sale, no T-shirt shops, no one trying to serve as a guide.
We took a room ($10) at the Pension Bastimentos, which was also run by a German couple, Tom and Ena Reichelt. The pension was built atop a dock, and the waves broke onto shore under our room's floorboards. There were no locks on the doors, no glass in the windows. Otti, the Reichelt's parrot, would occasionally hop through the window frame and squawk out a greeting.
Ena said we had arrived just in time for dinner, and we were in for a treat -- several bush rats, a native rodent, had recently been trapped, and she was combining the meat with some iguana to make a pasta sauce. "Bush rat is my specialty," she said. It had a distinct flavor -- something like smoked duck -- and the Panama rum went well with it.
We awoke to the sound of roosters, purchased a few bunches of bananas, and set off across the island in search of quiet beaches. Twenty feet beyond the last house in town, we were in thick jungle. Lizards skittered along tree branches. Neon frogs -- red with black dots, and no bigger than a thimble -- bounded through the underbrush. Leaf-cutter ants marched along the narrow trail, each carrying a piece of palm frond that looked like a green flag.
It took less than half an hour to reach the first beach, one of 11 on the island. The sand was pure white and extended along a bay for nearly a mile. Wave-polished sea shells and chunks of brain coral were strewn about; pelicans dived into the warm sea. But what I found most satisfying -- what made me feel I'd had a lucky, brilliant intuition about Panama -- is that on this particular beach, on this particular day, nobody else was there.
 
Crossing the Big Ditch to mountains and beaches
The Panama Tourist Bureau has opened an office near Miami. You can contact it for brochures and general information at Post Office Box 144351, Coral Gables, Fla. 33114; (800) 557-0017, fax (305) 854-4589. In Panama City, the bureau's number is (507) 226-7000, fax (507) 226-4002. Information on the Web is available at www.panamatours.com.
Lonely Planet has just published a guidebook to Panama ($16.95). It also offers "Central America on a Shoestring" ($19.95), which includes Panama information; call (510) 893-8555 or see www.lonelyplanet.com.
Panama gets more visitors during the dry season, mid-December through April, than other times. If you would like to have huge national parks virtually all to yourself, then go during the rainy season, May through November. I was there in September, and while it did rain nearly every day, the showers lasted only an hour or so, and left the air feeling scrubbed and fresh-smelling.
To witness Panama at its most festive, visit during carnival, the weekend before Ash Wednesday, which is Feb. 17 this year.
 
Getting There and Around
A number of major airlines, including American and Continental, fly to Panama City from the United States.
It's easy and inexpensive to fly domestically -- tickets are rarely more than $50 one way. Reservations can be made the same day, and the longest flight is less than an hour. Aeroperlas, (507) 263-5363, is the major domestic airline.
 
Where to Stay and Eat
There are dozens of hotels in Panama City, ranging in price from the 185-room Miramar Intercontinental, (507) 214-1000, where doubles start at $185 and suites are $415 to $1,700, to the Hotel Central, (507) 262-8044, in in the heart of Casco Viejo, where doubles are $11.55 a night (mine was less than pristine).
For outstanding seafood, visit the Avenue Balboa market, where you can buy a fish and have it cooked for $2 in the restaurant upstairs. The ajillo sauce is great.
In Boquete, we enjoyed the excellent and inexpensive Pension Topas, (507) 720-1005. It has six rooms, four with private baths. They are decorated with bright murals, have great views of the Volcan Baru and cost $12 to $26.40 a night. A large breakfast is $3.80
On Isla Bastimentos, in the Bocas del Toro archiepelago, the Pension Bastimentos, ($10 a night) was basic (no telephone and often, not even electricity) but friendly. Any boat taxi, though, will drop you off right at the pension's dock.
On Isla Carenero, order the catch of the day at Pago Rajo. Here, as everywhere rural we visited, it is difficult to pay even $15 for a meal. MICHAEL FINKEL

Walking in Wales
 
Q. I am planning a hiking trip to Wales this spring, and would like some general information on trails. -- Mindy Dillon, Buffalo
 
A. There are thousands of miles of walking paths throughout Wales, ranging from those that traverse the heather moorlands and mountainous terrain of the 845-square-mile Snowdonia National Park in the north, to less demanding trails that crisscross the gentle countryside of central Wales. Other popular destinations are in the western coastal regions of Pembrokeshire National Park and southern Wales' mountainous Brecon Beacons National Park. Wherever you roam, especially in the parks, you're likely to encounter abundant wildlife, including seals and numerous bird species. 
 The Wales Tourist Board publishes a free 53-page guide called "Walking Wales" that includes a selection of walks long and short, tough and easy. Nearby accommodations and a small map with Ordnance Survey references accompany each entry. Among the short walks is the four-mile St. Brides Major Walk that incorporates both inland countryside and segments of the 14-mile Glamorgan Heritage Coast in southern Wales. Sites on the route include a ruined castle, the remains of an old walled garden, the sandy beach at Dunraven Bay, traces of a Celtic settlement and an ancient church. Among the longer walks are the 182-mile Offa's Dyke Path, which crosses the England-Wales border 13 times; and the 186-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Path with its rugged cliff trails and sandy beaches.
The guide also includes a 10-page list of publications on hiking in Wales, a list of tourist office addresses and phone numbers, advice on transportation; and other useful information. It is available from the Wales Tourist Board, Department PP12, Post Office Box 1, Cardiff, Wales; telephone (44-1222) 457766, fax (44-1222) 482436.
Among the companies specializing in hiking in Wales are Acorn Activities, in Hereford, (44-1432) 830083; fax (44-1432) 830110, and Heart of Wales Farm and Country Holidays, telephone and fax (44-1686) 688444.
You may also be interested in a spring walking festival. From May 28 to 31, the Llanelli Festival of Walks will include 10 hikes along coastal paths, and through the hills of southern Wales; the walks range from 6 gentle miles to 10-mile strenuous walks. The fee is $24.50. A festival dinner costs $16. The Festival Office in Llanelli, telephone (44-1554) 770077, can provide information on lodgings in the area.
 
Brazilian Rhythm Festival
 
Q. I would like to go to the Panorama Percussivo Mundial festival in Salvador, Brazil. Please provide information. -- Mabel MacDonald, Aspen, Colo.
 
A. The six-year-old Panorama Percussivo Mundial (World Percussive Panorama, or Percpan, as it is called in Brazil) is a jubilant festival that showcases international percussion-based music -- both traditional and modern -- from Brazil, Africa, the Caribbean and other areas. Even though the festival is only two months away, promoters for the event, which will be held March 22 to 27 in Salvador, the capital of the northeastern state of Bahia, are not releasing details about international performers, with whom they're still in negotiation. It has been announced that the Brazilian songwriter Gilberto Gil and Nana Vasconcellos, a percussionist, will act as masters of ceremony.
 You're likely to see some colorful performances by musicians and dancers decked out in headdresses, feathers and flowing robes. Calabash and gourd rattles, cowbells, an exotic variety of drums, even a pair of wooden shoes, provided the rhythms for last year's festival, which included Doudou N'Diaye Rose, a Senegalese drum and dance ensemble, the Japanese group Wadaiko Yamato and the Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal.
In addition to the evening performances (there are about five a night), you can attend daily two-hour workshops, led by participating musicians.
Percpan will take place in downtown Salvador's Castro Alves theater (Praca 2 de Julho, Campo Grande). Nightly ticket prices are likely to be the same as last year: $8, $4 for students. For more information call (55-71) 243 6364, or by E-mail to percpan@e-net.com.br.
 
Rare Book Shops in Paris
 
Q. Do you know the names of bookstores in Paris that specialize in rare books? Simon Lagroste, Providence, R.I.
 
A. Most of Paris's antique book stores (called librairies) are concentrated in two distinctly different neighborhoods: on the Left Bank, in the fifth arrondissement near the Sorbonne and in the sixth arrondissement between St.-Germain-des-Pres and Odeon; and on the Right Bank in the area around the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore, as well as in the eighth and ninth arrondissements. The Left Bank shops are in a neighborhood for printers and book shops, which were established in the 15th century. At that time, the first printing press arrived in the city, and was housed in the Sorbonne.
Shops you might come across include: Alain Brieux, at 48 Rue Jacob in the sixth arrondissement. It was established at the end of the 19th century, and began specializing in rare medical and scientific books and instruments in 1958. It is open Monday to Saturday from 10 to 1 and 2 to 6:30; telephone (33-1) 42.60.21.98.
Librairie Gourmande, 4 Rue Dante in the fifth, stocks many rare books on the art of dining from the 16th century to the present. It is open every day from 10 to 7; (33-1) 43.54.37.27.
Librairie Beres, 14 Avenue Friedland in the eighth, is reputed to have the best collection of rare books from the 9th to the 20th centuries, on subjects ranging from politics and economics to literary first editions. Hours are 9 to 6 daily; (33-1) 45.63.85.53.
 Laurent Coulet, 166 Boulevard Haussmann in the eighth, specializes in handsomely bound works of French literature from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 to 12:30 and 2 to 6:30; (33-1) 42.89.51.59.
For rare maps, atlases and engravings from the 15th to the mid-19th centuries, you might want to go to the Librairie La Bail-Weissert, 5 Rue Lagrange in the fifth. The shop includes original topographical maps of the world, as well as maps of European cities, regions and a collection of architectural engravings. Hours are Monday to Saturday, from 10 to 12:30 and 2 to 7; (33-1) 43.29.72.59. SUZANNE MacNEILLE

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Stretch Market For Limousines

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THE passengers in those limousines are not all haughty film stars sipping Cosmopolitan cocktails. In the last few weeks, I heard about a Halloween birthday party where 15 costumed 8-year-olds had a ball riding to a New York restaurant in a maximo limousine. A friend, at loggerheads with a son about who would drive the second car needed to get seven people to Connecticut for Christmas dinner, hired a stretch limo for the whole group for $240 each way and was delighted with the trip and the sociability.
Even I, after years as a limo shunner, have at last seen the inside of a super stretch. At the travel agents' convention in Los Angeles in October, a hotel organization sent a long white limo to take a group of us to a reception. Lacking an alternative, I climbed aboard with nine others: three facing front, two facing back and five along the side. I have since learned that this was probably a 120-inch stretch, meaning that the sedan had been cut apart and 10 more feet of car inserted in the middle. 
 If 8-year-olds and people like me, who are neither getting married nor going to a prom, are riding in limousines, it dawned on me that things must have undergone a radical change. And indeed they have.
 
A Cost-Effective Choice
Bruce Kosman, president of 1-800-Limo-Center, a new national network of companies with headquarters in Rochelle Park, N.J., said there has been an explosion in the chauffeured-car business in the last two to three years. "When I was young, a limo was something of a luxury," he said. "Today the corporate world has realized it is the most cost-effective way to get around. If a $500,000-a-year executive is flying to someplace to close a $10 million deal, it does not make sense for him to get a rental car, figure out where he's going, drive there, find a parking place and walk in wilted." He said that estimates in the business, which is quite fragmented, put annual growth at 11 percent.
The magazine Limousine and Chauffeured Transportation, published in Torrance, Calif., reports that nationally 65 percent of company operators reported average revenue increases of 29 percent last year; 6 percent reported a decline, the rest level revenues. The magazine's editor, Sara Eastwood-McLean, said that companies now tend to buy each other out so that after 13 years of growth or stability in the total number of companies, 1998 saw a decline from 9,600 operators to 9,100.
Scott A. Solombrino, president of Dav El Chauffeured Transportation Network, with headquarters in Chelsea, Mass., said his company has grown an average of 28 percent a year for five years. The worldwide fleet, he said, totals 10,400 vehicles. Like Mr. Kosman, he said that corporate business was powering the expansion, particularly businesses' belief that resources were being wasted when executives were using rental cars.
"The second big force is the advent of the female executive," Mr. Solombrino said. "A company knows it is incurring a liability if a female C.E.O. arrives in Dallas at 11 P.M. and takes a cab to the hotel. They have demanded the use of chauffeured cars, and pretty soon everyone in the company begins to see the value of protecting all executives. Women executives are our best clients."
A third factor he cited was an out-of-control economy, saying that the same prosperity that was soaking up the first-class and business-class airline seats was causing car-service fleets to expand on the double. Right now, with gasoline prices way down, the companies are doing well and can expand. But, Mr. Solombrino said, he was not sure that growth would stay at 28 percent this year.
Dav El is business-oriented, he said: Less than 5 percent of its volume involves proms, weddings, nights on the town or gambling expeditions. In any case, he said, not many cars are sitting in the parking lot on Saturday and Sunday: Weekend corporate business has tripled in five years because so many companies now hold meetings over the weekend to take advantage of lower air fares.
Nationally, according to Limousine and Chauffeured Transportation magazine, corporate business accounted for 24 percent of the operators' income last year, airport trips 22 percent and weddings 20 percent. In 1996, corporate business was at 19 percent, airport trips 23 percent and weddings 24 percent.
Corporate clients use black sedans, most often Lincoln Town Cars, rather than the extra-long babies seen at Oscar night or prom time. On Christmas Day, when three of us needed to get from Captiva Island, Fla., to Fort Myers, and local taxis were not available, employees at the marina recommended Royal Palm Luxury Car Service. A comfortable black Town Car driven by the small company's president, Anthony Paolercio, who had a career at I.B.M. and left New York three years ago, scooped us up. He packed our luggage into the big trunk, recommended a place to buy oranges to take home, and three of us glided to our meeting spot for $75. We asked him to recommend a service as smooth and reliable as his elsewhere.
That was difficult, he said, and limo people agree, because if a recommended company proves a lemon, this could alienate a longtime customer from the original car service. So Royal Palm is part of still another of the growing number of limo networks: Empire International, in Norwood, N.J. It is headed by David Seelinger, who owns the part of the company serving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and has affiliates in 250 cities worldwide. It is growing so rapidly that the telephone message that played spoke of 100 cities, which Mr. Seelinger said was only a year out of date.
 
Plenty of Listings
The listings under Limousine Service cover most of nine pages in the Manhattan Yellow Pages, and almost four more pages of listings, some duplicates, appear under Car Service. It's pretty easy to tell which companies have contracts with corporations and law firms (clients use vouchers rather than cash) just by looking at the tags in the limo windows outside big office buildings, especially late at night on Wall Street. But the profusion of choices for the individual consumer means that a network or a trade name is a big help.
That is how 1-800-Limo-Center got into the business in July, Mr. Kosman said. After months of travel and checking into existing services in other cities, he said he was trying to think how to market directly to customers. He decided that 1-800-Flowers was the model to follow, and eventually he got American Express to be his "messenger" and put his leaflets into customer mailings.
Like the two other networks discussed here -- and there are doubtless others -- Limo Center takes reservations and credit card numbers and then bills the client for everything, including tip, so no cash is needed at the time of the ride.
The networks have varying prices and ways to respond to foul-ups, particularly cars that do not show up, but networks' basic response is to cancel the charge. Clients who do not find their cars waiting call the 800 number, according to the operators, and another car is dispatched if need be. Outside the network system, in a city like New York, when law firms and similar businesses have contracts with limo companies, they may not be able to fulfill a request if the weather turns bad, or it is a major holiday.
The big networks use airline computer systems to find out if the flights they are meeting will be severely delayed. These companies have access to buses for large groups, and also have minibuses with conference tables for business groups that want to work on the way.
Here are some details on the three networks.
1-800-Limo-Center is the company's name, and the 24-hour number translates to (800) 546-6236. The company started in July, and headquarters are at 336 West Passaic Street, Rochelle Park, N.J. 07662. It operates in the top 150 airports in the country through its links to 200 companies, 190 in the United States and the rest in London, Paris, Rome and Canada.
Prices are based on distance, which is determined by a computer program showing ZIP codes. These rates are quoted on the phone; a sheet of sample rates shows a trip from O'Hare Airport in Chicago to a downtown address in the 60618 ZIP code starts at $44 for a trip in a sedan, $74 in a 6-passenger limo and $94 in an 8- to 10-passenger limo. To Evanston, Ill., the rates are $40, $70 and $90.
To these rates, the company adds a 15 percent tip for a sedan (20 percent for longer cars) and a 10 percent processing fee. For domestic flights, the first 30 minutes of waiting time after the posted arrival is free. There is a $15 charge for meeting international flights, but no further charges for waiting time. There is a 15-minute grace period for non-airport pickups. The additional charge for each 15 minutes of waiting time is $11 for sedans and $15 for limos.
If the car does not show up in 15 minutes, the customer must call the 800 number; if no car then responds, this call avoids a no-show charge, which is the cost of the trip, the tip and waiting time. If the car never does show up, the cost of alternative transportation is paid by the company. Cancellations not made two hours or more in advance incur a charge of $44 for a sedan, $60 for a limousine.
Dav El Chauffeured Transportation Network, 200 Second Street, Chelsea, Mass. 02150, operates in 458 cities, 284 of them in the United States. The toll-free number is (800) 922-0343. Reservations may be made by phone, fax or Internet, and travel agents can reach the company on Apollo or Sabre reservation systems. The company approves customers' credit and opens an account.
In the United States and Canada, the company uses standard indexed hourly prices, which Mr. Solombrino says represent a national average. These are below the market rate in New York, he said, although they may be above elsewhere. A sedan costs $49 an hour, plus 15 percent tip. An 80-inch stretch Lincoln, holding seven people (six in two back seats, one in the front passenger seat) costs $63 an hour, plus 20 percent tip. An executive van for nine people with a table costs $63 plus a 15 percent tip. A regular passenger van for 15 people is $63 an hour, plus 15 percent. Waiting time costs the same as driving time.
Empire International, 55 Walnut Street, Norwood, N.J. 07648, (800) 451-5466, operates in 250 cities through a licensing arrangement. Outside the New York three-state area, it uses regional prices based on a computer program that gives the distance. In Chicago, for example, the trip from O'Hare to ZIP code 60618 would cost $80 in a sedan, plus a 15 percent tip. The same trip by limo or van would be $115 plus 15 percent. In smaller cities, the price is a minimum of $100, which is the two-hour minimum at $50 an hour, plus 15 percent. The company will establish individual accounts.

HEADLINE: Spies Wanted

BYLINE: By Tim Weiner; Tim Weiner is a Washington correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The phone yanked Steve Drescher from a deep slumber early on a mid-November Monday. He shook the weekend's cobwebs from his head and mumbled hello. The Central Intelligence Agency was calling.
 "Hi, remember me?" said the voice on the line. "I'm Mike. I'm with the C.I.A. We're interested in you." 
 Drescher came slowly into consciousness, wondering what the man was talking about, and why the C.I.A. was calling him -- a 19-year-old sophomore at Ohio State University. Then he dimly remembered dropping off a resume several weeks earlier with an agency recruiter on Career Day, the bustling job fair that Ohio State holds for its 48,500 students. Drescher, a budding computer programmer, had been much more focused that day on a job at Microsoft or Compuserve.
 The next night, he sat under a fluorescent light in a campus conference room, too nervous to touch his cooling pizza, listening to Mike try to convince him and 25 other students that it would be neat to be a spy.
 "I'm clueless as to what I would actually do for the C.I.A.," Drescher said to me. "The only thing I have to go on is the movies. To me, it's 'Mission: Impossible.' "
 The world's most famous intelligence service has kicked off the biggest recruiting drive in its history, digging deeply into the American landscape for a vein, a nugget, a trace of talent. Never before has it been so easy to arrange an interview with the agency: just call (800) 562-7242 ("JOBS C.I.A."), or log onto www.cia.gov. Answer the want ads in The Economist, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal -- then come on in for a lie-detector test! A few years from now, you, too, could be digging up dirt in Khartoum, skulking through the bazaars of Peshawar or poring over documents purloined from Pyongyang.
 George J. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, says he has to mount "a very aggressive way to bring people in" -- two or three thousand bright young Americans in the next few years -- or risk the slow death of American intelligence. "To do what I expect to do, to have the depth that I expect that we need to have, you have to go recruit the best and the brightest," he says.
 In fact, Tenet hopes to make the clandestine service bigger than it was at the height of the cold war, to open more overseas stations and bases, to mount more complex and more expensive secret operations. And he wants the nation's sharpest talents to come to work at C.I.A. headquarters as intelligence analysts, information technicians and in-house experts on everything from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. In sum, he aims to revitalize an agency that has been mired in a slough of despond -- terrible publicity, terrible morale, terrible credibility.
 "I will not allow the C.I.A. to become a second-rate organization," Tenet told a gathering of the agency's employees recently. By most accounts, including Tenet's, the hiring blitz is the most important internal affair on the agency's agenda for the rest of the century. Congress will pump hundreds of millions of extra dollars into the agency over the next few years to get new blood flowing.
 But success is hardly assured. With the cold war a fading memory and the C.I.A. increasingly scorned as a bungling bureaucracy, who really wants to be a spy anymore?
At the Ohio State job fair, the agency has set up a spiffy booth sandwiched between Chase Manhattan and a computer company. The recruiters hand out vaguely informative pamphlets and brochures. Fear and ignorance about the C.I.A. are rampant, judging from interviews with students at the fair.
 "People don't have a very clear idea of what they do," says Tim Paradis, 22, editor of the school paper, The Lantern. "It's a dark Government agency." Richelle Sherwood, 24, an Air Force veteran who speaks Vietnamese, says, "I don't really know a lot about them, except they do all this secret stuff." Karl Curtis, 21, an information-systems major, is intrigued but uninformed. "You've heard the rumors, you've seen the movies, you're curious about what weird things they do," he says. "I guess you'd get to know the dirty things, the cool things about the world. And a 'top secret' clearance is a really marketable skill."
 Marwan Saleh, 22, wearing a brush cut and a sharp suit, stands out. He looks as if he'd make a perfect spy. A fiercely patriotic Palestinian-American who's mellifluously fluent in Arabic, he's also a frequent visitor to the homeland, the holder of a political-science degree -- and slated to receive an M.B.A. this spring in global supply and demand. The C.I.A. would fall at his feet. But he's not likely to let them. "I'm an American Democrat," he says. "I believe as an American that it's my duty to question and help develop American policy. And the C.I.A. seems like it would be executing policy. And I can't blind myself. I have my own political views." He moves on.
 Two thousand college students parade past the booth this afternoon. Not many stop to chat. After all, the Heathers and Jennifers and Ryans and Karls are competing in a cutthroat environment, one in which the strong will be clicking their corporate keypads -- and the weak will be asking if you want fries with that shake. And considering that even the Steak 'n' Shake recruiters are offering $40,000 salaries that pay more than most C.I.A. entry-level jobs, bringing top students into the agency is no small challenge. Try as it might, the C.I.A. is going to have a tough time promoting the spy trade as just another smart career option.
The task of drawing talented people into the C.I.A. falls to four of George Tenet's most trusted men: Buzzy Krongard, a multimillionaire investor who serves as the Director's consigliere; Gil Medeiros, head of the C.I.A.'s newly created Recruitment Center; Dave Carey, the agency's executive director; and Dick Calder, its chief administrative officer. Sitting around a table on the C.I.A.'s seventh floor, in their crisp white shirts and quiet ties, they outwardly resemble Madison Avenue admen of yesteryear.
 The C.I.A.'s marketing push has yielded many new applicants: the Web site and want ads draw 50,000 resumes a year. But there's a mismatch between the people who want in and the people the agency wants to let in. Of those who formally apply, four out of five will never make it past an initial interview.
"We are not for everybody, and everybody is not for us," Medeiros says. "There are a fair number of resumes we have to throw away." Perhaps the biggest obstacle in recruiting young Americans, he says, is "the lack of awareness of history" among them. "It is amazing how little they know about us." And most of what they know is wrong: a jumble of "The X-Files," half-remembered headlines and good old-fashioned American paranoia. The recruiters know that a lot of people think the C.I.A. is some sort of secret police force, running around the United States killing people with high-tech guns. "I don't know if that is good or bad, actually," Medeiros says, and everyone laughs.
 "We do get a lot of crazies," Krongard says.
 Carey elaborates. "What you see, in the average group of 15 kids, is some who are reasonably well informed, who have looked at the Web page, who have actually tried to figure us out a little," he says. "And then there are those who think it is going to be 007."
 It never quite was 007, and it surely never will be again. Once upon a time in the cold war, the agency would never have advertised itself. It would have been unthinkable, unnecessary, unseemly. But when the hammer and sickle came down over the Kremlin, the veterans of the cold war began cleaning out their desks.
 Over the past six years, the C.I.A. has lost about 4,000 of its most experienced and skilled people: about 20 percent of its spies, analysts, scientists and technology experts. Ten years ago, the agency was probably 10 years ahead of the public sector when it came to computer capability. No longer. The agency desperately needs, right now, hundreds of computer wizards comfortable with the latest technology. But competing with the likes of Microsoft and I.B.M. is proving increasingly difficult.
 The decline has been most significant at the C.I.A.'s directorate of operations -- the clandestine service, the spies who serve abroad. At least 7 percent of the spy cadre has left the agency in each of the past six years. That adds up to about a thousand spies, and it leaves not many more than a thousand in place. The departures of hundreds of officers in their 30's and 40's were especially troubling to the C.I.A.
 This same instability has permeated the agency's top brass. No Director of Central Intelligence has served for more than two years in this decade. The whirlwind has at times left the C.I.A. directionless, a ship in irons. And bad publicity -- traitors within, snafus abroad -- further angered and depressed the agency.
 "There were tremendous internal morale problems," says John M. Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence in 1995 and 1996. "Tremendously poor morale and tremendously poor credibility."
 And as the agency went through director after director, "there was not a clear articulation of what the agency's mission would be," says John McMahon, deputy director of Central Intelligence in the 1980's. Without that clarity, the agency's spies "just wallow in their own stew" -- an unsettling state of affairs for a nation that calls itself the last great superpower.
 The accumulated miseries of the post-cold-war spy service damaged the C.I.A.'s ability to keep its best people. The agency hired about 25 new covert-operations officers in 1995, and lost six times as many to retirement. "You can't run a clandestine service worldwide if your intake is 25 a year," McMahon says. Making matters worse, in 1996, Harold J. Nicholson, a turncoat inside the agency, sold to the Russians the names of three years' worth of graduates of the C.I.A.'s internal school for spies, ruining their ability to work overseas.
 So the C.I.A. has to build a new fleet of spies. People who can hack into a computer system, pose as a cocaine kingpin, think like a terrorist, be fluent in cultures that are not American and speak silkily to people who may be murderers. It takes a special strain of Homo sapiens to do this work in secret and stay sane. A spy must know how "to use deception, to use manipulation, to use, frankly, dishonesty in the pursuit of his job," says Jeffrey Smith, the C.I.A.'s general counsel in 1995 and 1996. "The management of the agency must always worry about finding that extraordinarily rare individual who has the talent to deal in this deceptive and manipulative world and keep his or her own moral ballast."
 Finding, hiring and keeping such exceptional minds is looking increasingly difficult. "How do you recruit people like this?" asks Bob Gates, Director of Central Intelligence in 1991 and 1992. The C.I.A. has become highly bureaucratic, he says , less and less willing to admit creative oddballs -- "people that are a little different, people who are eccentric, people who don't look good in a suit and tie, people who don't play well in the sandbox with others," he says. "The kinds of tests that we make people pass, psychological and everything else, make it very hard for somebody who may be brilliant or have extraordinary talents and unique capabilities to get into the agency."
 The agency used to recruit new people through an underground network at the best universities and officers' clubs. The talent-spotting system it had among student bodies was unique. It existed on every major college campus in the country -- not just Yale (where the crew coach recruited) and Princeton (where at least one dean did the tapping), but at the University of Texas and Holy Cross too. And mandatory military service gave the agency the ability to sign up thousands of officers who had spent time abroad in Europe or Asia. When the draft ended 26 years ago, Calder says, the C.I.A. lost access to "a lot of people who had experience in the military, who had actually lived overseas and understood what that was about and perhaps developed a curiosity and an interest in certain cultures."
 And in those years, before the national nervous breakdown over Vietnam and Watergate, the agency had an aura of mystery and power that it may never regain. Its officers "were told time and time again that they were an elite organization and it was a badge of honor to be recruited and selected to work in C.I.A.," says McMahon. They were members of a secret society that outclassed Skull and Bones.
But most of the people milling around at the Ohio State job fair were born after the collapse of Saigon in 1975. The cold war ended when they were still kids. What's more, says Milt Bearden, a retired C.I.A. veteran: "Their appreciation of American history is probably from Oliver Stone movies, or a very cursory reading of history, as Americans haven't been forced by world events to do much with history. And so how do they recruit today?" Lacking the core mission and the esprit de corps that the cold war gave it, the C.I.A. has to go to colleges and corporations and try to get people interested in selfless, anonymous Government work, in an age of selfishness and self-involvement, when all the threats facing the United States put together don't add up to a single Soviet missile.
 The agency's hunger for talent was slaked a little at Ohio State, though the students' interest in intelligence seemed driven less by intense patriotism than by their perception that Government work would be a safe harbor, a sinecure protected from the brutal efficiencies of the marketplace. By December, the agency had received resumes from 123 Ohio State students, interviewed 30 and conditionally offered jobs to 18. Five or six of those students will wind up working for the agency after passing the lie-detector tests and the other physical and psychological screenings that are part of life at the C.I.A., the recruiters say.
 Although the agency said it was pleased with its haul, no one from Ohio State seemed to have the wherewithal to fill more exotic posts going begging -- jobs for an applied research psychologist with a Ph.D. (the agency needs one for in-house headshrinking) and for biologists and chemists interested in unconventional weaponry. Nor did any of the students seem to have the special talents needed for covert operations, the only job at the C.I.A. that involves a year of specialized in-house training.
 The C.I.A.'s talent-hunters hit 50 more campuses this fall. Their campaign generated close to 100 job applications a day. In addition, the agency is focusing attention on the children of ethnic Americans. This is another way in which the old C.I.A. used to find the people it needed, and which it is trying to recreate. "The people we were hiring in the beginning were much more diverse," says Gates. "We had a lot of ethnic Americans. We had a lot of people from Eastern Europe, from Russia, from Ukraine, from Germany, people who had a remarkable mastery of languages because they had lived abroad for most of their lives."
 For decades, though, the agency has been too American, too white, too culturally narrow, Gates says, unable to dispatch "an Asian- American into North Korea without him being identified as some kid who just walked out of Kansas, or African-Americans to work around the world, or Arab-Americans." In 1992, when Gates was Director, he wanted to hire a candidate who was an American citizen raised in Azerbaijan. "He spoke Azeri fluently, but he didn't write English very well," Gates recalled. "And so he was rejected because he didn't pass our English test. And when I was told this, I just went crazy. I said: 'I've got thousands of people here who can write English, but I don't have anybody here who can speak Azeri. What have you done?' "
 The agency is painfully aware of its former Director's diagnosis and is trying to cure the disease of conformity. The C.I.A., which analyzes both open and secret information from around the world, isn't fluent in the languages that half the world speaks: "Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Farsi -- you know, the languages nobody learns because of the low grade-point averages," Carey says. Too few languages means too little cultural acuity. This leads to mirror-imaging -- projecting American thinking onto foreign cultures, and thus misreading them. Far too few C.I.A. analysts have ever seen the countries they analyze. There are too many political scientists steeped in theory, and too few who have haggled in an Arab bazaar or walked through an African village.
 Now the agency is combing the cities and the suburbs of America looking for the children of immigrants and refugees, particularly young men and women who grew up in first-generation Asian and Arab households, and reaching out to these potential recruits through ads in ethnic newspapers throughout the United States. The languages these people speak -- and their physical appearance -- could come in handy when the C.I.A. tries to penetrate nations like Iraq or North Korea once more with home-grown American spies.
 The agency will live or die in years to come by its ability to project an image of international intrigue and intellectual adventure to smart young people, without repelling them with rigid internal security systems or repeating overseas conduct that goes against the American grain. Simply mounting a recruitment drive "doesn't answer the question: Can we recruit the person we need?" says McMahon, who spent 35 years in the C.I.A. "We can't really address that until the agency understands what it's going to be in 5 or 10 years, and I guarantee you it will not and cannot be what it is today."
The story of Maureen Lenihan suggests that the C.I.A. needs to work on that understanding. Twenty-five, whip-smart and patriotic, Lenihan had been thinking about nuclear weapons since she was a child growing up in Las Vegas. When the earth moved for her, it was the underground tests out in the desert.
 "It all goes back to the test site," Lenihan says. "It made you think about annihilation and international security and what you could do about it." She became a National Merit Scholar, took an undergraduate degree in international relations, entered a Presidential job program, earned a master's degree at the Georgetown School of Foreign Service -- a longtime C.I.A. farm team -- with a 3.7 average. She was very interested in chemical weapons. And she wanted to work for the C.I.A.
 The agency, in turn, was very interested in her. She already had top-secret clearances for a two-year stint on a national commission studying issues of Government secrecy and security, where she focused on the use of the polygraph. Lenihan's C.I.A. interviewers "told me that I had the right capabilities and the right background," she says. But it took the agency forever to offer her a job -- and the offer came with a poison bouquet.
The recruiters have talked to enough students to know that the lie-detector turns people off. Most courts regard it as legally and scientifically worthless. And yet the C.I.A.'s Office of Security has always used it to weed out potential traitors. "Their reliance on the polygraph is truly insane," in the opinion of John Deutch, the former Director of Central Intelligence. The agency knows that many recruits cannot stomach the idea that they have to pass lie-detector tests and undergo a rigid inquiry into their personal histories -- an investigation of every aspect of the past seven years of their lives -- to get in the front door at the C.I.A.
 Lenihan submitted to the lie-detector test. The C.I.A.'s polygraphers told her that she had "problems": her intimate understanding of their machine and its pitfalls, they said, had tainted her performance. She knew too much about the polygraph to pass one. Months went by, a year, a year and a half. She took a job with a Presidential commission on the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, a commission administered by the C.I.A. But first, she was told, she had to go over to the agency for a standard security briefing.
 "I walked in the door thinking I had put this behind me," she says. "I was feeling -- yeah, I gave up some dignity and self-respect, but in the end they cleared me. They ask you to give up your freedom of speech; you sign papers saying you will not talk about your work for the rest of your life. It's a very serious commitment. And you do it willingly. I went in there with open eyes, and they attacked me."
 The C.I.A. confronted her. "They had my folder out," she says. "They were reading my file to me. They twisted it, saying I had used countermeasures" -- the tricks of a spy -- "to try to fool the polygraph. They told me to sign a paper saying I would not commit any more indiscretions or any further misconduct or I would be subject to termination. I refused to sign anything that incriminated me. It enraged me. It enrages me still."
 Nevertheless, in July, the C.I.A. offered her a position. She turned them down flat.
 "The work could have been exciting," she says. "The work could have made a positive contribution to national security. But what they put me through, I could never work for them. I'm 25 years old. I can choose my career path. Do I want to work for an agency that doesn't trust me?" Lenihan has since taken a position at the Justice Department. (Mindful of her security clearances, she checked with the C.I.A. to make sure she was allowed to be interviewed.)
 The Director of Central Intelligence was apopletic when he heard what happened to Lenihan, and his staff says it was an aberration that won't be repeated. "I won't tolerate putting talented people on a string," Tenet says. "The single most important legacy I can leave this institution is people that insure its excellence 20, 30, 40 years from now. I believe that right down to my bones."
 But Maureen Lenihan, one of the best and the brightest, won't be among them. "The fundamental problem of C.I.A. is they can never explain the things they do," she says. "So you have to take at face value what they say they do. And that's hard."

A More Perfect Future

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
The clues to the biggest news of the next millennium still lie scattered in the last years of the last one, like gems and beads waiting to be strung into a precious new object. You have to gather nuggets from many sources to get a glimpse of the planet's political future. Here's a revealing sampling of clippings I have recently accumulated:
 Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations: "People who want to control and dictators who want to suppress the spread of information are going to have nightmares. . . . In quite a few areas we have had revolutions that have been caused by fax, and network, and Internet." 
 The Economist: "Every day, $1.5 trillion moves around the world's foreign-exchange markets. Companies merge across national borders and even talk of changing nationality completely. . . . When politicians in Paris or Jakarta thunder about Anglo-Saxons, they are referring not to gunboats but to George Soros, Rupert Murdoch and the Visigoths of the Internet."
 A Times dispatch from Moscow: "Even the Communist Party has a Web site. . . . While Russia sometimes seems to revert to its old peculiar ways . . . it can no longer afford to shun the club of civilized nations, hemmed in as it is by MTV on one side and the I.M.F. on the other."
 And one from Rome: "Leaving the United States behind, more than 100 countries achieved a 50-year goal today by agreeing on the fundamentals for an international court to prosecute war criminals and tyrants."
 George F. Will: "The Spanish judge who yesterday made progress in persuading Britain to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, former dictator of Chile, for trial concerning human rights violations is practicing what is called justice without borders.' . . . If what is called international law -- it is international, but is it law? -- ignores fences, will nations be more neighborly?"
 A Times dispatch from Aachen, Germany: "It has become usual for people who work in this western German city to live in Belgium and play a weekly tennis match in the Netherlands."
 From an investigation by Douglas Frantz in The Times: "Royal Caribbean, a Liberian corporation with its headquarters in Miami, made what the Justice Department described as an unprecedented claim: that a private company doing business in the United States was immune from criminal prosecution because its oil-dumping ships fly foreign flags."
 And from a summary by David F. Sanger in The Times: "President Clinton told Europe that unless it complies with a World Trade Organization ruling to open its banana market, he will slap 100 percent tariffs on $500 million in European goods, perhaps as soon as February."
 The Economist: "The 11 euro members' rights to inflate, to finance budget deficits by printing money and to boost exports temporarily by currency devaluation are being handed over to the new European Central Bank. . . . This amounts to policy disarmament."
 C. Fred Bergsten in The Washington Post: "Germany's decision to terminate its beloved mark and France's willingness to eliminate its historic franc represent the most dramatic voluntary surrender of sovereignty in recorded history."
Yes, sovereignties and frontiers are evaporating before our eyes. Their disappearance leads to new cohesions, as in Western Europe, or new disintegrations, farther East. The decline of the nation-state leaves global corporations and intercontinental banks bestriding the planet. And supranational institutions are taking root, managing currencies, policing commerce, yearning to punish "crimes against humanity."
 But where shall we station reporters to cover the evolving regime? Where are its legislators and tax collectors, its cops and jails? As borders dissolve, who will manage the flow of migrants and write rules for the virtual road? Who will monitor the claims of alien corporations, guarantee foreign loans, crack down on polluters of the seas and atmosphere? Who will define crimes against humanity, elect the definers and count the votes for electors?
 Common currencies are worthless without common rules and policies. But there cannot long be rules and laws without legislators, or legislators without elections. World-class crimes are meaningless without worldwide rights for individuals. And the rights of individuals are safe only if protected by a government to which they consent. "When a man hangs from a tree," wrote E.B. White, "it doesn't spell justice unless he helped write the law that hanged him."
 The earliest Americans experienced a similar disjunction at the end of the 18th century. As Carl Van Doren described their predicament:
 "The Articles of Confederation under which they lived was not so much a government as a league of states, in which the individual states retained a large part of their sovereignty. Congress was not a general legislature, but a diplomatic assembly, in which the states had equal votes. There was no general executive, no general judiciary. Congress could raise money only by asking the states to contribute their quotas for Confederation expenses. The Confederation government did not operate directly on the people of the United States, but only through the states themselves. . . .
 "There were no American coins of any kind. Where hard money was used, it had to be a confusion of English sovereigns, French louis d'or, Spanish pistoles or dollars, Portuguese moidores or johanneses, ducats or caroluses from different countries. . . . Delegates coming to Philadelphia from other sections had to adjust their money to Pennsylvania pounds and shillings."
 Those delegates came together not as representatives of states but as "we the people" in probably the most portentous event of modern history. They formed "a more perfect Union" by ceding to a Federal regime the powers required to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty. Call it one millennium's inspiration for the superstructure the world must surely design in the next.

Everyday Art in India

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
THIRTY years ago, the Philadelphia Museum of Art presented a ground-breaking exhibition titled "Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village." The show was aptly named.
Organized by the art historian Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993), it brought together work from outside India's ancient classical traditions. Instead of grand temple sculptures, one found pocket-size metal images cast in a threadlike filigree technique and intended for home altars. Rather than court paintings, there were embroidered textiles stitched by women from recycled saris with scenes of local weddings, and storytelling scrolls illustrating Hindu epics in a style as vivid and fantastic as anything produced by Bombay film studios today. 
 This was, in short, art for everyday life, of a kind still produced in rural India. But with its relatively modern dates (mostly 19th and 20th century), and its "folk art" look, it was a kind of material seldom on display in mainstream museums and little known to Western audiences.
Much has changed since the 1960's. Qualitative distinctions between fine art and folk art have been rethought. Vernacular art is taking its rightful place in elite collections. Maybe that's why the small exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum, "Threads of Cotton, Threads of Brass: Arts of Eastern India and Bangladesh from the Stella Kramrisch Collection" (through May 30), carries a thrill of delight rather than a shock of surprise.
The show is, in a sense, a reprise of "Unknown India" three decades later and in miniature. But the real "unknown" here may be Stella Kramrisch herself, a former curator at the museum, and one of the century's outstanding art historians. When she died, obituaries in the national press were few. Although she had been a pioneering figure in her field, the field itself -- the art of South Asia -- is one that only a handful of people in the West know or care much about.
Kramrisch knew it intimately and cared about it passionately. This comes across in her writing. Her two best-known books, "The Hindu Temple" (1946) and "The Presence of Shiva" (1981), are total immersion experiences, almost trance inducing with their insistent verbal cadences and their dense web of references to myth, literature and visual symbolism.
But her investment in Indian culture is perhaps most evident in the life she lived, a brief account of which was written by the Sanskrit scholar Barbara Stoler Miller in 1983 as an introduction to a book of Kramrisch's essays, "Exploring India's Sacred Art" (out of print in the United States, but available in an Indian edition).
Kramrisch was born in what is now the Czech Republic, the only child of two bookish, upper-middle-class parents, who moved to Vienna before she began grade school. The city was rich in cultural ferment. Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele were the contemporary artists Kramrisch grew up with; she saw Nijinsky dance with the Ballets Russes. (She studied dance herself and performed publicly while still in her teens.)
She was fascinated by the work of Northern European mystical writers like Meister Eckhart and Jakob Boehme, and Asian philosophy was in the air in the years around World War I. She encountered it in Kandinsky's writing on art and in the Theosophy of Rudolf Steiner (whom she knew). Her early discovery of the Bhagavad-Gita in German translation confirmed her specific interest in Indian culture.
But it was only after she finished a dissertation on early Buddhist sculpture at the University of Vienna in 1919 that she visited India for the first time. On a trip to England she met the poet Rabindranath Tagore, who invited her to a school he had established in Bengal. She went straight from London to Bombay, stopping in Vienna only long enough to meet with her parents in the train station.
Within a few years she was teaching art at the University of Calcutta, the only woman and the only European on the faculty. She remained something of an outsider to both Indian and colonial social circles, neither of whom knew quite what to make of her. But she seems not to have cared. She lived alone in a house in the grounds of the university's botanical garden, accompanied by a pet hyena and steeped in her work.
That work resulted in extensive travel across the subcontinent to visit and document Buddhist sites and Hindu temples, some of them renowned, many crumbling and forgotten. In the countryside she studied the dynamic world of Bengali village life and culture, and many of the objects in "Threads of Cotton, Threads of Brass" are among those she collected in the field in the 1920's.
She also experienced Indian religion firsthand when she became a devotee of Shiva and the disciple of a Tantric monk. In Miller's account, he subjected her to a harrowing initiation at Kalighat temple in Calcutta, having her sit on a corpse ready for cremation, and pulling her off only when the fire had been lit. Kramrisch did not, one suspects, undergo the ordeal in a spirit of scientific disinterest, and the emotional commitment and risk it entailed subtly warms her scholarship.
In 1929, she married an India-based Hungarian economist, Laszlo Nemenyi, though they spent most of their 21-year marriage apart, absorbed in separate careers. He was named economic adviser to the new government in Pakistan in 1947. Nationalist sentiment ran high at the time and Kramrisch's position in Calcutta grew uncomfortable. She had planned to spend her life in India, but when Nemenyi was shot and killed in Karachi in 1950, she left for America. Within a few years she began working at the Philadelphia Museum and teaching at the University of Pennsylvania and New York University's Institute of Fine Art.
Academic fashions come and go, and research is, to some degree, based on a principle of planned obsolescence. The work of any one scholar is, after all, meant to be refined or challenged or simply superseded by that of another. And in an era when sociologically derived Western theory has been a primary interpretive lens through which non-Western art is viewed, Kramrisch's metaphysical approach to Indian art and architecture, always criticized by some historians, has fallen somewhat out of favor.
But the tides are always shifting; the present climate seems increasingly to encourage the synthesis of a wide range of disciplines and approaches, old and new, orthodox and otherwise. In any case, the catalogue Kramrisch wrote for "Unknown India" remains one of her monuments. So does the extraordinary collection of Indian art she brought to the Philadelphia Museum, now overseen by her curatorial successor, the gifted young American art historian Darielle Mason.
Some pieces arrived with Kramrisch in 1950 and were sold to the museum a few years later. Such was the case with a fabulous sandstone sculpture of the multiarmed goddess Durga, bursting with aggressive energy from her carved niche. Other works, including most of the pieces in "Threads of Cotton, Threads of Brass" she willed to the museum.
The Durga is on permanent display; most of the village and tribal objects, many not exhibited since "Unknown India" 30 years ago, will return to storage at the end of the show. It's great to see them together now. As one moves back and forth from classical stone icons of Buddhas and Hindu deities to the tiny images of brass horses and quilts sewn with scenes of village life, the marriage of elite and popular traditions that is the essence of Indian art becomes clear.
And popular traditions are, after a long period of apparent decline, on the upswing, as was evident in a show of contemporary embroidered quilts organized by Molly Aitken at the Asia Society last summer. These quilts were executed with exactly the same technique as the 19th-century pieces in Philadelphia, but their narratives now dealt with pressing, up-to-the-minute social issues like spousal abuse, female infanticide and AIDS.
Kramrisch would doubtless have found the results fascinating and heartening, both as evidence of continuity with the past and spiritual tenacity in the present. This is the kind of response that profound cultural empathy can produce. Kramrisch had such empathy and it is a hidden thread that binds together a museum collection that she shaped equally with her scholarship and her spirit.

Amid Serene Natural Beauty, A Residue of Brutal Trauma

BYLINE: By MURRAY WHYTE; Murray Whyte, who lived in Vancouver until recently, writes on the arts for The National Post in Toronto.

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia

 BODY:
ON the fringe of Vancouver's junkie-ridden, impoverished inner city, Stan Douglas makes art that speaks of failure.
It's a subject that has brought the 38-year old artist considerable success. "Nut*ka," a deep exploration of the onset of post-colonial era -- and its destructive force -- near his Vancouver home got Mr. Douglas short listed for the Guggenheim Museum's Hugo Boss Prize in 1996. The work, a meditative, multilayered video, explores a savage tale extracted from the faded history of colonialism here on the Canadian West Coast and the connection of its intrusive violence to the present. Mr. Douglas's newest film work, "Win, Place or Show," will be on view at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea starting Feb. 11 alongside a work by the Glaswegian artist Douglas Gordon in a show called "Double Vision." Like "Nut*ka," the piece delves deep into the heart of a local debacle, as Mr. Douglas examines a brutish public-housing project planned for his Vancouver neighborhood in the 1950's but never built. 
 Mr. Douglas is not alone in his fascination with Vancouver's particular manifestations of modern trauma. Jeff Wall, Rodney Graham, Roy Arden and Ken Lum have all turned a critical, realist eye to the havoc wreaked by the march of developmental progress, each using his hometown and its environs to comment on themes and phenomena that stretch far beyond the limited boundaries of the Canadian West Coast.
The resulting work has earned for each recognition that stretches beyond Vancouver as well: Mr. Wall and Mr. Douglas were the first Canadians invited to show at the Whitney Biennial, in 1995. Mr. Wall, a conceptual photographic artist who has enjoyed an international reputation for almost two decades, had a major retrospective exhibition in 1997 that traveled from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles to the Hirshhorn in Washington, to the Art Tower Mito near Tokyo, in addition to shows at the Marian Goodman Gallery in New York.
Mr. Graham, 49, whose work includes elaborate installations, film, photography, sculpture, text pieces and hypothetical architecture, recently gained widespread recognition for "Vexation Island," a film piece that was a hit at the 1997 Venice Biennale. The somber, rich photographs of the rough spaces in which the developed and undeveloped chafe have won Mr. Arden, 41, places in prestigious collections like those of the Musee d'Art Contemporain in Geneva and the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart. Mr. Lum, 42, represented in New York by the Andrea Rosen Gallery, has also built an international career with works like a recent series of diptychs in which photographs and words play off one another to betray the anxiety of contemporary life. In one of the diptychs, the text, which reads, in heroic comic-book font, "Mounties and Indians" (1989), is balanced against a photograph of red-coated Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers who pose, smiling, with a group of native Canadians. The result is an awkward image that evokes the memory of the area's colonial past even as the victors stand arm-in-arm with the vanquished.
Mr. Douglas's "Win, Place or Show," like other recent works, has a decidedly local flavor, as its subject was found quite literally in his backyard: the housing project slated for his district would have seen his own house razed had it been built. For Mr. Douglas, the sparing of his neighborhood was part of his inspiration. "In some ways," says Mr. Douglas, a tall, soft-spoken African-Canadian, "this is the only part of this city that seems real."
The question of what is real and what is not is constant and pervasive in this seaside city of 1.8 million people. Its oceanside core, distinct and opposite from Mr. Douglas's inner-city home but less than two miles away, gleams with an almost surreal sheen of newness. Sparkling condominium towers, in turn dwarfed by the spectacular coastal mountains that surround them, compete for precious views of ocean and mountains, beaches and old-growth forest, which collude in a picture-postcard image too perfect to be trusted.
It is just this sort of imagery these artists hold in contempt: as Mr. Wall, now 52, wrote in the catalogue for "Cameres Indiscretes," ("Candid Cameras") a 1992 exhibition in Barcelona, Spain, featuring Mr. Lum, Mr. Graham, Ian Wallace and Mr. Wall himself, the contemporary conceptual art for which the city has become known evolved from "a rejection of a mythic self-image of Vancouver" -- a mythology that romanticizes landscape, native culture and the place of the Europeans who claimed it. It is in the work of these artists that the broader darkness behind the apparent regional success is exposed. Where there is economic development and construction, there is the conspicuous consumption of land and nature; where there is cosmopolitan diversity, there is racial tension; where there is urbanity, there is displacement, poverty and class division.
In Mr. Wall's spectacular, inert "history-painting" photographs, which he meticulously stages using actors, the artist has often zeroed in on the dark, personal brutality spawned by the onset of contemporary society. Cosmopolitan diversity begets racist conflict, as in "Mimic" (1982), a street scene in which an unshaven, greasy Caucasian man lifts his middle finger behind the back of an Asian man. In "The Outburst" (1989), the noble, industrial-age notion of honest work for fair pay dissolves as a garment-factory manager goes ballistic on one of his sweat-shop employees.
A more homely assault of suburban development on nature is evident in Mr. Arden's recent photographs, seen in 1996 at American Fine Arts in SoHo. In these he makes critical pictorial comment on the vulgar convention of developer-driven construction projects as they impose themselves in both the urban and rural landscape. In "Model House and Honda Warehouse" (1993), the hilarity of unreasoned development is captured as a suburban home of ridiculously grand scale squats in a barren field, the only other nearby structure a Honda storage building, while British Columbia's signature coastal mountains loom in the distance.
For Mr. Graham, human estrangement from nature persists, as if every attempt made to reconcile our differences ends in some sort of defeat, either cataclysmic or trivial. Thus, his "75 Polaroids" (1976-1988), taken in a forest at night without a flash, are consequently black.
The transformative force of contemporary progress is hardly a concern unique to Vancouver; modern reality has imposed itself with equal disregard all over the continent. Vancouver has become for some artists a stand-in for this phenomenon -- as Mr. Wall has often said, a generic example whose particulars are irrelevant to the greater issue.
In Mr. Graham's film, "Vexation Island," set in the South Pacific, where an 18th-century Englishman marooned on a desert island is doomed to repeat his actions over and over in an endless loop -- a Freudian reference to neurosis, where compulsive repetition takes the place of actual memory -- there appears to be no connection to his home at all.
"It doesn't have much to do with Vancouver," says Mr. Graham, a manic, bespectacled man with close-cropped, salt-and-pepper hair. "Oh, wait: yes, it does," he interrupts himself, peering through thick black-framed glasses with eyes that betray a pending joke. "I wanted to set that piece about as absolutely, geographically far away from Vancouver as possible. I liked the idea of being opposite from Vancouver on the globe."
Mr. Graham takes some sardonic glee from running down his hometown, but he has, in earlier works, explored issues essential to it. In "Millennial Project for an Urban Plaza (With Cappuccino Bar)" (1986), he plotted a design for a fanciful building meant to house only a gigantic pinhole camera, the sole purpose of which is to wait for a lone seedling tree, planted in front of the structure, to grow tall enough to be captured in the camera's sight.
It's an earnest reversal, according to Mr. Graham, committing a building to waiting for a tree, where so often in the march of progress forests have yielded to the building of cities. But it also leaves the tree subject to the whim of technology and comically stranded out of its element -- another miscarried attempt to reconcile urban society's estrangement from the natural.
This theme also comes clear in the work of Mr. Wall, who has rejected the idea that Vancouver in particular plays any role in his work. In fact, Mr. Wall, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has recently begun to make pictures in Los Angeles, where the transformative forces of progress have caused at least equal havoc.
But he has, at times, stepped back from his elaborately controlled depictions of personal interaction and trauma to capture images of broader scale. It is here that his work can be seen as influenced by the unstoppable advance of progress on Vancouver and its environs, says Kerry Brougher, who, as a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, designed Mr. Wall's traveling retrospective in 1997.
Mr. Brougher recalls his first trip to Mr. Wall's hometown when he met the artist to prepare for the show. "It seemed like everywhere I turned, I saw Jeff Wall," Mr. Brougher says in a phone interview from Oxford, England, where he is now director of the Museum of Contemporary Art. "The essential bareness of the place, the light, the constant gloom, all seemed to speak of the particular imagery you see in his work."
Mr. Wall's pictures that speak of the interval between the natural and developmental encroachment are among his most potent, says Mr. Brougher. "Coastal Motifs" (1989) is one of these: the omnipresent mountains, ominous and looming, cloaked in mist, are given visual weight equal to the eerily deserted industrial bay in the foreground.
LIKE Mr. Wall, Mr. Douglas has often dealt with the social and physical damage wrought by development and progress. In "Nut*ka," shot on Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound, where Europeans first made contact with West Coast native people, a smoke-belching pulp mill on the Sound, is captured in photographs that accompany the film.
In "Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe" (1992), Mr. Douglas builds on the notion of the social inequity spawned by the industrial age as he examines Ruskin, British Columbia -- named for the English critic and social reformer John Ruskin -- where a series of settlements eventually gave way to a now-abandoned power plant. Mr. Douglas's film tracks an unsolved murder from the 1930's in Ruskin, when Japanese-Canadians, ostracized in Vancouver, went to Ruskin to form a berry-farming community. Their idyll collapsed when they were forced into internment camps by the Canadian Government at the start of World War II.
Unlike Mr. Wall, Mr. Douglas wants you to know where his work comes from. Rather than becoming detached from the local phenomenon, he embraces it. In the opinion of Lynne Cooke, the curator of the Dia Center, there is never even slight concern that his work will recede into the regionalist realm. "It's the local and the global," she says. "Stan's work comes out of rooted experience and specific histories of a place, but the issues themselves are current and have much wider applicability. I think it's partly that that makes him such an important figure, and one that people look to."
"Win, Place, or Show," is a slight departure for Mr. Douglas, in that it dreams rather than documents, invents rather than explores. Its dream is a modernist reverie, in which the housing project proposed for Mr. Douglas's neighborhood was actually built.
"It took me a while to realize it, but this is modernist architecture," Mr. Douglas says, surveying the 1950's building plans with a degree of incredulity. North American housing projects that were actually built -- like the now-abandoned Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, which became synonymous with urban blight -- were a far cry from modernist architecture's ideals of democracy and efficiency. "The Robert Taylor Homes are the nearest thing to a realized radiant city of Le Corbusier, even though it's in the most brutal terms," says Mr. Douglas, thumbing through a binder thick with reports describing the project that never was. "But in reality, that utopic idea became like a sort of warehousing for the poor."
In Mr. Douglas's film, two dock workers occupy one of the apartments of his hypothetical public-housing project. Instead of an oppressive cell, though, the apartment becomes part of Le Corbusier's modernist ideal realized: a living space as refined as it is simple, removed from the housing-project reality that shunted the working poor into the living-space equivalent of a storage bin. On the movie set of the fantasy apartment, elegant Danish furniture and contemporary art grace the room, where the workers' daily life -- their jokes, arguments and fights -- plays out in an endless loop.
It's a transitional piece, Mr. Douglas says, his final glimpse at a final disappointment here -- a "sci-fi" exploration of a hypothetical modernist success that never was. "I'm sort of off that kick now," he says. "Instead of sort of mulling over failure, I've become interested in what comes next. You know, what to do with all those ruins."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
In a New Fosse Vehicle, A Headlong Joy Ride

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
EVEN as their budgets and, occasionally, their aspirations have ballooned, Broadway musicals give the impression of having grown smaller in recent years, at least in part because of the near-disappearance of dance from the American musical theater. Dance is still there, but it's either nondescript, as in "Footloose," or solemnly obligatory, almost instructive, as in "Ragtime." The sense of excitement and discovery has disappeared. If you have any doubt about what has been lost or, better yet, if you just want to have a terrifically entertaining night of Broadway theater, then you can't afford to pass up "Fosse," now at the Broadhurst.
Here is a very particular, epic-size musical revue. In its consideration of the career of Bob Fosse as dancer, choreographer and director on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television from the late 1940's into the 1980's, it celebrates the art, high spirits and dazzling inventiveness of a theater now known only through revivals. 
Be warned, however. "Fosse" is an anthology composed mostly of climaxes for which there are no build-ups. Some numbers are presented in their entirety, while others are spliced into medleys and not always easy to identify. Yet the elegant-looking production is given cohesion by the dynamic character and the restless mind of Fosse himself. There is also the pure exhilaration that comes only rarely these days, when watching a cast of 32 talented performers dancing and singing with an energy that, from time to time, threatens to raise the roof.
As "Fosse" looks back over approximately 40 years of dance in theater and movies, it inevitably prompts the question: What happened?
It may be Jerome Robbins who forever confounded our expectations for dance in the Broadway musical. His contributions still astonish: think of his role in transforming "Fancy Free," the Robbins-Leonard Bernstein ballet, into "On the Town" (1944), of his priceless Keystone Kops ballet for "High Button Shoes" (1947), of "The Small House of Uncle Thomas" ballet for "The King and I" (1951) and of those balletic gang rumbles in "West Side Story" (1957). He led us to believe that it would be the classically trained choreographer, skilled also in modern dance, who would bring new life and meaning to the American musical theater.
Robbins was as much at home in a Broadway house as in Ballet Theater. He brought a breadth of vision to musical shows that was unique and, by comparison, called attention to what some people saw as the limitations of such Broadway-bred choreographers as Fosse, Michael Bennett and Gower Champion.
An unfair comparison, really. Robbins was not just a great choreographer. He was a genius. He was one of a kind, without compare. He wasn't someone next to whom anyone else can be measured without the help of a large footstool.
Choreographers of the stature of Fosse, Bennett and Champion were masters of their own class of entertainment. No wonder they became directors: Broadway was then a dancing place.
If you have seen the work of the choreographers from ballet and modern dance who have recently been corralled by the musical theater, you might have noticed that there haven't been any Jerome Robbinses among them. You might also have realized that these recruits can be even more limited in their vision than the earlier generation of hoofers who went on to become superlative Broadway choreographers. (The one possible exception: Garth Fagan, the modern dancer and choreographer whose work is integral to the success of Julie Taymor's vision of "The Lion King.")
The problem facing contemporary Broadway choreographers is not only training but also experience. As the number of musical shows produced each year has dwindled, and as dance has come to look like an afterthought in the operettas that have dominated the scene, the choreographic gene pool has all but dried up.
No more that opportunity for Broadway gypsies to move from one show to several others within a single season, to survive flops, hits and road tours, to be hired and fired and to know that there is another show casting around the corner, if not this week, then next. No time to acquire the itch, not simply to dance well but to create one's own idiosyncratic dance vocabulary.
If you saw Fosse's film "All That Jazz" (1979), a gorgeous but self-absorbed Fellini-esque examination of the life of a director very much like himself, you already know that he was a man given to excess. The air he breathed was filtered through his cigarettes. He drank too much, ate amphetamines for breakfast, loved his wife and mistress and was faithful to neither. The film's most flamboyant conceit: Fosse's foreseeing his own death, which was to come in 1987 when he was 60.
Except for his fine screen version of "Cabaret"
(1972) and "Lenny," his comparatively disciplined biographical film about Lenny Bruce, all of Fosse's movies reflect the tendency toward excess that marked his life, though not his shows. He went a little mad in the movie studio, like the kid who decides he is able to fly with a parasol.
Note "Sweet Charity" (1969), the first film he directed. Among other things, the manic cross-cutting from one image to the next and the use of gigantic real-life locations, from Lincoln Center to Wall Street and the Brooklyn Bridge, all but swamp the adaptation of his hit Broadway show of 1966. He effectively upstages not only Shirley MacLaine, the star, the book by Neil Simon and the Cy Coleman-Dorothy Fields score, but also his own distinctive choreography.
There is something infectiously cheeky and bold about Fosse's movies as well as his shows. Yet his singular strength is his choreography, which, when seen in the theater at its best, cuts to the quick. It can make us laugh, and sometimes, without warning, as in the final moments of "Chicago," it can become unaccountably moving. These are the gifts of the man whose work is now being recalled on the stage of the Broadhurst.
As a choreographer, Fosse is a satirist. He is cool, spare of detail. At his best, he is also a brilliant caricaturist, someone who uses a minimal number of precisely drawn lines to express the essence of a single character, of several characters, of a whole raft of characters, in a specific time, place and circumstance.
I remember (I hope accurately) the initial image in the Broadway production of "Sweet Charity": Gwen Verdon, seen alone in silhouette against an orange-lighted cyclorama, her weight on one leg, her hip thrust to the other side, one arm akimbo -- a Broadway taxi dancer waiting for a customer and waiting, maybe forever, for life.
"Sweet Charity" provides "Fosse" with two of the show's most elegant sequences: the marvelously comic "Rich Man's Frug," in which Manhattan nobs, as ferret-faced as Maurice Sendak characters, sweep around a nightclub as if untroubled even by gravity (as choreographed by Fosse, the dancers appear to float), and "Big Spender," wherein Charity's taxi-dancer pals stand at the bar and face the audience, alternately wheedling and intimidating their would-be customers.
Some of the other memorable numbers recalled: "Steam Heat" from "The Pajama Game" (1954), "Mr. Bojangles" from "Dancin' " (1978), "Take Off With Us -- Three Pas de Deux" from "All That Jazz," in which three nearly nude couples, one heterosexual, one homosexual and one lesbian, make love, going as far as a standard modern balletic vocabulary allows, and the foot-stomping grand finale, "Sing, Sing, Sing," also from "Dancin'."
My favorite: a sly, spirited take on the old standard "Me and My Shadow" from Fosse's last show, "Big Deal" (1986), in which Eugene Fleming, Kim Morgan Greene and Dana Moore add a sexual dimension to the song so languidly and sentimentally sung by Ted Lewis from the 1920's into the 1950's.
Somewhat less effective, in part because they can be seen in context next door at the Shubert Theater where "Chicago" is playing: Fred Ebb and John Kander's "Razzle Dazzle" and "Nowadays." "Shoeless Joe From Hannibal, Mo.," from "Damn Yankees" (1955), also isn't helped by the fact that the number was better done in the 1995 Broadway revival, choreographed by Rob Marshall.
Richard Maltby Jr. is the director responsible for coordinating the many talents involved, including Gwen Verdon, Fosse's widow, the show's artistic adviser, and Ann Reinking, Mr. Fosse's companion, who is the co-director and (with Fosse) co-choreographer. Note that the spiffy production was initiated and is being presented by Livent Inc., the bankrupt Canadian company (which is also presenting "Ragtime"), founded by the besieged, deposed entrepreneur Garth Drabinsky.
Note also two other expert performers who help to make this enterprise work: Valarie Pettiford, who is both an accomplished Fosse dancer and a singer to shake the rafters, and that superb dancer Scott Wise, who also sings the elegant though abbreviated "Razzle Dazzle."
Seeing so much of Fosse's extraordinary work, in such a condensed form, also provides clues as to the identity of those who may have influenced him. Fosse himself acknowledged his debt to Jack Cole, the Broadway and Hollywood choreographer sometimes credited for having created "jazz dancing." "Fosse" also brings to mind Charlie Chaplin, an association I had never noticed before. If Charlie Chaplin had been a choreographer, he might have created dances like Fosse's.
The resemblance is remarked on not because of Fosse's fondness for derby hats and gloves. Rather, it's because the singular fashion in which Fosse uses the dancer's body, at rest and in motion, so frequently evokes Chaplin mannerisms, everything from the way the Tramp walks and stands to the way he controls his hands, even his elbows.
One big difference: Chaplin depends on close-ups of the Tramp's face to verify what has already been made clear. Fosse appreciates the full figure. The costumes he favors for his dancers, including black leotards, have a way of deflecting attention from individual features to allow movement to become the principal expression of character.
"Fosse," you should understand, is a rich, bewitching show.
'Art' "Art," Yasmina Reza's superbly funny French play, is clearly a theatrical phenomenon both in this country, where it is being seen in Christopher Hampton's English translation, and abroad, where it is playing -- or has played -- in more than 40 countries. It seems to be unstoppable.
At the Royale Theater in New York, Judd Hirsch, Joe Morton and George Wendt have replaced the English cast, which earlier replaced Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, who opened the show at the Royale last March. That company has just opened at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles. Another company is at the Royal George in Chicago. London, where the play opened in 1996, is on its ninth company. Meanwhile, "Art" continues in Paris.
Among the other places it has been seen: India, Peru, Belarus, Japan and Serbia. Remember, this is a comedy about three Frenchmen, members of the bourgeoisie, whose longtime friendship is about to dissolve in acrimony over the acquisition by one of the friends of a white-on-white painting. Does wit suddenly sell like kung-fu movies? In some places, apparently.
A return visit to the Royale to see the new cast confirms my original reaction: "Art," directed in New York as well as in London by Matthew Warchus, is an exceptionally wise and sophisticated work. It succeeds in being stylishly contemporary without ever dropping brand-names or references to any celebrity born after Seneca. Further, it is a play that seems to fit with ease any number of good if quite different actors.
Mr. Wendt, who is still best remembered as Norm in the long-running sitcom "Cheers," easily slips his large frame into the role of Yvan. It's a part actors might die for: the harried friend who helps precipitate the crisis by becoming engaged and rebelling against his position as the comedy relief for the two other men.
Mr. Hirsch is furiously, seriously comic as Marc, the full-time control freak. Mr. Morton is splendidly condescending as Serge, the divorced doctor who embarks on a life as a collector by buying the painting for a price his pals find ludicrous, 200,000 francs, or approximately $40,000.
"Art" is a delight in the economy of its construction. Running 90 minutes and played without an intermission, it never seems to hurry but, by the time it ends, a friendship has been analyzed in the kind of minute psychological detail you are more likely to find in a well-written short story or novel. "Art" breathes as if it had a life of its own.
There is something mysterious about writing so firm and true: it is infinitely adaptable. After watching each of the three casts I have seen play it, I have been convinced that no one else did it better, or even quite the same.

HEADLINE: With Lockout Over, Players Work Out

BYLINE: By DAN MARKOWITZ

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
THE small fleet of sport utility vehicles in the New York Knick parking lot outside the Physical Education Building at Purchase College here two weeks ago signaled that the National Basketball Association lockout had indeed ended.
But with a 50-game season beginning on Feb. 5, Michael Jordan's retirement announcement and practice sessions where players from any N.B.A. team and free agents could work out their kinks at the Knicks' training site, business was anything but back to normal. Still, the rack of 15 Spalding official N.B.A. balls was rolled out by the Knicks' strength coach, Greg Brittenham, and Knick regulars like Allan Houston, John Starks, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, along with a newcomer, Marcus Camby, gladly went through their paces. 
 "Mouths have been watering to get to this point," said Houston, who said he worked out religiously during the lockout, playing games at Basketball City at the Chelsea Piers in Manhattan and shooting and lifting weights on his own. "The misconception is that just because we weren't practicing as a team, guys weren't doing anything. Guys were still working out and staying in shape. But there's actually nothing like the intensity of playing real games and practices."
Childs, the Knicks' back-up point guard, looked in prime shape as well, but he derided pick-up games as doing more damage than good. "It's not the same magnitude of going to the gym with your teammates and being pushed to the top level," he said. "You can't do that away from the pro ranks."
A couple of former Westchester High School basketball stars, Rasul Salahuddin, 25, of Mount Vernon and Long Beach State, and Rasaun Young, 23, of New Rochelle and the University of Buffalo, joined the open practice. Both players have designs on filling the Knicks' vacant fifth guard spot.
Reggie Freeman, 23, another New York City product out of Rice High School, said the lockout would hurt young, inexperienced players' chances. "It's worse now because they want veteran guys that have been in the system more," he said, referring to team management.
Coach Jeff Van Gundy of the Knicks could not yet set foot on the special elevated and cushioned court built here because of the N.B.A. rule that the head coaches could not run practices until the collective bargaining agreement was signed. But all the accouterments of a regular practice -- the towels, the Gatorade bucket, the box of Power Bars, Kleenex, tape, sugarless chewing gum and lozenges -- were provided by an equipment manager..
The rookie hopefuls got lost in the shuffle of newspaper reporters and television camera crews sticking tape recorders and microphones in front of Ward, Childs and Houston, asking them for poignant Jordan memories. "You know you're great when people mimic you," Childs said.
Ward said, "I can tell my children 10, 15 years from now that I played against him, and I've got the pictures to prove it."
Houston said: "Just because Michael is not here this season it doesn't take away from who wins the championship. It takes a lot to get to the finals. We're not going to change our goals. We're not going to expect to be there just because he's not."
Even with Jordan's absence, the Knicks were not being picked as N.B.A. finalist quality. That lofty perch was expected to be filled by the Indiana Pacers in the East and the Utah Jazz in the West.
The man who could possibly redeem the Knicks' chances, along with the reported newly acquired guard, Latrell Sprewell, is their captain and the players' union president, Patrick Ewing. He was vacationingbefore beginning the rigors of training.
Ewing is most likely to have a lot of the anger harbored by N.B.A. fans over the lockout directed at him when he sets foot on the court in Madison Square Garden. Childs said Knick fans should show some sympathy for Ewing -- who made unrealistic comments during the lockout about millionaire N.B.A. players fighting for their economic survival -- and should look at "the sacrifice Patrick has made." He continued: "Financially and even physically, because he had to involve himself with the negotiations, it took time away from his family and working out."
Referring to the lockout, Childs said: "Everybody's at fault -- the players, the owners, the league -- and everybody lost, nobody won. It has hurt the game tremendously. It's just human nature. When you take something away from people that they enjoy so much, fans are not going to forget it right away."
After the informal practice, a small group of fans entered the gymnasium, including Gabriel Perez, 12, of Brooklyn, who took a day off from school and came here with his uncle. Hoping to get autographs as he watched the players shoot, Gabriel had already forgotten the lockout.
"I'm going to watch the games because I like the Knicks," he said.

HEADLINE: Plans to Preserve a Black Beach Enclave in Florida

BYLINE: By JANE TANNER 

DATELINE: AMELIA ISLAND, Fla.

 BODY:
A Jacksonville banker who bought an oceanfront lot in American Beach here last November plans to press for a master plan to stave off encroachment of high-end resorts on either side of an enclave that traces its special character back to the days of segregation.
The banker, Tony T. Brown, a senior vice president at Nationsbank Florida, is seeking to persuade other property owners to create a community development district and a financing plan to upgrade and preserve the neighborhood on the northernmost island off Florida's east coast. 
 Land purchases for new projects are rare at American Beach, developed in the 30's as a resort for blacks barred from whites-only beach areas, and has retained a feeling of community and cultural identity.
Most of the roads in its 78 acres are unpaved and the community lacks basic sewer and water infrastructure. Still, the property is coveted by high-end resorts to the north and south of it -- Amelia Island Plantation and Summer Beach, which are rapidly using up the last of their oceanfront property in the ongoing construction of condominiums, homes and golf courses.
The 18.2-square-mile Amelia Island, of which American Beach is a part, is a 35-minute drive across the Intracoastal Waterway from Jacksonville International Airport. It was a sleepy blue-collar community with a small quiet section of high-priced homes and condominiums at its southern end until the 90's.
Now it is dominated by upscale development. Private planes frequently fly into the island's small airport, where expansion, but not commercial service, is planned.
Mr. Brown bought a 50- by 100-foot parcel on the waterfront from a family trust, paying $89,500. He said he was holding off construction of a vacation home for his family until modern infrastructure is in place -- as are more than a dozen other American Beach property owners.
He said that he also planned to close this Friday on a second lot, where he plans to construct a four-unit apartment buiding. In addition, he said, he is working with longtime residents to create a museum to preserve the enclave's black heritage.
"As a practitioner of redevelopment, I want to practice what I preach," he said. At Nationsbank, now a subsidiary of BankAmerica following a merger last year, he oversees the institution's involvement in neighborhood revitalization in Florida.
Among other property owners pressing for a master plan is Michael Stewart, a Bell South regional manager for corporate affairs whose grandfather built a home in American Beach in 1941.
Mr. Stewart and Frank Morgan Jr., a real estate professional whose family owns more than an acre, joined Mr. Brown last month to discuss capital improvements with local officials. "For long-term viability, infrastructure is a must," Mr. Stewart said. "But it's not the panacea."
In November, Mr. Brown met with the American Beach Homeowners Association. Of the enclave's 125 lots, about 80 have homes; only 20 have year-round residents.
He found members of the homeowners association wary when he tried to persuade them to endorse his draft proposals for revitalizing the neighborhood. Ultimately such a plan would have to go before the local commissioners of Nassau County, the island's governing entity, for approval.
Mr. Brown's proposal offers several options to finance capital improvements such as sewage and water utilities. Among those discussed have been property-tax increases directed back to the neighborhood and issuance of bonds.
THE homeowners are seeking more details and have invited Mr. Brown back to give them. "There are people who come along from time to time like Mr. Brown who talk about developing American Beach," said Annette Myers, head of the homeowners' association. "Sometimes you don't know where these people are coming from."
Mrs. Myers said that residents were concerned about property values rising too high for elderly residents on fixed incomes, about retaining a mix of affordable housing and about keeping a vibrant ethnic identity.
American Beach residents have cause for concern, since resort owners and speculators have coveted the property. But so far, with 125 separate property owners and vocal residents determined to keep its historic identity intact, no one has been able to assemble enough for large projects.
Walter Gossett, the Nassau County manager, said that Mr. Brown's goals were realistic. "It is an ambitious undertaking, but I think it has the potential to succeed," Mr. Gossett said. "It is the best plan I've seen come down the pike. I think it would be a welcome development in Nassau County."
American Beach was founded in the 30's by Abraham Lincoln Lewis, an insurance magnate who was Florida's first black millionaire. Lewis, who co-founded the Afro-American Insurance Company in Jacksonville in 1901, bought 20 acres in 1935 that became the original American Beach.
He encouraged others to buy lots to create a lively beach getaway for black families. Michael Stewart's grandfather Ralph, for instance, was an actuary with Afro-American Insurance. Over the years, prominent black businessmen bought lots and built homes. At its peak, the enclave comprised 200 acres. But since the 60's the neighborhood has not moved forward. Many homes are vacant and rundown and neighbors want the boarded-up, ramshackle home adjacent to Mr. Brown's lot condemned and torn down.
In contrast to the near standstill at American Beach, the surrounding wealthy resorts are busy expanding. On 83 acres that once was part of American Beach, Amelia Island Plantation is building a 94-home gated golf retirement community, with houses that range in size from 1,500 to 2,056 square feet and in price from $230,000 to $350,000.
The 1,333-acre resort community -- begun in 1974 by the Sea Pines Company, which also developed Hilton Head, S.C. -- also is completing a seven-story, 21-unit luxury condominium. Nine of its 3,300-square-foot units have sold for an average of $900,000.
In a separate project, the resort is building two more seven-story condominiums, called Beach Side Villas, each with 21 units. The first was finished in December; the other will be completed in August. The 2,500-square-foot units are selling at $590,000 on average, and the first building is sold out.
Only a 600-foot oceanfront stretch remains, and that likely will be developed into condominiums, said Norman Bray, executive vice president of real estate development for Amelia Island Plantation. He expects the community to be built out completely by 2002.
"Everything has heated up in the last five years with the strong economy," Mr. Bray said.
Just to the north of American Beach the Summer Beach resort is developing the last parcels of its 500-acre community. Seven 14-unit condominium buildings called Carlton Dunes are currently under construction at the northern end of Summer Beach.
The 3,880-square-foot units have been selling for $750,000 to $1.3 million.
While property values are rising quickly on either side, values in American Beach remain relatively low. For instance, while Mr. Brown paid $89,500 for his 50- by 100-foot oceanfront lot, just to the south in Amelia Island Plantation resort, two lots, each 40-by-180 feet, sold last year for $425,000 a each, Mr. Bray said. Three other nearby oceanfront lots, 100 by 215 feet, sold for $1.3 million each. They will be developed with single-family homes.
Mr. Brown does not anticipate values at that level in American Beach, even though some high-priced lots are within walking distance. But he does look at Summer Beach and Amelia Island Plantation with both a touch of envy and a sense of opportunity. "There's no reason we can't be developed nicely too, and have that type of area here," he said.

HEADLINE: In the Region / Connecticut;
New Powers for Towns to Protect Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THREE months ago the General Assembly passed the Connecticut Village Districts Act, an amendment to the state zoning statutes that allows municipalities to greatly strengthen the roles of their zoning bodies. The action has pleased preservationists and planning and zoning commissions, but has troubled many builders, real estate professionals and architects.
Unlike historic districts, which are established by a two-thirds vote of affected residents, the measure authorizes local commissions to establish districts anywhere they deem appropriate as a means of preserving a neighborhood's character, whether it is historic, of more recent vintage, economically modest, mixed use, or whatever. 
 Under the new law, building permits can be denied to applicants who do not comply with regulations for renovations or new construction within a district.
Lawyers and municipal officials say that the amendment will limit the construction of immense "trophy" homes in inappropriate neighborhoods, and yet allow "big box" stores to be built, provided they abandon their generic architecture and conform to the new regulations.
The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. John G. Rowland after having been passed with almost no notice outside the chambers of the legislature, has so far been adopted by only one community -- Brooklyn, a 24-square-mile town of 6,700 residents in the northeast corner of the state.
But as word of the legislation spreads, village districts are being considered in a growing number of towns from Canterbury to Greenwich by planning and zoning commissions that have long sought legal means to reject projects that they feel destroy the integrity of a neighborhood.
The bill states in part that "village districts shall protect the distinctive character, landscape, and historic structures of such areas and may regulate alterations and improvements in view of public roadways, including but not limited to design and placement of buildings, maintenance of public views; design, paving materials and placement of public roadways; design, relationship and compatibility of structures, plantings, signs, roadways, street hardware, color, size, height, proportion of openings, roof treatments, and lighting of residential and commercial property."
It also states that "the removal or disruption of historic, traditional or significant structures or architectural elements shall be minimized."
"The good thing is it takes into consideration the esthetics of a town," said Terry J. Tondro, professor of real property law at the University of Connecticut. "My biggest criticism is it's too general. Regulating color and esthetics could be challenged. For legal due process it needs a whole lot of clarification. If a zoning commission is careful it could do that."
THE same concerns were voiced by William Ethier, executive vice president of the Connecticut Homebuilders Association. "The bill is so vague and open-ended," he said, "that in the wrong hands it could be very abusive of property owners and applicants for new construction and remodeling. A lot of builders who have looked at the act are concerned because they they don't know what to do with it."
He is working with the Connecticut chapter of the American Planning Association, which endorsed the bill, on amendments to be presented to the current legislative session. Wendy Johnston, Town Planner for Wilton and head of the chapter, applauds its purpose. "It offers a chance to do innovative planning," she said, "but under the current wording it's not easy for towns to write precise zoning regulations."
Real estate brokers say they understand and appreciate the concept of protecting a neighborhood's singular appeal as an enhancement for sales. But Timothy Calnen, government affairs director of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, expressed the view that "real estate is premised on property rights."
"The act could severely restrict the ability of people to transfer property and improve it with alterations," he said.
He would like to see more public participation through a provision calling for notification by certified mail of residents of a proposed village district that a designation is pending. The notification would come prior to the required public hearing by the local planning and zoning commission.
In Greenwich, a town perpetually deluged with applications for office buildings, oversized mansions and fast-food restaurants, Diane Fox, the Town Planner, enthusiastically supports the bill.
"We are exploring three areas that would qualify for village district status -- in Byram, Cos Cob and Old Greenwich," she said. "We are defining the commercial areas, schools and libraries that adjoin them in six or seven streets of each area, reflective of the history of development in those neighborhoods." She has asked for a copy of Brooklyn's local ordinance to study.
Similarly mixed neighborhoods in Stamford are seen as ideal candidates for village districts by Renee Kahn, director of the city's Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program. "We're very interested," she said. "The bill doesn't have the elitist quality of a historic district, so it could be very useful if you live in a little side street and a McDonald's wants to come in. You are protected from the noise, the lights and traffic. If your house looks out the back on one of those establishments it's a disaster."
UNDER the new law, each village district board is required to submit proposals for renovations or new construction to an architect or architectural review board for recommendations before approving or rejecting them.
"I think establishing village districts is worth a try, but I'm torn," said William H. Glover, a partner at Centerbrook Architects in Centerbrook. "I've served on zoning commissions and know from experience that you can't legislate beauty. As an architect I would rather not have a committee tell me what's appropriate in a particular situation, but as a resident it would be nice to have some means of preventing some of the disastrous developments that often occur."
The whole idea of village districts germinated two years ago as a vehicle for convincing the state's Department of Transportation to retract its plan for widening the portion of Route 6 that runs through the historic center of Brooklyn. Route 6 is being rebuilt across Connecticut, from the New York State border to the Rhode Island line.
John J. Filchak, executive director of the Northeast Council of Governments, one of Connecticut's regional planning agencies, was called in to devise a bill giving the town the final say on the design and appearance of Route 6 in the village area.
The Department of Transportation strongly opposed the measure as presented to the legislature in 1997 and it failed to pass.
"We need to have ultimate authority for creating a balance between road safety and capacity," Carl Bard, project coordinator for the Department of Transportation, said at the time.
When a much broader bill passed last year the department agreed to retain the mile-and-a-half roadway through central Brooklyn at its present width of 24 feet. A need to eliminate a dangerous curve will, however, require the demolition of four homes and the removal of one historic house to the back of its property.
"For the first time in the history of Connecticut zoning," said Mr. Filchak, "planning and zoning commissions are allowed to set up rules and regulations as to how things will look and interact."
John Shannahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission, recently moderated a panel on village districts, attended by a standing-room crowd. "We have over 340 national, state and local historic districts in the state," he said, "mostly residential and mostly without design control or esthetic review. We have a new tool here."
Ambiguity of language and the absence of a set of architectural standards that could be interpreted for a variety of village districts bother Gurdon H. Buck, partner and urban planner at the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole.
"The act is what I would call a good start," he said, citing the Westville neighborhood of New Haven, the Victorian downtown of Shelton, Federal portions of Ridgefield and late 18th-early 19th century Middle Haddam as potential village districts.
Representative Jefferson D. Davis, a Pomfret Democrat who is chairman of the planning and zoning development committee, introduced the bill.
"I don't agree that it's too broad in its authorization," he said. "It allows for discretion by planning and zoning commissions within a defined framework. A unique aspect is the consideration of public views of hills, parks, waterways -- an opportunity to define the relationships in our towns between our built and nonbuilt environments. And it addresses a tragedy in urban, suburban and even rural settings -- the reliance on zoning that divides towns into single use areas, driving out residential opportunities downtown."
"Often people don't give a new law a chance to be put into practice," he said, adding that he is more interested in giving it a year to sift out than amending it now.

HEADLINE: Dodging Bullets In Overseas Trade

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
WHEN the Asian financial crisis broke in July of 1997, it caused worries in Connecticut. Some of the Asian nations whose economies were hardest hit were among the state's 10 largest overseas trade partners, and while foreign trade makes up only about 6 percent of the state's economy, it is a segment that has steadily grown over the last decade.
With the recent release of the first comprehensive analysis of the situation, however, there is cause for cautious optimism. Sales by Connecticut companies to Asia have faltered, but not as badly as was feared. Economists and business executives are hopeful that the effects on jobs will remain small, and that trade will begin picking up soon. 
 "The general conclusion was it's affected us," said Will McEachern, editor-in-chief of The Connecticut Economy, a quarterly publication by the University of Connecticut's Center for Economic Analysis. But, he added, "unless it gets worse, it hasn't had a big effect on the economy."
The Connecticut Economy led its Fall 1998 issue with the following cover title: "A Mild Case of the Asian Flu." In a survey by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association of manufacturers in the state, almost a third of respondents reported a loss in sales they attributed to Asian economic problems.
The fears of manufacturers and service industry companies are complex, reflecting the complexities of a global marketplace.
National currencies throughout Asia have devalued drastically, making exports from the United States far more expensive than before, and making it harder for Asians to afford them. At the same time, it has made Asian imports less expensive in the United States, challenging the competitiveness of American companies.
There have been layoffs, stock market jitters and a slowing of economic growth in the United States as a result. In Connecticut, manufacturing export sales went down 11 percent for the first three quarters of 1998 compared with the same period in 1997.
But mitigating the effects and holding job losses low in Connecticut is the nature of the state's exports -- largely high-tech specialty products and services including insurance, pharmaceuticals and electronics that have continued to sell better than the consumer goods, raw materials and agricultural products that other states export, according to Peter Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
An example is Locknetics Security Engineering, a company in Bristol that makes electronic locks. Its president, James Scott, said in the 1990's the company's exports increased from 4 percent to 18 percent of its sales, roughly evenly divided between Asia and Europe. Locknetics made all of the magnetic doors for the new Hong Kong airport, the largest in the world.
Lately, however, Locknetics' sales in Asia have slowed considerably; devaluations have doubled the price that Asians must pay. "Our products have become very expensive for them," Mr. Scott said.
But Mr. Scott said he has seen signs of renewed orders from Singapore and elsewhere in Asia as construction projects that had been put on hold there have begun to restart. His company is also getting interest from construction projects in Japan where it had no business before, as well as from the Middle East and South America.
Mr. Scott attributed that interest to the reputation his company's products: the kind of locks operated with key pads, identification cards and handprint recognition devices that are familiar features of techno-thriller fiction.
Overall, said Mr. McEachern, foreign sales by the electric and electronic equipment segment of Connecticut manufacturing declined in 1998's first three quarters by 37 percent, as did the industrial machinery and computers industries segment. Precision instruments had about a 15 percent decline for the same period, he said.
The only bright spot has been in the transportation segment, in which export sales increased by about 20 percent in the first half and were still holding up for the first three quarters, he said.
Much of that was due to Pratt and Whitney's aircraft engine sales, which were brisk, even to Asia, according to Mr. Gioia. Boeing announced production cuts and layoffs earlier this month due to cancellations of Asian aircraft purchases, which has the potential of affecting Pratt and Whitney, but the company also sells to Boeing's competitors so it is too early to tell if there will be any impact, Mr. Gioia said.
"I don't think the effect has been dramatic," he said of the overall impact of the Asian economic crisis. "It hasn't been as much as people expected."
The fact that the Asian situation makes those countries' products less expensive, and more competitive, in other parts of the world might strengthen their economies faster than anyone expects, and some companies in the United States that make parts for Asian products would benefit from that, Mr. Gioia observed. So even though cheaper imports might negatively affect some Connecticut companies in the short term, it could be positive in the long term, he said. "It's a very tough thing to predict," he concluded.
Foreign sales of services, like insurance, are even more difficult to track, but that sector has also slowed because of the Asia situation, according to The Connecticut Economy.
United Technologies, based in Hartford, which owns Pratt and Whitney, has announced it expects this year's profits to be down 15 percent largely because of the Asian crisis, but "we're not concerned about it," said a company spokesman, Peter Murphy. United Technologies also owns Otis Elevator and Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter manufacturer.
Mr. Murphy noted that Asia is undergoing the biggest urbanization transformation in the history of the world, with 700 million people moving to the cities. That, he said, is an unstoppable force for economic growth, so whatever economic problems Asia is experiencing now are only temporary. "That is clearly the market of the future," Mr. Murphy said, and United Technologies is taking advantage of the opportunities the devaluation of Asian currencies offers to purchase companies and form joint ventures there.
Meanwhile, the state's exports still show strength, said Mark Prisloe, a senior economist at the state's Department of Economic and Community Development. Asian countries account for 21 percent of the state's total foreign trade. Although exports to Asia dropped 11.4 percent in 1998, he said, the previous year, they rose 14 percent.
But figures like that can be deceiving, he said. Connecticut's exports to Canada, its largest foreign trade partner, rose only 1.9 percent for the first three quarters of 1998 while exports to Taiwan, the state's 10th largest trade partner, rose 24.5 percent. "I would not make too much of any quarter's data," he said.
"Connecticut seems to have fared better than some of the other states," noted James C. Nicholas, executive director of the Connecticut World Trade Association, an organization that promotes foreign trade. He said some of the more optimistic estimates for when the Asian crisis would end range from 18 months to three years.
Japan is the key to Asia's recovery, said Mr. Nicholas, because it exports capital as well as products to its neighbors. That is reflected the thinking of others, including Mr. McEachern who was far less sanguine about the prospects for a quick end to the Asian economic crisis. He said Japanese students who attend his classes at the University of Connecticut are very anxious about it. "The students who I've talked to have very little confidence in the Japanese Government's ability to resolve the problem," he said.
Nevertheless, The Connecticut Economy quantified the effect of the Asian crisis on Connecticut as a loss of only about 0.2 percent of the 127,000 jobs generated by foreign trade in the state. "It comes at a time when the rest of the economy has been doing well," Mr. McEachern said. However fast Asia's recovery is, the economists writing for The Connecticut Economy forecast a return to rapid growth in export-related jobs in the state beginning in 2000. Unless there is another dramatic development, its analysis predicts, "the Asian crisis by itself holds little threat for the state's economy."

He's at Home In the Pulpit, Wherever It Is

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: LINCOLN PARK

 BODY:
EVER since the civil rights movement forged the link between the black church and the world of politics, many African American preachers have found it to be a good policy to keep one eye on their flocks and the other on what the local politicians were up to.
It was through just such concerned involvement that DeForest (Buster) Soaries Jr., pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens, ended up giving the invocation at the Somerset County Republican Dinner in the fall of 1993. At his side on the dais sat a big-name political consultant, Ed Rollins, who was campaign strategist for a no-name Republican underdog in the gubernatorial race, Christine Todd Whitman. 
 Mrs. Whitman is now Governor, of course, and 10 days ago Dr. Soaries was confirmed as her latest Secretary of State, an appointment that will make it possible for him to keep that eye on government by giving him a seat at the center of power in Trenton.
True, he conceded, the Secretary of State's position does not require a lot of heavy lifting -- the state constitution lists his first duty as "keeper of the Great Seal of the State" -- but as the 47-year-old minister put it, "the weight of what is being lifted is in proportion to the strength of the lifter."
And Mr. Rollins? He has retired to the world of book contracts, speaking fees and cable television appearances, but his presence on the dais with Dr. Soaries that day has a lot of do with how the new Secretary got the job.
That's because of something Mr. Rollins did one week after Mrs. Whitman was elected, putting out the story that the victorious Republicans had bribed unidentified black ministers with a half million dollars to advise their parishioners to stay home on election day. It did not take Dr. Soaries long to realize that as a black minister recently seen smiling and schmoozing with Mr. Rollins, he had a problem, and that Mrs. Whitman had a problem, and that Mr. Rollins's hasty denial was not going to solve it.
"I called up the Governor's office and I told them that Christie needs to be at the 7 A.M. service in my church on Sunday, and she was there," Dr. Soaries recalled.
In the days that followed, Dr. Soaries, who had endorsed Jim Florio, the incumbent Governor defeated by Mrs. Whitman, stood with the Governor-elect and found other black ministers to do so. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton came and went, Mr. Rollins announced his retirement from politics, and the first crisis of the Whitman administration gradually faded. And Mrs. Whitman had met her go-to man in the state's tricky racial politics.
Some people worried that Dr. Soaries, who says he is a political independent, had tied himself too closely to the Republicans, but that was not his concern, he said. "I had an interest in disproving this story not so much to protect the Republicans, as to defend the church," he said.
That church today worships in a tiny, 1930's-era building. But behind it a new, $10 million church is rising, as big as an airport terminal, spacious enough to accommodate the 5,100 enrolled members in First Baptist in two services.
The new church, and the swelling size of the congregation, are part of Dr Soaries's legacy since he arrived in Somerset in 1990 from Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, where he worked under the celebrated Rev. Howard S. Woodson.
The move to his own church was not an easy one. First Baptist had had only two ministers in its 53 years. It had no formal annual budget, it had no bylaws and it had no guidelines for electing a successor. In the highly factionalized scramble to advance three different candidates, Dr. Soaries won a plurality but not a majority.
"I came to a church that was divided," he said, and listening to his account of those years gives a sense of how he operates in politics as well as in church management.
Rule one: no purges.
"We were facing a situation where we could have had a lot of little churches breaking off -- Second Baptist, Third Baptist -- but we held it together, and we did it with the same people, we didn't say some people were out and some people were in."
From a membership of 1,500, First Baptist had grown to 5,100 members and has spun off six non-profit corporations, including a credit union and a community development corporation.
That Dr. Soaries should value democracy and inclusiveness in church management may be related to the total absence of dissent in the Montclair household where he grew up. DeForest Soaries Sr., a cleric and a teacher at Kinney Junior High in Newark and himself the son of a West Indian preacher, was not a man inclined to argue details with his three children.
"He was a benevolent dictator, emphasis on dictator," Dr. Soaries said of his father.
The son graduated from Fordham University, and, moved by his grandmother's anguish at the murder of Martin Luther King Jr., he took a master's from Princeton Seminary and a doctorate in theology from the Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, the old Methodist divinity school. He lives in Franklin Park with his wife, Donna, and their 9-year-old twins, Malcolm and Martin.
Dr. Soaries intends to keep preaching every Sunday while he is Secretary of State, and to keep pushing for the interests of the poor and neglected in his official capacity during the week. As he outlined his goals, he might have been drawing from the sermon he had just delivered, based on the prophet Micah's commandment to "do justice."
"It can be a position of major leadership instead of one of minor observation," Dr. Soaries said of his government job. "I intend to consult with the Governor on her budget message, and intend to consult with the Attorney General on law enforcement as it affects areas that are underserved by police, and I expect to be in consultation with all of the boards and commissions as an advocate of the Governor's notion of personal responsibility."
And what about the Govenor's responsibility to minorities, a subject that has landed her in tight spots several times since the Rollins episode? Mrs. Whitman is innocent of bigotry, Dr. Soaries said, but needed coaching in managing those relations.
"She was not raised to think racially," the preacher said. "In a clinical sense, that is a virtue, but in a real-world sense, it can be hazardous."
Translation: race is so pervasive an issue, for good or ill, that to ignore it invites trouble.
On the day of his Martin Luther King Day sermon, Dr. Soaries offered a similarly balanced view of the relations between the races. His assessment was half good -- pure bigotry has abated -- and half bad:
"We still live in separate worlds," Dr. Soaries said of blacks and whites. "We don't really see the other side, and that's true of the black middle class and lower-income minorities -- they don't really know each other, either. That is something we all need to address."
 
'There Are Those Who Are in Need of Mercy'
Last Sunday Dr. DeForest B. Soaries Jr. delivered his Martin Luther King Day sermon at First Baptist Church of Lincoln Park, in Somerset. His text was the prophet Micah's well-known admonition to "do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your God." Here are excerpts from his message:
 
EVERYBODY loves mercy when mercy visits their house. Everybody loved mercy when mercy stops by their way. But believe I hear Micah saying we ought to love mercy when God bestows mercy on other folks. . . .
Don't get me wrong -- there are people who are victims of their own irresponsibility. I don't want anybody to think that I am so naive as to think that every person who is unemployed, that they have been the victim of discrimination. I don't want you to think that in 1999 that all of our problems and all of our poverty is still a consequence of the outstretched arms of 200 years ago slavery. Yes, some of us are responsible for our own condition and we are the victims of the choices we've made and the chances we've taken.
Having said that, there are those who are in need of mercy. That grandmother, whose child died from an overdose of drugs, now she's trying to raise her children left behind by her child -- that grandmothers need the support from the community and from the government -- she needs what the Bible calls mercy! Five thousand young people in the city of Newark whose parents have died from AIDS, by no fault of their own they are the victims of circumstances beyond their control, they need some mercy! Children born, languishing in hospitals, their parents on drugs, those children could not choose the family to which they were born, those children need mercy!
When we've become so self-sufficient, when we've become so proud of our having pulled ourselves up by our mythical bootstraps, when we've become so middle class and uppity-up, when we become so high-falutin' in society, when we no longer celebrate the fact that God is a merciful God and he needs us to be what Assisi calls "instruments of God's peace," we are irrelevant, and history will have nothing to celebrate as a consequence of our lives.
Martin King was a man who loved mercy, and worked that God would manifest his mercy on those who needed God's attention!

HEADLINE: Tourism Figures Show a Drop

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE crescent of picturesque villages bordering the Hudson River was once known as Millionaire's Row, a strand of lavish vacation hideaways along the shore where the wealthy whiled away their summers. But in the last year, the popularity of the historic estates as Westchester tourist destinations has waned, and officials are wondering why.
The number of visitors to five sites in Westchester managed by the nonprofit Historic Hudson Valley in Tarrytown -- among them the popular Kykuit, the home of four generations of Rockefellers -- was down nearly 7 percent last year from 1997. 
 "This comes as a real wake-up call," Burns Patterson, marketing director for Historic Hudson Valley, said.
Mr. Patterson and others responsible for tourism on both county and state levels said the figures may only represent a temporary fluctuation and therefore have little long-term significance. Or they could presage difficult times ahead for the industry, because the five sites represent some of the Hudson Valley's main attractions.
"It could be just a blip on the radar screen, but we don't know," said Harold E. Vogt, chief executive officer of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce. "It also could have long-range implications. Either way, we're taking this very seriously."
Georgia G. Kalayjian-Murphy, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Westchester, which is affiliated with the County Chamber of Commerce, agreed that the decrease at the Hudson Valley sites should not be ignored.
Mr. Patterson said 200,000 people visited the historic estates last year compared with 1997, when there were 214,000 visitors.
In addition to administering Kykuit (pronounced KYE-cut), which is considered the centerpiece of the tourist sites along the river, Historic Hudson Valley also manages tourism for four other estates in Westchester.
They are Washington Irving's 17th-century house Sunnyside in Tarrytown, Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow, the home of Frederick Philipse, a carpenter who eventually earned his fortune as a slave trader; the Union Church of Pocantico Hills in Sleepy Hollow, which has stained-glass windows by Matisse and Chagall, and Van Cortlandt Manor, an 18th-century manor house in Croton-on-Hudson.
In addition, Historic Hudson Valley, which was founded by John D. Rockefeller Jr. in 1951, is responsible for visitor activity at Montgomery Place, a 434-acre historic site in Annandale-on-Hudson in northern Dutchess County. In calculating the annual number of visitors, the organization tallies people coming through the turnstiles and does not count lecture series sales or other related events outside the premises, Mr. Patterson explained. The group's mission, he said, is to preserve the culture, landscape and history of the Hudson River Valley. At least in part, the decrease in tourism last year at the county's best known historic sites can be attributed to wet weather in the spring. "But when you live by the sword," he added ruefully, "you also die by the sword." At Sunnyside, for example, torrential rains had an adverse effect on events like an outdoor exhibition by local artists and a Victorian-style picnic planned on the lawn for Mother's Day.
"Our intention was to show guests that we offered more than just dusty old house tours," Mr. Patterson said.
Although he acknowledged that the organization could buy a large tent or even umbrellas for every visitor -- and could even promote rain-or-shine events -- Mr. Patterson said, "We'll never be able to weatherproof ourselves 100 percent."
Robert W. Elliott, Director of Economic Development for the county, said the numbers reported by Historic Hudson Valley were "unfortunately not an anomaly" and possibly indicated a wider trend.
Mr. Elliott said there have been similar, though still early and unconfirmed, reports of tourism on the decline from other historic sites in Westchester.
"At the very least," he said, "this is something to pay attention to."
Looking at the last eight years, however, the growth at Kykuit, Sunnyside, Philipsburg Manor, Union Church and Van Cortlandt Manor has been extremely healthy, Mr. Patterson said. Visitor figures in 1991 were 96,000. And when compared with 200,000 this year, that represents a 108 percent increase.
But a 1996 study conducted by Marist College in Poughkeepsie for the nonprofit Hudson River Greenway Council -- a state-appointed group charged with establishing a chain of riverfront parks and scenic open space between Albany and New York -- concluded that many of the historic sites along the Hudson have not been marketed aggressively enough and could handle even more visitors.
Dr. Ann Davis, a professor of economics and director of the college's Bureau of Economic Research, said last week that interviews with visitors at 50 sites along the Hudson, from Albany to New York City, revealed that most of them learned about sights in the Hudson Valley from friends, family and word of mouth -- and were not drawn to the spots either by travel services or advertising campaigns.
"There's a very large potential here that's not being tapped," Dr. Davis said. She said that according to the Marist College study of visitors about 51 percent of them were 50 or older and 62 percent had college or graduate degrees. Those findings suggested that more marketing should be aimed at those groups.
Maggie Vinciguerra, executive director of Greenway Council, said that her organization was studying new marketing strategies for historic sites. She also said that the organization would make recommendations to market sites as part of a region rather than as individual places to visit. Ms. Vinciguerra said that was the strategy adopted in Williamsburg, Va., where tourist numbers are now increasing again after a period of decline. She also said Williamsburg was advertising multiple-day stays rather than one-day trips.
Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy of the Convention and Visitors Bureau said she was puzzled by the downturn at the Historic Hudson Valley sites, especially in light of other tourism figures in Westchester. For example, taxable hotel sales for the county in fiscal year 1997, the last year for which figures are available, were $173.4 million -- 26 percent more than in fiscal year 1996, when they were $137.9 and 104 percent more than in 1992, when they were $85.2 million.
Taxable hotel sales for 1998 should top $201 million when the tallying is done later this winter, Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy predicted.
Also, visitor spending generated more than $25.7 million in county sales taxes in 1997, up from $10.6 million the year before, Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy said.
But she cautioned: "We can't always be breaking the records. Perhaps when the numbers go so high, they're bound to hit a peak."
Estimates show that based on industry standards of measuring such things, the average Kykuit day tripper, for example, spends $59 in the county on gas, restaurants, and the like, Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy said. And for every overnight hotel stay, $189 is the average amount spent in addition to the cost of the room.
Mr. Elliott at the county's Economic Development Office observed that Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy's numbers included business travelers staying at hotels and therefore did not accurately represent the problems being experienced by Historic Hudson Valley or any other cultural institutions.
The numbers of visitors to Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, the former estate of Jay Gould, the financier, were also disappointing last year. They rose by 1 percent in 1998, to 78,780 visitors from 78,000 the year before, Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy said.
Meanwhile, officials of the Convention and Visitors Bureau and other agencies said they were stepping up efforts to increase numbers for the coming tourist season. At Sunnyside, the season begins on April 10 and 11 with a celebration of Washington Irving's birthday. The bureau will be the host to a Travel Expo at the County Center in White Plains on March 11 and 12. And Ms. Kalayjian-Murphy said her group, the county and others like Historic Hudson Valley were working closely with New York City groups to sponsor Westchester tours.
Metro-North Railroad, for example, is working with the bureau to sponsor One-Day Getaways to sites like Rye Playland -- "the most popular attraction that we offer," said Daniel O'Connell, a marketing director for the railroad. He said the beach and amusement park draws 15,000 Metro-North riders a summer. Some guided tours of the Hudson Valley are offered year-round; other packaged events are available seasonally. Rye Playland topped the one million visitor mark in 1998, the best attendance in a decade.
Meanwhile, tourism in New York City has grown in recent years, with 33 million domestic and international travelers visiting the city in 1997, the most ever in one year, according to New York City's Tourism Bureau. The state, too, has reported healthy figures. "Tourism is New York State's second-largest industry with an economic impact of $46 billion per year," Charles A. Gargano, chairman of Empire State Development, said recently. The largest industry in the state is agriculture, with an economic impact of more than $60 billion a year.
Gov. George E. Pataki reported in 1997 that figures released by the Travel Industry Association of America on people who take part in historic and cultural activities showed that the state ranked second only to California in attracting those tourism dollars. Pennsylvania was third.

HEADLINE: After the Blizzard, A New Hartford Team?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
THE New England Blizzard of the bankrupt American Basketball League may be gone, but the team, which was based in Hartford, is not forgotten by its legion of fans. Indeed the team may not be gone for good.
Two high-ranking state officials are trying to fill the void that was created when the league ceased operations in late December, resulting in the demise of the popular Blizzard, who played their home games at the Hartford Civic Center. 
 Lieut. Gov. M. Jodi Rell and Commissioner James F. Abromaitis of the Department of Economic and Community Development have sent letters to the presidents of the National Basketball Association and the Women's National Basketball Association, respectively, requesting that the surviving women's league, which is owned by the N.B.A., put a franchise in Hartford. Ms. Rell and Mr. Abromaitis pointed to the huge drawing power of the Blizzard, which led the A.B.L. in home attendance during its first two seasons and was far ahead again when the league filed for bankruptcy protection and suspended operations on Dec. 22. They also asked that the W.N.B.A. and N.B.A. reconsider a policy of placing franchises for women's teams only in cities where N.B.A. teams play. The women's teams play in N.B.A. arenas during the summer months when the men's league is not functioning. Ms. Rell's letter was sent to David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, on Jan. 13, two days after the State Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, announced he had issued a subpoena for N.B.A. documents to determine whether the league used its economic muscle to block the American Basketball League's access to sponsors and to television contracts.
Though neither Mr. Stern nor Valerie Ackerman, the president of the W.N.B.A., which was a rival to the A.B.L., responded immediately to the letters, at least one W.N.B.A. official has said publicly that the league was unlikely to put a franchise in Hartford. "If we were to go into New England, it would have to be in Boston," Renee Brown, the women's league director of player personnel, said. "That's the W.N.B.A. policy."
Jeff Twiss, a spokesman for the Boston Celtics, said that Celtics' officials had discussed the possibility of applying for a W.N.B.A. franchise. "There were some internal discussions about it several months ago," Mr. Twiss said in an interview, adding that the discussions took place before the American Basketball League -- which played a fall and winter schedule -- suspended operations. Asked whether a W.N.B.A. team based in Boston might play some of its games in Hartford, Mr. Twiss said that was a possibility. "But then we'd also consider other cities in New England like Providence, Worcester, Springfield and Bangor, Maine," he said.
Until a few years ago, the Celtics played about a half dozen games at the Hartford Civic Center each season. While Boston has been a hotbed of professional basketball since the 1950's, when the Celtics began a long reign as the dominant team in the N.B.A., the city has never been tested as a market for women's basketball. By comparison, both the New England Blizzard and the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, have both drawn well at the Hartford Civic Center.
If a W.N.B.A. franchise were awarded to Boston or Hartford, it could not happen until next year at the earliest. Mark Pray, a spokesman for the league, said that the women's league had already decided to add two new franchises this summer -- in Orlando and in Minneapolis -- which will give the league 12 teams. "So far as I know, there've been no discussions about further expansion," Mr. Pray said.
In asking that the league reconsider its policy of awarding women's team franchises only to cities with N.B.A. teams, Ms. Rell said in her letter, "As evidenced by the Blizzard, it has been proven that the true base of women's basketball fans in New England is in Hartford. There are tens of thousands of women's basketball fans in Connecticut who would jump at the opportunity to see their favorite professionals" such as Jen Rizzotti and Kara Wolters" -- both Blizzard players who previously had been stars of UConn teams -- playing again at the Civic Center.
Mr. Abromaitis, a former UConn basketball star, noted in his letter to the W.N.B.A. Commissioner Val Ackerman that the Blizzard's home attendance last season, with more than 10,000 spectators a game, was larger than that of six of the eight W.N.B.A. franchises "without the benefit of W.N.B.A. marketing and promotion."
"Support for women's basketball at both the professional and college levels has been a unique Connecticut phenomenon over the past decade and continues to grow," Mr. Abromaitis wrote.
One of the team's -- and the league's -- biggest sponsors was the Hartford-based Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company. Phoenix is also the A.B.L.'s biggest creditor, having guaranteed a $6 million bank loan to help bankroll the league. The company, at least for now, has retained most of the Blizzard's 13-member front-office staff.
What the A.B.L. never recovered from, it seems, was its inability to get a season-long contract with a major television network. After issuing a subpoena of N.B.A. records relating to the W.N.B.A., the Attorney General, Mr. Blumenthal, said he had received information from industry sources that the N.B.A. used methods that might have blocked such a contract and, indeed, led to the collapse of the A.B.L.
"There's evidence that the N.B.A. used sharp economic elbows to exclude the A.B.L. from fair play, including access to essential financial rights like TV and product sponsorship," Mr. Blumenthal said, adding that "any indications of unfair, exclusive arrangements or restrictions imposed on broadcasters would be of very powerful importance."
The attorney general's subpoena -- which must be answered by Feb. 3 -- requests information on conditions and restrictions that the N.B.A. might have imposed on sponsors, broadcasters or manufacturers to the detriment of the A.B.L. Mr. Blumenthal said he was hopeful that the N.B.A., which organized the W.N.B.A. after the A.B.L. was formed, would not fight the subpoena. "Their interests would be better served if they did not fight it," he said in an interview. He also said that he has talked with attorneys general in other states where A.B.L. teams were situated, and that some of them were considering similar action.
Asked if his issuance of a subpoena for N.B.A. records could jeopardize Hartford's chances of getting a W.N.B.A. franchise, Mr. Blumenthal said, "There's no way it could hurt, and it might actually help indirectly." Meanwhile, Blizzard players have been blocked from playing with other teams since the A.B.L. has refused to release them claiming they are still assets of the league during its bankruptcy proceedings. The league has maintained its stance even though the players have not been paid since November.

Decoding The Murky Rent Laws

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
WHILE most New Yorkers are aware that there are two basic forms of rent regulation -- rent control and rent stabilization -- there is often confusion about what each does and where each came from. Here are some of the more significant differences between rent control and rent stabilization, along with a brief description of their origins.
"What we have here is a confusing patchwork of laws," said David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer.
Mr. Ng explained that both forms of rent regulation were the product of state and local laws. Rent control, Mr. Ng said, applies to rental units in buildings built before Feb. 1, 1947, that have been continuously occupied by the same tenant or a legal successor tenant since before July 1, 1971. 
 Rent stabilization, on the other hand, applies to apartments in buildings with six or more units constructed between Feb. 1, 1947, and Jan. 1, 1974, and to tenants who moved into similarly sized buildings built before Feb. 1, 1947 if the move-in date was after June 30, 1971. It also applies to certain loft buildings and some buildings that participate in tax-abatement or other government programs.
According to the most recent survey conducted by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, there were 70,572 rent-controlled apartments and 1.05 million rent-stabilized apartments in the city in 1996. The total number of rental units in the city at that time was 2.02 million.
And while both rent control and rent stabilization are made possible by state laws -- the Local Emergency Rent Control Act and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act , respectively -- further actions are required on the local level for rent regulations to apply in specific municipalities. (While New York City has the vast bulk of rent regulated apartments, more than 50 other municipalities across the state have also adopted rent control or rent stabilization laws.) The actions, which are generally required every three years, include a declaration of a housing emergency -- deemed to exist when vacancy rates are below 5 percent -- and the adoption or renewal of local rent-control or rent-stabilization laws.
So, for example, while the Legislature in June 1997 extended the Emergency Tenant Protection Act for six years -- to June 2003 -- that did not automatically extend rent stabilization in New York City for the same amount of time. That is because, Mr. Ng said, the New York City Rent Stabilization Law, which put into effect the provisions of the state's Emergency Tenant Protection Act, is set to expire on March 31, 2000, and must itself be extended to remain in effect beyond that date.
While the state's Local Emergency Rent Control Act has no automatic expiration date, New York City must nevertheless renew its local Rent and Rehabilitation Law for rent control to remain in effect after March 31, 2000.
Mr. Ng said that rent-regulated apartments -- both rent-stabilized and rent-controlled -- become decontrolled in a number of ways. For example, he said, regulated apartments that are vacated can be deregulated if the legal rent that can be charged to a new tenant, either immediately or after improvements, reaches $2,000.
In addition, Mr. Ng said, even occupied tenants can lose their regulated status under the luxury decontrol provisions of the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1993. Under that law, which was amended in 1997, an apartment can be decontrolled when the rent is $2,000 or more and the annual income of the tenant exceeds $175,000 for two years preceding the landlord's petition for decontrol.
Moreover, Mr. Ng. said, apartments subject to the rent-control law lose their status upon vacancy. In buildings of six or more units, they then fall under the provisions of the rent-stabilization regulations, once a negotiated rent has been set with the new tenant. In smaller buildings, Mr. Ng. said, the apartments are usually decontrolled.
Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants & Neighbors Coalition, a tenant-advocacy group based in Manhattan, said that the most significant difference between rent control and rent stabilization is the manner in which rent increases are calculated.
In New York City, he said, increases in rent controlled apartments are determined by what is known as the Maximum Base Rent/ Maximum Collectible Rent system. With that system, he said, the maximum collectible rent is defined as the highest rent that can be charged for an apartment at a given time. The maximum base rent for each apartment -- an amount originally set in 1972 and then adjusted every two years to reflect increases in operating costs -- is frequently higher than the maximum collectible rent.
Under the current rent-control laws, Mr. McKee said, the maximum collectible rent can be increased by up to 7.5 percent each year, as long as it does not exceed the maximum base rent.
Increases for rent-stabilized apartments, on the other hand, are calculated on an "inflation-sensitive" basis by the nine-member Rent Guidelines Board, with two representatives each of landlords and tenants and five public representatives. In calculating yearly increases for rent-stabilized tenants, Mr. McKee said, the board takes into consideration increases in the owner's operating expenses, adjusted for inflation.
While it is often thought that rent increases for rent-stabilized tenants generally exceed those for their rent-controlled counterparts, Mr. McKee said, the opposite frequently occurs. Over the last several years, he said, increases for rent-stabilized tenants have stayed at around 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease. Increases for rent-controlled tenants, on the other hand, frequently amount to 7.5 percent each year because the spread between the maximum collectible rent and the maximum base rent -- both of which increase on a regular basis -- often remains wide enough to allow for the maximum increase in the collectible rent.
Martin Heistein, a Manhattan lawyer who frequently represents landlords, pointed out that while owners of both rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments can also obtain rent increases for major capital improvements, there are different rules that apply to each. Generally, Mr. Heistein said, increases for major capital improvements -- defined as buildingwide improvements that benefit all tenants -- are based on a seven-year period of amortization of the cost of the improvement, allocated on a "per-room, per-month" basis.
So, for example, a $50,000 major capital improvement in a building with 25 four-room apartments would result in a monthly increase of $5.95 per room. (The amortization of $50,000 over seven years is $7,142.85 a year or $595.23 a month. When apportioned equally among 100 rooms, that amounts to an increase of $5.95 per room per month.)
For rent-stabilized tenants in New York City, Mr. Heistein said, the rent increase for a major capital improvement that is collectible in any one year may not exceed 6 percent of the rent. Moreover, he said, the increase is retroactive to the date 30 days after the owner filed the application for the increase. For rent-controlled tenants the increase can be as much as 15 percent of the tenant's rent, Mr. Heistein said. However, he said, major-capital-improvement increases for such tenants are effective only from the date of the order granting the increase; they cannot be applied retroactively.
Another difference between rent control and rent stabilization, Mr. Heistein said, is that owners of rent-controlled apartments in New York City can generally pass along increases in fuel costs to tenants landlords in rent-stabilized buildings cannot.
At the same time, tenants in rent-stabilized apartments have a right to sublet their units, but tenants in rent-controlled apartments do not.

How Stocks Could Work For Social Security

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT'S fun to talk about what to do with 15 years' worth of projected surpluses in the Federal budget, particularly when the number in question is a tidy $4.4 trillion. That is what President Clinton was doing last week when he lobbed his Social Security proposals in front of the nation.
Such a discussion is much more enjoyable than contemplating how much smaller those numbers might be if -- Heaven forbid -- the economy fell into recession between now and 2015. 
 Still, any number of important people inside the Beltway were far from amused at Mr. Clinton's suggestion that part of the surplus he wants to target for Social Security -- a sum of about $700 billion -- be invested in stocks and corporate bonds instead of Treasury securities.
Peter A. Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and chairman of a panel of the nonpartisan National Academy of Social Insurance that issued a report on the issue last month, shared his thoughts on the topic last week via telephone from Cambridge, England.
 
Q. Is the President's proposal something you can support?
 
A. At the moment there are two fairly radical proposals about Social Security: One would create individual accounts as a substitute for defined benefits, and the other is to have the Social Security trust fund invest part of its money in stocks and bonds.
The trust fund proposal, which the President put forward, is the less radical idea of the two. I favor it, and I thought the President put it in absolutely the right context.
 Q. But don't people like Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, have a point when they say decisions about where to invest the money would fall prey to political pressure?
A. The issue here is the design of an institution to do the investing.
Mr. Greenspan is at the head of an institution that has a lot of independence to handle monetary policy. Fed governors are appointed to 14-year terms, but if the President or Congress don't like their policies, they can't remove them.
Congress could wipe out the Fed and change the rules. But to do that would obviously be a massive political step.
I believe we can create a separate institution with the same features as the Fed.
Mr. Greenspan raises the fear that investment decisions and share voting would be controlled in detail by the House and the Senate. That, it seems to me, is not a likely outcome.
 
Q. Aside from creating an independent institution, what else would you do to try and depoliticize the investing process?
 
A. I would add two other features. First, restrict stock investments to broad index funds, ones that cover a wide swath of the economy.
Second, the actual investments themselves would be done by private managers, who would commingle funds for Social Security with those from private investors.
There is very little point in considering anything but index funds, which are going to do about as well as other funds and make more sense from an economic point of view. And if you move away from them, politics starts to enter into the equation.
Q. There are all sorts of index funds. What kinds would you favor?
A. I don't think one should consider an index fund any narrower than the Standard & Poor's 500. One could actually mix a little bit, from the S.& P. out to the Russell 3000.
 
Q. Why are you indisposed to the idea of individual accounts?
 
A. There are four reasons why I think using individual accounts as a substitute for Social Security is a nonstarter.
First, high administrative costs, which eat into returns. Risk is Point No. 2. With a defined benefit program, ups and downs get smoothed out. For individuals, market moves are much more pronounced.
The third point, one that has been raised by people like Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is that a system of individual accounts would require a massive education effort, which is expensive. And the potential for fraud in that sort of a system is massive. Point 4 is that over time people are going to be living longer. Individual accounts cut benefits. When you hit the retirement age, you look at what you can tap. The longer you live, the less you get out of any fixed sum.
 
Q. You have been studying the issues surrounding Social Security for a quarter of a century. Have other countries decided to invest public retirement money in stocks?
 
A. Canada has started to implement a diversified portfolio, which I think is a good idea. The Norwegians invest some of their oil revenues abroad through the central bank. But most European countries have much worse problems with their systems than we do. They are not running budget surpluses, so they are not raising the issue.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Trial's War of Economists Pits Student Against Teacher

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
FOR the last few weeks the Microsoft antitrust trial has heard warring economists provide sweeping overviews of each side's case. These two particular economists have a history.
The Government's witness, Franklin M. Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the thesis adviser of the chief Microsoft economics witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, also of M.I.T. Perhaps that is why Mr. Schmalensee appears to take impish delight in poking fun at his mentor. 
 Mr. Fisher challenges Microsoft's decision to imbed its browser -- the software that connects computers to the Internet -- into its Windows operating system, which has a more than 90 percent share of the market. His case, Mr. Schmalensee says, boils down to arguing that "consumers will be made better off if they are deprived, by court order, of Web-browsing functionality that Microsoft wishes to provide at zero marginal cost and that consumers are free to ignore or replace." Put that way, the Government's case does sound vapid.
Not so, counters Mr. Fisher. He traces the steps by which Microsoft crossed the line between fierce competition and illegality. Microsoft, he argues, has attempted to use its Windows monopoly to seize control of the market for browsers. The threat is not merely that Microsoft will wrest the browser market away from the current leader, Netscape Communications. Worse, he says, Microsoft might well use browser domination to eliminate competition in operating systems.
The latest browsers have the potential to replace the operating system as the platform from which computers run word processors and other applications programs. With a browser like Netscape's that can work with many operating systems, a user might eventually be able to do without Windows. Microsoft perceived the threat and, Mr. Fisher argues, pounced.
First, it bundled its browser with Windows without charge and forced computer makers to sign contracts prohibiting them from substituting Netscape's browser for Microsoft's. These contracts cut Netscape off from one large channel of distribution.
Next, Microsoft wrote contracts with Internet companies like America Online, putting short cuts to their Web sites in a prominent spot on Windows computers in exchange for the companies' tilting their customers toward Microsoft's browser. These contracts cut Netscape off from another distribution channel.
Mr. Fisher's point is that these contracts did not benefit consumers, though they did hurt Netscape. He challenges Microsoft's decision to give away its browser, labeling the zero price "predatory" -- set to lose money in the short run just to drive a competitor out of business. So what appears to be a wondrous gift to consumers is in fact a manipulative ploy to protect Window's monopoly position.
The antitrust laws permit Microsoft to prosper by selling superior products. They do not allow a monopolist like Microsoft, Mr. Fisher argues, to use expensive tactics that serve only to impose costs on potential rivals. With Microsoft behaving that way, it is hard for entrepreneurs who want to develop a rival product to find financial backing. So by crushing competition, Microsoft crushes innovation -- a dire threat to consumers.
It would be a compelling argument, except for one inconvenient fact. When asked during cross-examination whether Microsoft's tactics had harmed consumers, Mr. Fisher said, "On balance, I'd think that the answer is no up to this point." This was not, however, a devastating admission, since. under the antitrust laws, the Government doesn't have to prove that consumers have been harmed, only that Microsoft's tactics pose a substantial threat of harm.
MR. SCHMALENSEE labels his former teacher's ruminations about consumer harm "sheer speculation." Microsoft keeps the price of Windows low and steadily improves the product, he says, and its contracts have not shut Netscape off from potential customers. In fact, the number of users of Netscape's browser increased by about 20 million from early 1996 to last fall.
Mr. Schmalensee stingingly accuses his teacher of elementary error. Microsoft's zero price for the browser cannot be labeled predatory, he argues, because even at a zero price, the browser makes money by bolstering sales of Windows and other products.
Yet Mr. Schmalensee's testimony falls flat in key places, too. He breathlessly asserts that bundling the browser with Windows helps consumers. But Mr. Fisher's complaint is less with the bundling than with the no-substitution contracts and the fact that Microsoft made the technical task of replacing its browser with Netscape's needlessly difficult. Mr. Schmalensee says that Netscape enjoys ample distribution channels, but Mr. Fisher's point is that Microsoft's contracts deny Netscape the most lucrative ones.
So who wins this battle of wits? Mr. Fisher has made a compelling case that Microsoft's tactics are illegally anticompetitive. Mr. Schmalensee has made the case that the threat of harm is speculative. That may leave the court to rule cautiously in favor of the Government, but to tread even more cautiously when it designs remedies.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Phillip N. Davidson;
American Century Value

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

 BODY:
WHAT is a nice mid-cap value fund like this doing in an aggressive growth family like American Century?
American Century Value, managed by Phillip N. Davidson since its inception, was started in 1993 in an effort to "round out" the family of funds of the Kansas City, Mo., company, he said. "They had been incredibly successful, and just wanted to diversify their offerings to their shareholders and in the 401(k) market," Mr. Davidson added. 
 Sticking to his mandate, Mr. Davidson has followed a strict value discipline that is sharply divergent from the more aggressive style of American Century's better-known growth funds. Unfortunately, the bull market has been far more generous to large-capitalization growth stocks than to the mid-cap value category. In 1998, American Century Value returned just 5.0 percent, compared with 26.67 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large-cap stocks.
Still, Mr. Davidson can take consolation in average three-year annualized returns of 24.8 percent through Jan. 15, well above the median 22.9 percent for the mid-cap value category. And he thinks that funds like his will soon bounce back.
Mr. Davidson, 43, his co-manager, R. Todd Vingers, and his three senior analysts use computer screening to look at all American stocks with market capitalizations above $1 billion. The screens rank stock prices in relation to earnings, book value, dividend yield, cash flow and debt-adjusted cash flow. ("The more debt a company has, the more operating cash flow it has to have to be as attractive," he said.)
To qualify for consideration by the fund, he said, a company must be in the cheapest one-third of the market on at least two of the five screens. Generally, 250 or 300 stocks qualify, and most are in the mid-cap category, which he defines as a market value of $1 billion to $6 billion.
"Then you go through and start doing individual company analysis," Mr. Davidson said. He looks for companies that are leaders in their industries but that are temporarily out of favor because of, say, a temporary dip in earnings.
The fund, with total assets of $2.17 billion, usually holds 65 to 70 stocks, about 60 percent of them mid-caps. Generally, once a stock's price rises to the point that it no longer meets two of the five value criteria, Mr. Davidson sells.
A case in point is J. C. Penney. Mr. Davidson bought the stock in the spring of 1997 at about $45, then sold it last year as the price approached $70. Penney climbed close to $80 last June before it started dropping, the victim of weak sales.
Penney "didn't fall back into our own valuation screens until the low $50's" in the third quarter, Mr. Davidson said, when the fund started buying it again. The shares closed Friday at $39.875. "The primary play here is that they have the traditional department store -- it's basically no growth, but a nice cash cow -- and then they got the Eckerd drugstores acquisition" in 1997, which should bolster company earnings, he said.
Not all stocks in Mr. Davidson's fund turn over as quickly as Penney. Take the Mercantile Bancorporation, which it has owned since 1994 and is now the fund's biggest holding, at 4.9 percent of the portfolio. Mercantile is the dominant bank in the St. Louis market and No. 2 in Kansas City. It has built up its market share with acquisitions.
When Mr. Davidson started buying the stock in 1994, at $20 a share, "it was a cheap stock with a good retail deposit base," he said. "And basically, what happened is all that stuff just got better when they made these acquisitions." But the acquisitions slowed earnings growth.
As Mercantile's shares slid below $40 last summer, pulling down American Century Value's returns, Mr. Davidson bought more. The stock closed Friday at $44.8125, still down from a high near $60 early last year. The acquisitions will ultimately benefit the bank, he said.
NOTHER company whose acquisition shows promise, Mr. Davidson said, is Tyson Foods, the poultry company based in Springdale, Ark. Since completing the purchase of the rival Hudson Foods last January, Tyson controls about 30 percent of the domestic chicken market, he said.
Tyson stock rose with the acquisition, then came down as weakness in foreign economies undermined exports and higher grain prices pushed up costs. Mr. Davidson said he started buying the stock early in 1998 at $18 and $19 a share. The price fluctuated during the year, and he increased his position during the summer's general selloff. Tyson closed Friday at $20.50. Mr. Davidson expects it to rise considerably more than the stock market this year.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
U.S.A. Accounts Are New Volley in Retirement Savings Debate

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
IN his State of the Union address and, again, before a roaring crowd in Buffalo, President Clinton last week floated the idea of Universal Savings Accounts, a new type of subsidized savings for low- and moderate-income workers akin to a 401(k) plan. The Government would use 11 percent of the projected budget surplus to match money the workers would save on their own in the U.S.A.'s.
At first blush, the plan appears designed to appeal to both political parties. It is intended to help workers at the low end of the spectrum who now have only Social Security at retirement. That should appeal to Democrats. For Republicans, there is the draw that these accounts would be controlled by individuals, not the Government. 
 Whether the President's plan will get bipartisan support, or any support at all, is unknown. Right now, the U.S.A. proposal is high in concept and low in details, and the Administration says it will not have more specifics for at least a month. In general, though, both liberal and conservative economists say they find such accounts an intriguing way to increase the savings rate. They also say the proposal is another volley in a larger debate about investing Government retirement funds in the market.
Still, basic questions remain. Is this the best way to spend part of the budget surplus? How would the matching formula work? What can the savings accounts be used for? How may the money be invested? And will the public support a new Government program that redistributes wealth to lower-income citizens?
"These accounts are still a very nebulous concept," said Steve Moore, director of fiscal policies at the Cato Institute, a free-market research group in Washington. "I like the idea of setting up savings accounts. We want to create a culture of savings in this country. But it's bad in the way it's done. It looks more like a new entitlement program than an I.R.A. I don't see the rationale of creating a new income distribution program."
THE Administration envisions the program, which would cost nearly $500 billion over 15 years, or $33 billion a year, as offering $100 grants to workers to start accounts. The Government would then match workers' contributions at a variable rate based on income. About 100 million Americans who earn less than $80,000 to $100,000 a year -- the precise cutoff has not been set -- would be eligible for the accounts.
"The basic idea is to get more people to do more saving on their own," said an Administration spokesman. "There are so many things to help the rich save. We think there is a big hole in savings at the low end."
Currently, 41 percent of all workers earn less than $15,000 a year; of those, only 8 percent have a retirement program at their workplaces, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a Washington research group.
The match rate for the new accounts would be progressive, with the lowest-paid getting the most. The investment options would be modeled closely after the Federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan, which offers three Government-run investment funds -- a stock index fund, a bond index fund and a Treasury bill fund.
For example, the Administration said a worker earning $40,000 a year could deposit up to $600 a year. At that income level the Government would match 50 cents on the dollar, providing $300 more to the account. Counting the $100 starting grant, that comes to $1,000 in the first year, $400 of it from the Government.
Bruce Thompson, a Washington representative for Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest broker, praised the plan as "opening the door to private investments."
Still, Merrill and other Wall Street firms would prefer that the Government use a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to finance the accounts, rather than using the budget surplus, and would like the program to be open to workers of all income levels. Mr. Thompson said he was concerned about how the accounts would be financed when the budget surplus ends.
"We would rather see all people given the option of investing a portion of their payroll taxes, maybe one or two percentage points, in accounts that would be similar to I.R.A.'s, and invest that money however they see fit," Mr. Thompson said. This idea is similar to one proposed by some Republicans as an alternative to President Clinton's plan to strengthen Social Security by allowing the Government to invest in stocks.
OTHER sellers of investments had little to say, for the moment. "We don't have enough information to judge yet," said John Collins, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for the mutual fund industry. In general, brokers and mutual fund companies want the opportunity to sell investment products to U.S.A.'s, but worry that a program restricted to lower-income people would result in many small accounts with low balances, which are costly for brokers to administer.
Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, wants to see the funds less restricted in another way: what savings can be used for. "Done right, U.S.A. accounts are a very good idea," Mr. Aaron said, but the money should be available for more than just retirement -- education, medical care, down payments on first homes and and business start-ups, for example.
"This could be a device to help make savings fashionable and educate people on the power of compound interest," he said, adding that U.S.A.'s are much "sweeter" for lower-income people than are individual retirement accounts, which offer only a tax deduction.
Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, also reacted favorably to the plan, though with reservations. "I'm not sure what these accounts offer that isn't already out there in the market," Mr. Mitchell said. "I like that Clinton recognizes that private investment is the key. But it will not succeed unless we put a chunk of the payroll taxes into it, because the poor will not be able to build up a good balance. They cannot use disposable income for this because they don't have enough."

HEADLINE: Make Way For Grown-Ups

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
HEY, gang! Guess what kind of adult entertainment is hot -- and legal -- in New York these days. Give up? It's puppetry. Gaining more respect as an art form, puppetry seems to promise wider audiences, higher esteem and perhaps bigger money for a tight-knit group of city artists.
New productions and new marketing strategies are bringing in the grown-ups. "There are people, who, if you say 'Punch and Judy' they'll run, but if you say 'experimental theater,' they'll flock to it," said Peter Lewis, the coordinator of the Lenny Suib Puppet Playhouse at Asphalt Green, a private recreational center on the Upper East Side. 
 The buzz nowadays is about African masks and Indonesian influences rather than marionettes and hand puppets. Audiences sip wine instead of apple juice at intermission, and nobody fights for seats on the rug. After Disney's hit Broadway production of "The Lion King," whose puppets by the director Julie Taymor captivated critics and audiences, and the sellout success of four international puppet theater festivals in New York since 1992, puppet artists are sounding wired.
"There is a truly fascinating explosion of imagination in the field," said Theodora Skipitares, a Manhattan artist whose avant-garde puppet work, "Body of Crime II," a history of women's imprisonment, will be presented by La Mama Experimental Theater Club in the East Village this spring. Ms. Skipitares, a sculptor who began to work with puppets in the early 1980's, is one of many visual artists who have leaped onto the puppet stage.
From Broadway to the tiny theaters that showcase avant-garde productions, more puppets seem to be popping up. A Broadway show scheduled to open in March, "Band in Berlin," about a singing group that was persecuted by the Nazis, will include shadow puppets by Stephen Kaplin, an artist from Jackson Heights, Queens, who has worked with Ms. Taymor. A production of "Peter and Wendy" by the New York theater group Mabou Mines uses actors and puppets and explores the darker side of James Barrie's novelization of his play "Peter Pan," according to the playwright who adapted it, Liza Lorwin. The show is going to the Berkeley Repertory Theater in California. Meanwhile, members of the Crowtations, a group that has drawn crowds in Central Park for years with its crow puppets, say backers have expressed interest in an Off Broadway show they are developing.
Many people in the puppetry world link the boom to the rising fortunes of Ms. Taymor, a former member of downtown's avant-garde puppet scene who has won a Tony award and a MacArthur fellowship, which is given to people of exceptional creativity. They also credit the Jim Henson Foundation, which gives grants to puppet artists and, more importantly, has helped find new audiences for the form by using savvy marketing to present international festivals. The key, said Leslee Asch, executive director of the foundation and producing director of the International Festival of Puppet Theater, was freeing puppets of the "stigma" of "bad kids' shows."
Puppetry also has an economic appeal for nonprofit theaters with limited budgets and for artists trying to break into theater. "Puppetry allows you to enact an entire war on a tiny stage," said Ms. Skipitares, a miniaturist who has used 300 puppets in a single show. "You can do it in your room, and the sky's the limit."
Far from feeling slighted by the new emphasis on adult audiences, the traditional puppeteers -- those who work with marionettes and hand puppets -- expect to catch the wave. "It's bound to trickle down to us," said Nick Coppola, who runs a marionette theater for children in Park Slope called Puppetworks. Membership in the Puppetry Guild of Greater New York, most of whose members are traditional professionals and amateurs, is now 120, a high mark in the last two decades, said Steven Widerman, a member and past president.
Yet with all the excitement over how "The Lion King" has brought puppet art into the mainstream, the question is whether puppetry will remain there or return to the fringe. Can this form of theater, much of it created by artists without training in drama, continue to attract money and audiences? Will the avant-garde practitioners of puppetry continue to coexist peacefully with the traditional children's entertainers? Experimental and traditional puppeteers often provide work for one another. But puppetry has elevated itself largely by shoving the kids' stuff into the closet.
The war room where the fight for adult minds is planned is Ms. Asch's office at the Jim Henson Company, on East 69th Street in Manhattan. The foundation was begun 17 years ago by Mr. Henson, the creator of the Muppets, who died in 1990. Mr. Henson "didn't want people to be forced into the mold of doing work like his," Ms. Asch said. "He wanted people to find their own voices." These days, Ms. Asch is busy planning next year's festival. Many offerings are "dark and serious" works, she said, as she offered a visitor coffee in a Kermit mug. Even the lighter fare, she added, is both "playful and empowering."
The festival has sold out every event since it began, expanding from the Public Theater, its sole venue in 1992, to 12 others for last September's 28 productions, Ms. Asch said. The Henson foundation raised $1.8 million for last year's festival, which drew an audience of 28,000, she said; it raised $1 million for the first one, which attracted 13,000 theatergoers.
About half the festival's productions are American, Ms. Asch said, with New York artists "in the forefront." And, she said, theatergoers are realizing that 80 percent of the shows are aimed at adults. (To make sure they understand that, festival brochures offer the equivalent of parental advisories.)
Does the ubiquitous presence of puppetry for children make it more difficult to attract adult audiences for puppet theater? No, Ms. Asch said. A former puppet designer and builder for "Sesame Street" and "The Muppet Show," she said, "I don't think that just people who work with adults are artists, and those who work with children are not."
Nevertheless, in the past, she said, "if you said you were a puppeteer, people would do this." She formed her hand into a jabbering creature and made a high-pitched squeal. Those days seem to be ending, she noted with relief. But if Ms. Asch still harbors concerns about bad traditional puppetry undermining her painstaking work, there are those who worry about the other end of the spectrum.
"I feel the avant-garde people could use a lot more craft," said Jonathan Edward Cross, who is himself part of the avant-garde. His Cosmic Bicycle Theater, which has performed at the Henson festival, combines actors, puppets and masks in original works like "Venus Envy," about goddess worship and lust, as well as classical ones like "The Miser," by Moliere.
Mr. Cross, 30, operates his tiny Clockworks Experimental Puppetry Theater out of a storefront and basement on East 12th Street. He said he has been dismayed by avant-garde shows in which puppet pieces fly off. In one, he recalled, an electrical fire started, then was compounded by an attempt to extinguish it with water. "I feel you should make something solid," he said.
Though he and others involved in puppetry in New York expressed admiration for Peter Schumann, the founder of the Bread and Puppet Theater, which started in New York in the 1960's and later moved to Vermont, Mr. Cross is less impressed by imitators of Mr. Schumann, whose giant puppets, long a favorite on college campuses and at political protests, are often crude cardboard affairs. "I feel the anti-craft movement has gone far enough," he said.
It was partly to perfect his own skills that he worked with Mr. Widerman, a traditionalist whose Puppet Company performs on weekends at Asphalt Green for family audiences, doing shows like "Al E. Gator's Surprise Party." While that seems like a far cry from Mr. Cross's work -- one is "Thanatopsis," which he described as "a meditation on death" -- Mr. Cross said he had much to learn from Mr. Widerman, who can perform virtuoso feats with marionettes, like having one roller-skate.
Another person who straddles the genres is Jim Bowen, 28. By day he works in Brooklyn with Mr. Coppola's marionettes at Puppetworks and sometimes substitutes at Central Park's marionette theater, the Swedish Cottage. By night he often performs his own political hand-puppet show at the 37th Street Theater's open mike evenings or at ABC No Rio, a Lower East Side performance space.
"Some of the avant-garde stuff tends to get really self-indulgent," Mr. Bowen said. "People are giving you a biography of their life, not a narrative. It's like an ego out of control." He added, "There sometimes tends to be a disregard for the audience." Children, he said, would never let a puppeteer get away with that.
But both he and Mr. Cross were enthusiastic about the growing recognition of puppetry as an art form. Mr. Cross, who came to New York to study puppetry with Ralph Lee, the 63-year-old puppeteer who started the Greenwich Village Halloween parade and is still active in the field, said he thought puppet art was "where theater is headed."
New York University's Tisch School of the Arts recently began to offer a course for actors who want to perform with puppets. Initially, students could not see the reason for the course, said John Bell, who teaches it. "People said, 'If I'm going to do Mamet, why do I need this?' he said. But eventually, they realized "that if you're going to work Off Broadway, or even on Broadway, there are puppets all over the place."
Still, for all of the interest in puppetry, few places train artists from other disciplines who want to enter the field. For them, and for established puppet artists who lack studios, the Arts at St. Ann's, in Brooklyn Heights, operates a weekly puppet lab where ideas and power tools are shared.
Other types of artists who have decided to embrace puppetry have a role model in Janie Geiser, who directed the puppet lab until recently, when the California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia, recruited her to teach in its new $600,000 puppetry center. Initially a visual artist, Ms. Geiser became a big name on the New York avant-garde puppet scene, receiving many grants and awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship.
How do painters and illustrators learn theater, in which visuals are only one element and audiences expect drama? Dan Hurlin, who now leads the St. Ann's lab, said some visual artists found themselves stymied by the challenge. "I'm putting them in touch with directors and writers," he said. As for writers who have trouble making puppets, Mr. Hurlin suggested they try manipulating photocopied images. The traditional separation of actors, directors, set designers and technicians in theater doesn't apply to puppetry, at least his kind, he said.
But puppet theater's new directions sometimes require explaining. Ms. Lorwin, the playwright who adapted "Peter and Wendy" for Mabou Mines, said the play puzzled some potential backers. "We went to people who fund the avant-garde, and they didn't understand," she said. But foundations known for financing mainstream shows "instantly recognized it as experimental," she said.
Ms. Lorwin said some producers were put off because some of the puppets in "Peter and Wendy" are only 18 inches tall, so the show cannot be presented in a large theater where many seats can be sold. Yet the production is complex and expensive, she said, with seven puppeteers, a full band "and numerous people backstage."
Limited seating is an even bigger problem for toy theater, a form in which both Ms. Geiser and Mr. Cross work. Toy theater uses dollhouse-size stages and puppets, and can only be viewed in small spaces. It is a 19th-century form that has been promoted by Great Small Works, a Manhattan theater company of which Dr. Bell, the N.Y.U. instructor, is a member.
It's a safe bet that toy theater isn't headed for Broadway. But, Dr. Bell said, that should not be the measure of an art form's success. "I don't think that's the only goal of doing theater," he said, adding that he did not view the New York avant-garde puppet scene as much more active now than it has been for the last 20 years.
The difference, he said, is the mass recognition given to Ms. Taymor and Basil Twist, whose innovative puppet piece "Symphonie Fantastique" is in the ninth month of a critically acclaimed run at Here, a South Village performance space. And the popularity of puppets on Broadway has meant more work for people in the field, Dr. Bell said.
Yet many New York puppet artists still seem to be struggling. Many earn a living by making props, doing educational projects and, yes, entertaining the kiddies. Mr. Cross said much of his company's income has come from puppet festivals abroad. He recently returned from performing in France, as did Ms. Skipitares, the sculptor-turned-puppet-artist. "It's hard to come back to New York," she said, because puppetry is more widely accepted as a serious art form in Europe.
Brad Brewer, who founded the Crowtations puppet ensemble 26 years ago, said his group has performed with jazz musicians in nightclubs in Germany, where its work is considered adult fare. He is hopeful that grown-ups in New York will take the same attitude. Ten years ago, the Crowtations occasionally performed in after-hours clubs in the city, and as Mr. Brewer remembered it, the adults responded just like kids. "If you closed your eyes and listened to them," he said, "you couldn't tell the difference."

Puppeteers famous for children's entertainment have also done more highbrow work aimed at adults. Some examples:
 
Bil Baird -- His marionettes, including Charlemane the Lion, were television regulars in the 1950's and 1960's. But he also directed a 1983 puppet version of Igor Stravinsky's "L'Histoire du Soldat" at the 92d Street Y and created artistically acclaimed full-length works for puppets.
 He and his wife, Cora, founded the Bil Baird theater on Barrow Street in Greenwich Village in 1966. The theater's aim, Baird said in a 1968 letter to a friend, was "to make it a popular thing for adults to attend live puppet theater." But he also expressed concern that inferior work by other puppeteers would undercut such efforts.
 
Marty Robinson -- The performer behind Telly Monster, the anxious Muppet. He also created an hour-long puppet piece, "Jackstraws," under the name Martin P. Robinson, which was presented last week at the National Puppetry Conference in Manhattan.
 
Donald Sahlin -- The builder of Bert and Ernie, the Muppet odd couple of "Sesame Street," he did a series of baroque operas with puppets.
 
Jim Henson -- He created the Muppets, but he also directed an experimental short film, "Timepiece," with actors and objects, that preceded the Oscar-winning 1966 French movie "A Man and a Woman" in cinemas. He worked with noted movie directors on a series of folk tales that included his 1987 short film "The Soldier and Death," and he created puppet works for adults that followed the Huntley-Brinkley news programs on the NBC television network.

A Place To Please The Techies

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. His column on the Main Street economy appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif.

 BODY:
AFTER just three years, the founders of the hot high-technology start-up were bumping against a familiar problem. They knew they had maxed out the potential of the backwater burg where they had founded the company. To keep attracting the number and caliber of skilled employees they needed, they had to move the company to where the action was.
Yes, it was time for Broadcom to forsake sleepy little Los Angeles and make its mark in the high-technology metropolis of Irvine, an hour's drive south. 
 "We were reaching a critical mass; we had to go somewhere that's suited to building a big high-tech company," explained Henry T. Nicholas, who with Henry Samueli started Broadcom, a communications chip and cable modem maker, in 1992 when the two men were professors at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Mr. Nicholas, Broadcom's chief executive, says he misses the city's night life and cultural ambiance. But, recalling how hard it was to recruit people to move to Los Angeles, he felt he had little choice. "It's hard to relocate techies to L.A.," he said. "It's the congestion, expensive housing -- and there's a certain stigma to it."
Irvine, on the other hand, is what you might call a nerdistan: a suburban enclave of subdivisions, shopping centers and business parks where scientists, engineers and technicians feel comfortable living and working. For technology companies, it is everything a traditional urban center should be but isn't: a strategic location where the relevant partners, competitors, money and knowhow are all close at hand.
Most nerdistans have appeared on leafy peripheries of metropolitan areas, close to major airports, universities and science-based industries but far from inner-city problems and annoyances. High concentrations of technology workers and companies have flocked together in suburbs of Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, and in Silicon Valley, the original and still champion nerdistan.
Like Irvine, most nerdistans are less bedroom communities than what the Purdue University historian Jon C. Teaford calls post-suburbia -- economically and culturally self-sufficient areas that ring traditional core cities but are largely insulated from them. This pattern is clear in sprawling Los Angeles County, which leads the nation in the number of high-technology jobs but ranks 15th in technology workers as a share of the work force, according to a study by researchers at WEFA, an economic research organization; neighboring Orange County, where Irvine is, ranks seventh. A map of Los Angeles County's technology companies finds a vast majority in peripheral areas miles from the center of the city.
Similarly, despite media buzz about Silicon Alley, most technology jobs in the New York City area are in the suburbs, not in Manhattan. The periphery's share of the region's computer-related jobs grew to more than 80 percent in 1996 from 68 percent in 1982, according to a study at the University of Miami. Sections of Fairfield County, Conn., and northwestern New Jersey rank among the top 15 places in the country for most technology workers per capita; New York City ranks 80th, according to WEFA.
NERDISTANS can also be defined by what they generally do not have, said John Kasarda of the University of North Carolina. There are no ports or railroad yards, but technology work does not require them. There are no venerable art museums or symphony orchestras, but technology workers generally do not miss such amenities. And there are usually no homeless people or derelict buildings in sight.
"You get rid of the problems of the city by charging for the exits," said Mr. Kasarda, who has studied the movement of high-technology companies in the Raleigh-Durham area and elsewhere. "For these people, the city is superfluous."
Once they get started, nerdistans snowball. Richard Holcomb, president of the Raleigh-based Haht Software, said the presence of a herd of big technology companies like Data General, I.B.M. and Burroughs-Wellcome provides a pool of seasoned workers for start-ups to tap. "You can get a great job, and if this one doesn't work out, you can just go down the road," he said.
Given the technology sector's generally high pay, nerdistans are evolving into centers of wealth, with demographics to match. In Irvine, which is also home to a University of California campus, almost two-fifths of households earn more than $75,000 a year, and more than half the adult population is college-educated, compared with one-fifth for the country as a whole. Not quite as "white bread" as its reputation, Irvine has a population of 122,000 that is 70 percent Caucasian and 22 percent Asian.
Not all nerdistans are alike, though. Older, unplanned centers like Silicon Valley and southwestern Connecticut are becoming victims of their own success, plagued by congestion, housing shortages and struggling public schools. Newer planned communities like Irvine and the Research Triangle seem to be coping better, Mr. Kasarda said. And that translates into a competitive advantage in recruiting scientists and engineers, especially those with children.
"It's a very planned place," said Nancy Venable, a technology support engineer and divorced mother of a teen-age girl who moved last year from Charlotte, N.C., to take a job at Wonderware, a factory automation company based in Irvine. "You don't have to join an association to get to a pool, and everything has been placed close to where you live. The schools are good. It's safe, it's clean, it's easy to get around, and it's new. Engineers love new tools."

A Delicate Family Affair

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BABY boomers seem to be focused on three economic issues: their homes, their retirements and their children's college educations. But a fourth potential drain on their resources tends to sneak up on them: their parents.
The parents of the baby boom generation are getting older, and may not be prepared for the financial strains of declining health. Last month, President Clinton proposed a $1,000-a-year tax credit for the chronically ill and, in some cases, for relatives who care for them, but that would hardly dent most such health care bills. 
 "Our generation doesn't have a clue to what caring for a parent is all about," said Virginia Morris, author of "How to Care for Aging Parents" (Workman Publishing, 1996). "I think in the next 10 years we're all going to get a shock. Not only are people living longer now, but living longer with disabilities."
How do you know if your parents have adequate insurance and savings to handle a medical crisis? And how do you ask? My parents are in their mid-70's and very independent. How much should I pry? And should a "That's none of your business" be allowed to end the discussion? True, it is none of my business right now, but it may become my business if, say, my father has a stroke and my mother is overwhelmed by the demands of caring for him. In that case, I wouldn't hesitate to open my wallet, even at the expense of my four children.
But I would like to avoid having to make such a choice. My parents tell me they're fine, and I don't doubt their sincerity. But do I know how much they have in reserve or how extensively they have planned? No, and I have never asked. For many families, it's the same: "Don't ask, don't tell."
Michael P. Mayko, 44, of Milford, Conn., never asked. His parents are in their 80's, and when his father developed Alzheimer's disease, Mr. Mayko helped his mother care for him. Then his mother had a heart attack, and overnight he became responsible for the care of both parents. Today, he spends some mornings before work and much of his time on weekends at their house a few towns away. And while his parents can still cover most of their health care costs, Mr. Mayko knows their funds are limited.
"I saw it coming, but I tried to keep it out of my mind," Mr. Mayko said. "They had no wills and made no arrangements for long-term care. Now, I'm making decisions on their lives that I'm not comfortable making."
For Angela Scott, 46, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., it wasn't so sudden. One day her mother turned to her and said, "I think I'm getting Alzheimer's disease." She was right. Her mother moved in with her, but now requires constant care. While their mother had some savings and insurance, Ms. Scott and her two siblings are still stuck with bills totaling tens of thousands of dollars a year.
"We realize we can't afford to keep her at home much longer, so we will have to place her in a nursing home," Ms. Scott said. "Financially, there isn't a choice. I'm dreading that day."
Ms. Morris, the author, says she doesn't think people realize how expensive care can be. "Average nursing home care is $40,000 a year, but you can easily spend $80,000," she said. She added that children need to discuss finances with their parents early, before they become ill, vulnerable and frightened. The best way to begin the conversation, she said, is to simply ask them about their goals.
"Ask them what are their concerns, what are their worries," Ms. Morris said. "The big issue is where are they going to live if they need long-term care. It lets them take the conversation where they feel safe. You'll have to bring it up a couple of times. You're not going to sit down in one conversation and sort this out."
SOME sensitive topics to address, she said, are whether the parents have or should buy long-term care insurance; who should have power of attorney over their affairs, if that becomes necessary; whether they have made a "living will" naming someone to make medical decisions for them when they are unable; what estate planning they have done, and what Medicare and Medicaid benefits they can expect.
Parents might refuse to discuss any of this with their children, or may be willing to talk with one child but not another. For those who prefer to talk with an outsider, suggest that they consult with a financial planner or a lawyer specializing in elder law. The Institute of Certified Financial Planners (800 282-7526 or www.icfp.org) will provide you with a free list of certified planners in your area. The National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (520 881-4005 or www.naela.org) sells directories for $15 that list its members by region.
"Soon, our parents are going to be the dinner-table conversation," Ms. Morris said. "When we say 'day care,' we won't be talking about our children, we'll be talking about our parents."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
As Rivals Flail, Teardrop Golf Yells Fore and Makes More Deals

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
AS the depth of an industrywide slump the best time to go on an acquisition spree?
Teardrop Golf thinks so. The club maker, which is known mainly for its Teardrop putter, has been busily rolling up small golf businesses while bigger competitors like Callaway Golf and Adams Golf have been bleeding money. 
In its two years as a public company, Teardrop has acquired two well-known but ailing manufacturers, Tommy Armour Golf and RAM Golf, as well as a golf tour for aspiring PGA Tour players that now bears the Teardrop name. And it is still on the prowl. It lost out to Golfsmith International in the bidding for the assets of Lynx Golf, a bankrupt Canadian company, when the price topped $9 million. But in the process, Teardrop picked up Lynx's endorsement contract with Fred Couples, the marquee player who is now Teardrop's top spokesman.
Companies usually do not buy in slumps, in part because acquisition binges are hard to finance in tough times. Teardrop remains a small company, with estimated 1998 sales of $65 million. Its market capitalization of $27 million isn't big enough to be on the radar of major Wall Street analysts or institutional investors. Teardrop is expected to post a modest net income of $2.2 million for 1998 after a loss in 1997, and its margins suffered lately as it slashed prices on some models to clear away backlogged inventory. As a result, Teardrop's ability to finance acquisitions from its own resources is limited.
Nor is paying with common stock, the currency of choice in technology deals, so easy for Teardrop. Its stock price is stuck in a sand trap, closing on Friday at $5.25, far off its peak of $14.0625 a share last May, and the market has been unkind to both small-caps and golf stocks for months. Teardrop has included stock in several deals but has yet to make an all-stock acquisition.
That leaves borrowing, and Teardrop has loaded up on debt. At the end of the third quarter of 1998, it carried $21.265 million of debt on its balance sheet, equivalent to 34 percent of current assets and more than 127 percent of shareholders' equity -- a level of leverage that leaves Teardrop vulnerable if things do not go as smoothly as planned.
Moreover, the cash demands don't end when the ink is dry on an acquisition. Teardrop is also spending heavily on advertising and marketing to "reinvigorate the companies and recreate the ambiance that these companies are here to stay," said Rudy A. Slucker, chief executive of Teardrop, which has corporate headquarters in Morton Grove, Ill., and executive offices in Union, N.J.
Mr. Slucker says Teardrop's stock has been depressed by "the Callaway syndrome," referring to the problems of Callaway Golf, the behemoth of the $2.5 billion golf equipment industry. As industrywide club sales slid 10 percent to 20 percent last year, Callaway dismissed its chief executive, laid off 700 employees -- a quarter of its work force -- and closed several noncore ventures. Investors reacted by bidding down most golf stocks.
But Teardrop thinks it can sidestep Callaway's problems. In 1999, "we'll either lose a little or make a little," Mr. Slucker said.
"Even if the industry has a terrible year, we believe we'll have a fair year," he added.
Analysts are not so sure.
"It's debatable whether they will escape the inventory bubble in the industry," said Shawn Milne, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco. Mr. Milne expects golf club sales to grow about 5 percent in 1999 from a weak 1998 and sees a risk of swollen inventory if an expected flood of new products does not entice golfers to buy more. Beth Burnson, an analyst at ABN Amro, said that in a climate of price-cutting, golfers who favor premium brands are unlikely to switch to Teardrop's lines.
Specialty retailers say the company's products are not flying out the door. For instance, sales of Teardrop putters and Armour clubs have been mediocre at the Edwin Watts Golf Shops chain, a retailer based in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., with 46 stores, mainly in the the South, said Edwin Watts, a co-owner of the chain; delivery delays for Armour clubs have not helped.
Still, Mr. Slucker is optimistic about the prospects for his company, even in Asia, where Teardrop expects to begin selling this year despite the region's economic troubles. The reason? The roll-up strategy is beginning to bear fruit, by giving Teardrop a range of brands that can pursue complementary market strategies.
For example, Mr. Slucker has repositioned RAM as a low-priced line to sell in sporting goods chains, discounters and warehouse clubs, where competition is less fierce than in specialty shops. "They can effectively address the mass market and the green-grass market without cannibalizing themselves," said Gar Jackson, executive vice president at Par Valu, a newsletter in Carlsbad, Calif., that tracks golf stocks.
But in a business littered with high-flying small companies flattened by industry selloffs, even Mr. Slucker is hedging his bets.
"I think there may be an opportunity in 1999 for a company that's aggressive and smart and growing," he said. "I'll put my hat in the ring for that one. I'm not saying we can do it, but we'll try."

When the Government Plays Investor

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
BY investing $700 billion of the Social Security trust fund's reserves in the stock market, President Clinton hopes to generate enough high-voltage returns to keep the fund solvent into the next century. Alas, the way he wants to do it almost insures failure.
There is no doubt the fund needs some zip. It is now invested in United States Government securities -- the safest investment, but not the highest yielding. During the 1980's, annual returns averaged 4.8 percent. 
 Mr. Clinton's plan bogs down when it hands over investment decisions to the Government rather than to individuals. History shows that public investors do not behave as profitably as private investors do.
A World Bank study of government-managed retirement plans found that during the 1980's, they generally underperformed privately managed plans. Annual losses ranged from 37.4 percent in Peru's fund to 3.8 percent in Kenya's. Publicly managed funds that eked out gains included Singapore's and Malaysia's, with 3 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.
Meanwhile, private pension funds in the United States scored average annual returns of 8 percent; Chile's were the top performers, at 9.2 percent.
Underperformance is also typical among state and local pension funds in the United States. A study by Olivia Mitchell, a professor of insurance and risk management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and Ping-Lung Hsin of Cornell University found that from 1984 to 1990, while bonds returned an average of 15.5 percent and stocks returned 13.9 percent, the average state or local pension plan gained 11.1 percent.
What explains the lag? The World Bank identified two culprits. One is the tendency to invest too conservatively. The other is the tendency to invest too politically.
Unlike private funds, public portfolio managers can invest in socially desirable projects that may not meet the economic criteria a private investor would demand. An example? Funding a local company, as Connecticut's state employee pension plan did in 1990, when it invested $25 million in the troubled Colt Firearms to keep 925 local jobs from being lost.
But politically charged investments are very often losers. In a study published last fall, John R. Nofsinger, a professor of finance at Marquette University in Milwaukee, compared the returns of funds that held such investments and funds that did not. During three years in the early 1990's, the funds that included politically minded investments underperformed their benchmarks by 2.1 percent on average. Those that did not came out ahead by a hair.
Supporters of the President's plan say an independent board can keep politics out of the Government's investment decisions. Dream on, says Maureen M. Baronian, a stockbroker in West Hartford, Conn., and a former state representative. She sat on the advisory board overseeing Connecticut's investments when it bought into Colt. Ms. Baronian and three other board members voted against the investment, but politics triumphed. "Political considerations are always there," she said. "They may tell you they aren't, but they have to be."
Ms. Baronian was right to object. Colt filed for bankruptcy in 1992, and Connecticut's employees lost their investment.

HEADLINE: The World;
A New Big-Power Race Starts on a Sea of Crude

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: ISTANBUL

 BODY:
WITH the discovery of great energy reserves in countries around the Caspian Sea, a vast new region has catapulted onto the world stage. It not only offers oil companies the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a place to test their strength.
The United States is waging a strong campaign to win decisive influence in the Caspian. So are Russia, Iran and other powers in the region. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the world's newest stage for big-power politics. 
 "We are at the beginning of what will be a massive oil boom," said Stanley T. Escudero, the United States ambassador to Azerbaijan. "It means that Azerbaijan and this whole region are about to emerge as major players in the world energy game, and also as a vitally important area for the whole world."
Officially the United States supports cooperation in the Caspian, saying it wants every country except Iran to prosper. Some American diplomats in the region, however, sense that they are involved in a modern version of the 19th-century Great Game, in which Britain and Russia competed for dominance there.
"This is where we prove we're still the big boy on the block," said one diplomat. "China, Europe, Iran, Russia and all the others want to see if they can take us down. All of our so-called friends and all of our so-called enemies want control of this region."
Today's game is being played out in an intense competition for oil and gas pipeline routes. The nations that win will be able to help shape events in the region for decades to come.
The Clinton Administration is lobbying intensely for an oil pipeline route from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean. This would tie Azerbaijan and Georgia to the West and be a boon to Turkey, a key NATO ally. American officials are applying every form of encouragement and pressure they can muster to persuade oil companies to choose it.
The companies are skeptical. They say the American-backed line is far too expensive to build without a subsidy of $1 billion or more. By their calculations, a line across Georgia to the Black Sea would cost less than half as much.
Since oil companies will pay for whatever pipeline is built, they are in the catbird seat, and governments in the Caspian area are fervently wooing them. "In a reversal of history," said Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, "the industry today is showing its potential to drive geopolitical events, rather than be driven by them."
In Washington, meanwhile, some members of Congress warn that the United States must be wary of anti-American forces in the Caspian. They want the Clinton Administration to work with the American oil companies to establish a stronger United States presence.
These legislators support bills like the Silk Road Strategy Act proposed by Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas; it would finance programs in the region ranging from support for independent newspapers to "transfer of excess defense articles."
Critics counter that the United States should not help Caspian countries as long as they reject democracy, especially if a hidden agenda is to smooth the way for big business. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, has suggested that the Silk Road Act be renamed "the oil and gas interests bill."
 
Russia's Back Yard
Russian leaders are highly suspicious of American ambitions in the Caspian, which they view as a naked power grab. Russia has controlled the region for more than a century and is angry at what it sees as an aggressive American campaign to wrest it away.
"We cannot help seeing the uproar stirred up in some Western countries over the energy resources of the Caspian," President Boris N. Yeltsin told a newspaper interviewer last year. "Some seek to exclude Russia from the game and undermine its interests. The so-called 'pipeline war' in the region is part of this game."
Small amounts of Caspian oil are now being shipped through a Soviet-era pipeline that runs north from Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, to the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea. Russia proposes that the main export pipeline be built along this route, rather than across Turkey as the United States wants.
A pipeline across Russia would help keep Caspian nations under Moscow's thumb. But leaders of new nations in the region are determined to break free of Russian influence. To do that, they must have an export route that Russia does not control. "I want to be the head of my family," reasoned Ahmed Zeynalov, an Azerbaijani oil executive. "Would you put your neighbor in the position of being able to control your family?"
In addition to this political problem, there are practical ones. The Russian route runs through Chechnya, hardly known for its stability. And even if Caspian oil can be brought across Russia to the Black Sea, no one is certain how it would be sent on from there.
Turkey, suddenly discovering its environmental conscience, says it cannot bear more tanker traffic through the already crowded Bosporus to the Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkish officials say, the only solution is to build a pipeline across their country. But Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine are offering an alternative: send the oil across the Black Sea to our ports and from there to Western Europe. This option gives oil companies another card to play when they ask Turkey for billion-dollar subsidies.
 
The Lure of Iran
In their hearts, many American oil executives believe the best export route for Caspian oil is through Iran. They cannot choose that route now because sanctions imposed by Congress forbid large investments in Iran. But they refuse to write off the idea, preferring to stall in the hope that the sanctions will collapse.
"Sanctions are a drag on our business position," said Cecil Davidson, operations manager in Turkmenistan for Halliburton International Inc., a supplier of oil and gas equipment. "The competition gains strength because of it. They can operate in Iran and we can't."
Lobbyists for American energy companies are pressing for an end to the sanctions, and some prominent figures in the foreign policy establishment support them. In a speech this month, former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance urged new overtures to Iran. Graham E. Fuller, a Rand Corporation analyst and former C.I.A. official, recently called for "a process of reconciliation" based on "a remarkable number of common interests," including Caspian energy.
Iranian officials have begun courting Western oil and gas companies. "The route through Iran is the most economical, and the companies know this," said Alireza Bikdeli, Iran's Ambassador in Azerbaijan. "They know this region very well, perhaps better than the U.S. Government."
Caspian nations do not share the United States' desire to isolate Iran. They must live as Iran's neighbors, and would rather cooperate than feud. "We'll take into consideration that the United States opposes routes through Iran," said Recepbay Arazov, the oil and gas minister in Turkmenistan, "but we're not scared off."
Oil executives looking for a way to bring their crude out of Azerbaijan have only three or four main alternatives. But huge amounts of oil and gas will also be coming from two countries on the eastern shore of the Caspian, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Competition there involves a much wider group of players.
Turkmenistan has huge reserves of natural gas, but its only export pipeline runs through Russia. Because Russia is itself a gas producer, it refuses to accept competing gas at fair prices. After a bitter argument in 1997, Turkmenistan turned off its spigot.
Now Turkmenistan has gone more than a year without earning a cent from its gas reserves, and it has nothing else to sell. The Government is living on bank loans, mostly from Germany. So President Saparmurat Niyazov is negotiating with Royal/Dutch Shell to build a $4 billion pipeline across Iran to gas-starved Turkey.
"This guy can't wait," said Omer Ertur, the chief United Nations representative in Turkmenistan. "He's in a financial crisis. He's up to his neck in debt and he's paying for a series of colossal projects. If there's no pipeline, there's going to be instability here."
The largest of the new Caspian nations, Kazakhstan, is also hoping to escape from Russia's shadow. Kazakh leaders have approved the construction of an oil pipeline across Russia to the Black Sea, but they also want a non-Russian option. They are pushing for a line under the Caspian to Azerbaijan, from which their oil could be shipped westward to Georgia and beyond.
"Of course Russia will not agree with this project, and will try to block it," said Ermukahmet Ertsybaev, director of the Kazakhstan Institute of Strategic Studies. "It would have a huge political impact. We have been isolated from the world system, and this would be our link to Europe. It would make our independence real, and also the independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia."
Both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also pursuing the idea of building pipelines eastward to China. These lines would be long and expensive, but Chinese leaders remain intrigued by them. They know that a pipeline would pull Central Asia into their sphere of influence, and guarantee energy sources for continued expansion of their economy.
 
Arms Bolster the Claims
Some of the outside powers seeking influence in the Caspian region are using armies to strengthen their positions. Russia maintains bases in Georgia and Armenia. The United States has established a much smaller but nonetheless palpable military presence.
The United States Army has held maneuvers in the region, brought local officers to America for training, and donated patrol boats and other military equipment to friendly regimes. In May the Army and units of the National Guard will stage an international disaster relief exercise, using computers, in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan has signed a defense cooperation agreement with the United States, and others may follow.
Russia and Iran view these steps as part of a hostile plan to establish American hegemony over the Caspian. Some American experts, however, believe there is enough wealth in the region for everyone.
"If things go well, it would be a tremendous boost to all of the surrounding powers, which are many and formidable," said S. Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
"It would be the best thing that could happen to Russia, because it would lay to rest their imperial hangover," he said. "It would give Iran its traditional role as a trading state. Turkey would find a position for itself among peoples with whom it has a historical connection. China would have a new strategic connection to the West. Pakistan and India would have chances to integrate themselves into an emerging region, rather than consume themselves with mutual hatred."
"If things don't go well, there will be a geopolitical vacuum, which is everywhere dangerous. They invite intrusions, and this is a highly nuclear neighborhood."

Map/Chart: "The Great Game: Picking a Path for Oil"
The fabulous wealth in fossil fuels that lies beneath the Caspian Sea basin is now being developed, but no one is certain how to bring it to foreign markets. The Caspian region is landlocked, so pipelines are needed. The routes chosen will have profound political implications -- for the United States, for Russia, for Iran, and for the nations that sit atop the vast lakes of oil and gas. Here are the principal alternatives:
 
Through Eastern European ports
Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine say they could send oil by barge or pipeline straight to Western Europe from their ports on the Black Sea.
 
Through Georgia and the Black Sea
Some American oil companies favor this route for now, since building a new pipeline here would be simpler than through Turkey, and tankers could then go straight to Eastern Europe or out the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. But Turkey objects to increased traffic through the Bosporus.
 
Through Turkey via Georgia
This route is favored by the United States Government, which sees it as a way to build up Turkey, assure delivery of oil to the Mediterranean through friendly territory, and promote as much independence as possible in the former Soviet republics. American oil companies, however, say they would need big subsidies because of the expense.
 
Through Iran
A new pipeline here might be the cheapest way to bring out oil, but American companies are forbidden from doing business with the current Iranian regime.
 
Through Afghanistan
Pakistan would like to develop these routes, but Afghanistan has been in the grip of civil war for a decade, and its current rulers, the Taliban, run what is perhaps the most radical Islamic regime.
 
To China
A feasibility study is due later this year for a natural gas pipeline that would deliver fuel directly to China through Kazakhstan. An oil pipeline is also being studied.
 
Through Russia
Soviet-era pipelines exist and could be supplemented, and the Russians are eager to do this. But American oil companies and the newly independent countries of the Caucasus want alternate routes -- partly to avoid new dependence on Russia and partly to sidestep unstable areas of Russia like Chechnya.

HEADLINE: With Switch In Heir Plan, King Hussein Stuns Jordan

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan is preparing to select one of his sons as his heir, Jordanian officials said today, culminating a dizzying week in which the King returned from six months of cancer treatment abroad and then dismissed his brother as Crown Prince.
The sudden ouster of Crown Prince Hassan, who is 51 and had been the King's designated heir for 34 years, has stunned even Jordanians long used to surprises from the 63-year-old King, who has made change in course a hallmark of his 47-year rule. 
 The King has not yet offered any clue as to why his brother fell into disfavor, and he has not yet signaled which of his five sons he might now elevate to the head of the line for the Hashemite throne.
Since the King returned on Tuesday to announce that he had "thoughts and ideas" about changing the line of succession, Jordan had been buzzing with speculation and disbelief. But on Friday, Jordanian officials said, the King made the news official in a meeting in which he told his brother to prepare for a royal decree that would designate a new heir.
The Crown Prince, who is described in an official biography as the King's closest confidant, had run the country as Regent during all six months of his brother's absence, as he had done countless times before.
The King was reported by Jordanian officials to have told the Crown Prince that he wanted to designate him as his deputy, albeit with limited power, but people close to Crown Prince Hassan said he had taken the news badly and might well choose to live abroad.
According to knowledgeable Jordanians who spoke on condition of anonymity, the leading candidates to succeed King Hussein are now Prince Abdullah, 37, the King's eldest son and an army major general in charge of a royal security force, and Prince Hamzeh, 18, the King's eldest son by his current wife, the American-born Queen Noor.
Prince Hamzeh, who is now attending a course at the British military academy in Sandhurst, England, has long been seen as the King's favorite. He was at his father's side through much of the grueling cancer treatment, at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, and unconfirmed talk around the Royal Court has long suggested that Queen Noor wanted Hamzeh to become King.
King Hussein, whose treatment included six rounds of chemotherapy and the transplant of bone marrow, has pronounced himself "fully recovered from the cancer," a variety known as non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
But his latest illness was his second brush with cancer in the last seven years, and it has robbed him of his hair, weight and some physical vigor. For the latter reason, diplomats in the Jordanian capital, Amman, have suggested that the King might now find it difficult to resume a full work schedule.
They say they know of no reason to doubt that the King has been cured, but they also have described his sudden attention to succession as reflecting a fresh sense of mortality.
Neither Prince Abdullah nor Prince Hamzeh has been given much of a public profile in Jordan, but both are said by people who know them to have the same charm and charisma that have helped the King to guide Jordan through turbulent times.
By contrast, Crown Prince Hassan has found it difficult to shake an image of being relatively aloof. Still, he has also has won many admirers through his long years as his brother's understudy.
That has been particularly the case within the business community, which regarded him as well-equipped to help Jordan through economic strains. And even Jordanians who have never been great admirers of the Crown Prince are shocked and confused by the move to sideline him from the succession.
"I don't think this is any way to treat a brother," said a former Jordanian official who like most people critical of the King would speak only on condition of anonymity.
The King, who is one of the world's longest-serving leaders, has a long record of surprising friends and foes, through decades of artful swerves that included his sudden embrace in 1994 of a peace treaty with Israel.
But never before has he courted so much potential discord within his family.
When he designated Hassan as Crown Prince in 1965, the King's sons were infants, and a series of assassination attempts against King Hussein had raised concern about how Jordan would fare if he were killed. The move required an amendment to Jordan's Constitution, which had stipulated that the eldest son of the reigning monarch inherit the throne.
The selection of a son as the new heir would restore that line. King Hussein was designated in 1952 and formally took power the next year, succeeding his grandfather, King Abdullah, assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951, and his father, King Talal.

HEADLINE: Social Insecurity in Brazil For Its Government Retirees

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 22

 BODY:
They have been called "privilegiados" who collect lavish pensions and benefits, and portrayed as budgetary vampires who drain the pension system and contribute nothing.
Now, millions of retired Government workers across Brazil are watching the financial crisis that is enveloping Latin America's largest economy tear the first breaches in the social contract that has shaped their lives. What else, they wonder, will be open to question in the new scheme of things? 
 "You work really hard, and what is it for? Just to worry at the end of your life?" said Djalma da Silva Rodrigues, who worked for the Federal Revenue department for 38 years, many of them at the country's borders for the customs service. "God in heaven, what is this? We gave everything for our jobs."
Brazil is financially on the ropes, with its currency plunging in value since the Government allowed it to float freely against the dollar a week ago. Hard currency reserves are dwindling. The Group of Seven major industrialized nations, the United States and the International Monetary Fund have contributed to a $41.5 billion bailout package to pull Brazil through the current turbulence.
In return, foreigners expect Brazil to show that it can carry out structural changes that strike at vested interests. The vote in Congress on Wednesday night to trim welfare benefits proved it can -- even though the markets appeared unimpressed, and the plunge in the currency and the flight of dollars continued on Thursday and Friday.
The changes will raise the pension contributions of most Government workers to just under 25 percent for the highest earners. The measures will save Brazil only $2.5 billion this year, but the plan shatters a longstanding cultural taboo against retired Government workers having to continue to pay into the pension system.
In Brazil, retired Government workers -- 905,000 -- now outnumber the 902,000 active civil servants. Government projections indicate that pensions will produce a $29 billion deficit this year.
If outsiders viewed Wednesday night's vote as a test of commitment to sound fiscal management, retired workers watched through a different lens.
Some saw it as the just end to a sweet ride. Others, like Mr. Rodrigues, were bitter and felt the Government was changing the rules not so much in the middle of the game, but after it had ended. Retirees from the private sector, who have had to buy supplemental retirement policies to collect their pensions of more than 1,200 reals a month, now some $750, said it was about time.
But for all Government workers, Wednesday's vote, which is expected to be approved by the Senate, shatters a sense of security that had shaped the lives of public servants.
"To us, this vote has been one of the biggest blows on the heads of workers," said Claudette Alves da Silva Souza, president of the municipal workers' union of Sao Paulo, which represents 147,000 civil servants. While the congressional vote itself affects only federal workers, Sao Paulo officials said this week they would apply it to state and municipal workers as soon as the federal law took effect.
Ms. Souza said she agreed with the need for reform, but noted that the Government had not struck at more powerful vested interests, like Brazil's wealthy landowners, the banking sector or multinationals operating in the country.
Even within the Civil Service, some classes have remained protected. The military, both retired and active workers, have so far been exempt from the reforms affecting the rest of Brazil's public workers, and they will not have to contribute to the pension system. Judges and teachers are also protected from some of the reforms.
"Who's being hit?" Ms. Souza said. "It's the middle class and below that's being called upon to pay for the mistakes of a Government that implemented a disastrous policy."
Brazil's pension system for Government workers remains generous by any standards. Retired civil servants receive their highest salary for as long as they live, and after retirement they continue to collect any salary increases their union negotiates, as if they were still working.
To many private sector workers, like Levy Kauffman, a former vice president of the telephone company, it was high time for Brazil's governing class to abandon its privileges. Watching the congressmen supporting the reform speak above the din of opposition critics, he said, "We're at a stage in Brazil where a minority that's organized controls a majority that's disorganized."
Mr. Kauffman, 75, nodded as he watched Roberto Jefferson, a congressman from Rio de Janeiro, defend the social security reforms as necessary for Brazil's solvency. "For each real the public servant puts into the pension system, the Government puts in 10," Mr. Jefferson intoned. "And there's no actuarial table in the world that can make sense of that."
"Finally," Mr. Kauffman said, as if at last hearing somebody who spoke his language.

HEADLINE: Ailing Asian Companies Unload Their Hotels

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Japan Airlines bought the Essex House, a grand Art Deco hotel on Central Park South, 15 years ago and turned it into a flagship for its Nikko hotel chain in a city where real estate always seems like a good bet for foreign investors.
Now that the airline is struggling with declining profits in a turbulent Asian economy, it is selling the Essex House to an American company, Strategic Hotel Capital, for about $250 million, real estate executives say. Eight blocks away, the Lai Sun Group of Hong Kong is selling the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, as well as the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, for similar reasons. 
 Many of the Asian companies that have poured billions of dollars into American real estate, particularly trophy hotels in New York, California and Hawaii, are now selling out. With the hotel market booming in the United States, some foreign companies are making huge profits. Others, like Japan Airlines, are breaking even, or even losing money. But there is no question that the Asian shopping spree is over.
"A lot of Asian companies are trying to liquidate assets and convert them to cash because of problems at home," said Arthur Adler, a partner at the Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, a real estate investment bank. "And the timing's not bad, because there's a feeling that the market is peaking."
There is no shortage of buyers. At the Essex House auction, Laurence S. Geller, the chairman of Strategic Hotel Capital, which owns 26 hotels including the Marriott East Side in Manhattan and the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel in California, had to fend off rivals like Marriott, Intercontinental Hotels and the Blackstone Group's Savoy Hotels. Strategic signed a contract earlier this month to buy the Essex House and is set to close the deal in late February or March.
Mr. Geller said Strategic would be spending money to "upgrade the hotel and position it at a higher level than it is today."
"The Essex House will be one of our flagship hotels in the United States," he said Friday. "We believe that lodging in Manhattan is rock solid. It's one of the few great world tourist destinations."
Most analysts say that the market for hotels reached a high point last summer, but that hotels will remain very profitable in cities like New York because business remains so strong. Even without the latest round of hotel sales, room rates have been rising swiftly. During most of the year, it is almost impossible to find an available room in New York City. As a result, the average room rate in Manhattan has jumped 36.9 percent to $213.83 since January 1996, according to PKF Consulting, a hotel consulting company. And rates are expected to rise 7 percent this year in New York, and 5 percent nationally.
"We'll see an increase in room rates in 1999, but it's a factor of demand, not the purchase price of the hotel," said John Fox, a principal at PKF Consulting. "The profits in this industry are still very good."
According to hotel and real estate executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Strategic is betting that it can raise room rates at the 597-room hotel and take advantage of a better reservations system. Strategic, in turn, has hired Westin hotels to manage the Essex House. Westin, which is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, already runs the nearby Westin Central Park South.
Japan Airlines had lots of company on its trip to the auction block.
The Taisei Corporation of Japan sold the Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines in La Jolla, Calif., last month for $82.5 million to Hilton Hotels, which promptly renamed it the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines.
Another troubled Hong Kong company, Paliburg Holdings Ltd., is selling its stake in Regal Hotels, a chain that has 13 properties in the United States and Canada, including the United Nations Plaza in New York, the Biltmore in Los Angeles, the Knickerbocker in Chicago and the Regal Bostonian in Boston.
Last year, a company controlled by Ong Beng Seng, the Singapore billionaire, sold its 40 percent stake in the Pennsylvania Hotel, across Seventh Avenue from Madison Square Garden. And Sinar Mas Group, the second-largest conglomerate in Indonesia, sold a real estate portfolio that included the Pasadena Hilton in California and the Melrose Hotel in Dallas to pay off mounting debts.
The sales mark the end of what was actually the second wave of Asian investment in American real estate. Between 1985 and 1992, Japanese companies spent $77 billion on real estate in the United States, buying everything from the former Exxon Building to Rockefeller Center. No price was too high for the Japanese, who were confident of the long-term value of the office buildings, hotels, golf courses and shopping centers.
But they took a beating during the recession in the early 1990's. Since 1992, the Japanese have sold about one-third of those properties for a little more than half the original purchase prices, according to the E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group.
As the Japanese retreated, a second wave of investors from Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Brunei and South Korea swept into the United States between 1993 and 1996, snapping up $6.3 billion worth of real estate, most of it hotels, at bargain prices.
But even as real estate prices started skyrocketing in New York and California in 1997, the Asian economy began falling apart. Faced with steep debts and falling sales at home, many of the new investors decided to sell at what turned out to be the top of the market in the United States. During the first six months of 1998, Asians bought only $160 million worth of real estate, but sold nearly $1 billion worth.
Lai Sun will reap the benefits of the boom in recent years. The company paid $190 million two years ago for the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street, one of the most lavish hotels in the world, and is now selling it for about $260 million, a relatively quick profit of $70 million.
Japan Airlines is not so lucky. The company bought the Essex House in 1985 for $190 million, closed it for two years and spent $100 million more on renovations.
The rooms at the Essex House are usually full, and it has two highly rated restaurants, but the hotel has never been an economic powerhouse for the airline, according to hotel executives. Under pressure in Japan, the company is now being forced to sell many of its hotels and resorts.
"The Essex House is a large hotel in a prime location," said Fox, of PKF Consulting. "It's a significant addition to anybody's roster."

A Scandal Tears Apart Olympic 'Family'

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 23

 BODY:
People in international Olympic circles have for many years been fond of describing the Olympics as a "family." The term, combined with the ever-present logo of the five interlocked rings, suggested a shared mission, a unity that went beyond sports, a higher purpose.
Dysfunctional is probably the first thing most people would think of now. 
 The Olympic family, a sprawling multibillion-dollar sports entity that had seemed to own the high ground of international athletic competition -- drenched with its associations to ancient times, haughty in its superiority to mere professional sports -- has over the last week almost looked to be coming apart at the seams.
Like pop-up targets at a shooting gallery that come too fast to shoot, new allegations of impropriety, if not formal illegality, have emerged almost daily about how the International Olympic Committee, generally known as the I.O.C., has awarded its ultimate plum prize -- the granting of the great five-ring franchise to a particular city.
And that in turn has set off one of the great media chases in recent years, as news organizations all over the world -- in just about every city that has been host to the Olympics in the last few decades or wanted to -- has begun to look at how the process worked.
What began here in Utah late last year as a small brushfire, as stories began to circulate about how I.O.C. delegates were courted and wined and dined and enriched as part of Salt Lake City's efforts to win enough votes to obtain the 2002 Winter Games, has thus become, for the Olympic movement, a worldwide conflagration.
From Toronto to Brazzaville, Congo, and Nagano, Japan, to Sydney, Australia, tales have emerged -- some confirmed, others simply reported by local news organizations and thrown out onto the worldwide news net. There have been reports of petty grasping by I.O.C. delegates and of formal payoffs for votes, of free shotguns and samurai swords, of plastic surgery provided gratis as a city's gift to a delegate, of burned records and of geisha girls, of land deals that benefited I.O.C. delegates and of recitals for pianists of uncertain talent who had the right connections.
And to a great extent those reports have been considered all the more newsworthy -- if not sensational -- precisely because of the mantle of respectability and sanctimony with which the Olympic family had so long wrapped itself.
"It's the old issue -- do people's behaviors conform to their value systems? The answer is, most of the time they do and occasionally they don't," said R. Thayne Robson, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Utah, and a close observer of the Olympics struggle.
"My view as an economist is that people are pretty much motivated by greed and selfishness and that given the opportunity, they will act on that," he said.
Part of the Olympics story has centered on the almost metaphysical question of how to define a gift. Is a present to gain good will from an influential decision maker really so different, many local Olympics organizers around the world have argued, from the tax breaks and giveaways that are routinely offered to corporations by states or cities -- including, notably, New York -- as they compete to keep a company where it is or induce it to move somewhere else? Why aren't those things called bribes?
But what has also emerged is how much personal power individual I.O.C. delegates possess, or were perceived to possess, by local organizers who in many cases seem to have been almost pathetically desperate to win enough votes to get an Olympic franchise for their home town.
Although most of the reports have suggested that only a small minority of the I.O.C.'s 114 delegates may have received direct financial benefits from local organizers, the overwhelming message is that almost whatever a delegate asked for could not be denied and that first-class treatment with all expenses paid was the barest minimum to be expected when a delegate came to call.
To date, two I.O.C. delegates have officially resigned: Pirjo Haeggman of Finland and Bashir Attarabulsi of Libya. Olympic officials have identified the 11 other I.O.C. officials linked with the Salt Lake City scandal as Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zen El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of the Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands, Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Lamine Keita of Mali, Kim Un Yong of South Korea, Charles Mukora of Kenya, Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile, David Sibandze of Swaziland and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia.
Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Friday, for example, that the daughter of an influential I.O.C. executive was given a piano recital -- sponsored in part by local Olympics organizers -- shortly before the vote in which Nagano was selected as the site of the 1998 Winter Games. That report came just a few days after Olympics officials in Nagano said that financial records about the Games there had been burned.
On the same day, an I.O.C. delegate from Libya, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, resigned -- the second delegate to quit in five days -- after published reports said that his son, Suhel, had gone to college in Utah, and received a $700 a month living allowance while he did so, paid for by Salt Lake City Olympic organizers.
As if that were not enough for one day, a senior official of the Australian Olympic Committee announced that he had offered tens of thousands to two I.O.C. delegates from Africa just before the vote in which Sydney won the right to be host to the 2000 Summer Games. The official, John Coates, said the money was intended to help develop sports programs in Kenya and Uganda and was not a bribe. Sydney won in the subsequent balloting, as it turned out, by exactly two votes.
And finally, a newspaper in the Netherlands this week reported that Olympic organizers had spent almost $7 million on I.O.C. delegates during Amsterdam's effort to get the 1992 Olympics. Dutch Olympic officials even brought a fleet of private buses to I.O.C. headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland to provide free transportation for I.O.C. members and guests while the vote was held. And it didn't even work. Amsterdam was first city to be eliminated in voting for the Summer Games that year, losing to Barcelona, Spain.
In Quebec, which lost to Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Games, local Olympic officials even began keeping a paper trail of the highly specific wishes or demands of the more than 60 I.O.C. delegates who visited the city before the vote. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported today that one asked for the city to pay travel expenses for his nation's athletes, while another wanted money for investment in a paper pulp factory. Quebec officials have previously said that they would seek reimbursement of more than $12 million in expenses from the I.O.C. if Salt Lake City's victory was found to have been improper.

Overtaxed? Depends on the Source

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSON

 BODY:
In Washington, there's a another whopper making the rounds. This one is about Uncle Sam and your wallet.
 In the Republican response to President Clinton's State of the Union Address, Representative Jennifer Dunn of Seattle told the story as fact.
 
 "Last year a typical mother and father who both work paid nearly 40 percent of their income in taxes," Ms. Dunn said. "That means 40 cents out of every dollar they earned went to the Government in Federal, state or local taxes."
 Not true. According to official estimates from the Clinton Administration and the Congressional Budget Office, a two-income middle class family of four pays closer to 30 percent in taxes. For a similar family in Ms. Dunn's suburban Seattle district, the figure is 28 percent.
 Even her source, the Tax Foundation, which is a nonprofit organization, disagreed with her.
 "It appears that Congresswoman Dunn's staff relied on an outdated report of ours," said Bill Ahern, spokesman for the foundation.
 In November 1997 the Tax Foundation said a family of four in which both parents work paid 38.2 percent of its income in taxes. The report was widely criticized for exaggerating the tax burden. A revised report lowered the estimate to 37.6 percent. The foundation says that number is too high for 1998, the year Ms. Dunn referred to, because Congress gave parents a $400 tax cut for each child.
 "A family of four does not pay a penny in income taxes until their income reaches $28,000," said William G. Gale, a tax economist at the Brookings Institution, "and three-fourths of all taxpayers either pay no income taxes or are in the 15-percent tax bracket for part of their income."
 At week's end Ms. Dunn was standing fast. That "40 percent is a round number that is very close to the figure that is accurate," she said. As for controversy over the Tax Foundation's methodology and the official estimates being much lower, Ms. Dunn said, "We try to be as accurate as possible. There may well be better numbers, but people are being taxed way too much and everybody knows it."

The Brazilian Bear Growls Again

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
Markets aroudn the world shuddered on Friday as Brazil's economic crisis deepened. Brazil's central bank intervened in currency markets to keep its currency, the real, from going into a free fall. Even so, the currency has fallen 30 percent against the dollar since the start of the crisis. The intervention was the bank's first since allowing the real to float last week.
 
 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite index lost 2.4 percent for the week, closing at 6,593.90. The biggest Canadian banks have $3 billion (Canadian) in loans, deposits and securities in Brazil, and share prices dropped for Scotiabank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Royal Bank of Canada.
 Markets in New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Madrid and Amsterdam were also reeling on Friday. Amsterdam was the hardest-hit, down 4.61 percent. One trader in Paris told Agence France-Presse that Brazil's currency "just hasn't found a floor." He added, "There are a lot of European companies with exposure to South America."
 In addition to worry over Brazil, disappointment over I.B.M.'s earnings delivered a big punch, as the Dow Jones industrial average lost 219.88 points last week, closing at 9,120.67, down 2.35 percent.

HEADLINE: How the Eggheads Cracked

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. He is working on a book about Silicon Valley.

 BODY:
A lot of unusual things have happened in the four months since Long-Term Capital Management announced that it lost more than $4 billion in a bizarre six-week financial panic late last summer, but nothing nearly so unusual as what hasn't happened. None of the 180 employees of the hedge fund have stood up to explain, to fess up or to excuse themselves from the table. Even the two Nobel Laureates on staff, who could very easily have slipped back into their caps and gowns in the dead of night and pretended none of this ever happened, have stayed and worked, quietly. The man in charge, John Meriwether, has shown a genius for lying low. Photographers in helicopters circle his house, and journalists bang on his front door at odd hours and frighten his wife. Yet whenever the question "Who is John Meriwether?" has demanded an answer, it has been supplied not by those who know him and work with him but by a self-appointed cast of casual acquaintances and perfect strangers. They have described Meriwether and his colleagues as reliable Wall Street stereotypes: the overreaching, self-deluded speculators. In doing so they have missed pretty much everything interesting about them.
Not long ago, I visited the hedge fund's offices in Greenwich, Conn., to see if its collapse made any more sense from the inside than it did from the outside. So many different activities take place in enterprises called "hedge funds" that the term is perhaps more confusing than helpful. In general, hedge funds attract money from rich people and big institutions and, as a result, are somewhat less stringently regulated than ordinary money managers. Long-Term Capital was an especially odd case, less a conventional money manager than a sophisticated Wall Street bond-trading firm. The floor it had constructed in Greenwich was a smaller version of a Wall Street trading floor, with subtle differences. The old wall between the trading floor and the research department had been pulled down, for instance. For most of Wall Street the trading floor is a separate room, distinct from research. The people who pick up the phone and place the bets (the traders) are the highly paid risk takers, while the people who analyze and explain the more complicated securities (the researchers) are glorified clerks. Back in 1993, when Meriwether established Long-Term Capital, he also created a new status system. The title "trader" would no longer exist. At Long-Term Capital, anyone who had anything to do with thinking about how to make money in financial markets would be called a "strategist." 
 The strategists spent several days with me going over the details of their collapse. They began with a six-hour presentation they had just put together for the investors whose money they had lost, because, as one of the fund's partners puts it: "Virtually no one has called and asked us for the facts. They just believe what they read in the papers." Then I was shown the bets that had cost the strategists their fortunes and their reputations as the smartest traders on or off Wall Street. The guided tour of the spectacular ruin concluded with a conversation with John Meriwether. He, and they, offered a neat illustration of the limits of reason in human affairs.
 
Riding the Crash of '87 With Meriwether and His Young Professors
"The first time I saw a market panic up close was also the last time I had seen John Meriwether -- the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. I was working at Salomon Brothers, then the leading trading firm on Wall Street. A few yards to one side of me sat Salomon's C.E.O., John Gutfreund; a few yards to the other side sat Meriwether, the firm's most beguiling character. The stock market plummeted and the bond market soared that day as they had never done in anyone's experience, and the two men did extraordinary things.
I didn't appreciate what they had done until much later. You cannot really see a thing unless you know what you are looking for, and I did not know what I was looking for. I was so slow to grasp the importance of the scene that I failed to make use of it later in "Liar's Poker," the memoir I wrote about my Wall Street experience. But the events of those few hours were in many ways the most important I ever saw on Wall Street.
What happened in the stock-market crash was one of those transfers of authority that seem to occur in the financial marketplace every decade or so. The markets in a panic are like a country during a coup, and seen in retrospect that is how they were that day. One small group of people with its old, established way of looking at the world was hustled from its seat of power. Another small group of people with a new way of looking at the world was rising up to claim the throne. And it was all happening in a few thousand square feet at the top of a tall office building at the bottom of Manhattan.
John Gutfreund moved back and forth between his desk and the long, narrow row of government-bond traders, where he huddled with Craig Coats Jr., Salomon's head of government-bond trading. Together they decided that the world was coming to an end, as it came to an end in the Crash of 1929. The end of the world is good news for the bond market -- which is why it was soaring. Gutfreund and Coats decided to buy $2 billion worth of the newly issued 30-year United States Treasury bond. They were marvelous to watch, a pair of lions in their jungle. They did not stop to ask themselves, Why do we of all people on the planet enjoy the privilege of knowing what will happen next? They believed in their instincts. They had the nerve, the guts or whatever it was that distinguished a winner from a loser on a Wall Street trading floor in 1987.
And in truth they had been the winners of the 80's boom. Business Week had anointed Gutfreund the King of Wall Street. Coats was believed by many to be the model for the main character in a book then just published called "The Bonfire of the Vanities." Coats was tall and handsome and charismatic. He was everything that a bond trader in the 80's was supposed to be.
Except that he was wrong. The world was not coming to an end. Bond prices were not about to keep rising. The world would pretty much ignore the stock-market crash. Soon, Coats would arrive at work and find that his $2 billion of Treasury bonds had acquired a new name: the Whale. Traders near Coats started asking him about the Whale. As in, "How's that Whale today, Craig?" Or, "That Whale still beached?" In the end, the gut decision to buy the Whale cost Salomon Brothers $75 million.
Meanwhile, 20 yards away was Meriwether. When I think of people in American life who might have been like him, I think not of financial types but creative ones -- Harold Ross of the old New Yorker, say, or Quentin Tarantino. Meriwether was like a gifted editor or a brilliant director: he had a nose for unusual people and the ability to persuade them to run with their talents. Right beside him were his first protgs, four young men fresh from graduate schools -- Eric Rosenfeld, Larry Hilibrand, Greg Hawkins and Victor Haghani. Meriwether had taken it upon himself to set up a sort of underground railroad that ran from the finest graduate finance and math programs directly onto the Salomon trading floor. Robert Merton, the economist who himself would later become a consultant to Salomon Brothers and, later still, a partner at Long-Term Capital, complained that Meriwether was stealing an entire generation of academic talent.
No one back then really knew what to make of the "young professors." They were nothing like the others on the trading floor. They were physically unintimidating, their bodies merely life-support systems for their brains, which were in turn extensions of their computers. They were polite and mild-mannered and hesitant. When you asked them a simple question, they thought about it for eight months before they answered, and then their answer was so complicated you wished you had never asked. This was especially true if you asked a simple question about their business. Something as straightforward as "Why is this bond cheaper than that bond?" elicited a dissertation. They didn't think the same way about the markets as Craig Coats did or, for that matter, as anyone else on Wall Street did.
It turned out that there was a reason for this. On the surface, American finance was losing its mystique, what with ordinary people leaping into mutual funds, mortgage products and credit-card debt. But below the surface, a new and wider gap was opening between high finance and low finance. The old high finance was merely a bit mysterious; the new high finance was incomprehensible. The financial markets were spawning vastly complicated new instruments -- options, futures, swaps, mortgage bonds and more. Their complexity baffled laypeople, and still does, but created opportunities for those who could parse it. At the behest of John Meriwether, the young professors were reinventing finance, and redefining what it meant to be a bond trader. Their presence on the trading floor marked the end of anti-intellectualism in American financial life.
But at that moment of panic, the young professors did not fully appreciate their own powers. All their well-thought-out strategies, which had yielded them profits of perhaps $200 million over the first 10 months of 1987, wilted that October day in the heat of other people's madness. They lost at least $120 million, which was sufficient to ruin the quarterly earnings of the entire firm. Two years before, they were being paid $29,000 to teach Finance 101 to undergraduates. Now they had lost $120 million! And not just anybody's $120 million! One hundred twenty million dollars that belonged in part to some very large, very hairy men. They were unnerved, as you can imagine, until Meriwether convinced them that they should not be unnerved but energized. He told them to pick their two or three most promising trades and triple them.
They did it, of course. They paid special attention to one big trade. They sold short the newly issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bond of which Craig Coats had just purchased $2 billion and bought identical amounts of the 30-year bond the Treasury had issued three months before -- that is, a 29-year bond. (To "short" a stock or bond means to bet that its price will fall.) The young professors were not the first to see that the two bonds were nearly identical. But they were the first to have studied so meticulously the relationship between them. Newly issued Treasury bonds change hands more frequently than older ones. They acquire what is called a "liquidity premium," which is to say that professional bond traders pay a bit more for them because they are a bit easier to resell. In the panic, the premium on the 30-year bond became grotesquely large, and the young professors, or at any rate their computers, noticed. They laid a bet that the premium would shrink when the panic subsided.
But there was something else going on that had nothing to do with computers. The young professors weren't happy making money unless they could explain to themselves why they were making money. And if they couldn't find the reason for a market inefficiency they became suspicious and declined to bet on it. But when they stood up on Oct. 19, 1987, and peered out over their computers, they discovered the reason: everyone else was confused. Salomon's own long-bond trader, the very best in the business, was lost. Here was the guy who was meant to be the soul of reason in the government-bond markets, and he looked like a lab rat that had become lost in a maze. This brute with razor instincts, it turned out, relied on a cheat sheet that laid out the prices of old long bonds as the market moved. The move in the bond market during the panic had blown all these bonds right off his sheet. "He's moved beyond his intuition," one of the young professors thought. "He doesn't have the tools to cope. And if he doesn't have the tools, who does?" His confusion was an opportunity for the young professors to exploit.
Years later it would be difficult for them to recapture the thrill of this moment, and dozens of others like it. It was as if they had been granted a more evolved set of senses, and a sixth one to boot. And they had nerve: they were willing to put money where their theory was. Three weeks after the 1987 crash, when the markets calmed down, they cashed out of the Treasury bonds with a profit of $50 million. All in all, the bets they placed in the teeth of one of the greatest panics Wall Street had ever seen eventually made them more money than any bets they had ever made, perhaps $150 million altogether. By comparison, all of Merrill Lynch generated $391 million in profits that year. The lesson in this was not lost on the young professors: panic was good for business. The stupid things people did with money when they were frightened was an opportunity for more reasonable people to exploit. The young professors knew that in theory already; now they knew it in practice. It was a lesson they would regret during the next big panic, far bigger and more mysterious than the Crash of October 1987 -- the panic of August 1998. They would still be working together, but at Long-Term Capital Management.
 
What Long-Term Capital Was and Wasn't About
I was a tad uneasy about meeting these people again. All those pregnant pauses! All those explanations! Even more than 10 years later, I can recall the dreadful minutes after I had asked them to walk me through one of their trades, when my brain felt like a beaten cornerback watching the receiver dancing into the end zone. On top of it all was their Spock-like analytical detachment, which still hung heavy in the air in Greenwich and overshadowed any larger consideration, like shrewd management of the press. "If everything had gone well," one of the young professors said not long after I stepped off the elevator, "we wouldn't be talking to you." But everything did not go well, and they had decided to explain themselves to someone they had practice explaining things to.
When I heard that Long-Term Capital had collapsed, my initial reaction was a sneaky relief: Hans Hufschmid was no longer worth $50 million. Anyone who has quit one life for another will understand the importance of insuring that none of the people you leave behind do so well for themselves as to suggest that you have made a truly colossal mistake. Since I left Salomon Brothers in 1988 to make a living as a writer, I had remained curious about how rich I would have become if I had stayed on Wall Street. There were several people whose fortunes I considered fair proxies for my own, and whom I tagged for further observation, like wolves released in a wildlife experiment.
Hans was one of them. Back in 1986, Hans and I left the same New York training program for the same London trading floor, where we were ultimately supervised by John Meriwether. Although neither of us was a young professor, we had gone into the same arcane line of work. We both spent half of our time flying around Europe trying to coax innocent investors into complicated new American-born financial instruments and the other half seeking out speculations for those who needed no coaxing. But those were just our surface similarities. Deep down, Hans and I shared a dirty little secret: we couldn't keep up with the young professors. We belonged to a new semi-informed breed who could "pass" as experts on the new financial complexity without possessing true understanding.
In any case, Hans was one of those people I might have become had I remained on Wall Street. And so, at the end of 1993, after I heard that Salomon Brothers had paid Hans a bonus of $28 million, I spent at least three hours wondering why I hadn't done so. Twenty-eight million dollars was just the original insult. At the end of 1994, Hans left Salomon to become a partner in Long-Term Capital's London office. It gives you an idea just how desirable it was to work for John Meriwether that to do so people quit jobs at the finest Wall Street firms, which paid them bonuses of $28 million. Word came that Hans had sunk not merely his $28 million bonus into the fund but also $15 million he had borrowed from some bank.
The fund rose by 43 percent in 1995, by 41 percent in 1996 and by 17 percent in 1997. At the end of each year, Hans reinvested his profits in the fund. That was another odd thing about the people at Long-Term Capital. They did not define themselves in the usual Wall Street way, by their material possessions. Their hundreds of millions of dollars didn't lead inexorably to private jets and new life styles. (They would be better off now if that had been the case.) Their favorite form of conspicuous consumption was to buy more and more of their own investment genius. As a result, before their demise, Long-Term Capital's 16 partners had invested roughly $1.9 billion of their own money in their fund. Making some fairly conservative assumptions about Hans and his effective tax rate, $50 million of that pile belonged to him. This, to my way of thinking, made it a bit more expensive than it should have been not to be Hans Hufschmid.
And then . . . poof . . . it was not so very expensive at all. Not being Hans was positively joyous. By the end of September 1998, the same friends from Salomon Brothers who had informed me how rich Hans was becoming in late 1997 were telling me that he and all his partners were wiped out. As Hans himself had borrowed to invest in himself, it was at least conceivable that he was worth less than zero.
That did it for me: I demanded no further reparations. I was once again satisfied to be paid by the word. But it turned out that I was alone in this sentiment. A lot of people wanted not only Hans's money but also his hide, along with the hides of Larry Hilibrand, Victor Haghani, Eric Rosenfeld, Greg Hawkins and John Meriwether. Plus those of Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, Nobel Prize-winning economists who had joined Meriwether. (They won the 1997 Nobel Prize for their work on risk management of options.) Hans and his partners were accused by all sorts of people of behaving recklessly, succumbing to hubris and jeopardizing the economic health of the West.
One number that kept popping up in the papers was the "$1.2 trillion" that Hans and the young professors had supposedly wagered. The $1.2 trillion represented what are known as the open trading positions of the fund. Anyone who works on Wall Street knows that a firm's open trading positions contain all sorts of things that offset one another. At any given time, Goldman, Sachs or Shearson Lehman, which had only about twice as much capital available as Long-Term, might carry $7 trillion or $8 trillion in positions on their books. What was important was not the gross amount of the positions but the amount of risk in them.
That's where "leverage" came into the newspaper accounts. Leverage means borrowing to buy things you otherwise could not afford, and many of the public accounts invariably equated it with "risk." "At L.T.C.M.," wrote Carol J. Loomis in Fortune, "the best minds were destroyed by the oldest and most famously addictive drug in finance, leverage." Possibly there was once a time when leverage was a good measure of risk. But one consequence of the new complexity in financial markets has been to make any such simple calculation impossible. A portfolio might be leveraged 50 times and have almost no risk. A portfolio might be leveraged five times and be perfectly mad. Long-Term Capital had been in pretty much the same line of work as a Wall Street investment bank, and Wall Street investment banks were leveraged the same amounts, about 25 times (although a Wall Street investment bank can lay its hands on capital more quickly than a hedge fund can).
The important number in any portfolio is not its leverage but its volatility: how much do its net assets rise and fall each day? By that measure, to which no one paid much attention, Long-Term Capital was running a fund that looked to all of Wall Street a bit less risky than if it had taken its capital and simply invested all of it, unleveraged, in a diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks.
Then there was the inevitable search for True Character. One of the stories I had told in 1989 about Meriwether had been twisted beyond recognition into evidence that he was indeed a madman. The story ran as follows: John Gutfreund, who routinely dropped tens of thousands of dollars to the young professors playing liar's poker, a game of both chance and skill using the serial numbers on dollar bills, challenged Meriwether to one hand for $1 million. ("One hand, $1 million, no tears" was what he supposedly said.) Meriwether replied that he would play only for $10 million. Gutfreund walked away. End of story. All sorts of people, Gutfreund included, later denied that the incident ever occurred, but in any case the point of the episode was just the opposite of the interpretation now placed on it. The point of the story was that in a world where you weren't supposed to flinch from financial risk, Meriwether had found a clever way to avoid what was clearly an act of lunacy.
But even without knowing much about what Meriwether did, or how he did it, or what sort of man he was, you could see that the public accounts of the collapse of Long-Term Capital were, at the very least, incomplete. From the mid-80's right up until last summer, the young professors had been the most widely imitated men on Wall Street. If they were so wildly irresponsible, why had every big Wall Street firm copied them? Even after Long-Term's collapse, a lot of smart people were sniffing acquisitively around their portfolio. If that portfolio was so recklessly speculative, why was Warren Buffett, among others, trying to buy it?
Between the lines of the stories were hints of a more complicated one. The most remarkable gurgling noises from last summer's panic came from the inner sanctums of finance. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said then that "the world is now experiencing its worst financial crisis in 50 years." That was something coming from a man who specialized in soothing investors and who had been on a trading desk at Goldman, Sachs during the Crash of 1987. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, said that he had never seen anything in his lifetime that compared to the terror of August 1998. From one end of Wall Street to the other, firms were announcing record bond-trading losses. Goldman, Sachs, which worked harder than any other firm to copy Meriwether's success, explained its own disaster by saying that "our risk model did not take into account enough the copycat problem." That statement was true but inadequate. It failed to mention the name of the original cat.
 
How Meriwether and the Young Professors Lost Control
If you didn't know who John Meriwether was, you wouldn't have the slightest curiosity about him. He has small, even features, a shock of cowlicky brown hair that droops boyishly down over his forehead and a blank expression that could mean nothing or everything. His movements are quick, however, and so is his talk. He speaks in fragments and moves rapidly from one idea to the next, leaving behind a trail of untidy thoughts. He shapes other people more completely than he does himself. His discomfort with the first person occasionally makes him difficult to follow, especially when he is supposed to be talking about himself. When he says, "If anyone wants to focus on anybody and wants to take them apart, he can," he means, "I believe that people set out to destroy me, and succeeded."
When I arrived, he was hunched over at his desk on the trading floor, but by the time I got to him he was in his office. It was a token office, big and empty and conspicuously unused. It had a nice view of some trees, which I'm sure no one had glanced at in months. A tall stack of books and a large basket of shiny apples crowded the area beside his desk. Meriwether offered me one of each.
The book was "Miracle on the 17th Green," a fantasy for adults about a regular middle-aged man who one day is blessed with the talent of a golf champion. "Extraordinary things happen to ordinary people," said the back of the dust jacket. It was soon clear that this reflects Meriwether's own sense of himself and his current situation. About the first thing he said after we sat down across from his coffee table was, "I don't want this story to be about me."
To insure that it was not, he would not allow me to quote him much. And for good measure, he insisted that Richard Leahy, who hired me onto the Salomon trading floor and who is Meriwether's oldest business partner, sit in on our conversation.
My own guess is that Meriwether would rather people think him a bit weird than know the real reason he avoids publicity, which is that he is deeply uncomfortable with the attention. He has a phobia about public speaking, for instance. When you passed him on the Salomon trading floor, you could see him force himself to meet your eye. In conversations in which he might be expected to take control -- say over drinks with a couple of new employees -- he would shrink from the responsibility. He was one of those people whose desire in conversation was for everyone to be "equal." Oddly, the adjective he often chooses to describe the people he most admires is "shy." He means this as a compliment, as in "shy and polite." Shy and polite was a bizarre combination in the testosterone tank of the Salomon trading floor. It was a handicap, at least for someone seeking power in its usual corporate form, through control over large numbers of people. Meriwether sought power in a different form, through the markets.
In the five years after the 1987 crash, Meriwether and the young professors made billions for Salomon and tens of millions for themselves. They started out as oddballs but became the heart of the firm. From the mid-80's through the early 90's the rest of Wall Street, and Goldman, Sachs in particular, poached bond-trading talent from every major bond department at Salomon -- corporates, governments, mortgages. Jon Corzine, who was co-C.E.O. of Goldman, Sachs until a shake-up earlier this month, rose in the firm in part by buying the right people off the Salomon trading floor.
The single exception to this diaspora was John Meriwether's group: it wasn't for sale. In the end, it was broken up by force. A government-bond trader at Salomon Brothers named Paul Mozer, who replaced Craig Coats in 1988 and who reported to Meriwether, tried to corner the U.S. Treasury-bond market. In 1990 and 1991, he submitted phony bids at the Treasury's quarterly auctions that enabled him to buy more than his legal share. Meriwether found out, and went to his superiors, including Gutfreund, and Gutfreund agreed that the Treasury should be informed. For whatever reason, Gutfreund failed to follow up immediately, and it was several months before Salomon informed the Government.
The fate of the firm hung in the balance until Warren Buffett, Salomon's biggest shareholder, stepped in and cut a deal with the Treasury. Salomon would survive if Buffett would oversee the reform of its culture, and Gutfreund was encouraged to resign. And though everyone including Buffett acknowledged that Meriwether had done nothing wrong, Meriwether was encouraged to resign, too. He quit and created a new firm.
In many ways, Long-Term Capital was better designed for the young professors than Salomon Brothers was. There was only one noticeable disadvantage. Other Wall Street firms might have sensed how well Salomon's young professors and their strategy was paying off and sought to mimic their subtle workings. But they could not actually see these workings. When the young professors left Salomon Brothers, they opened themselves and their bets up for inspection by Wall Street. In exchange for lending Long-Term Capital the money to make its trades, the big firms -- Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs -- demanded to know what it was up to. This in turn led to higher-fidelity imitation.
"Everyone else started catching up to us," Eric Rosenfeld says. We'd go to put on a trade, but when we started to nibble the opportunity would vanish." Every time they took action, others noticed and copied them, and eliminated whatever slight irrationality had crept into the markets.
At some point, Meriwether lost control of his esoteric markets. In our conversation, I asked him how that experience had changed his ideas about making money. He replied that his old ideas, which worked so well for 15 years, have been in some sense consumed, and that he needs to find new ones. Then he proceeded to explain why.
In its broad outlines, the Long-Term Capital story could be described by a couple of pie charts. The first pie chart would lay out its losses. Of the $4.4 billion lost, $1.9 belonged to the partners personally, $700 million to Union Bank of Switzerland and $1.8 billion to other investors, half of them European banks. But as original investments had long ago been paid back to most of the banks, the losses came mainly out of their profits. The second and more interesting pie chart would describe how the money was lost. The public accounts have suggested that it was lost in all manner of exotic speculations that the young professors had irresponsibly digressed into. The speculations were exotic enough, but they were hardly digressions. When I paged through their trades, the only thing I hadn't expected to find was a taste for betting on corporate takeovers. One hundred fifty million dollars vanished from Long-Term Capital when a company called Tellabs failed to complete its acquisition of a company called Ciena, and the price of Ciena stock, which Long-Term owned, dropped from 56 to 31 1/4. ("This trade was by far the most controversial in our partnership," Rosenfeld says. "A lot of people felt we shouldn't be in the risk arb business because it is so information sensitive and we weren't trying to trade in an information-sensitive way.") Of course, Long-Term had some complicated notion of its advantage in risk arbitrage, but that notion now looked silly. Still, even taking account of the $150 million loss in Ciena shares, its stock-market trading was profitable.
The big losses that destroyed Long-Term Capital occurred in the areas the young professors had for years been masters of. The killer blows -- a good $3 billion of the $4.4 billion -- came from two bets that Meriwether and his team had been making for at least a decade: interest-rate swaps and long-term options in the stock market. Now there is no reason anyone should feel obliged to understand interest-rate-swap arbitrage. The important point about it is the degree of risk it typically involves.
Like most of Long-Term Capital's trades, these bets required the strategists to buy one thing and sell short another, so that they maintained a Swiss-like neutrality in the market. Like most of their trades, the thing they bought was similar to the thing they sold. (Their gift was for mathematical metaphor: they noticed similarities where others saw nothing but differences.) But like only some of their trades, the thing they bought became -- or was supposed to become, after a period of time, and under certain conditions -- identical to the thing they sold.
One way to understand this, and to see how bizarre was the panic of August 1998, is to imagine a world with two kinds of dollars, blue dollars and red dollars. The blue dollar and the red dollar are both worth a dollar, but you can't spend them for five years. In five years, you can turn them both in for green dollars. But for all sorts of reasons -- a mania for blue, a nasty article about red -- the blue dollar becomes more expensive than the red dollar. The blue dollar is selling for $1.05 and the red dollar is selling for 95 cents.
If you are an ordinary sane person who holds blue dollars, you simply trade them in for more red dollars. If you are Long-Term Capital, or any large Wall Street firm for that matter, and are able to borrow money cheaply, you borrow against your capital and buy a lot of red dollars and sell the same number of blue dollars. The effect is to force the price of red dollars and blue dollars back together again. In any case, you wait for blue dollars and red dollars to converge to their ultimate value of a dollar apiece.
At best, the odd passions that drove the red and the blue dollar apart subside quickly, and you reap your profits now. At worst, you must wait five years to collect your profits. The "model" tells you that you will one day make at least a nickel for every red dollar you buy for 95 cents and another nickel for every blue dollar you sell at $1.05. But as Ayman Hindy, a Long-Term Capital strategist, puts it: "The models tell you where things will be in five years. But they don't tell you what happens before you get to the moment of certainty."
Which brings us to the case of Long-Term Capital in August 1998, when the red dollar and the blue dollar were driven apart in value to ridiculous extremes. Actually, when you look at the young professors' books, you can see that the first sign of trouble came earlier, on July 17, when Salomon Brothers announced that it was liquidating all of its red dollar-blue dollar trades, which turned out to be the same trades Long-Term Capital had made. For the rest of that month, the fund dropped about 10 percent because Salomon Brothers was selling all the things that Long-Term owned.
Then, on Aug. 17, Russia defaulted on its debt. At that moment the heads of the other big financial firms recanted their beliefs about red dollars and blue dollars. Their fear overruled their reason. Once enough people gave into their fear, fear became reasonable. Fairly rapidly the other big financial firms unwound their own trades, which, having been made in the spirit of Long-Term Capital, were virtually identical to the trades of Long-Term Capital. The red dollar was suddenly worth 25 cents and the blue dollar $3. The history of red dollars and blue dollars made the statistical probability of that happening 1 in 50 million.
"What we did is rely on experience," Victor Haghani says. And all science is based on experience. And if you're not willing to draw any conclusions from experience, you might as well sit on your hands and do nothing."
Aug. 21, 1998, was the worst day in the young history of scientific finance. On that day alone, Long-Term Capital lost $550 million.
The young professors' attachment to higher reason was a great advantage only as long as there was a limit to the market's unreason. Suddenly there was no limit. Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin said they had never seen such a crisis, and neither had anyone else. It was one thing for the average stock-market investor to panic. It was another for the world's biggest financial firms to panic. The world's financial institutions created a bank run on a huge, global scale. "We put very little emphasis on what other leveraged players were doing," Haghani says, "because I think we thought they would behave very similarly to ourselves."
Long-Term Capital had worked on the assumption that there was a pool of professional money around that would see that red dollars and blue dollars were both dollars and therefore should maintain some reasonable relation to each other. But in the crisis, the young professors were the only ones who clung to such reasoning.
 
Did Long-Term Capital Die or Was It Killed?
By the end of August, Long-Term Capital had run through $2 billion of its $4.8 billion in capital. Even so, the fund might well have survived and prospered. But what started as a run on the markets, at least from Long-Term Capital's point of view, turned into a run on Long-Term Capital. "It was as if there was someone out there with our exact portfolio," Haghani says, "only it was three times as large as ours, and they were liquidating all at once."
For nearly 15 years, Meriwether and the young professors had been engaged in an experiment to determine how far human reason alone could take them. They failed to appreciate that their fabulous success had made them, quite unreasonably, part of the experiment. No longer were they the creatures of higher reason who could remain detached and aloof. They were the lab rats lost in the maze.
Inside Long-Term Capital, the collapse is understood as a two-stage affair. First came the market panic by big Wall Street firms that made many of the same bets as Long-Term Capital. Then came a kind of social panic. Word spread that Long-Term was weakened. That weakness, Meriwether and the others say, very quickly became an opportunity for others to prey upon.
"The few things we had on that the market didn't know about came back quickly," Meriwether says. "It was the trades that the market knew we had on that caused us trouble." Richard Leahy, the Long-Term partner, says: "It ceased to feel like people were liquidating positions similar to ours. All of a sudden they were liquidating our positions."
It was this second stage of his demise that clearly ate at Meriwether. As our conversation drifted toward the subject his unease turned to bitterness and his phrasing became so tortured as to be as useless to me as he hoped it would be.
By the end of August, Long-Term Capital badly needed $1.5 billion. The trades that the strategists had made lost money, but they would recover their losses if they could obtain the capital to finance them. If Long-Term Capital could ride out the panic, Meriwether figured, it would make more money than ever. "We dreamed of the day when we'd have opportunities like this," Eric Rosenfeld says.
Meriwether called people rich enough to pony up the entire sum Long-Term Capital needed, among them one of America's richest men, Warren Buffett. Buffett was interested in the portfolio but not in Meriwether. "Buffett cares about one thing," one of the fund's partners says. "His reputation. Because of the Salomon scandal he couldn't be seen to be in business with J.M."
Meriwether also called Jon Corzine at Goldman, Sachs. Goldman, Sachs agreed to find the capital but in exchange wanted more than a fee. It wanted to own half of Long-Term Capital. Meriwether and Corzine had been aware of each other's existence since the late 60's, when they studied together at the University of Chicago. For 15 years, Corzine had done his best to figure out what Meriwether was up to. This was his chance to know for all time.
What neither man realized was that the game of saving Long-Term Capital was over before it began. First came the rumors. Traders at other firms began to use "Long-Term" the way weathermen used El Nio -- to justify whatever they needed to justify. Lou Dobbs appeared on CNN to explain that certain stocks were falling because Long-Term Capital was selling them. The young professors, who had not been selling stocks or anything else, watched in wonder. International Financing Review, the most widely read trade sheet in the bond markets, wrote that Long-Term Capital was sitting on $10 billion of floating rate notes. The young professors say they owned no such things.
The rumors that contained some truth were more damaging, of course, and now the truth was out there, available to Goldman, Sachs and others. Every day someone would publish something about them that left them more exposed than ever to those who might prey on them. "Every rumor about the size of our positions was always double the truth," Richard Leahy says. "Except the rumor about our position in Danish mortgages. That was 10 times what we actually had."
Banks that called up to bid on Long-Term Capital's positions would say things like, "We can't buy all of what we've heard you've got, but we'd like a piece." They would then ask to buy twice what Long-Term actually owned. According to the young professors, Wall Street firms began to get out in front of the fund's positions: if a trader elsewhere knew Long-Term Capital owned a lot of interest-rate swap, for instance, he sold interest-rate swaps, and further weakened Long-Term's hand. The idea was that if you put enough pressure on Long-Term Capital, Long-Term Capital would be forced to sell in a panic and you would reap the profits. And even if Long-Term didn't break, the mere rumor that it had problems might lead to a windfall for you. A Goldman, Sachs partner had been heard to brag that the firm had made a fortune in this manner. A spokesman for Goldman, Sachs said that the idea that the firm had made money from Long-Term Capital's distress was "absurd" in light of how much Goldman, Sachs had lost making exactly the same bets.
When one player in any market is sufficiently big and weak, its size and weakness are reason enough for the market to destroy it. The rumors about Long-Term Capital led to further losses, which in turn led to more rumors. The losses mounted, but strangely. The losses in August were part of a market rout. The losses that continued into September were part of a rout of Long-Term Capital.
The trouble led the New York Federal Reserve to help bring together a consortium of Wall Street banks and brokerage houses to come to the rescue. Goldman, Sachs, a consortium member, was dissatisfied to find itself one of many. It had hoped to control Long-Term, and to acquire the wisdom of the young professors. And so before the consortium finalized its plans, Goldman, Sachs turned up with Warren Buffet and about $4 billion in an attempt to buy the firm.
Long-Term Capital was caught in a squeeze -- for that's what it's called, and that's what it felt like to Meriwether and the young professors. On the very day, Sept. 21, that Warren Buffett and Goldman, Sachs turned up, Long-Term Capital, for the second time in its history, lost more than $500 million in one day. Half of that was lost in its second disastrous trade, a short position in five-year equity options. Essentially, it had sold insurance against violent movement in the stock market. The price it received for the insurance was so high that the bet would almost certainly be hugely profitable -- in the long run. But on Sept. 21, the short run took over, in a new and more venal fashion. Meriwether received phone calls from J.P. Morgan and Union Bank of Switzerland telling him that the options he had sold short were rocketing up in thin markets thanks to bids from American International Group, the U.S. insurance company. The brokers were outraged on Meriwether's behalf, as they assumed that A.I.G. was trying to profit from Long-Term's weakness. A spokesman for A.I.G. declined to comment.
But what the people who called Meriwether did not know was that at just that moment, A.I.G. was, along with Warren Buffett and Goldman, Sachs, negotiating to purchase Long-Term Capital's portfolio. But one consequence of A.I.G.'s activities was to pressure Meriwether to sell his company and its portfolio cheaply. Meriwether is convinced that A.I.G. was trying to put him out of business, a contention A.I.G. would also not comment on.
It is interesting to look over the clippings and see the role played by the media in this stage of Long-Term Capital's demise. After the firm entered negotiations to sell its portfolio through Goldman, Sachs, rumors about its holdings trickled out in the financial press, exposing Long-Term Capital's trading positions to outside attack. After negotiations among the fund and Goldman, Sachs and Warren Buffett broke down, a new wave of articles appeared. Carol Loomis wrote in Fortune, "Warren Buffett is a longtime friend of this writer," and then went on to tell the following tale -- that Long-Term Capital had refused his bid because John Meriwether didn't like his terms. The story played down the fact that William McDonough, president of the New York Fed, came to the same conclusions as Meriwether -- different from Buffett's -- that the fund could not legally sell without consulting its investors, which Buffett had given them less than an hour to do. Buffett declined to comment.
The Fortune story and others like it, the Long-Term strategists maintain, created even more pressure on Meriwether to sell the next time someone made a low bid. Meriwether also says that the A.I.G. trade was "minor compared to some of the things we saw." But he declined to say what these things were, and no wonder. On Sept. 23, a consortium of 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage houses gave Long-Term $3.6 billion, in exchange for 90 percent of the firm. Some of the things Meriwether "saw" could well have been perpetrated by some of the very Wall Street firms that now own his firm, and that he now works for.
Meriwether did say this about his treatment at the hands of the big Wall Street firms: "I like the way Victor" -- Haghani, one of the young professors --"put it: The hurricane is not more or less likely to hit because more hurricane insurance has been written. In the financial markets this is not true. The more people write financial insurance, the more likely it is that a disaster will happen, because the people who know you have sold the insurance can make it happen. So you have to monitor what other people are doing."
 
The End of the World as Long-Term Capital Knew It
In October 1987, the markets took power from people who traded with their intuition and bestowed it upon people who traded with their formulas. In August 1998, the markets took power away from people with formulas who hoped to remain detached from the marketplace and bestowed it upon the large Wall Street firms that oversee the marketplace. These firms will do pretty much exactly the same complicated trading as Long-Term Capital, perhaps in a slightly watered down form, once the whiff of scandal vanishes from the activity. Indeed, the global economy now expects it of them. Without it, risk would be poorly priced and capital poorly distributed. And in any case, Long-Term Capital's portfolio has already turned around, rising almost 10 percent by year's end.
The events of August and September 1998 have left Meriwether and the young professors exactly where they did not want to be, working for the large Wall Street firms. Back is the messy company politics they thought they had left behind. In place of the hundreds of millions they made each year for themselves they are now paid salaries of $250,000, or the wage of a beginning bond trader without a bonus. In the best-case scenario, their portfolio will make the fortune they predicted for it, they will convince the money culture that they are still worth having around and they will find other rich people to replace their current owners. In the worst and more likely case, they are finished as a group.
It is interesting to see how people respond when the assumptions that get them out of bed in the morning are declared ridiculous by the wider world. There is obviously now a very great social pressure on the young professors to abandon the thing they cherish most, their hyperrational view of the world. In the coming months, they could very well be hauled before some Congressional committee to explain their role in jeopardizing the free world. Oddly, the question that occupies them is not whether to push on with their models of financial behavior but how to improve the models in light of what has happened to them. "The solution," Robert Merton says, "is not to go back to the old, simple methods. That never works. You can't go back. The world has changed. And the solution is greater complexity."
"It's like there are two businesses here," Eric Rosenfeld says, "the old business, which works fine under normal conditions, and this stand-by business, when the world goes mad. And for that, you either need to buy insurance or have a pool of stand-by capital to take advantage of these opportunities."
The money culture has never been very good at distinguishing bad character from bad judgment and bad judgment from bad luck, and in the complex case of Long-Term Capital it has been worse than usual. Reputations are ruined, fortunes lost and precious ideas simultaneously ridiculed and stolen. So maybe the most interesting thing to happen since Long-Term got itself into trouble is what has not happened. There have been none of the venal self-preservatory acts that often accompany great financial collapse. No one has pointed a finger at his partners. Already several partners have declined offers to work for other fund managers or big Wall Street firms.
Yet for the first time in 15 years, John Meriwether and his young professors cannot steer toward some moment of certainty in the distant future. What they hope will happen next is no longer the same as what they think will happen next. Which is to say that they are, for the first time in 15 years, just like everyone else.

New York Lends a Hand To Ailing 'Eco' Cleaners

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
LAST November, the TriBeCa Ecomat, a cleaner that shunned a potentially carcinogenic solvent used by most dry-cleaning companies, closed its doors. It was a quiet death for a shop that had had a noisy birth.
In June 1997, the outlet had opened to the cheers of Harvey Keitel, the actor, and his neighbors at 39 North Moore Street. They had fought for more than a year to evict a traditional dry cleaner from the ground floor of their building. And at the beginning, many people scurried to try the new "green" cleaner. 
 But when the shop, which used a water-and-detergent method called wet cleaning, started shrinking clothes, patrons quickly lost confidence. Traditional cleaners argue that water will ruin some clothes and that it is simply too labor-intensive for many fabrics. But environmental advocates say that management problems and not problems of the alternative cleaning method led to the demise of the Ecomat.
Whatever the reason, the woes of the TriBeCa shop are not unique. Ecomat is the major operator of "green" dry cleaners in the city. Of its five shops here -- it also has three outside the city -- two have closed and two are open but up for sale. The stock price of Ecomat, which is based in Mamaroneck, N.Y., was $4.12 at its 12-month high; recently it has been trading for just a few cents..
Troy Morano, Ecomat's director of operations, acknowledged particular problems with the TriBeCa store, but said that the company was reorganizing and that wet-cleaning technology had improved.
In any event, state and local officials now hope to help Ecomat and other entrepreneurs give a lift to the nascent green dry-cleaning industry in New York City. Empire State Development, a state agency, will award $200,000 in federally financed grants to existing dry cleaners to help buy washing machines that use alternatives to perchloroethylene, or perc, the suspected carcinogen and the most common dry-cleaning solvent. The grants will be awarded to between 20 and 30 cleaners and will pay for 20 percent of the cost of a new machine, up to $10,000. Last week, the agency began a series of workshops to explain how to apply for the grants by the April 30 deadline.
Grant recipients can buy computer-controlled wet-cleaning equipment, but officials also want to award grants for three new methods that use hydrocarbons, glycol ether or carbon dioxide instead of perc. The agency will also help the cleaners obtain loans for the rest of the machines' cost.
A new wet-cleaning machine starts at $18,000; a hydrocarbon one costs $50,000.
"This will help jump-start the use of alternative technology," said a spokeswoman for Empire State Development, Maura Z. Gallucci. Cleaners who win the grants must open their shops and records to state officials, who hope to learn if the new methods cut pollution, satisfy customers and make economic sense to cleaners.
Perc is a powerful degreaser, which makes it popular with cleaners. But studies of humans and animals have linked perc -- one of the pollutants at the heart of the legal battle in Jonathan Harr's book "A Civil Action" -- to cancer and neurological damage. Dry-cleaning workers are at the greatest risk from perc, but studies have also shown increased risks to people who live above dry-cleaning establishments, like Mr. Keitel and his neighbors.
The situation is particularly troubling for New York City, which has 933 dry-cleaning shops operating inside residential buildings, according to the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Chicago, the American city with the second-highest number of dry cleaners situated in apartment buildings, has only 75, said David DeRosa, who leads Greenpeace's Toxic Campaign Dry Cleaning Project.
But there are problems as well with alternatives to perc, said Bill Seitz, the executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association. City officials have not yet approved glycol ether or hydrocarbon machines, and may require cleaners using them to install expensive safety equipment, he said. The carbon-dioxide machines will not need such safety measures, but they raise practicality issues. The ones made by Micell Technologies cost $150,000 and weigh 10 tons, and only a limited number of them will be available this year.
Wet-cleaning machines require no special environmental permits and are available now. Wayne Edelman, president of Meurice Garment Care, which has two Manhattan locations, cleans up to 30 percent of the clothes at his shop with wet-cleaning methods in the summer, when customers bring in less wool. Many stains, like sweat, wine and food, come out best with wet cleaning, he said, but cleaning wool and some other fabrics with water is too difficult.
"Wet cleaning is a great tool," Mr. Edelman said. "But it's just like a plumber who comes to fix your sink. He has more than just a screwdriver in his tool box." For this reason, he believes that wet-clean-only shops will have difficulty succeeding.
Robert Morrison, who led the fight at the North Moore Street building, argues that perc is as dangerous to people's health as lead paint or asbestos. Mr. Morrison said he would rather have shrunken clothes than cancer. Nevertheless, after Ecomat shrank some of his clothes, he returned to a traditional dry cleaner.
Although it has yet to turn a profit, the Ecomat outlet in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has a damage claim rate of 2 percent, below the industry standard of 4 percent, said Aaron Shiffman, director of economic development for the Fifth Avenue Committee, a nonprofit community development group that runs the store on a franchise from Ecomat. The store turns away just 2 percent of customer clothes as uncleanable by its methods, Mr. Shiffman said.
"We take a little longer, but your garment won't shrink," Mr. Shiffman said.
State rules on the use of perc, including a requirement that many shops install vapor barriers, have prompted some traditional dry cleaners to look at the alternatives, state officials said. But if the regulations are the stick, the grant program is the carrot.
"This project isn't just about giving grants," said Tria Case, director of Empire State Development's Office of Environmental Business Services. "It's about figuring out what the alternatives are and figuring out how they work and getting them through the regulatory process."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about dry cleaners who use solvents other than perchloroethylene, a suspected carcinogen, misstated the application deadline for finanical aid for cleaners to buy machines that use alternatives. It is April 1, not April 30.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Art Worth More Than Money Enriches Lincoln Center

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Art and money, money and art. The two are forever linked, but it is still unfortunate when they become virtually synonymous. Right now the Jasper Johns painting "Numbers, 1964," which has hung quietly in a raised area at one end of the lobby of the New York State Theater since it opened in 1964, seems to look like little more than cold cash to some people. But the Johns is a living work of art, a claim that can't be made for all the sculptures and murals in the buildings and around the plaza at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
The center has received offers of more than $15 million for the Johns painting, and the Lincoln Center board has at least initially endorsed the idea of a sale. A meeting is scheduled for today to discuss the disposition of the work. 
 The proposal for the sale of the painting, most of whose proceeds would go to repairing Lincoln Center's aging buildings, has stirred up heavy opposition. Aside from the moral and legal issues the prospect has raised, it also prompts some historic and esthetic questions. Among them are how all the art at the New York State Theater came to be where it is, its relationship to the center, its meaning and quality as art (as opposed to merchandise or public decoration) and the entwined histories of the theater's principal tenants, the New York City Ballet, which opposes the sale, and the New York City Opera, which endorses it.
Works of contemporary public art are always a gamble, and most are eminently forgettable. The Johns painting's current predicament suggests that if a work of public art should turn out to be of lasting historical importance and its owner is facing financial need, it is vulnerable to sale. By this rule, the only public artworks that stay put are either mediocre or such highly visible symbols of communal pride that selling them would be unthinkable. This is why, for example, Italy does not start selling off bits of the Roman Forum whenever it has a financial crisis.
The Johns is particularly vulnerable to sale among the works of art at Lincoln Center. It is one of the most historically important and most portable, and it is not strongly associated in the public's mind with Lincoln Center, unlike the enormous Chagall murals at the Metropolitan Opera House or the Henry Moore sculpture that occupies the reflecting pool in front of the Vivian Beaumont Theater.
The Johns is an unusual kind of public art: it dominates through reticence and self-containment, inviting private contemplation. While it was being made, Philip Johnson, the chief architect of the New York State Theater, described it as "the subtlest monument of our time." It is the only public commission of an artist famous for turning public signs -- targets, flags, the alphabet, numbers 0 through 9 -- into a private language.
It was somewhat out of character for Johns to accept a public commission in the first place. (He has never done another, although he says he has never been asked.) His willingness to do it undoubtedly reflects his friendship with Mr. Johnson, who purchased works for his own collection and for the Museum of Modern Art from Mr. Johns's legendary first one-man show, at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1958.
Measuring 9 by 7 feet, "Numbers, 1964" is a broad vertical rectangle calculated to hold the low wide wall it hangs on. Its glowing metallic surface makes its presence felt a long way off. This is because the numbers, the grid and the brush strokes are all considerably larger than in any other of Johns's gridded number paintings, creating an expanded version of his characteristically intimate, elegantly worked surface.
The work is not without some typically subversive Johnsian secrets. The artist used the length of the foot of his friend Merce Cunningham to determine the unit size of the grid, insinuating a symbol for a younger, less-established, more radical choreographer into the grand new house of Balanchine.
Barely visible in the work's lower left corner is the phrase "Cut-Rate," one of the collaged bits of newsprint typical of Johns's paintings. (Some people familiar with the work maintain that the phrase is actually part of an Andy Warhol silk screen that Mr. Johns incorporated into the surface.) This may have been a comment on the fact that the artist received only $12,000 for 'Numbers, 1964," a work that some experts feel would have brought $50,000 on the open market. Mr. Johns recently said that he had intended for the painting to have a metal frame but could not afford it; he made do with the rather flimsy wood frame that the work still has.
But the painting is site specific in larger, more historical and accessible ways, too, if one takes the trouble to look carefully.
Of all the buildings at Lincoln Center, the New York State Theater is the only one where the art still conveys any of the artistic vitality of the moment that the building came into being, and the core of this vitality is the Johns. The painting is where it is because despite differences in taste the two men primarily responsible for selecting the art -- Lincoln Kirstein, a founder of the New York City Ballet, and Mr. Johnson -- were as deeply involved with art as they were, respectively, with dance or architecture.
Much of the other art at Lincoln Center seems to have been pretty moribund from the start and is certainly irrelevant now. Walk across the plaza and see what graces the lobby of Avery Fisher Hall: large bronze sculptures by Dmitri Hadzi and Seymour Lipton, neither of whom was very significant even at the time they were selected. (They were donated by Mr. and Mrs. David Rockefeller.) Overhead at Avery Fisher, the handsome kinetic spangles of Richard Lippold have not held up too well either.
The Chagalls at the Met are lovable and cheerful but only faint echoes of a great talent that was at its height in the 1910's and 20's. How much better if Chagall had been commissioned to paint murals at the old Met, on Broadway at 39th Street, when he was in his prime (and if the building were still standing).
The art that Kirstein and Mr. Johnson chose, while not all of equal quality, forms an illuminating time capsule, reflecting their different sensibilities and sampling the waxing and waning artistic reputations of a significant transitional period in New York art. In addition to the work by Johns, who was quite prominent by 1964, Johnson commissioned works by Lee Bontecou, a widely admired sculptor of the time whose work has recently enjoyed a strong revival, and a black-and-white sculpture by Edward Higgins, then an emerging artist who has gone on to make small, subtly shaped blocks of stone, earning a small but loyal art world following.
The Higgins work, suggesting two horses back to back, adds an appropriate motif of movement and grace to the inner lobby of the theater. But the Bontecou, an elongated work made of gray and cream canvas sewn to a steel armature, is as specifically scaled to its site as the Johns, answering back to it from the opposite side of the lobby, albeit more aggressively. Resembling a car's ornate front fender, it bristles with mysterious openings suggestive of eyes, mouths or guns.
These three artworks (the Johns included) were commissioned through the Leo Castelli Gallery and represent an ascendant generation that would soon be divided into Pop and Minimalism. But artists and movements whose stars were fading or temporarily in eclipse are also represented, completing the time capsule and giving it a fascinating memento mori cast.
The decline of Abstract Expressionism is palpable in the fluttering forms of Reuben Nakian's bronze sculpture "Voyage to Crete" and the lacerated surfaces of a sculpture by the now forgotten Francesco Somaini. Jacques Lipchitz's "Birth of the Muses" conjures European modernism with a certain period-look vitality.
The other two works here are closely tied to Kirstein, who was an advocate of new art in his youth but was belligerently out of step with contemporary art by the early 60's and also loved to play favorites. Thus it was that one of his proteges, Yasuhide Kobashi, was invited to make the large, gold broochlike sculptures for the stairway landings at either end of the lobby.
Kirstein also saw to it that the building contained a work adapted from an artist he felt passionately about: the strange polystylist Elie Nadelman, whose big, buoyant sculptures of pairs of curvaceous circus women, carved in white marble, dominate the promenade above the lobby. They were enlarged from smaller works owned by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, to the consternation of many Nadelman admirers since the artist was dead and had never made anything so large.
But these demure towering kewpies create one of the most commanding indoor sculptural spectacles in New York City. And Nadelman's reputation has, like Bontecou's, risen dramatically in the last 20 years, confirming the foresight that Kirstein always, imperiously, seemed to claim for himself.
This bit of esthetic history underscores an interesting fact: The New York State Theater was built for the New York City Ballet. While it was expected that the City Opera would also become a tenant, it did not arrive until 1966 and played no part in the selection of the artworks. This may explain why the board of the opera company favors the sale, and the ballet's board does not.
In 1963, when Mr. Johns accepted the State Theater commission, he was 33. A few months earlier Newsweek had described him as "probably the most influential young painter in the world." Instead of being eminently forgettable, the work that he produced for the theater is merely eminent, one of the best works of 20th-century public art in the country.
It is also the centerpiece of a whole greater than the sum of its parts, a rich slice of New York cultural history fraught with talent, hubris and varying fortunes that has, miraculously, remained intact. Given the winds of philistinism that regularly blow through this town, the very existence of this ensemble is a bit of New York City dumb luck.

HEADLINE: GE Capital to Buy the Assets Of Failed Big Japanese Leaser

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
In one of the largest acquisitions by a foreign company so far in Japan, GE Capital Services said on Saturday that it was buying the leasing business of a company that collapsed with the Long-Term Credit Bank last fall.
In a deal that will meld Western management with Japanese business practices, GE Capital, based in Stamford, Conn., will acquire the multibillion-dollar assets of the Japan Leasing Corporation, but essentially no bad debts. 
 The acquisition comes as Japanese financial companies are trying to crawl out of the turmoil that has swept aside ailing companies and brought about mergers or alliances among many others.
Neither GE Capital, the financial services arm of the General Electric Company, nor Japan Leasing disclosed the financial terms of the deal. Japanese news reports said that the purchase price was between 700 billion and 800 billion yen, or roughly $6 billion to $7 billion. But GE Capital officials have said that the actual price range is $4 billion to $5 billion.
Under a broad revamping blueprint, Japan has been deregulating and liberalizing its financial industry, forcing companies to compete more rigorously. At the same time, recession has depressed the stock market, making it difficult for weak companies to survive on their own. Foreign companies are becoming a key source of capital and management expertise.
Japan's struggling banks are also about to receive an injection of public money that could reach $90 billion. In potentially the largest infusion, Fuji Bank, one of the giant, somewhat wobbly banks, was reported to be considering a request to the Government for nearly $9 billion, partly to finance the purchase of a 50 percent stake in a big trust bank, the Yasuda Trust and Banking Company.
For GE Capital, the Japan Leasing deal will help extend its reach in Asia, where it has traditionally been rather weak. At the beginning of the year, it was part of a consortium of investors that bought a large stake in a big South Korean bank, and the company apparently sees this as a good time to buy cheap assets and build a corporate presence in Asia.
GE Capital is expected to take on many of Japan Leasing's employees, including the top management, and it will also get a good franchise and a wide customer base.
The money that GE Capital pays to Japan Leasing will go toward paying off a portion of the $20 billion in debts on the company's books. Japan Leasing has bad debts from real estate loans that went sour when the economic bubble burst in the early 1990's.
It also was apparently saddled with a significant amount of the Long-Term Credit Bank's bad debts through a deal in which Long-Term Credit essentially lent Japan Leasing the money to buy the debts.
The acquisition of the leasing business, mostly equipment leases for the likes of cars and machinery, broadens the Japanese business of GE Capital, which has $7 billion in assets in this country. GE Capital has also bought an insurance business and a Japanese consumer finance unit, among other enterprises.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: MAN IN THE NEWS -- Paul Maritz;
Microsoft's Star Antitrust Witness

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
It is certain to be the hot seat. But Paul Maritz, who takes the witness stand this week as the highest-ranking Microsoft official scheduled to testify in the company's antitrust trial, is an executive known for a cool, sometimes prescient, analytic style.
In 1988, for example, he was placed in charge of the Microsoft Corporation's prickly partnership with I.B.M. in developing a new personal computer operating system, OS/2. 
 Soon after, Mr. Maritz had made up his mind about where things were headed. "My judgment," he recalled, "was that the sooner we blew it up, the better." Indeed, the companies did part ways in 1990.
Then there was the time in 1997, when two business school professors approached Microsoft about cooperating on a book about competition on the frontier of the information economy -- the Internet software business. The initial response was favorable, but Mr. Maritz, the senior executive in charge of most software development and marketing at Microsoft, was adamantly opposed.
Microsoft was engaged in a fierce competitive fight with the Netscape Communications Corporation, the early leader in the Internet browser market. And according to one E-mail message from Microsoft, Mr. Maritz was concerned about the "public relations implications" of a book that focused closely on the browser battle.
"Maritz foresaw the blowup over Netscape," said Michael Cusumano, a professor the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and co-author of "Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft."
Mr. Maritz may have foreseen trouble, but certainly not of the magnitude that Microsoft is now facing as the defendant in a sweeping Federal antitrust case. And when he takes the stand early this week, probably today, the stakes will be high -- particularly since Mr. Maritz was the executive who oversaw development of some of the main Microsoft products at issue in the trial.
"The key products in this case were directly under his control, and Paul Maritz knew exactly what was happening," said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School and the other author of "Competing on Internet Time," which has been cited in evidence by both the defense and the prosecution in the trial.
"Maritz is the person who executed the Internet strategy," Mr. Yoffie added. "He is the man."
Since the trial began in October, the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company have portrayed Microsoft as a bullying monopolist. Industry witnesses from Netscape, Intel, I.B.M., Intuit, Apple Computer and America Online have taken the stand to echo the Government's theme that Microsoft illegally used its market muscle to thwart the challenge posed by the Internet.
Now, it is Microsoft's turn to present its side of a series of meetings and deals with corporate rivals and partners beginning in 1995.
The 43-year-old Mr. Maritz is the first and most senior of nine Microsoft executives scheduled to take the stand with a single corporate objective: shred the Government's case.
His adversary in United States District Court in Washington will be David Boies, lead lawyer for the Justice Department and one of the nation's leading trial litigators. "I expect the temperature in the courtroom to go up this week," a Government lawyer said.
Mr. Maritz is regarded as the No. 3 executive at Microsoft, the person with the most responsibility after William H. Gates, the chairman, and Steven Ballmer, the president. As group vice president for platforms and applications, Mr. Maritz manages the making and marketing of Microsoft's Windows operating systems, its Office productivity programs (Word, Excel and Powerpoint) and its browsing software -- the corporate crown jewels and the products at the center of the Government's suit.
His E-mail messages are already in evidence in the case on matters like tightly integrating Microsoft's browser with its operating system, blunting the Netscape challenge, and dealing with other companies.
How to interpret Microsoft's Internet strategy, of course, is at the heart of the matter in the antitrust case. To Microsoft and its admirers, the company's plans and actions show a big corporation responding swiftly and successfully as few do to the rise of a new technology, embracing it and bringing it to users. To the Government and Microsoft's opponents, they are the anatomy of a crime.
The case against Microsoft is also an indictment of its corporate character -- "a culture of predation," according to Thomas Miller, the Iowa state attorney general.
So Mr. Maritz, in a sense, is Microsoft's lead character witness. People who have worked with Mr. Maritz describe him as brilliant both technically and in his business instincts. Though an intellectual peer of Mr. Gates and Mr. Ballmer, Mr. Maritz, they say, has a very different temperament -- quiet, reserved and deliberate.
"With Bill or Steve, you'll get an opinion within 60 seconds," a former Microsoft executive remarked. "With Paul, it can take a week."
Companies in the industry generally welcome dealing with Mr. Maritz as Microsoft's representative. "Not full of bluff and bluster," was how one executive described him. Another noted that "Maritz is not on the hothead list, and that's not a short list at Microsoft."
"Paul Maritz has never begun a conversation, as some others at Microsoft do, by saying we're Microsoft and we're doing to do whatever we want, said Gordon E. Eubanks Jr., president of the Symantec Corporation, a software company. "He is pragmatic, someone with tremendous gray matter, and I've always found him to be a man of genuine integrity."
"He should be a great character witness for Microsoft," added Mr. Eubanks, who opposes the Government's suit.
Mr. Maritz has come quite a distance in his rise to become a senior executive at the world's largest software company, with a personal wealth of more than $300 million. Born in Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia), he spent his early years on the family cattle ranch, where, he recalled, they did not have electricity 24 hours a day.
His family moved to South Africa when he was a teen-ager, and his first exposure to computing was by happenstance -- an experimental course in computer science at the University of Natal.
"I got bitten by the bug," Mr. Maritz recalled last week in an interview, which he agreed to under the condition that he would not discuss the court case. "I found that programming was an activity that could occupy your whole mind for long periods of time, and give you great satisfaction at the end of it because you have produced something."
After finishing college, Mr. Maritz went to London to find a job in the computer industry -- knocking on doors, his possessions in a backpack and staying at a 5 pound-a-night bed-and-breakfast. He landed a programming job with Burroughs and later became a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1981, he moved to Silicon Valley after being hired by Intel, where he worked for five years before joining Microsoft.
Microsoft has been called an "irony-free zone," but Mr. Maritz, given his British-influenced education, is known for a cutting, often self-deprecating sense of humor. Today, he says he admires the way I.B.M. has remade itself, after its travails of the early 1990's, but adding, "Of course, as Dr. Johnson said, there's nothing like the sight of the gallows to focus the mind."
His wife, Yaffa, a social services counselor, is not yet a conscript in the PC revolution. "It is a bit ironic to me that after all these years, and with six PC's in our house, she refuses to touch them," he remarked.
Mr. Maritz has cooperated on at least one book on Microsoft -- "Showstopper," a flattering 1994 chronicle of Microsoft's development of Windows NT, the company's operating system mainly for corporate users. In that book, by G. Pascal Zachary, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Maritz was depicted as "calm and sardonic," a "classic field general" who amazed people with his grasp of technical details.
But Mr. Maritz said in a recent E-mail exchange with a reporter that he had refused to cooperate with the book written by Mr. Cusumano and Mr. Yoffie because of the inevitable tendency of books to "sensationalize" events and that he thought it would prove to be "just another management headache, of which we have a sufficient supply."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
A Fair Trade To Find Peace: Trash for Vice

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
A statesman has finally emerged to make peace between New York City and Virginia. While politicians and journalists have been busy escalating the garbage war, Jim Spencer has come forth with a bold, diplomatic initiative.
Mr. Spencer, a columnist for The Daily Press in Newport News, Va., is one of the many Virginians offended by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent comment about their state's "reciprocal relationship" with New York. Virginians benefit from New York's cultural and financial institutions, the Mayor explained, and New Yorkers benefit by sending trash barges to landfills in rural Virginia. 
 "Besides theaters and banks," Mr. Spencer wrote in response, "New York has some crackerjack crack houses, much better than anything Virginia can offer. And despite Giuliani's attempt to clean up Times Square, his city has more whores and dirty-book stores. In the spirit of letting each place do what it does best, I say we round up all of our pushers, prostitutes and pornographers, stick 'em on a barge and float 'em up the Hudson River."
If this is the price of peace, how can we say no? The deal makes sense for both sides. Virginians could assuage their wounded pride without giving up the profits of their trash business, as their politicians threatened to do by outlawing barges from New York. And if Virginia's vice merchants moved north, New York's tourist industry would profit from the surge of Virginians desperate to continue practicing their favorite sins.
Virginia's exiled entrepreneurs might even reinvigorate New York's beleaguered vice industry, although this is unlikely. The most enterprising ones have already come here. Those determined to make it big -- to be the next Bob Guccione or Mayflower Madam or French Connection -- did not pursue their dreams by sticking around Newport News. The vice business has long benefited from the free flow of people and goods across state borders.
So does every other business, but for some reason politicians refuse to believe that's true for trash. They can't keep their hands off garbage even though they've repeatedly made a mess of things by interfering. It was public officials, after all, who built and ran the notorious old municipal dumps without linings or environmental safeguards. Then, when the dumps were forced to close by Federal regulations in the 1980's, politicians were sure that America faced a permanent shortage of landfill space, so they attacked the "garbage crisis" with recycling programs and incinerators.
But the politicians' alternatives have turned out to be embarrassingly expensive now that there's a glut of cheap space in new landfills with environmental safeguards. These privately operated landfills have been welcomed by rural communities that appreciate the economic benefits of interstate commerce in trash. Some critics argue for better enforcement of safety standards for the trucks and barges carrying trash, but that can be done without closing the border or having politicians decree how many tons of trash can enter their domain.
The chief garbage problem in need of politicians' attention is the one created by their overpriced incinerators and inefficient recycling programs. That ultimately may be why they're so upset by the brisk business at the landfills. The landfills' success raises an irritating question, as Mr. Spencer noted in his column.
"Why recycle?" he wrote. "If this state has enough landfill space to dispose of 1.6 million tons of New York City's solid waste each year, what am I doing digging up to my elbows in chicken bones, used Kleenex and grapefruit rinds to snag a No. 2 plastic jug that I inadvertently threw away?"
A similar question occurred to me several years ago, when I stood at a huge landfill in Charles City County, Va., and looked at recycling bins filled with cans and bottles painstakingly sorted by local residents. The landfill manager would have been happy to dump them in his mountain of trash, but he was required to pay a trucker to take them 20 miles away to a recycling center, which demanded a further fee to take the stuff off his hands.
I mentioned this story to Mr. Spencer during the course of our negotiations over his diplomatic initiative, and I suggested adding a sweetener to the Virginia-New York Garbage Peace Pact: Virginians, besides having the having the right to send New York bargeloads of vice merchants in exchange for garbage, would be freed of any responsibility to recycle.
"Sounds like a win-win to me," he said.

HEADLINE: Citing Drop in Welfare Rolls, Clinton to Seek Further Cuts

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.

 BODY:
President Clinton will announce on Monday that the number of people on welfare has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, and call for programs designed to help more recipients get to jobs and encourage more businesses to hire them.
The new figures from the Health and Human Services Department also show the dramatic declines in the welfare rolls of recent years are beginning to slow in certain states. 
 Nationally, just under 8 million people were on welfare at the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. But state officials and academics have long cautioned that, at some point, nearly all the people who can move off welfare with relative ease will have done so, leaving those with deeper problems like substance abuse, domestic violence and very little education.
"With welfare reform, the more you succeed, the harder the job becomes," said Don Winstead, who heads a Florida welfare program.
Mr. Clinton hopes to make that job easier. Administration officials said he will announce proposals included in the budget he will submit to Congress next month, including:
*$1 billion to help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients in high-poverty areas move to work. It continues a two-year-old program with a new requirement that 20 percent be used for low-income fathers.
*$430 million to give 75,000 housing vouchers that help people on welfare move closer to a new job.
*$150 million in transportation money to help people get to jobs, often in suburbs not served by public transportation.
*$530 million to extend the tax credit for businesses that hire people off welfare.
As he did in his State of the Union Message, the President will trumpet the falling welfare numbers on Monday.
"On a national basis, the caseload drop has been remarkably steady," said Bruce Reed, the President's chief domestic policy adviser.
But the figures show the drops in some states may have begun to slow in the final quarter of fiscal year 1998. In at least eight states, most of which have seen sharp drops since 1993, the reductions slowed to a trickle in July, August and September 1998.
"There's a difference between the first three quarters of the year and the last quarter of the year," said Michael Kharfen, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman.
State officials say they are preparing to serve welfare recipients with tougher problems, moving beyond the "work first" approach that helps recipients look for work and then pushes them to take any job they can find. Under that approach, states do not try to solve every problem or get people the education they may need. They simply try to find them jobs, reasoning that work experience will help them move up the economic ladder.
But that is not enough for everyone, state officials say.
"We're past the situation where someone comes in who may need a little bit of confidence building, who may need a brush-up on skills and may need a new battery for the car -- all things we can do," said John Garlinger of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. "We are left with the hard-core people."
Kansas has cut its welfare rolls by 62 percent since 1993, but by the end of the last fiscal year, sharp quarterly drops of 8 percent to 10 percent fell to just 1.7 percent.
Other states seeing drops include Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and North Carolina. New Mexico, after nearly cutting its rolls in half, experienced a 40 percent increase during 1998.
Seasonal variations may explain some changes. In Massachusetts, the rolls always stay higher near September, when the state gives clothing vouchers for every child on welfare.
But other states say they have begun to "bottom out."
"We knew that after that wave of families went off the rolls, the somewhat harder work would begin," said Joe Quinn, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. In Arkansas, the the number of welfare recipients fell just 2.7 percent in the last quarter after declining about 9 percent in previous quarters.
Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare reform for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said states were financially prepared to work with harder-to-serve people because of the money saved from fewer people getting checks.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Up 40.1% in 1998

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Japan's merchandise trade surplus with the world climbed 40.1 percent in 1998 after another jump in December from a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said today. It said Japan's surplus with the United States rose 33.4 percent in 1998 and in December alone rose 23 percent.
The Finance Ministry said the total December surplus rose 14.4 percent from a year earlier with exports dropping 12.2 percent but imports sliding further, down 21.7 percent. 
 President Clinton warned last week that the United States would not tolerate a continued surge in Japanese steel exports. The deputy United States trade representative, Richard Fisher, is to conduct trade talks in Tokyo.
Japan's steel industry and the Trade Ministry have predicted that steel exports this year would fall enough to please the United States, although Government officials stressed that this was only a forecast and not a policy pledge.
But Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has said the matter needs to be handled with care and that the United States trade deficit with Japan and China could become a problem in the future.

HEADLINE: As Arab League Urges Iraqis to Obey the U.N., They Walk Out of the Meeting

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
In an angry rupture with fellow Arabs, an Iraqi delegation withdrew from a high-level meeting here tonight as Arab foreign ministers were adopting a statement critical of Baghdad.
Baghdad hoped that fellow members of the 22-member Arab League would use the session to focus attention on Iraq's foes, in part by issuing an explicit condemnation of the air attacks last month on its territory by the United States and Britain. 
 Instead, the foreign ministers deliberated for another four and a half hours after the walkout but made no fundamental changes in the statement. It demands that Iraq renounce "provocations" against its neighbors and that it comply with all United Nations resolutions before economic sanctions could be lifted, Arab League officials said.
A member of the Iraqi delegation told reporters as he left the session that the resolution "did not comply with any of the Iraqi demands."
The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, blamed Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria for the anti-Iraq tone of the statement, which he called fruitless and negative.
At a news conference in a Cairo hotel, Mr. Sahaf warned that the United States might try to use the Arab stand as a pretext for new attacks on Iraq. But he insisted acidly that the criticism of Iraq did not represent any kind of broad Arab view, but only that of "the friends of America" among the Arabs.
The bitter outcome of the session was a fresh indication of just how much Iraq's relations with fellow Arabs have soured, particularly in recent weeks.
Most Arab leaders have opposed or expressed regret about the American-led attacks, which ended on Dec. 20. But they have not done so vehemently enough to satisfy Baghdad, prompting Iraq to respond with extraordinary venom, particularly toward Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
In a rambling speech earlier this month, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq called on Arab people to overthrow unspecified leaders who he suggested were little more than vassals of the United States.
Such attacks have not left most Arab governments in any mood to offer succor to Mr. Hussein, who Arab officials have begun in recent weeks to describe -- privately but increasingly -- as a ruler whose days should be numbered.
The walkout tonight by Iraqi officials shattered the hopes of Arab League officials that the session might somehow rebuild an illusion of Arab solidarity that was shattered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The meeting was prompted by the American-led air strikes last month. An Iraqi account said some Arab countries, including Libya and Morocco, had favored a resolution more favorable to Baghdad. But those countries were thwarted, the Iraqis said, by the Saudis and other Persian Gulf countries, the most hawkish among the Arabs in their anti-Iraqi views.
Mr. Sahaf, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, specifically accused Egypt and Syria of having been too timid to oppose the hard-line Saudi stand. The Iraqi walkout followed more than seven hours of meetings by 18 Arab foreign ministers and four other representatives.
In public statements today, some Arab leaders hewed to a longstanding theme, emphasizing solidarity with Iraqi civilians who have borne the brunt of the sanctions.
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria also criticized American policy, saying the only clear outcome of the four days of American strikes on Iraq last month had been "to aggravate the suffering of the Iraqi people."
But as measured by the Iraqi response, the main thrust of the Arab League statement appears to be sharply critical of Iraq, perhaps more than any similar declaration since the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
Among other things, Arab League officials said, the statement calls on Iraq to reaffirm its recognition of its borders with Kuwait. Iraq took that step in 1994, four years after invading its tiny neighbor, but in the last several weeks some prominent members of the Iraqi Parliament have urged a reversal.
The statement also demands that Iraq resolve the issue of Kuwaitis who are still considered missing or prisoners of war as a result of the invasion, the Arab League officials said.
On the question of United Nations sanctions, Iraq urged the Arab League to take the lead in the campaign for their lifting, perhaps even by unilaterally declaring them to be null and void.
But the Arab League officials said the statement was more cautious, calling for study of ways to lift the sanctions but saying they should remain in place until Iraq honored its obligations to the United Nations.

Olympic Scandal Is Not Cleansed by Sacrifice of Small Fry

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
THERE is a morbid law school joke that goes: "What do you call 500 lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?" Answer: "A good beginning."
The International Olympic Committee made a minimal effort to purge itself yesterday when a special committee voted to expel six delegates who had most blatantly taken gifts during the bidding process. Three other I.O.C. delegates have resigned and another has been chastised. 
 Nine departures out of 114 delegates are a start, a token, a gesture, a bit of ballast tossed overboard to keep the I.O.C.'s cushy little balloon afloat. But lightening the load by less than 10 percent is not going to help because the selection of all recent Olympic host cities is permanently tainted.
The Olympic motto -- "Swifter, Higher, Stronger" -- is now understood to be an auctioneer's chant in a corrupt bidding system that has allowed wealthy cities like Sydney, Australia, (and Nagano, Japan, and Salt Lake City) to grease delegates with lavish presents. I would call them bribes.
So far, the real sports in this Olympic scandal have been the Chinese. They have not yet made an international uproar about the very real prospect that Beijing was cheated out of being host to the 2000 Summer Games.
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, insisted yesterday in Lausanne, Switzerland, that he will remain in office, and he scoffed at the suggestion that he had some responsibility for this scandal, which took place right under his aristocratic nose. Where are Henry Hyde and Bob Barr when we really need them?
After yesterday's meeting, the I.O.C. announced it would implement new rules for the selection of the 2006 Winter Games, meaning that delegates will not be allowed to visit bidding cities and payoffs will not be permitted. It's a little late.
"We are not accusing any member of corruption or bribery, or suggesting that there was criminal conduct," said Richard Pound, the I.O.C. vice president from Montreal who led the inquiry into the current Salt Lake scandal, and who is one of the more forthright people in the I.O.C. "These members are guilty of breaking the oath they took and bringing the reputation of the I.O.C. into disrepute."
 Right. But there is more than a handful of delegates being caught with their hands in the caviar jar. The I.O.C. insults our intelligence and morality.
The Salt Lake scandal is at least tempered because everybody agrees that it was the best candidate for 2002. And nobody is ever going to find written proof why the 1998 Winter Games were awarded to a backwater Japanese town in a soupy climate, the closest to the equator that the Winter Games have ever been held. Officials in Nagano burned their records. Charming.
Sydney is the real loser. Cultured and beautiful and prosperous and gracious, Sydney won the 2000 Summer Games. At the time, it was cheap and easy for the I.O.C. to posture that the developed city in the democratic nation had paid its dues, and that Beijing should improve its economy and its air quality and its human-rights protection, and wait its turn.
Now it turns out the vote may have been bought. In what I find to be an astonishing mixture of candor and gall, the Australian Olympic Committee president, John Coates, has admitted giving $35,000 each to two African I.O.C. delegates in 1993 for their national sports programs, the night before Sydney defeated Beijing, 45-43.
"You have to create a sense of them having some obligation to you when they go into that room," Coates said the other day.
What is worse is that the I.O.C. vice president Kevan Gosper, one of the more cosmopolitan voices in the squalor of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games, is pushing for a quick vote of confidence for Sydney. Did I mention that Gosper is Australian?
Gosper said he saw nothing "sinister" in the $70,000 in payments, adding, "I think there is a good case for reviewing regulations and process." Coates, the payer of the $70,000 gifts, said the system "should be changed," adding that "it is a process that we went into with our eyes wide open." He admitted, "We didn't win it on the beauty of the city and the sporting facilities we had to offer, and we were never going to." What a cynical sentiment from a man running an Olympic organizing committee.
Meanwhile, Sydney wants a vote of confidence from the I.O.C. because the international corporate sponsors are itchy about their sugar water and their gas-guzzlers being tainted with a lingering scandal.
As of now, Samaranch and Gosper and Coates hold on to their positions. They are going to try to paint themselves as reformers. They need a visit from a posse of Olympic sponsors, who are not planning to write any more checks until this thing is cleaned up. Samaranch might not want to see a delegation from Beijing on his doorstep either. With any luck at all, the Beijing sports officials are boning up on that most delightful of Western concepts, the lawsuit.

State of Unreality

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Once a year I get invited to the White House for a quick brain rinse and mindset on the State of the Union. This time I wandered in the wrong West Wing door and saw what I was not supposed to.
There was a worried-looking Betty Currie in the corner of the reception room, flanked by two grim suits offering advice, presumably not about her secretarial duties. 
 So what if White House aides were reassuring her, or even going over questions she might be asked if House managers call her to testify? They've been doing that for a year and nobody objected.
Then what was all the fuss about the House managers' talking to Monica Lewinsky? They wanted to find out if she would clarify her sometimes ambiguous testimony before asking the Senate for permission to depose her under oath.
President Clinton, contrariwise, does not want to take the chance that Monica will reveal some damning detail of their cover story, or sharpen the conflicts in perjurious testimony about his passivity.
Here's the fair, unembarrassing, history-respecting solution: depose both Lewinsky and Currie privately. If important discoveries or clarifications are made under oath to resolve disputes, call them as public witnesses. If not, send both women home and move to the verdict. This is orderly trial procedure, not rocket science.
After the presumed acquittal, should there be a vote of censure? I think not. If individual senators voting to acquit want to get well with a disapproving portion of their constituencies, let them rise in their places and excoriate Clintonian behavior to their consciences' content, railing away into the night. Those who really want to get tough may even decline to sip acquittal champagne at the White House victory rally.
But impeachment and trial are censure aplenty. In 2001, Clinton may face perjury prosecution requiring a pardon from his successor; for now, however, he will have won the right to two more years of Federal housing.
That's all he'll win. His stratospheric job approval ratings reflect mainly today's great good times, and contrast sharply with the repugnance with which most Americans tell pollsters they view him as a person. Thus, the moaning of moralists, the hand-wringing of law-and-order types and the unhappiness of culturecampers at the artful Clinton's latest dodge are at least premature.
Instant analysts were bowled over by the very fact of his State of the Union address. But this giddy gallimaufry was an appeal to detach ourselves from reality.
After they gently ushered me out of the off-limits reception area, I joined other thumbsuckers in the Roosevelt Room. There, four young Clinton aides foresaw -- with unblinking certitude -- the next generation's ever-rising surpluses, and laid out how the money will be spent.
Wait. Only a few years ago, economic sages saw huge deficits "as far as the eye could see." Wrong. Even this year's budget estimates of surplus were tens of billions out of whack. Federal budget projections are near-Malthusian in their enormous error.
Yet here were these earnest guys, each preparing his resume in case their boss gets the heave-ho next week, assuring the world that U.S. Government profit in the next 15 years would equal exactly $4.5 trillion. And Senate numbers crunchers concur.
No recession; no medium-sized wars; no S.& L. bailouts; no pandemics; no stagflation; no tax cuts or spending increases by Congresses to come -- these memory-free central planners see nothing but linear loveliness and blue skies from now on.
After predicating the salvation of Social Security on this rosiest scenario, they carved out half a trillion of Maybeland money for the biggest income-redistribution scheme in history: "Universal Savings Accounts," a new entitlement named after its initials, in which a chunk of the lifelong earnings of workers enhance retirement "savings" of the poor.
Tinsel is falling to confuse our radar. Can this lamest-duck Administration commit the President after the President after this President to a State of the Union Message in 2015 married to the Clinton model?
No, the Era of Big Government will not return on the back of an Age of Absurd Expectations. Through our ups and downs, the people and not the tax collectors will decide how to spend our earnings.

HEADLINE: Pope's Visit to U.S. To Focus on Future Of Church Growth

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 18

 BODY:
When Pope John Paul II arrives in the United States on Jan. 26 for a two-day visit to St. Louis, his first major speech in that city will be at a rally of Roman Catholic youth, a group the Pope regards as vital to the church's future.
When he first visited this country 20 years ago, John Paul was a relatively vigorous 59, keeping a grueling schedule as he swept through the Northeast and Midwest. He returns as a historic figure, a prophet of the post-Communist world and one of the longest-reigning pontiffs in history, but also far more frail. 
 The church he will encounter here has been quieter politically than it was on his first visit and even in the 1980's, when the American bishops produced influential pastoral letters on war and peace and the nation's economy. Controversies among lay people now tend to show up in local parishes, as in Rochester last fall, when some Catholics objected to the removal of an outspoken liberal priest as their pastor.
But beneath the surface, the church is undergoing important shifts that will affect its future here well into the 21st century. Sociologists are finding that many young people are increasingly individualistic in their religious views and often divided from their elders on matters of sexuality.
"That's going to be the next Catholic constituency," said Dean R. Hoge, a professor of sociology at the Catholic University of America in Washington, who, with other academics, is conducting a study of young Catholic adults that has found evidence of sharp polarization between generations on issues like premarital sex and leadership possibilities for women in the church and society.
At the same time, the church is becoming more ethnically diverse as a result of immigration by Catholics from Asia and Latin America. They bring their own traditions and, in some cases, attitudes about church issues that sometimes differ from those of American-born Catholics.
"We're facing the many different kinds of people in our community that can't be categorized as just liberals and conservatives," said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of America, a Jesuit magazine. "We have to preach the Gospel to them and figure out how to make them one church."
Since 1979, the American Catholic population has grown through births to families here and immigration by a quarter, to 61.6 million people. The United States now has the world's third-largest Catholic population, after Brazil and Mexico.
Yet at the same time, the number of its priests has declined, the result of a plunge in seminary enrollments that began 30 years ago and has not been reversed.
The changes can be readily sensed here in the Archdiocese of New Orleans, which once encompassed a territory that included St. Louis, nearly 600 miles north of here.
Shortly before mass at Ignatius Chapel at Loyola University, a Jesuit school in the city's Uptown neighborhood, 10 undergraduates pulled chairs into a circle and leaned forward to speak avidly about what being Roman Catholic meant to them. One sophomore called the church her "centering point," while a freshman said it was her "foundation."
But on some hot-button issues, where church teachings meet social controversies, the young Catholics disagreed.
Six declared premarital sex to be always wrong, and six said homosexual activity was wrong, too, positions in keeping with church teaching. Asked whether women should be allowed to be priests, a subject the Vatican has ruled off-limits, the majority went the other way, six raising their hands to say yes, while the four others quietly looked on.
New Orleans also reflects the church's new ethnic diversity. While the city has long been home to a large African-American Catholic population, in recent years it has also been absorbing many immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia.
In a former marshland that has become a suburban neighborhood, sits the Mary, Queen of Vietnam parish, founded in 1983. During a midmorning Sunday mass, the white-walled sanctuary was packed with worshipers, its pews, built to seat 1,000, so full that ushers had to search for spots for latecomers. "It's typically this crowded," said Anh Cao, 31, a law student at Loyola.
Social issues seem to elicit a generally conservative response from younger parish members, as when the question of whether women should be ordained is raised with members of a youth choir.
"I have never thought of that," said Kim Phan, 24, a graduate student at the University of New Orleans. "I've never imagined a woman could be a priest."
Hieu Hoang, 22, a junior at Louisiana State University and a member of a parish women's group, the Daughters of Mary, offered a similar response.
Mr. Cao said Vietnamese Catholics strongly opposed abortion, in keeping with church teaching.
Such attitudes reflect the continuity of traditional Vietnamese Catholic values, said Joseph Trung, 32, a choir director and composer. "It comes from the family, it comes from the community," he said.
But sociologists are finding strong generational divisions in surveys nationwide on a variety of social issues.
A recent article in America magazine by Professor Hoge illustrated the trend with graphs from his study of younger Catholics that showed, among other things, that fewer than half of Catholics under age 30 believed homosexual activity was always or almost always wrong -- compared with a majority of those over 30 (and about three-quarters of those over 50) who thought it wrong.
One of Professor Hoge's associates in that study, William D. Dinges, a Catholic University associate professor of religion, said the study has found that 90 percent of young people confirmed in the church retain their Catholic identity, a far higher proportion than found in a similar study of young adult Presbyterians.
But, Professor Dinges said, many of the young Catholics in the study indicated that they regarded the church not as the bearer of absolute religious truths, but as a denominational "option," one form of Christianity among many.
R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame, said that such findings reveal the loss of an "embedded" Catholic worldview among the faithful. "I suppose what's been called radical individualism in American society is the biggest challenge to Catholic identity and to the Catholic church," he said.
But on a more positive note for the church, Professor Dinges said that the research also indicated that younger Catholics saw the church's sacraments and a commitment to social justice as vital to their religious identity.
A symbolic element of the Pope's visit will be his flight across the United States-Mexican border on a trip on which he will likely emphasize common concerns among North and South American Catholics.
Father Reese said the trip will provide the Pope his first opportunity to respond to Synod of America, a 1997 gathering in Rome of 200 bishops from the Western Hemisphere. Concerns voiced at that meeting included poverty, the debt burden in developing nations, the loss of Latin American Catholics to Pentecostal churches, and issues related to immigration.
The Pope will likely focus on "the question of new immigrants in the United States, which is a north-south issue," Father Reese said.
An estimated two million Hispanic immigrants entered the country in the early and mid-1990's, most of them Catholics. But within the American Catholic Church, other ethnic groups have grown, too, among them the Vietnamese.
Monsignor Dominic M. T. Luong, pastor of Mary, Queen of Vietnam, said the parish had about 3,000 members when it began in 1983. But now, he said, there are 17,000 Vietnamese Catholics in the New Orleans archdiocese.
He said the parish had recently contributed $7,000 to a fund for Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.
The local Vietnamese population, he said, had produced 31 priests and 47 of its young men and women are studying to become priests or nuns, at a time when a growing shortage of priests has meant that an ever-larger number of tasks -- administering parishes, working with immigrants and teaching youth in Catholic schools, is falling to lay people, said Mr. Appleby.
"That's a structural challenge that the church needs to take more seriously," he said.

Few Details Furnished By Utah Organizers

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 24

 BODY:
In the Wasatch Mountains that dominate the landscape here, snow has been falling almost nonstop the last few days, vividly illustrating the gifts of nature and meteorology that made this city appealing as a site for the Winter Olympics. And in the packed downtown meeting room where executives of the local Olympic organizing committee faced journalists from around the world today in a news conference about the latest developments in the unfolding Olympic scandal, the display was just as vivid of all the reasons the 2002 Winter Games are in crisis.
The officials, led by the committee's chairman, Robert Garff, and Frank Joklik, its acting president and chief executive, offered little new information and declined to answer many questions. They said that because of the various investigations under way here, they could not comment on the details of the report released by the International Olympic Committee today in Switzerland about how and when Olympic officials here paid I.O.C. delegates. 
 Both men also declined to say whether they believed the remedies announced by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C.'s president, would go far enough in addressing the problems of influence and greed that have been identified in how sites are selected for the Games, saying that that was for the I.O.C. to address. They also declined to say whether they thought Samaranch should step down.
"That's a matter for the I.O.C.," Garff said. "I refuse to be drawn into their internal politics."
And they declined to say whether the local committee might need to restructure itself, saying -- as they have for weeks -- that what happened here in the city's efforts to win I.O.C. members' votes to get the 2002 Olympics was the result of a few errant individuals whose behavior lapsed, and not of a structurally flawed system.
"We take responsibility for the actions of certain members of the former bid committee," Garff said, reading from a prepared statement. "Some of those actions taken were below the standards expected by this community. Therefore I reiterate our previously stated apology to the people of Utah."
The I.O.C.'s report, issued half a world away using information gleaned in part from the files of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, offers many new details about how the I.O.C. says its delegates were influenced by Salt Lake organizers, including dates and amounts paid. In an unfolding story in which many of the specific facts have remained vague or unconfirmed, the I.O.C. report offers one of the first documented glimpses into the process of delegate influence. It also hints that the payments and amounts were accounted for in financial records kept by the Salt Lake committee, and not paid from some loosely controlled cash fund.
One I.O.C. delegate who was expelled, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, received at least four payments from the Salt Lake committee, the I.O.C. report said, including one of $6,991 on Dec. 13, 1994; one of $3,000 on Sept. 15, 1993, and two of $2,500 on May 23, 1995. Another delegate, Jean-Claude Ganga from Congo Republic, opened an account with one of the largest local banks here, the First Security Bank, for receipt of his payments, the report said. Another delegate apparently preferred his payments to be regular -- $1,000 a month for seven months between late 1994 and mid-1995.
At the news conference here today, Joklik -- who resigned recently but remains until his successor is found -- said he had confidence that the problems from the payment scandal could and would be overcome, and that the financial and public relations implications -- including at least several major corporate sponsors that have recently become noncommittal about their economic participation in the Games -- will also ease as it becomes clear that the Olympic movement is serious about cleaning up its mess.
But exactly how far that cleanup will go here or, conversely, how widely the blame may be distributed remains unknown. Samaranch has said, for example, that any I.O.C. member on the international level who knew or should have known what was happening in the site-selection process will face sanctions; today he announced the ouster of six members and continuing investigations of three others. The officials here declined today to make that blanket promise. Garff said the question would have to await the independent ethics investigation report expected here within the next week.
"When that report is finished and in our hands, we will then take decisive action," he said.

HEADLINE: Constraints Over Budget Put Pataki in a Bind

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 24

 BODY:
After the fiscal drought of the early 1990's, the last two years have been a monsoon season for New York State. Lawmakers have responded to the flood of revenue with tax cuts, record increases in school spending, higher payments to pensioners and a numbingly long list of expensive pet projects, from a sports stadium in Brooklyn to bigger purses at Saratoga Raceway.
The economy and the state's revenues are still strong, but Gov. George E. Pataki is saying that the party is over. 
 He has pledged that the 1999-2000 budget he will propose Wednesday will increase spending by no more than the rate of inflation. He has declared the state's budget surplus off-limits to spending, saying that the estimated $2 billion or more must be preserved to pay for promised tax cuts.
And while he will propose $1 billion a year in new tax cuts, most of them would not take effect for two to three years.
But a close look at the state budget shows that because of commitments the state has already made, the Governor can meet these goals only by freezing or even cutting from most areas of the budget.
There is, of course, some wiggle room on definitions, and the proof awaits the release of his budget plan. But Mr. Pataki and his aides insist that he means precisely what he says.
Most economists predict that inflation will be about 2 percent for the coming year, and a 2 percent increase in the state's $71 billion budget would be $1.42 billion, less than one-third the increase approved last year.
Just two programs already written into law -- one to pay local school districts to reduce property taxes, and another to expand prekindergarten programs and lower elementary school class sizes -- commit the state to spending $1 billion more in the next fiscal year. Contracts with state employees have built-in salary increases that will cost even more.
"The real-world effect of staying under inflation is that you would be cutting," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. "We have spending commitments that can't be avoided, and the Governor's idea leaves nothing left over -- less than nothing -- for the rest of the budget. So we would have to cut everything else -- schools, health care, you name it."
If Mr. Pataki's budget proposal does that, independent fiscal analysts are sure to applaud, since they have long warned that the state could be headed for a crisis if it does not slow spending. But the Legislature will take an austerity budget as a declaration of war, lawmakers in both houses and parties say.
"I don't know how he thinks he's going to do all these things and not have a revolt on his hands," said Senator Martin Connor, leader of the Democratic minority.
The Governor's aides have been tight-lipped about just what his proposed budget will contain, but some confirm that he will call for some spending cuts, particularly in health care programs, that could translate to layoffs by the state, and more likely by hospitals and contractors that rely on state money.
Over the last two years, the Assembly, controlled by Democrats, and the Senate, run by Republicans, have become used to their budget battles being not about hardship, but about how to split up the bounty of the nation's thriving economy and Wall Street's boom.
As the state ran up record surpluses in the last two years, the Governor and the Legislature eagerly spent the dividends, increasing state spending 13 percent, after Mr. Pataki had held it essentially flat in his first two years. Last year's 8 percent budget increase, as the Governor successfully sought re-election, was the largest since the mid-1980's.
Passing the budget is the main business of the Legislature, invariably setting the tone for the year's dealings with the Governor. Many lawmakers say that a nasty budget fight this year could make for an equally ill-tempered legislative session, making it harder to make deals in other important areas, like health care and criminal justice.
"If he really means this stuff about saving the surplus and keeping under inflation, he is going to have some real fights on his hands, and not just with Democrats," said a Republican state senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In years past, the Governor's proposed budget, significant as it was, could be regarded as no more than the opening posture in a long dance with the Legislature, leading to a negotiated settlement. But last year's move by the Senate and Assembly to draft a budget largely without Mr. Pataki's involvement gave him extraordinary freedom to reject their choices through his veto power, insuring that the final plan closely resembled his original.
Legislative leaders say last year's process is still their model, but no one in the Capitol professes to have a clue how it will play out this year.
Democrats have signaled that they will seek another big increase in school aid and will try to protect health care from cuts. The Senate Republicans are nearly as ardent as Assembly Democrats in supporting spending on schools and hospitals, the easiest way to bring state money to their districts, and they are bent on enacting an ambitious new round of tax cuts.
But lawmakers have already spent dividends that have not yet arrived. In the last two years, they locked into place tax cuts and spending programs that are to increase in size year after year, from a current worth of $1.3 billion a year to more than $6.8 billion in 2001-02, when they are fully implemented.
Experts in academia, on Wall Street, in private policy study groups and even within state government have warned that the pace is unsustainable. Mr. Pataki was stung by charges that last year's fat election-year budget meant he was no longer a fiscal conservative, a claim that ran counter to the image he was trying to build both in New York and nationally.
Now, he appears ready to heed some of that criticism, but as he ponders a bid for a spot on the Republican Presidential ticket in 2000, he must strike a difficult balance between the need to hold the state's finances together and the need to placate New Yorkers who expect a high level of government service.
The last time Mr. Pataki insisted on tightly restrained budgets, in 1995 and 1996, labor unions, advocacy groups and Democrats in the Legislature mounted a fierce public relations campaign against him. The campaign, which included television and radio advertisements, lowered the Governor's poll ratings, and he backed off some of his most Draconian proposals.
Some groups that were involved in that campaign said they were prepared for a rerun.
"There could be blood in the water," said a prominent labor leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "It won't be pretty."

HEADLINE: Who's Fiscally Responsible Now?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Chait; Jonathan Chait is a fellow at the New America Foundation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
No sooner had President Clinton unveiled his plan to save Social Security than it was savaged as big government run amok.
Republicans are reacting so hysterically precisely because the plan -- a solid proposal surrounded by poll-driven vacuities in his State of the Union address -- is not wild liberalism. Rather, it is fiscal conservatism -- what Republicans used to stand for before they invented supply-side economics -- devoted to progressive ends. 
 The gist of Mr. Clinton's proposal, remember, is not to spend the budget surplus but to save it. Three-quarters of the budget surplus would go to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which would save some of the money directly and use most of it to reduce the national debt. With the Government soaking up less private savings, more would be available for corporate investment. Most economists -- and especially conservative economists -- consider this the best way to boost economic productivity.
Indeed, Republicans do not dispute the conservative merits of debt reduction. Instead, they throw up their hands and moan that it is not realistic.
"Knowing the proclivities of democracy, and the Congress particularly," Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, sighed last week, "it's very unlikely that that will happen." But the Republicans, not least Mr. Archer, are the very ones who are insuring it won't happen with their insistence that the surplus go toward tax cuts instead. It is reminiscent of the protection racketeer who sadly warns that the neighborhood is a dangerous place when he's the one who's making it dangerous.
So Republicans aren't arguing against debt reduction on economic grounds. Instead, they say the budget surplus "belongs to the American people." But what does this mean? Mr. Clinton, after all, isn't planning on giving the surplus to foreigners or setting it on fire; he wants to put it toward an end that benefits the American economy as a whole.
The Republicans, by contrast, are making a distributional argument. They want the surplus to reduce income taxes, most of which are paid by the well off. Mr. Clinton's plan, then, is concerned with enlarging the size of the economic pie, while the Republicans are more interested in how to divide it up.
According to conservatives, the most dangerous part of the Clinton proposal is investing a portion the Social Security trust fund in stocks, so that, in the long run, the higher returns help keep the program solvent. As a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Kevin Hassett, put it, "If the Government owned all the equities, we wouldn't really be much different than the old Soviet Union." Really? The absence of free elections, the suppression of dissidents, the state-run economy, the furry hats -- all that in one seemingly innocuous accounting shift?
If the fearmongering is working, it's because it seems to make sense at first blush. Having the Government own shares of the private sector is indeed dangerous. But listen to what Mr. Clinton actually proposes to do.
He wants to take a small portion of the budget surplus and turn it over to the Social Security trust fund. The trust fund would give the money to an independent board, whose members would be insulated from political influence the same way members of the Federal Reserve are. They would hire private-sector fund managers to invest the money in passive index funds and forfeit all voting rights on those shares. Could future Congresses change the rules if they wanted to attach strings to the money? Sure, but they could do the same thing to the Federal Reserve -- a far more tempting target.
There may well be some flaws in this proposal that haven't come to light. But conservatives haven't even tried to figure out what these might be, preferring instead to dismiss it out of hand.
It's not hard to figure out why. Conservatives have never warmed to Social Security, particularly the way it redistributes wealth. Republicans thought Social Security reform would give them an opportunity to privatize the system. Their most politically potent argument was that a privatized system would allow individuals to enjoy the higher returns that the stock market historically yields. But if you can get those higher returns without privatizing, as Mr. Clinton suggests, then privatization loses its appeal to all but hard-core conservatives.
Congressional critics are making much of the fact that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, expressed his opposition to putting the trust fund in stocks. But Mr. Greenspan also said using the surplus for debt reduction -- the main element of the Clinton plan -- would be preferable to tax cuts. In truth, there is no reason to give special deference to Mr. Greenspan's views on budgets and taxes. He is responsible for monetary policy, on which we quite properly hang on his every word, but on other matters his thoughts should count for no more than those of any other conservative economist.
The political genius of Mr. Clinton's plan is that it marries good policy with good politics. This used to be what Republicans called responsible budgeting. How sad that they now see it as unacceptable.

HEADLINE: 3M Reports Drop Of 4.9% in Profit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the maker of more than 50,000 industrial and consumer products, said today that its fourth-quarter profits fell 4.9 percent.
Fourth-quarter earnings before a charge fell to $348 million, or 86 cents a diluted share, from $366 million, or 89 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 80 cents a share. 
 Revenue rose 1.9 percent, to $3.79 billion from $3.71 billion. 3M, widely viewed as an economic bellwether because of the diversity of its products and regional markets, gets more than half its revenue overseas. United States revenue rose 1 percent, to $1.77 billion. Overseas revenue rose 3 percent, to $2.01 billion.
In the fourth quarter, the company took a charge of $99 million for production improvements and $38 million to refinance the debt of its employee stock-ownership plan. The charges resulted in net income of $211 million, or 52 cents a share. There were no gains or charges in the period a year earlier.
Shares of 3M rose $3.8125 today, to $75.125.

Banana TalksWith Europe Turn Nasty U.S.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Prospects for a quick end to the increasingly acerbic trade row between the United States and the European Union over bananas faded today as a compromise was rejected and American efforts to move ahead with sanctions were blocked, at least temporarily.
After negotiations on Sunday, the two sides returned to the table for hours, breaking away from a scheduled meeting of the 133-member World Trade Organization to consider a compromise, but to no avail. 
 The United States argues that the big American fruit distributors Chiquita Brands International and the Dole Food Company are illegally restrained from selling Latin American-grown bananas in Europe. Backed by Latin American countries, Washington won a W.T.O. panel ruling in 1997 that European import regulations favored Caribbean nations, many of which were former European colonies. A revised European banana trade policy went into effect on Jan. 1, but the United States contends that it still violates international trade rules.
It says the European Union's failure to comply with the ruling sets off retaliatory measures.
The 15-nation European Union insists that its new regulations meet the 1997 panel's requirements. Its trade negotiator, Roderick Abbott, has called for a new panel to review compliance before any sanctions are approved. United States trade officials are seeking immediate approval for $520 million in sanctions against the European Union.
A compromise, offered by Renato Ruggiero, the head of the World Trade Organization, would have allowed the compliance-review panel to also rule on whether the proposed American sanctions were fair. Under trade organization rules, the sanctions must be equal to the amount of trade that American companies have lost from discriminatory banana imports.
When they failed to compromise, the two sides squared off in what was described as a "bad-tempered discussion" over the American request for approval of its sanctions. Two Caribbean banana-exporting countries, St. Lucia and Dominica, refused to go along and blocked the adoption of the agenda where the sanctions were to be discussed.
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, accused the European Union of taking the "extraordinary step of shutting down the work" of the trade organization to stave off punitive sanctions.
"Fortunately, we will have another opportunity tomorrow to see if the E.U. will reconsider this drastic step and permit the W.T.O. meeting to proceed," Ms. Barshefsky said in a statement from Washington. The blocked agenda will be the subject of a trade organization meeting on Tuesday.
Diplomats fear that the dispute could escalate into a trade war and jeopardize the organization. "This dispute deteriorates the whole W.T.O. system," said Rita Hayes, the chief United States delegate. "You can't pick and choose the rules you wanted to abide by."

American Express Net Up 7.5% in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 7.5 percent as card holders spent more on their cards and as its asset-management unit collected more fees from investors pouring money into mutual funds.
The travel and financial services company said its net income rose to $530 million, or $1.16 a diluted share, compared with $493 million, or $1.04 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. That met Wall Street's expectations. 
 Shares of American Express, which is based in New York, rose $3, to $101.50.
"They did a good job considering what's going on worldwide" with troubled foreign economies, said Thomas Facciola, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. "They're sticking to their knitting and doing what they do best."
Net income at the charge card and travel unit rose 16 percent, to a record $326 million, as the number of card holders rose and people spent more using their cards. Spending per card holder rose to $1,861, from $1,731 a year earlier, as the company increased the number of merchants that accept its cards and people took advantage of its rewards program.
Earnings at the financial advisers unit, historically the company's fastest-growing business, rose 14 percent, to $209 million, a record, as it increased assets under management. The unit offers mutual funds and other services to investors.

HEADLINE: For Couture, the Show Will Go On

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
Whether because of the economy, the euro, media hype, Bernard Arnault, an infusion of new money from Germany and the former Eastern Bloc, or just the same old let-them-eat-cake attitude, haute couture doesn't appear to be a glamorous dodo bird after all.
It was eight years ago -- July 1991, to be exact -- that Pierre Berge, the outspoken head of Yves Saint Laurent, stood before a small group of reporters in the emptied ballroom of the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris and memorably said: "Believe me, it's true when I tell you these are the last days for haute couture. Maybe not tomorrow or next month, but in 10 years it will be finished." 
 That, of course, was before anyone knew what to make of Mr. Arnault, the upstart chairman of the luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, who four years before Mr. Berge's dire prediction was managing his family's real estate holdings in New Rochelle, N.Y. That was before John Galliano, who ran through investors like a small child running through a candy shop, turned up at Dior in a George Brent mustache and set Paris on its ear with swooning romance. And that was before anyone had heard of the Lebanese-born Mouna al-Rashid, a big couture customer, or the Miller sisters or, for that matter, young France Goldman of Boca Raton, Fla., who was in the front row at all the major shows last week with her husband, David, and expected to order something from each of her four or five favorite houses.
One week after the conclusion of the semiannual showings of haute couture in Paris, reports of the death of this anachronistic and outrageously indulgent institution are exaggerated.
"Listen, this is a very different world," said John Rosecrans as he waited to go into the Dior show with his wife, Dodie, who had on a pencil-thin gray suit with a pair of black Manolo Blahnik monkey-fur boots. Mr. Rosecrans, who was in the toy and sporting goods business before selling to Mattel, says he comes to couture for its sense of refinement, not to mention the frenetic social scene. And he can still recall the first dress he picked out for his wife (a cerise Balenciaga gown) right after they were married 39 years ago. "There are a lot of people who enjoy spending money on clothes," he said. "I think it's a wonderful thing to do."
In good times or bad, couture has always been the domain of a few rich nomads -- titled Europeans, Arabian princesses, the socially registered -- who don't mind spending $20,000 for a little black dress. Even onlookers, like the actress Katherine Boorman, daughter of the director John Boorman, can be caught up in couture's elusiveness. "You're inspired," Ms. Boorman said before the Chanel show. "And that's thrilling enough.
Yet, while couture seems a curiously old-fashioned pursuit for avant-garde designers like Jean-Paul Gaultier and the Dutch-born Josephus Thimister, the clients themselves have also changed with the times.
"What's different is they have no time," said Joy Hendricks, director of couture sales at Chanel, sounding the lament of every women. "Either they don't want to come to Paris for two fittings, or they want their clothes sooner than they can be made." Giancarlo Giametti, the partner of Valentino, agreed. "The clients don't want to come to Rome," he said. "You don't think of the woman who goes to Le Cirque every day for lunch. That's finished." The upshot is that most big houses now keep a sales executive on the road most of the time. Another difference is that clients are buying fewer daytime looks -- those they evidently get from ready-to-wear designers -- and more evening and special occasion clothes, particularly for weddings. A few days before Alexander McQueen's spring show last week, Caroline Grouvel, the couture sales director at Givenchy, said that she had already booked three weddings from the collection, even though the clients had yet to see it. Last year, Christian Lacroix's workrooms produced clothes for 28 weddings, an extraordinary number considering a couture wedding gown costs at least $150,000 and most clients buy for the other members of the wedding as well.
Though the fashion press still fusses over clients who have social or royal pedigrees -- and looks askance at those in the front row who wear diamonds in the afternoon -- the truth is couture has always depended on new-money customers. "I hate this word 'new,' " Ms. Hendricks said, frowning. "I mean, there are new people coming along, new money. So what?" Today, customers come not from France, but from Brazil, Mexico, Germany and the United States. Nunzio Palamara, head of couture sales at Versace, says he has a German client who buys 25 to 50 pieces a season, which represents millions of dollars. Givenchy has a male customer who buys a couple of frocks every season -- for art, you understand.
That's one thing about the couture houses -- they don't discriminate. Money is money, whether it comes from ancient aristocrats or the daughters of Russian arms dealers. "Anyway, we're not the foreign office," Dior's press chief, Bernard Danillon de Cazella, said.
Mr. Berge, in his Paris office on the Avenue Marceau, agreed that new designers have brought an excitement to couture, but he hasn't changed his stance about its doomed future. "For me, there is only one new designer," he said. "It's Gaultier. You have other people, more or less, more or less" -- Mr. Berge rolled his eyes -- "that are a joke."
Mr. Berge, who has said that he would close the Saint Laurent couture house the day Mr. Saint Laurent retired, continued: "You have to understand, haute couture is not only for fashion shows. It is not only for two rich women who can buy a rich look. That is not the destiny of haute couture. The destiny is to help with the art of living. And my question today is: What is the art of life? I'm not blind. I can see how people in the streets dress. They don't care. They are miles and miles away from haute couture."
Nor does Mr. Berge buy the conventional wisdom that the publicity that couture generates for the house, and its other lines, is enough to justify its existence. He could be right. Mr. Danillon de Cazella of Dior may point with pride to his binders of press clippings, but has Mr. Galliano -- and his employer, LVMH -- really succeeded in exploiting the attention given to couture to sell ready-to-wear and perfume? Many fashion insiders say there is a gulf between what Mr. Galliano creates and what Dior's image is in the consumer's mind.
Indeed, there were signs last week of frustration in the LVMH ranks, with designers complaining about management's failure to market their creativity. "If they don't know what direction they want, how can I give it to them?" Mr. McQueen asked. Mr. Lacroix, too, sounded weary about some LVMH strategies. "A lot of money has been spent in the wrong ways," he said over a sandwich after his triumphant show. "They have very poor follow through."
Small wonder that designers like Mr. Thimister and the Dutch team of Viktor and Rolf, who showed a strangely wonderful Victorian silhouette, are choosing a different path. "We all realize now, the marginal people, that all this publicity and image has a fake value," Mr. Thimister said. "It's what the new generation is really fighting against. It's why things have become more personal and sensible."
Didier Grumbach, the new, well-respected president of the French federation that governs couture, sees a limitless future for the institution and would like to change the rules to open the door to more designers.
"It's absolutely the trend to buy something more and more specific," Mr. Grumbach said. "Fashion will go toward smaller categories of people and taste."
And strange as it must seem for designers like Mr. Thimister, who is 35 and came of age in the Belgian avante-garde, with no aspirations of empire building, the best way to express themselves is through the individuality of haute couture.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
After 23 Years, Justices Will Revisit Campaign Limits

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In a case that brings the debate over money and politics back to the Supreme Court's door, the Justices agreed today to decide whether the strict contribution limits the Court upheld for Federal elections 23 years ago are still constitutionally valid.
The issue reached the Court not in the context of the Federal law the Justices addressed then, in the Buckley v. Valeo decision, but as a challenge to a 1994 Missouri election law that incorporated the same limits of $1,000 per election. 
 In a Nov. 30 ruling, a Federal appeals court panel in St. Louis struck down the Missouri law on the ground that the limits were "so small that they run afoul of the Constitution by unnecessarily restricting protected First Amendment freedoms." Limits that made sense in 1976, when they were upheld by the Supreme Court in the Buckley case, have been so eroded by inflation as to stand in the way of "meaningful participation in protected political speech and association," the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said.
In one analysis in the case, the current value of $1,000 in 1976 dollars is $2,500. The Missouri limit has been adjusted for inflation under a state legislative formula, and was $1,075 when the appeals court struck it down; there are now no contribution limits in effect in the state.
Missouri told the Supreme Court that the appeals court had placed many similar state campaign laws in an intolerable constitutional limbo.
"It would be difficult to find an issue of greater national significance that both requires and warrants some measure of legal certainty," Jeremiah W. Nixon, Missouri's Attorney General, told the Court. The constitutionality of the Federal limits is also at stake, Mr. Nixon said.
While it is by no means certain, or perhaps not even likely, that the Justices will use this case as a vehicle for a broad revisiting of the Buckley decision, the prospect is there. Inexplicably, the Court indicated today that it would not hear the case until next fall, meaning that a decision might not come until a year or more from now. The state had filed its appeal with unusual speed, in less than two weeks rather than the allowable 90 days, in the hope that the Justices would be able to hear the case in April and decide it by the end of the current term in June. April is the last month during which the Justices hear arguments, and they have scheduled only 12 arguments for a calendar that can accommodate 24.
While accepting the state's appeal, Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, the Court took no action on a companion appeal that raised more directly the continued viability of Buckley v. Valeo.
This second case, filed by a member of the Missouri House of Representatives, asked the Court to decide "whether the analytic structure undergirding Buckley v. Valeo has become so confused and unwieldy as to call for reconsideration of the relationship between the First Amendment and content-neutral efforts to regulate the financing of political campaigns." (Bray v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-978)
The Buckley decision has come under intense criticism recently, not for its upholding of the Federal contribution limits, but for the other half of the decision, which equated campaign spending with political speech and struck down expenditure limits. Despite the criticism that the decision has made it impossible to regulate the flow of money into politics, the Court has not displayed much appetite for revisiting it.
In fact, the action today may reflect primarily the Court's sense of obligation to clarify the contribution issue. In a 1997 case from Kentucky, another Federal appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, upheld a $1,000 contribution limit against a similar challenge, and it is now clear that the judicial unanimity that has prevailed for more than two decades is beginning to fray.
The Eighth Circuit in the Missouri case subjected the state law to an analysis that differed considerably from the approach the Supreme Court took in the Buckley decision. The appeals court said a high level of proof was necessary -- "demonstrable evidence" of "genuine problems" from large political contributions -- to justify the limits. The Supreme Court in the Buckley decision accepted anecdotal evidence and said that the Government only had to prove that the problems were "not illusory."
There were also these other actions on an extremely busy day at the Court.
 
Congressional Power
Taking up an important question of Federal-state authority, the Court agreed to decide whether Congress had the authority to make states liable to suit in Federal court for violating the Federal law that bars age discrimination on the job. In a decision last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, refused to allow an age discrimination suit against Florida by current and former faculty members of two state universities. The Justices accepted appeals from both the plaintiffs (Kimel v. Florida, No. 98-791) and from the Federal Government, which supported them (U.S. v. Florida, No. 98-796).
 
Police Records
Accepting an appeal from the Los Angeles Police Department, the Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a California law under which various police records can be released to the public but may not be used for commercial purposes.
The law was challenged by a publishing service that provides names of people who have been arrested or who are victims of crime and sells the information to lawyers, insurance companies, driving schools and others. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled last year that the law violated the company's First Amendment right to commercial speech. The case is Los Angeles Police Department v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., No. 98-678.

HEADLINE: Talking Back to Greenspan

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich teaches economic and social policy at Brandeis and is writing a book on the future of work.

 BODY:
I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a governmental direction," Alan Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee last week, one day after President Clinton proposed investing a portion of Social Security funds in the stock market.
Mr. Greenspan was equally forthright in criticizing the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour from $5.15. "My own preference would be to lower it and, in fact, eliminate the minimum wage because I think that it does more damage than good," he told the committee. 
 Pundits are now declaring Mr. Clinton's stock plan to be in deep trouble, in large part because Mr. Greenspan opposes it. And a new cloud also hangs over the possibility of raising the minimum wage.
Rarely has the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board been so outspokenly critical of the White House. Rarely, in fact, has Mr. Greenspan been outspoken about much of anything.
The forcefulness of Mr. Greenspan's criticisms is especially peculiar in light of the unwritten -- yet inviolable -- rule that the President and his Administration must never criticize the policies of Mr. Greenspan. (As Secretary of Labor, I once had the temerity to suggest to a reporter that the Fed "might" pay a "bit" more attention to the unemployment rate when setting short-term interest rates -- and within an hour received a call from the then-Treasury Secretary strongly suggesting that I should be more circumspect.)
The Administration's rule of silence about the Fed is not a result of Mr. Greenspan's popularity with the public. Most Americans have no clear idea what he and his colleagues do. Nor is the rule invoked because Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have been perceptive enough or lucky enough in recent years to have kept the economy from overheating or overcooling. No one knows exactly why the economy is enjoying its longest peacetime recovery, but the Fed deserves credit for not messing it up.
In fact, the rule of silence was in place before the current recovery gained strength. It was there right from the start of the Clinton Administration. It was probably in place in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan first appointed Mr. Greenspan.
The truth is that the White House cannot criticize Mr. Greenspan because Wall Street would take any such criticism as a sign that the executive branch was not as serious as the Fed about preventing inflation. The Street's resulting "lack of confidence" would send interest rates up and stock and bond prices down.
I am not aware of any study that has verified this assumption, but that's beside the point. Like so much other lore surrounding the mysterious ways of our capital markets, it has its own prophetic power, simply because so many traders believe it, and, presumably, they are prepared to act upon it.
The result has been the muzzling of any discussion by the executive branch about monetary policy. This is doubly paradoxical because monetary policy is the only major remaining policy lever over jobs and wages -- of larger consequence than any Presidential proposal on Social Security or the minimum wage.
Decades ago, the economy could be nudged either by reducing short-term interest rates or by increasing net Federal spending, or both. But now the car has only one pedal. Fiscal policy is dead. Budgets have to be balanced. The President even wants to reduce the national debt.
So what might the President say, were he allowed to comment on Mr. Greenspan's policies with the same forthrightness that Mr. Greenspan has commented on the President's? I have no direct knowledge. (Wall Street can relax.) But here's one possibility: The President might say that Mr. Greenspan could do a great deal of good by reducing interest rates once again when he and his colleagues meet next week.
Even though short-term interest rates are three-quarters of a point lower than they were in September, there's room to lower them further. After all, inflation has now utterly vanished. It has gone largely because much of the rest of the world is in recession, but also because new information technologies have caused domestic competition to intensify so much that producers dare not raise prices. And most workers -- knowing how easily they can be replaced by technology or by global "outsourcing" were their wages to rise -- dare not demand raises.
On the other hand, consider the benefits of lower interest rates. A tighter labor market would induce employers around America to do what they have begun to do in places where unemployment has dropped below 3 percent. They are recruiting workers from central cities and from rural backwaters where joblessness continues to be relatively high, then training them and even paying them wages above the minimum.
Mr. Greenspan's forthrightness about the President's proposals also deserves a candid response.
If Mr. Greenspan does not believe the Government should try to extend the life of the Social Security trust fund by putting part of the proceeds into the stock market, he has another option. Were he and his colleagues to cut interest rates and thus reduce unemployment still further, more workers and their employers would pay into the trust fund. As a result, Social Security's day of reckoning would be delayed for years, or perhaps forever.
Likewise, if Mr. Greenspan opposes the minimum wage, let alone the prospect of raising it, he could cut interest rates and thus tighten the labor market further. That way, employers would be induced to pay people at the bottom a bit more. Presto. No need for a mandatory rise in the minimum wage.
The President's proposals are now open to public debate. Mr. Greenspan is free to criticize them, as is everyone else. Congress can ditch them, and may very well do so. That's the way democracy works. But the proposal that Mr. Greenspan makes to the Fed's Open Market Committee next week about what should happen to interest rates is not open to public debate. Not only is the President in effect barred from commenting, but Congress has no role to play. All Mr. Greenspan must do is convince a majority of the Fed that he's right.
Mr. Greenspan may be wise, but he's not always right. He, and the rest of us, need to keep that in mind.

HEADLINE: Ruling Favors Employers on Pension Gains

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Companies do not have to share surpluses in their pension plans with their workers, even if the workers contributed to the plans through money withheld from their paychecks, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously yesterday.
Pension experts on the employer side hailed the decision as either a great victory for management or a confirmation of established law. Those who represent workers said the decision showed how a 1974 Federal law intended to protect workers' benefits had been twisted into a tool to restrict those benefits while enriching corporations. 
 The decision came in a case involving Hughes Aircraft and its corporate successors: Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, and the Raytheon Company. Other companies that have been named in similar pension litigation include General Electric and Georgia-Pacific.
At issue was a type of defined-benefit, or traditional, pension plan in which both the company and its workers contribute money. About $60 billion of the $2 trillion in defined-benefit pension assets are in such contributory plans, pension experts said yesterday.
Money deducted from workers' pay provided about half of the contributions to the Hughes plan before 1986. It was then that the company stopped making contributions because investment gains had created a $1 billion surplus. Workers were required to contribute until 1991, when the company gave them the option of continuing their contributions or switching to a plan in which they made no contributions but stood to receive smaller benefits. The company also started using the surplus to finance pension benefits for new workers, who did not have to contribute to their pensions.
Five retired workers from Arizona sued in United States District Court in 1992, saying that because Hughes had made such extensive changes to the plan, it had been effectively terminated. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, when a plan with a surplus is terminated, workers get a share of the surplus. The workers figured that under a terminated plan their benefits would increase by as much as 25 percent, said their lawyer, Jerome Tauber of Manhattan.
Hughes said that as long as it paid the retirees the benefits they were promised it was free to use the surplus to reduce its pension expenses for other workers.
A Federal judge in Arizona threw out the lawsuit, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a trial should be held.
Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the Supreme Court opinion reversing the appellate court, said that the retirees "proceed on the erroneous assumption that they had an interest in the plan's surplus."
What the workers bought with their contributions, the Court held, was not a share of the pension plan's investment gains but a guarantee that they would earn a defined benefit based on their years of employment and their salaries.
The 1991 changes to the plan, Justice Thomas wrote, "did not affect the rights of pre-existing plan participants, and Hughes did not use the surplus for its own benefits."
Jay W. Waks, the senior pension partner at the Kaye Scholer law firm in Manhattan who represents companies in pension disputes, said the decision "is a sterling victory for employers who have overfunded their defined-benefit pension plans." The decision removes any doubt about the freedom of companies to use surplus pension assets as they deem best, he said.
Mark Ugoretz, president of the Erisa Industry Committee, a Washington-based trade organization, was more restrained, saying that the Court had "simply affirmed existing law that was understood by everybody except these plaintiffs and their lawyer."
He said that workers who contributed to the plan did not buy the right to bigger benefits if the plan achieved a surplus but rather "the guarantee that they would get paid their promised benefits even if we were in a deep depression."
He estimated that only 5 percent of defined-benefit plans run by individual companies ever had a requirement that workers contribute and that such plans are rare now. "Today a company that wants workers to contribute would probably have a 401 (k) plan," Mr. Ugoretz said. In 401 (k) plans, workers assume all investment risks.
Karen Ferguson, executive director of the Pension Rights Center, a workers' advocacy organization, said that the High Court had endorsed "one more corporate sleight of hand to siphon off pension plan surplus for corporate purposes instead of requiring that it be used for the employees, who by law are supposed to be the sole and exclusive beneficiaries."
She said the surplus represented, in part, inflated dollars that the workers should receive because their pension checks are in fixed amounts whose value has been eroded by inflation. "The decision is fundamentally unfair," she said.
Norman Stein, who teaches pension law at the University of Alabama, said, "This was a plan funded by the employees with their money, and to say that the employees don't have an interest in their own money is absurd."

HEADLINE: John Paul Tells Mexicans That Faith Must Overcome Corruption

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II bade farewell to Mexico today with a spiritual message aimed straight at the country's social and political ills.
Faith, he said, must help society, especially the peasants and indigenous peoples, to overcome "the corruption that permeates many institutions and many citizens." He called on the country to "root out drug trafficking, based on the lack of values, on the lure of easy gain and on youthful inexperience, to put an end to the violence that divides brothers and social classes." 
 The Pope addressed a fervent crowd at Aztec Stadium here in the last large public event of his trip to Mexico; he flies to the United States on Tuesday for an overnight visit to St. Louis, where he will meet President Clinton.
In the stadium, 120,000 people stomped, swayed and did the wave when the Popemobile entered. Hundreds of doves were released into the open sky shortly before the Pope was elevated by lift onto a rotating red podium. Outside, 100,000 more people lined sidewalks and climbed trees for a last glimpse. As the Pope sat on a white chair, slowly turning, two giant television screens broadcast satellite hook-ups with Catholics addressing him from six Latin countries and the United States.
In Mexico, the Pope tried to focus believers on the demands of their faith in the coming millennium. But his remarks also carried a strong political resonance in a country where corruption and economic inequity is entrenched and the Roman Catholic Church is increasingly outspoken about social and economic injustice.
After 70 years of fierce anti-clericalism, the Government recognized religious freedom in 1991 and restored diplomatic relations with the Vatican the next year. This visit by the Pope united millions of Catholics, but it also heightened tensions between church and state. Perhaps emboldened by the Pope's presence, the leader of Mexico's church, Norberto Cardinal Rivera Carrera, delivered what many here view as his sharpest critique of the country's leadership to date.
"People suffer and grow desperate because they see no imminent solution to their cries for justice, food, health care, well-remunerated work," he told the Pope at a Mass on Sunday that was attended by more than a million people. "Peace doesn't seem close enough, and sometimes they feel like a puppet, no longer manipulated by visible strings, but by remote control."
Mexican newspapers carried the Cardinal's remarks on their front pages. The leftist newspaper La Jornada described them as "an open outburst by the Catholic hierarchy into earthly affairs."
During his stay, the Pope did not refer to Chiapas, the state where Indians and leftist guerrillas are in rebellion against the Government.
But his comments in support of the poor and the indigenous peoples were seized on by the embattled Bishop of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz Garcia, as vindication of his work with Indians and poor people there. Conservatives have accused Bishop Ruiz, who acted as mediator between Indians and the Government until last year, of supporting the armed rebels.
The Pope tonight asked the young to make a Christian effort to improve society, saying, "You young people of Mexico and America must act so that the world, which one day will be entrusted to you, will be oriented toward God and so that political institutions, or scientific, financial or cultural ones, put themselves at the real service of man, without distinctions based on race or social class."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Gauges Return to Plus Column on Strong Earnings Reports

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr 

 BODY:
After meandering through much of the day, stocks closed higher, lifting major averages back into plus territory for the year.
Microsoft provided some early lift, opening more than 5 points higher after the software giant, which last week reported strong quarterly earnings, announced a 2-for-1 stock split. This is the eighth time the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., has split its shares since it went public in March 1986. Its last split was last Feb. 23, and as of Dec. 31, Microsoft had about 2.5 billion common shares outstanding. Shares of Microsoft closed up 5 5/8 at 161 7/8. 
 This helped push stocks higher, with the Nasdaq composite index finishing with a gain of 30.43 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,369.31.
Most other stocks, however, lagged behind until midafternoon, when selling seemed to dry up as investors digested the day's batch of mostly positive earnings reports.
"Good companies rallied here today," said Timothy J. Morris, a senior strategist at Bessemer Trust. "Nervousness about Latin America is being offset by good fundamentals here at home."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.65 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 9,203.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 8.79 points, to 1,233.98.
Several Dow components rose on earnings reports. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, was up 3 13/16, to 75 1/8, on the company's projection of faster growth this year.
AT&T reported fourth-quarter earnings on target with estimates but cautioned analysts to lower their expectations for the first quarter. It finished up 1 3/8 higher at 89 5/8.
American Express rose 3, to 101 1/2, and General Electric increased 2 5/8, to 100 1/2.
Shares of Berkshire Hathaway rose after it received a favorable recommendation from Paine Webber, which said the Omaha-based holding company might be "possibly the most-talked-about and the least-understood company in the world" and concluded that its shares were "significantly undervalued." Berkshire class A shares climbed 2,400, to 66,000, and the class B shares rose 55, to 2,130.
Despite the gains, there was a strong undercurrent of caution as Wall Street watched, among other things, the President's impeachment trial, high valuations and a sizable buildup of impending equity financing.
The pipeline of new issues -- initial public offerings and sales of additional shares by companies already market-tested -- is perhaps $30 billion, not counting billions more on the "shadow" calendar, said Michael W. Clark, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"The supply has caught up with the demand and the market is probably going to stall a bit here," Mr. Clark said. "It's going to be hard to get to the next level."
Internet stocks, the subject of frantic speculation of late and alarms that they could bring the whole market down, cooled a bit yesterday. Among the relative handful with big swings were Ebay, up 20 3/4, to 217 1/2, and Amazon.com down 10 5/8, to 112 3/8. Among computer issues, Gateway Inc. jumped 6 3/8, to 68 7/8, while I.B.M. gained 2 1/4, to 182.
Eli Lilly spurted 6, to 86 1/4, in a mixed drug group as Barr Laboratories agreed to drop two claims involving its generic version of Prozac, Lilly's big-selling antidepressant. Barr fell 2 3/4, to 40 7/8. Merck, which is halting work on its experimental antidepressant, eased 1 1/2, to 137 1/2.
Financial stocks were mostly higher, including Chase Manhattan up 2 9/16, to 74 7/16; Citigroup rose 1 5/8, to 53 1/4; Equitable climbed 5 5/16, to 65 7/16, and Bear Stearns rose 2, to 44 1/8.

Bond Prices Fall
By The Associated Press
Bond prices slipped yesterday as a rising stock market robbed United States Treasury securities of some of their appeal as a haven for investors.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 22/32, to 102. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.11 percent, from 5.07 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo. Bills	 	Price	98.912	97.836	High Rate	4.30%	4.28%	Investment Rate	4.41%	4.44%	Low Rate	4.25%	4.24%	Median Rate	4.29%	4.27%	Total applied for	$25,528,801	$25,657,093	Accepted	$11,280,922	$11,074,043	Noncompetitive	$1,243,065	$1,205,638

HEADLINE: Head to Head, Albright and Russia's Prime Minister Do Not See Eye to Eye

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Yevgeny M. Primakov and Madeleine K. Albright sat down to dinner tonight, nearly the 20th occasion that they have done so during the maturing of the relationship between a former university professor and a former spymaster.
The American Secretary of State and Russian Prime Minister talked for three hours in an intimate wood-paneled dining room in the White House -- the Government building here. They drank toasts, and when the subject turned to extremism in Russian politics, a troupe of two guitarists and a singer slipped in to enliven things. 
 One of the starkest points of the evening, as described by an American who took part, was Mr. Primakov's description of his recent trip to Siberia.
The Prime Minister talked of seeing bankrupt state enterprises and the disastrous results of failed Communist policies of the past. He made the implicit case, the participant said, that the United States should not abandon him, because he is the best man to deal with the problems.
"The message was, 'I have a big cleanup job and I'm doing the best I can,' " said the American official.
Mr. Primakov was striking at the core of the problem that now worries the United States about Russia. Of uppermost concern is a collapse of central power, a collapse that some in the Clinton Administration say appears to be happening even faster than anticipated.
A weakened Russia could threaten the United States in many ways -- including, officials say, increased leaks of nuclear materials, a turn toward authoritarianism and an inability to control uprisings in Russia's neighborhood.
For all the talk of a certain chemistry between Ms. Albright, 61, the former university professor, and Mr. Primakov, 69, the former director of the foreign intelligence service that replaced the K.G.B., there were two increasingly different views of the world at the table tonight.
Ms. Albright has reportedly described Mr. Primakov to colleagues this way: "He is what he was."
By that she apparently meant that Mr. Primakov's formative experiences as a Tass correspondent in the Middle East during the height of the cold war and his maneuvering and rise to the top of the Kremlin bureaucracy until the end of Communism left an indelible mark on him.
He continues to be suspicious of the intentions of the United States and wants to promote as much as possible the power of his country, which is now much less than it was.
Mr. Primakov, who was elevated from Foreign Minister last year, has repeatedly said in the last few months what he is reported to have said tonight: that the United States should back him because the alternatives are worse. In delivering that message he has also unmistakably telegraphed his resentment of American dominance.
"Primakov is not working to diminish American influence per se," said a Russian Foreign Ministry official. "But he is resentful of the American arrogance as it makes its foreign policy."
"He argues that the United States cannot act just as it sees fit," the official said, explaining a central theme of Mr. Primakov's foreign policy. "He sees the only way of maintaining Russian interests is to have strong international checks and balances at a time of Russian weakness."
In an interview with several American journalists last summer while he was still Foreign Minister, Mr. Primakov said he was miffed at what he saw as unfair portrayals of him in the American press that emphasized his former position as the head of the intelligence service.
He showed an ample knowledge of what was in the American press.
"It's not because I want your audience to like me," he said at the time, as he gave sound bites on the essence of his foreign policy. "I believe it's possible to combine a number of things. One, protect the national interests of Russia. Two, do it without slipping toward confrontation. Three, to develop relations with every country."
The sense of despair in Moscow about Russia's tumbling stature and economic disarray has transformed itself into explicit expressions of bitterness toward the United States.
For example, in an interview on Russian television tonight, Mr. Primakov's predecessor as Prime Minister, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a reformer who was thrown out of office by President Boris N. Yeltsin last August, made some unusually harsh comments about Washington.
Mr. Kiriyenko, who was a favorite leader of the Clinton Administration, said the United States should help the Russians develop their nuclear technology so that Russia could market peaceful technology for profit.
Instead, Mr. Kiriyenko asserted, the United States was asking the Russians to curb their nuclear technology and was offering food aid in return. In such a situation, the food would be good for "tomorrow," Mr. Kiriyenko said, but Russia would lose its valuable technology forever.
In her most contentious meeting today, Mrs. Albright met with the Communist Speaker of the Parliament, Gennadi Seleznyov, who asked pointed questions about why the United States had decided to plan a limited missile defense system.
In an interview earlier with reporters, Mr. Seleznyov said he believed that the step would postpone Moscow's ratification of Start II, the treaty that calls for cuts in nuclear weapons by the United States and Russia.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Voice Raised Against City Hall

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
LINDA BLYER is not the kind of person who fights City Hall. She is a former home economics teacher who speaks so softly people lean in to hear her. Her only previous encounter with city government was in 1976, when she was enlisted as a quilting instructor during the Bicentennial celebration.
"I'm embarrassed to admit it," she said last week, "but I'm not even interested in politics." 
 But late last month she began to understand the meaning of the maxim that all politics is local. That is when the city started slipping eviction notices under the door of Families First, a nonprofit child-care center that Ms. Blyer runs in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn.
The five-story building on Baltic Street, where Families First was founded more than 20 years ago, has become the hostage in a fierce political battle between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the local City Councilman, Stephen DiBrienza.
Angered by legislation sponsored by Mr. DiBrienza that limits the size of new shelters, the Mayor has vowed to place a homeless shelter in the building. To make room, Ms. Blyer's day-care center, an agency for the elderly, the local community board's office and a civic association must all pack up and leave their first-floor offices by Sunday.
And so Ms. Blyer -- who has been involved with the center since she first walked in 17 years ago with her son, Jonathan, who was 6 weeks old -- has stepped into what she describes as a distinctly uncomfortable role.
She voted for Mr. Giuliani in the last election and said she has considered him an effective Mayor.
But now she is speaking at rallies, denouncing him as petty and vindictive. Last Friday, she began her day at 6 in front of television cameras, pleading for him to change his mind. Later, she dug out boxes of documents in her tiny office to give to lawyers from Davis, Polk & Wardwell, who have volunteered to try to block Mr. Giuliani's action.
By early afternoon, striving to be heard over the cries of babies and the roar of a vacuum cleaner, Ms. Blyer was being interviewed again and was again tearing into the Mayor, albeit in her own decorous way.
"I'm just really angry," she said, her voice almost a whisper, "that he has the audacity to use revenge against somebody else to hurt people who don't have anything to do with this homeless shelter baloney."
(The Mayor's office referred calls about the issue yesterday to the city's Department of Homeless Services. Officials with the department declined to comment.)
Ms. Blyer said the child-care center helps about 1,000 families a year in the neighborhood, offering low-fee classes for parents and children. More than 20 parents a day drop by the center, to meet other parents and let their children play together.
If the center is forced to move, she said, it will cease to exist. Its yearly budget, with funds derived from membership and class fees and small grants, is $100,000, which barely covers the telephone, electricity, cleaning and exterminating bills and the salaries of Ms. Blyer and four part-time employees.
FOR the last decade, the center's parent agency, a state out-patient psychiatric clinic on the upper floors of the building, has tightened its belt as state funds have dwindled, and so Families First has been scraping by with little outside help, Ms. Blyer said.
Most of its battered furniture is donated or scavenged from the street. Last year, the mailman delivered a plastic picnic table he had found on his route. Ms. Blyer's husband, Alvin, the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board, donated a sofa that a colleague had left behind when she moved out of the city. The Blyers' son, Jonathan, and daughter, Raina, 21, pitch in from time to time.
"I think of this place as almost like my child," said Ms. Blyer, 52, "because I grew up with it as I was raising my son and my daughter. And so I felt like it was almost a threat to my family when the Mayor started doing this."
It was that kind of maternal outrage that brought Ms. Blyer out of her shell and in front of the cameras, she said.
"I never did anything before that anyone had to interview me for," she said. "I was always Raina's mother or Johnny's mother or Al's wife or Dinah's owner. Dinah's our chow. I was always this person's that. And I would always stay in the background because I felt more comfortable in the background."
When she first met her husband at George Washington University in the early 1970's -- he was a law student and she an anthropology major -- their early dates included marching on the Pentagon. But Ms. Blyer said she was never really a joiner.
After briefly teaching home economics and special education at high schools in Chelsea and on the Lower East Side, she stopped working to raise her children. And she got involved with Families First only because the center was desperate for parents' help. She joined the board and then agreed to serve as one of two coordinators to help run the center. When the director left, she was asked to take over.
"And I said I really didn't want to because I had no experience, but I would do it until they found somebody else."
She paused and smiled: "And that was maybe 10 years ago. I don't remember. It was a long time ago. And I'm still waiting for that person to walk in."

HEADLINE: Union Carbide's Earnings Are Down 48%

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Slumping world markets and a sales decline drove the Union Carbide Corporation's fourth-quarter 1998 profit down 48 percent. The results were slightly below Wall Street expectations.
The chairman of Carbide, William H. Joyce, said today that a decline in the world economy had led to lower sales and said the difficult times were likely to last through most of 1999 and perhaps longer. 
 The maker of plastics and specialty chemicals based in Danbury earned $67 million, or 49 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $130 million, or 92 cents a share, in the 1997 period.
Quarterly revenue fell to $1.29 billion, down 16 percent from $1.54 billion in 1997.
The latest results included an after-tax gain of $43 million, or 31 cents a share, from the settlement of a lawsuit.
Without that one-time gain, Carbide would have earned 18 cents a share for the quarter, 1 cent below the average estimate of 19 cents a share by analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation.
Shares of Union Carbide rose $1.50, to $44.25, today.
The fourth quarter of 1997 benefited from an after-tax gain of $72 million, or 53 cents a share, in a separate legal settlement. An accounting change reduced earnings by $17 million, or 12 cents a share, in 1997.

 BODY:
Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters, died peacefully in her sleep at age 109 yesterday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.
She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the first colored woman -- the term she preferred -- ever permitted to teach home economics in white New York City schools. 
 Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh, N.C.
Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was known to thousands of people only as "Dr. Bessie." She charged $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her rates in 27 years of practice.
The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993 of a memoir they called "Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years." They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white suburb.
The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and high schools, was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed it in 1995 with "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom."
In 1995, "Having Our Say" was adapted by Emily Mann into a Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the home they owned on a dead-end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss Delany remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. "She is my right arm," Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly before her sister's death. "If she were to die first, I'm not sure I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to keep her living."
But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, "On My Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie," appeared in May 1997.
The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one, who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to her, "Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the truth?"
If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses, with an uncommon talent for getting along and for being as sweet as the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.
The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they suffered through segregation.
Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a "colored woman" or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as black -- that did not describe her color, she used to say -- nor did she care for the term African-American.
Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys, Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church. He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's. Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was born Sept. 19, 1889, at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two sisters and six brothers on the campus of St. Augustine's, where their father was vice principal.
Happy though they might have been, the South around them was not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around 1914. In "Having Our Say," Sadie Delany wrote:
"I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Mr. Heller's fault; this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, 'Good morning, Mr. Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.' And I would say, 'Where, Mr. Heller?' And he would gesture to the back and say, 'Back there.' And I would say, 'Back where?' Well, I'd just worry that man to death. Finally, he'd say, 'Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.
"Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that," she recalled. "But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section."
Sadie Delany liked to say that when she got her master's degree in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed, "That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants anyway."
In this, Miss Delany said, she was "just like Papa."
She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for newborn infants.
Years later, she remembered her students: "They looked up to me and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite what white people were trying to do to us." She proudly recalled driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.
The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in 1916, and Bessie came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the sisters were separated. Eventually, 9 of the 10 Delany children moved to New York, and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest, stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and nephews.
At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors complained.
"They thought we were running a fast house!" the two sisters recalled. "We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds. So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the whole mess." The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with people who did not understand them, and they always straightened out the mess.
While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny a piece.
People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a loft on 121st Street in the late 1920's and made homemade chocolate fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called "Delany's Delights," it was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham & Straus, at $2 a pound. She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash. "People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure," she said.
After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools, Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia, after all. No Negro had ever done that before. She applied for a job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to meet her.
She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter explaining there had been a "mixup," and just showed up at the all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.
"They just about died when they saw me," she recalled. "A colored woman!"
She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where she taught adults at night.
It was lonely, she said. Some of her fellow teachers, who were all white, were friendly, she said, "but you couldn't count on any of them being your real friend."
She told Ms. Hearth: "New York was no piece of cake for a colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child. But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa. Raleigh will always be home."
"Sadie is molasses without even trying," her sister once said. "She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss." "
But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education once sent her what she called a "nasty" letter. She had lived for so long that the bean counters had become convinced that she must have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.
Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. "Why, we don't even own a rocking chair," she said.
She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said, "Thank you, Lord, for another day." Then she would wake up Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, "Oh Lord, another day?"
Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga. They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.
They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they "never had husbands to worry us to death."
But Sadie Delany said, "Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet."

HEADLINE: Judge Turns Trial Witness In Anchorwoman's Lawsuit

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In a rare role reversal, a justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court found himself in the witness chair today, testifying in Federal court on behalf of a television anchor who is suing her former employer for age and sex discrimination.
The anchor, Janet Peckinpaugh, had dated the justice, Richard N. Palmer, during the mid-1990's, when she was wrangling over her future with the CBS affiliate in Hartford, where her newscasts had once drawn the highest ratings in the state. 
 During 30 minutes on the stand, Justice Palmer testified that Ms. Peckinpaugh had told him at the time about a conversation that is crucial to her case, in which she said station executives had assured her that she could grow old on the air without fear of being fired.
Ms. Peckinpaugh maintains that she turned down lucrative offers in bigger cities on the basis of that promise, then was replaced months later by a younger woman.
Justice Palmer said his sense from their discussions was that "the station fully intended she would stay there until a ripe old age." But, he added, "I have no personal knowledge other than what she told me." Station executives deny that they said such a thing or had any obligation to her beyond her four-year contract, which they paid in full.
The justice also testified that Ms. Peckinpaugh had told him years ago about an incident in 1987 in which she contended that her co-anchor at the time, Al Terzi, had grabbed her and kissed her in a hotel room after a late-night assignment. Justice Palmer said she had told him Mr. Terzi had "come on to her physically; sexually, I guess."
Mr. Terzi, who remains an anchor at the same station, testified last week that in the hotel that night, they had exchanged a friendly hug and kiss, but that he had done nothing improper.
Justice Palmer said Ms. Peckinpaugh had told him then that she was concerned that Mr. Terzi, in retaliation for her reporting the incident, might have intentionally spoiled an audition tape that would help determine her future at Channel 3, the CBS station. Justice Palmer said she had told him that she felt "there was some effort to subvert the communication" between her and Mr. Terzi.
Both Justice Palmer and Ms. Peckinpaugh are 48. He is single and she is twice divorced. Ms. Peckinpaugh said that they had dated for seven years and that she had broken off the relationship in November 1997.
The unusual appearance, on the fifth day of the trial, brought smiles to the jury of five men and three women. The justice, who joined the court in 1993, helped alleviate the potential awkwardness of the situation with light humor.
Justice Palmer appeared with no fanfare. Judge Alfred V. Covello of United States District Court asked the justice to raise his right hand and swear to tell the whole truth. When her lawyer, David Golub, began by asking standard questions about credentials, the justice went into a narrative about how he had grown up nearby in Wethersfield and graduated from Trinity College and the University of Connecticut School of Law.
Judge Covello let that go on for a while and then looked down from the laptop computer he was using to take notes. "Why don't you tell us who you are, sir?" he asked Justice Palmer.
Ms. Peckinpaugh is suing Post-Newsweek Stations, a division of The Washington Post Company, which owned WFSB, Channel 3, when she worked there from 1987 to 1995. An economist who is a witness for her testified today that her break with the station resulted in lost lifetime earnings of $4.43 million.
The lead trial lawyer for Post-Newsweek, Joseph A. Moniz, said he did not object to Justice Palmer's being called as a witness. But Mr. Moniz would not discuss the possible impact on the case, citing an agreement with the court not to talk to reporters during the trial. Witnesses for Post-Newsweek have maintained that Ms. Peckinpaugh was replaced because of declining ratings, the station's need to reduce its number of high-priced anchors, and surveys in which another anchorwoman was rated more highly by viewers.
As the courtroom clock neared 5 this afternoon, Judge Covello expressed exasperation at the slow pace of the questioning, which has been his refrain throughout the trial. Justice Palmer chuckled in commiseration and said, "It's easier being an appellate judge."

HEADLINE: Catholics Try to Reseed St. Louis With $5,000 Offer

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 22

 BODY:
It was a compelling offer for Dave and Patti Patty-G'sell: $5,000 to put toward buying a house.
And there were only a few strings attached. The house had to be in a St. Louis neighborhood where crime and economic hard times had taken their toll. They had to promise to stay there five years or repay the money. And they had to join the neighborhood Roman Catholic Church and send their children to the neighborhood Catholic school. 
 In an unusual effort to lure Catholics back to the city, the Archdiocese of St. Louis has begun making the offer to any Catholics outside the city if they settle in one of three racially diverse South Side neighborhoods.
"Unless there is that outreach on our part, this parish is not going to survive," said the Rev. Kenneth Brown, the pastor of St. Margaret of Scotland, one of the three St. Louis parishes that started what priests call the "Catholic homesteading" program a few months ago.
So far, Father Brown, who has been recruiting in suburban churches, has had two takers -- Gary Sebescak, who is single, and the Patty-G'sells, a young couple expecting their first child. In another parish, Holy Family, a family has accepted the offer. The third parish is St. Pius V.
When Pope John Paul II visits St. Louis on Tuesday and Wednesday, he will see a city where officials have spent months repaving streets and planting trees to spruce it up. New lights will adorn the famous Gateway Arch and nuns are baking 131,000 tiny hosts for a gigantic Mass at the Trans World Dome.
So much care has been taken to make the Pope's visit a success that most people believe it could not have been coincidence that an execution of a death-row inmate scheduled to die during the visit was postponed till February by the Missouri Supreme Court. The Pope strongly opposes the death penalty.
An estimated 600,000 people will assemble here to see the Pontiff, a number that organizers like to point out dwarfs the 50,000 fans who flooded the streets when Mark McGwire smashed his record-breaking home run for the St. Louis Cardinals last fall.
But underneath all the gloss and ceremony is another St. Louis. It is a city that has been hemorrhaging people, including many Catholics, to the suburbs for decades, a city beset with many struggling neighborhoods, a city wrestling with the thorny problems of racial strife and floundering public schools.
On this, the Pope's fifth visit to the United States, John Paul will sound broad themes about youth and the future of the church in America. Here in St. Louis, priests say, the future of the church's urban core is inextricably linked to the progress of the city and its ability to handle some of these intractable issues.
Several priests are hoping the Pope, who has had a long association with St. Louis's Archbishop, Justin F. Rigali, will speak, at least obliquely, about the situation in the city. Indeed, one public gesture in the Pope's visit will be the formation by the Archdiocese's ecumenical office and several non-Catholic clergy groups of an interfaith effort to get local congregations involved in rehabilitating housing, tutoring children and providing immunizations in St. Louis's inner city.
Many efforts are already under way. In a burst of civic activism over the last several years, the Catholic Church here has taken it upon itself to try to address some of the struggles of the city's neighborhoods -- and at the same time try to keep its parishes and schools from foundering.
"I think you're getting beyond a problem," said Msgr. Ted L. Wojcicki, the Archdiocese's vicar for pastoral planning. "You're getting to a crisis in terms of the city. In the diocese, we commit tremendous resources to maintaining a presence in the urban areas."
Since 1950, the city of St. Louis has lost more than half of its population, about 400,000 people, largely to the suburbs. The Archdiocese's suburban parishes have boomed, but the church in this city that was founded by French Catholics has seen its ranks dwindle to 70,000 from about 200,000 in that time, and 33 of the church's 85 city parishes have closed for lack of people, Monsignor Wojcicki said.
The Catholic Homesteading program, in which the Archdiocese is investing $375,000 over five years, is only one example of church efforts to revitalize city neighborhoods. Catholic churches have formed organizations, in some cases with the help of non-Catholic churches, to get low-interest loans to help low-income and working-class families buy homes in the city. Catholic churches have also lobbied city officials to crack down on absentee landlords and recently persuaded the city to double the fine for violations of building codes.
And just last week, Archbishop Rigali took the unusual step of endorsing, in writing, a proposed sales tax increase of two-thirds of a penny that city residents will vote on next month. The increase would pay to continue St. Louis Country's largest busing program, which sends some 13,000 black inner-city students to mostly white suburban schools. Many public school parents and some school administrators favor busing, saying it gives black students a choice of where to be educated and gives city schools an incentive to compete for students.
At a neighborhood level, churches are pressuring owners of abandoned buildings. St. Pius V, on the South Side, persuaded the owner of an abandoned Sears building to sell to a developer who would build 30 homes on the property in the hope of encouraging some of the neighborhood's Vietnamese and Bosnian immigrants to become home owners.
Father Brown at St. Margaret of Scotland is on the board of a new organization that plans to buy rundown properties in his Shaw neighborhood and rehabilitate them or tear them down for new homes. And, in an effort to reach out to his neighborhood's large and relatively poor non-Catholic African-American community, Father Brown has formed a choir that includes the children of these families and plans to hire a black woman as a church outreach worker in the neighborhood.
Mayor Clarence Harmon says he welcomes the church's activism, calling the parishes and their schools "the glue that keeps it all from unraveling."
Some of the church's lobbying efforts have put him in a difficult position, said Mr. Harmon, who is an African-American Catholic. For example, he said, some alderman have worried that cracking down on substandard buildings could leave poor families living in those buildings without affordable housing.
Still, on balance, he is supportive. "I think it's a new kind of evangelism, if you will," Mr. Harmon said.
He said that when he heard about the Catholic Homesteading program, "I shouted words of glee."
So far, the Patty-G'sells, who moved from University City, just west of St. Louis, to be near Ms. Patty-G'sell's job as a school counselor, are happy with their decision.
"At first I wouldn't even consider moving down here," said Mr. Patty-G'sell, who said they paid $94,000 for a four-bedroom brick house. "But I'm learning that it's actually not so bad after all. We had a better welcome here than I think I've had any place I've ever lived."
Father Brown, whose church has 450 families, down from 2,200 in the 1950's, is busy trolling for more buyers. This Sunday, he will take his pitch to St. Charles County, a largely white suburban area that now has more Catholics than the city itself.
"I'll say, 'Let's face it, 99 percent of you people obviously aren't going to be moving to St. Margaret of Scotland,' " Father Brown said. " 'We're not kidding anybody. This is not for the faint of heart. But you have children and you have grandchildren.' They go home and they say, 'You wouldn't believe the fool that came to speak to us,' but their kids might say, 'Hmmm, that's sounds O.K.' "

HEADLINE: Whitman Budget Speech Focuses on Property Taxes

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman presented lawmakers today with a proposed budget that would return $200 million to property taxpayers, but she made it clear that any cuts in property tax rates would require tough choices by municipal officials and taxpayers about their local services.
In her annual budget address to the Legislature, Mrs. Whitman called upon taxpayers to demand that local officials eliminate unnecessary layers of government and share more municipal and school services with neighboring cities and towns. 
 "Real reform is going to require really tough choices at the local level," she said. "Our citizens should be asking why New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the country, spends more than any other state to bus a child to school. Citizens should ask, 'Does New Jersey really need 1,600 separate units of local government?' "
Mrs. Whitman made property taxes the theme of her speech, outlining her $19.16 billion spending plan for the coming fiscal year, which starts on July 1.
With the state's coffers overflowing with surging tax revenues from the strong economy and a windfall from the nationwide tobacco settlement, Mrs. Whitman has $1.1 billion more to spend in the new fiscal year than she had a year ago.
In addition to the $200 million in property tax rebates, the first installment of her five-year property tax relief program, her budget also includes $23 million for a program that would freeze property taxes for low-income elderly and disabled homeowners. She also included $22 million to cover the cost of removing 200,000 low-income residents from the state income tax rolls.
Mrs. Whitman's plan would increase spending for public schools, higher education and open space preservation and for health care programs for children and the elderly. In addition, she proposed using a third of the $93 million the state expects to receive from the tobacco settlement to cover costs of health care benefits for state employees. Other funds from the tobacco settlement would be earmarked for anti-smoking programs aimed at teen-agers and for other health-related programs.
Republican lawmakers, who control both the Assembly and the Senate and whose support Mrs. Whitman needs for her budget, had nothing but praise for the spending plan.
"This is a Christmas budget," said the Assembly Speaker, Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, as he pointed to a Christmas necktie that he wore for the occasion. "Everyone should be happy with it. I think that it touched on every segment of our society: education, crime, the elderly and tax relief. I think it should be getting bipartisan support."
But Democrats, while careful not to criticize Mrs. Whitman's plan to send property tax rebate checks to homeowners, said that they thought the budget proposal should have done more to reduce property tax rates. "New Jersey residents will still be the most highly burdened taxpayers in the country," said the Assembly's Democratic leader, Joseph V. Doria of Hudson County.
Since taking office six years ago, Mrs. Whitman has insisted that local officials, not the Governor and State Legislature, determine local property tax rates. To encourage local governments to consolidate services, Mrs. Whitman said that she had also included $35 million in her proposed budget for incentives. "It's time to start handing out aid as a reward for doing the right thing to promote government reform," she said.
By trying to move the debate over property taxes from the State House to the local level, Mrs. Whitman was fending off one of the sharpest attacks of the property tax relief program that she announced earlier this month.
Critics say that her proposal, while giving rebates to homeowners, would do little to address the state's long-term property tax problem, because it would not reduce or hold down rate increases.
The state has the highest property tax rates in the country, which average about $4,000.
A major reason is the many levels of local government. With its long tradition of home rule, New Jersey has 566 cities and towns. Taxpayers also help finance 21 counties, 188 fire districts and 611 school districts.
But some Democrats and local school officials say that Mrs. Whitman is not addressing a major cause of the state's property tax burden: state assistance for public schools. They say that New Jersey's state revenue covers about 40 percent of the costs of local school districts, with property taxes making up the balance. The national average for state assistance is 50 percent.
"New Jersey overrelies on property taxes to fund schools," said Charles V. Reilly, president of the New Jersey School Boards Association. "Tax reform requires a permanent rebalancing of state and local revenue sources used to support schools."
State Senator Richard J. Codey, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that Mrs. Whitman's words and her budget failed to address the issue. "The fact that we have the highest rates will not change one iota," he said. "We're still No. 1, and that's just wrong. Unless you radically change the way you fund education, we're always going to be No. 1."
Democrats also criticized Mrs. Whitman for not putting up the money now to pay for her property tax rebate program, which will cost the state $1 billion a year by 2004, two years after she leaves office.
At a cost of $200 million to the state budget this year, rebate checks, which will average about $120, would go out to homeowners after Labor Day. When the program is fully phased in, the checks are to rise to about $600 a year.
On Wall Street, Richard Marino, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, said that the Governor's overall budget was prudent, but he said the property tax plan left important questions unanswered.
"How will it be paid for?" Mr. Marino asked. "Does it really address the underlying problems of the state: schools and duplication of services? While it might provide relief for taxpayers, the underlying problems are still there."
 
Compromise Is Reached on Utility Deregulation
Legislative leaders announced a compromise yesterday on legislation to deregulate New Jersey's power industry, and the bill could be ready for the Governor's signature by Thursday.
The State Senate and the Assembly passed slightly different versions of the legislation on Jan. 13. Both bills called for cutting the state's high utility rates by allowing power companies to compete for residential and commercial customers and to let municipal officials negotiate bulk rates on behalf of their constituents, a process known as aggregation.
Under the compromise, lawmakers dropped an Assembly provision requiring a referendum to approve of aggregation, the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said yesterday.
Rather, Senator DiFrancesco said, approval will require a majority of the local governmental body, plus one vote. He said the power supplier would then have to notify individual customers of a deal.
The Senate and Assembly are to vote on the compromise on Thursday, said Rae Hutton, Mr. DiFrancesco's spokeswoman.
Wendi Patella, a spokeswoman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, said: "The Governor is pleased that it looks like we are very, very close. But the Governor wants to look at the final language before she gives her unconditional support."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence on Rise, But Worries Exist, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The rebound on Wall Street during January helped restore consumers' confidence in the economy, but Americans still have concerns about their own finances in the months ahead.
A survey by the Conference Board released yesterday found consumers are feeling better about the current financial situation than they did during December, particularly when it comes to the availability of jobs. 
 The business research group reported its index of consumer confidence rose nine-tenths of a percent, to 127.6, from a revised 126.7 in December. The index dropped sharply in October and has since been making a steady recovery.
But the Conference Board found that looking ahead to the next six months consumers were not quite as secure. The number of people who said they expected their incomes to increase over the next six months dropped 5.3 percentage points, from 28.7 percent to 23.4 percent.
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
Still, economists who analyzed the results say consumers are likely to be swayed by current headlines and that the index is therefore less valuable as a measure of how people feel about the economy's progress.
"It's more a barometer of people's opinions rather than their actual behavior," said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist with the Chicago-based Bank One Corporation. "It's a poor indicator of spending."
"We're doing phenomenally well. What's key in the confidence numbers is how people feel about their own pocketbooks, and they feel really good," Ms. Swonk said. "We're only a little off the all-time high" of 138.2 that the Conference Board index set in June, she said.
The latest improvement comes in a month when the stock market has again reached record highs.
While spending may slow a bit in the coming year, it will likely still be one of the strongest years of the last decade, Ms. Swonk said.
The rise in consumer confidence was helped mostly by an increase in the number of consumers who said jobs currently are plentiful. Forty-five percent believe there are many jobs available, compared with 42.5 percent who said so a month ago.

HEADLINE: Texaco Posts 80% Plunge in Earnings

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Texaco Inc., the third-largest oil company in the United States, said today that fourth-quarter earnings fell 80 percent because of lower crude oil prices and narrower profit margins on fuel sales.
Profit before special items dropped to $92 million, or 15 cents a diluted share, compared with $472 million, or 84 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company said on Jan. 8 that it expected to make 13 to 16 cents a share, far less than the 30-cent average estimate of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. Revenue fell 35 percent, to $7.81 billion from $12.05 billion. 
 Texaco was hurt because much of its refining and fuel-sales operations outside the United States are in Asia, where many nations are in recession and energy demand has shrunk. Texaco is also more dependent on the price of crude oil than the Exxon Corporation, which saw fourth-quarter profit fall 30 percent, and the Chevron Corporation, which reported a 63 percent drop.
Charges totaling $329 million and a tax gain of $24 million gave Texaco a final loss of $213 million, or 43 cents a share. Texaco, based in White Plains, took charges of $235 million for writing down the value of inventory and assets, $80 million for employee severance and $14 million for the formation of a refining alliance with Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
In 1997's fourth quarter, Texaco recorded gains from asset sales and charges for write-downs that resulted in a gain of $151 million and net income of $623 million, or $1.12 a share.
Shares of Texaco fell $2.125, to $48.50.

HEADLINE: Russia and U.S. Urge Kosovo Talks; Albright Weighs Troops

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Russia and the United States today called on both sides fighting in Kosovo to hold talks toward achieving a political settlement in the Serbian province, while the United States spoke more openly of using force to compel the talks.
Russia remains firmly opposed to using force. But a joint statement, issued on the second day of a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, would be helpful in showing the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, that he cannot automatically count on the Russians for support, Administration officials said. 
 And for the first time today Ms. Albright refused to rule out using American ground troops as part of a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, saying, "We would examine that among other options."
An Administration official said the United States had "moved further along" toward possible use of ground troops in Kosovo, an option that appeared virtually unthinkable last week.
In the statement today the Russians went further than they had before in calling on Mr. Milosevic to restrain his police and military units in Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia, but where more than 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian. The ethnic Albanians are calling for independence.
In calling for a political settlement, the United States and Russia said that both sides in the Kosovo conflict must accept "substantial autonomy" for the Serbian province.
At a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels today the United States continued to push for an ultimatum to be issued to both sides that threatened air strikes if they did not agree to a political settlement.
Russia has traditionally been more sympathetic to the nationalism of fellow Slavs in Serbia than many Western countries. Serbia is one of two republics that remain in Yugoslavia.
In the joint statement on Kosovo issued by Ms. Albright and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov the Russians also agreed for the first time to push Mr. Milosevic to accept investigators from the war crimes tribunal in The Hague to investigate the killings of 45 ethnic Albanians this month in the village of Racak.
The statement on Kosovo was the most immediate result of the Moscow meetings, which covered a gamut of strategic and economic issues at the most troubled time in American and Russian relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Despite the paucity of specific agreements Ms. Albright and Mr. Ivanov tried to put the best face on the relationship.
Asked at their joint news conference whether the United States had been ignoring Russia, Ms. Albright, who stood beside Mr. Ivanov on a stage at a press center here, replied: "The proof is in the pudding -- or me. I am here because we are neither ignoring nor avoiding or dismissing Russia and its views."
A more defensive Mr. Ivanov said Ms. Albright had explained the Clinton Administration plans for a new missile system and its effect on the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which the Russians believe is sacred to the control of nuclear arms control. The new position of the Americans is "being studied very thoroughly," Mr. Ivanov said.
But he made clear that the Russians resented what they consider the hardball tactics of the United States on nonproliferation.
Ms. Albright pressed the Russians again to stop what the Administration asserts is help to Iran with nuclear missile technology.
In recognition of the volatile political landscape in Russia Ms. Albright reached out to some people who are most likely to run in the presidential election next year. She met yesterday with Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow and today with Aleksandr I. Lebed, the former general who is now governor of a region in Siberia. She also met with Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal party.
The meeting with Mr. Luzhkov was quite fiery, American officials said. Mr. Luzhkov vigorously attacked United States policy toward Iraq and Kosovo and expressed concern that the United States wanted to kill the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
She spoke by telephone with President Boris N. Yeltsin, who remains in the hospital.
The discussion of possible ground troops in Kosovo was an inevitable outcome of the increasing talk at NATO about possible air strikes against Serbian targets in Kosovo. In the event of air strikes some type of peacekeeping forces would have to be deployed in Kosovo afterward.
As the NATO ambassadors met today in Brussels there were talks with NATO military commanders about limited air strikes or a longer phased air campaign, a Western diplomat said. The diplomat said the participants also discussed the context to issue an ultimatum.
But there was still disagreement among the allies about which diplomatic channels to use and in what order, Administration officials said. Before issuing a NATO ultimatum the French and British want to hold a meeting of the so-called contact group, which includes Russia, and is dedicated to resolving issues of the countries that once made up a larger Yugoslavia, an Administration official said.
Ms. Albright, who was so irritated after attending a meeting of the group last year that she dismissed it as the "lowest common denominator of diplomacy," was not eager to attend a meeting, the officials said.

NATO to Cut Bosnia Force 10%
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (Reuters) -- NATO has decided to cut its military force that supervises the peace in Bosnia by 10 percent in March, the United States said today. The 32,000-member NATO-led force was sent to the former Yugoslav republic after the Dayton agreement of 1995 that ended three and a half years of war.

HEADLINE: The Pope's Message

 BODY:
Today Pope John Paul II completes his eighth visit to North America. In his appearances in recent days in Mexico City and St. Louis, he spoke haltingly at times and walked unsteadily. But his message -- the primacy of the human being -- rang out. Early in his papacy he attacked the dehumanization of Communism, and now he sounds warnings about the human costs of hard-edged capitalism. World events have risen and fallen around John Paul, but his theme has never changed.
In his mass in Mexico City's Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, he attacked Latin America's free-market policies for their neglect of the poor and their "purely economic conception of man." He blamed globalization for causing environmental destruction and a growing gap between rich and poor. He criticized the materialism inspired by the media. 
 When the Pope was elected in 1978, his first foreign visit took him not to his native Poland but to the Dominican Republic and Mexico, which has more Catholics than any nation except Brazil. His latest trip to Mexico was his fourth, and the country's embrace seemed even warmer for his failing health.
One of the Pope's goals in Mexico was to stop the flood of millions of Catholics who have joined evangelical Protestant churches. He was also trying to attract young people to the priesthood. There is only one priest for every 13,000 parishioners in Latin America. Some of the Church's problems stem from John Paul's conservative views on doctrinal matters, especially birth control and divorce, which have convinced many Latins that the Church is irrelevant to their daily lives.
The Church in the United States has also experienced a shortage of priests, and officials here are worried about Catholic adhesion among young people, whose views on premarital sex, homosexuality and birth control are far more liberal than those of their parents.
John Paul also sought to warn Mexicans of the dangers of technology, which can lead, the Pope said, to a world without a soul. His trip, however, inadvertently reveals the magnitude of what he is battling. He has always relied on modern media to enhance his extraordinary charisma and communication with his faithful. Before he spoke of technological dangers in Aztec Stadium, the arena's screen blazed with greetings to the Pope transmitted from all over the hemisphere. His criticisms of materialism were part of a trip underwritten by Pepsi-Cola and several other companies. Pope John Paul won his battle with Communism, but his struggle to mount a spiritual critique of capitalism and a global commercial culture promises to be an even more complex task.

Mexico's Central Bank Is Optimistic on Economy

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Mexico has already weathered the worst blows of the global economic crisis and is not likely to suffer severe trauma from the instability in Brazil even if it deepens, top finance officials said today.
The relatively sanguine prognosis for Mexico came from senior officials of the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, as they announced that they would take more aggressive action to rein in inflation in 1999. 
 Despite dizzying fluctuations in many emerging markets last year and a drop in the price of crude oil, one of Mexico's main exports, by about 30 percent, the economy held its own over all, the officials said, growing by about 4.8 percent.
Consumers continued to spend, although more cautiously toward the end of 1998, and official unemployment reached the lowest levels of the decade at 2.6 percent. Most economists believe these official figures do not reflect the large numbers of Mexicans who only have part-time jobs or have precarious income from street vending or other insecure work. But they remain an indicator of the creation of formal jobs.
Mexico is better protected than other Latin American countries from the disarray in Brazil, the region's largest economy, the officials said. Less than 1 percent of Mexico's foreign trade is with Brazil, while more than 80 percent of its manufacturing exports are sold in the United States, where growth is projected to slow only mildly this year.
"There just aren't many paths by which the crisis in Brazil can reach us," one senior central bank official said.
"Our principal nexus is with the United States, and we hope that it will maintain its growth," another official said. "As they say, you should hitch your wagon to a rising star."
Other analysts said the Mexican officials were too optimistic but not completely off base.
"No country in Latin America is as far removed from Brazil in terms of trade and investment flows as Mexico," said Gray Newman, senior Latin American economist at Merrill Lynch. "There are really two Latin Americas, one with a hub in Brazil and another in Mexico. But it's a little too early to say they are decoupled. Mexico is still vulnerable to investor sentiment about all the emerging markets."
Economists noted that the peso slipped only slightly, to 10.15 to the dollar in New York today from 10.23 on Monday, after the Brazil's currency -- the real -- was allowed to float earlier this month and lost 30 percent of its value.
The view at the Banco de Mexico is that international conditions cannot get much more unsteady than they were in 1998, with Russia's default on part of its debt and the uncertainties in Asia. The central bank's estimates are based on an estimated average price for Mexican crude oil this year of only $9.25 a barrel, and the officials do not believe prices can go much lower than that.
The officials said they were "not happy" that inflation ended the year at 18.6 percent, well above the original goal of 12 percent. They will try to bring it to 13 percent this year. Inflation was increased by some devaluation of the peso, by increases in prices of basic goods like gasoline and tortillas, and by erratic weather, which ruined many food crops.
The central bank will stick to its policy of allowing the peso to float but will react faster and more aggressively to international shocks, which depress the currency and fuels inflation. The bank will continue to limit the amount of money in circulation on a daily basis as an anti-inflationary measure. The central bank also restricts bank lending by forcing the institutions to maintain the equivalent of $1.9 billion in deposits in the central bank. Although the policy raises interest rates in the short term, in the long term it reduces inflation by strengthening the peso and encouraging foreign investment.
"We are going to have a very careful, very vigilant, fundamentally very restrictive policy," one top official said.

HEADLINE: William M. Batten, Ex-Chief Of Stock Exchange, Dies at 89

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
William Milfred Batten, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and a former chairman and chief executive of the J. C. Penney Company, died on Friday in Hilton Head, S.C. He was 89.
Mr. Batten, who was often called Mil, became only the second paid chairman of the New York exchange in May 1976 after his retirement from Penney. While his original $2 million contract to head the Big Board expired in May 1981, it was extended another three years. 
 As chairman, Mr. Batten oversaw a $70 million renovation of the exchange floor and the installation of electronic equipment that tripled the daily trading capacity to 150 million shares. Other changes during his chairmanship included development of a subsidiary, the New York Futures Exchange, which was later sold, and work on a system linking price and volume information for all stock exchanges.
Before Mr. Batten took over the exchange, it faced criticism that it was dominated by securities industry insiders and calls that specialist who match buy and sell orders should be replaced by computers. The exchange was also under fire from the Government for not moving fast enough to develop a unified national market system.
Amid such turmoil, James J. Needham, the exchange's first paid chairman, resigned in 1976 with almost two years remaining on his contract. The abolition of fixed brokerage commissions on stock transactions a year earlier had slashed the profits of many Wall Street firms, leading to a number of mergers and closings. And the stock market was still shunned by many investors who had lost 40 or 50 percent of their investments in the severe bear market of 1974. Other investors were turning to other forms of investment, including commodity futures contracts and stock options, which were not available on the New York exchange.
Partly because of Mr. Batten's ability as a low-key diplomat, the exchange installed enough computer systems to improve efficiency yet retain specialists, whose job is to insure orderly buying and selling of stocks. He also calmed the concerns of regulators in Washington and worked to include traders and member brokerage firms of the Big Board in making decisions.
Mr. Batten became J. C. Penney's fourth chairman in 1964. As head of the store chain, he presided over its transformation from a company of Main Street merchants primarily in small towns into a diversified, mass merchandiser primarily in shopping malls. As a result, his predecessor, A. W. Hughes, referred to Mr. Batten as "the chief architect of the new Penney company."
He was also responsible for a significant expansion of the merchandising line, the introduction of the Penney credit card and the company's entry into the catalogue business.
Mr. Batten began his career with Penney in 1926 as a part-time salesman in his hometown of Parkersburg, W. Va. In 1935, he was offered a full-time job in Penney's store in Lansing, Mich., at $70 a month. He was told that this would be enough to live on until he proved he was worth more.
A veteran of World War II, Mr. Batten moved to Penney's New York office in 1945. He became vice president of the company in 1953 and a member of the board in 1955. He was named president and chief executive in 1958. In 1964, he became chairman. Although he reached retirement age in 1969, he was asked to stay on, remaining until 1974.
Mr. Batten received a Bachelor of Science in economics from Ohio State University in 1932 and did graduate work at the University of Chicago. From 1984 to 1986, Mr. Batten was a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He also served on the boards of numerous corporations including AT&T, Boeing and Texas Instruments.
He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; a son, David, of Palma de Mallorca, Spain; a daughter, Jane Wild of Lawrence, Kan.; a sister, Francis Young of Akron, Ohio; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: Best-Selling Author's Gloomy Future for Los Angeles Meets Resistance

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26

 BODY:
On a winter Sunday morning of the sort that only Southern California seems to produce, under a brilliant blue sky scoured clean of clouds and smog, a crowd of upper-middle-class Angelenos filed into the Skirball Cultural Center and plunked down $10 each to hear a conversation with their city's reigning prophet of doom.
In two best-selling books, "City of Quartz," published in 1990, and "Ecology of Fear," issued last fall, that man, Mike Davis, has portrayed Los Angeles as a false paradise ruled by malign elites who have stifled the poor, built a fortress downtown surrounded by a growing ring of dying suburbs, and courted environmental disaster by heedlessly encroaching on canyons and cliffsides never meant for mass habitation. 
 For this Mr. Davis, a one-time meat-cutter and now full-time Marxist urbanologist, has been hailed as something like a hero, not only by the coast-to-coast school of critics who have long looked askance at Los Angeles, but by his fellow Southern Californians whose unrelenting misery he presumes to celebrate. The winner of a $315,000 MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant, he has also won an unquestioned place on the short list of serious thinkers about a city whose prevailing culture has long been a blend of oligarchical boosterism and noir self-loathing.
When a questioner at the Skirball Center gestured to the sunny splendor of the Sepulveda Pass outside and asked if Los Angeles was really so bad, Mr. Davis, 52, acknowledged with a rueful laugh, "I wake up in the morning and look at the San Gabriel Mountains in incredible January -- even if it may be a symptom of global warming -- and I ask myself, 'Are you crazy?' "
For the first time, a growing chorus of Californians is effectively answering, "Yes!"
"Ecology of Fear" (Metropolitan Books), with its thesis that the modern megalopolis of Los Angeles has no business existing in the earthquake-ridden Southern California desert, has unleashed a pent-up firestorm of criticism over Mr. Davis's methods after 16 weeks on the local best-seller list ("City of Quartz" is No. 5 on the paperback list).
Critics have cast grave doubt on many of the obscure and startling factoids that are Mr. Davis's stock in trade, calling into question his broader argument that Los Angeles is a hopelessly damned creature of unchecked real estate speculation and the mercenary folly of its ruling class.
The debate has pitted rival camps of the city's interpreters against each other in a fight more typical of New York or Paris than of laid-back Los Angeles. Academics, alternative weeklies, business journals and The Los Angeles Times have all weighed in, with everything from Mr. Davis's birthplace (the desert suburb of Fontana, not Los Angeles, as the book jacket of "Ecology" says) to his marriages (he is on his fifth) grist for the mill. As a topic of collective conversation, he is not quite on a par with the Dodgers or the latest grosses, but he is gaining.
"In my opinion, it is a significant development in the intellectual history of Los Angeles -- and don't gasp, there is such a thing," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian of California whose own histories of the Golden State, like "Inventing the Dream" (Oxford University Press, 1985) have been hailed as authoritative. "The decade of the 90's began with 'City of Quartz' and its elegantly presented noir vision of Los Angeles as a repressive conspiracy, and sure enough, all these noir aspects came out, beginning with the riots in '92.
"At the end of the decade," Mr. Starr continued, "there's a different situation. Immigrant groups have revitalized the Los Angeles economy, the mood is better, and here comes a book that really makes us think about earthquakes and the epicycle of climatological reality.
"Davis's offering of an unmitigatedly apocalyptic point of view is now meeting with resistance. There's going to be some bad manners, some fighting back and forth. But you've got people caring about L.A. and the theory of L.A., and I think that's very important."
Mr. Davis, whose unruly shock of white hair and soft, half-swallowed speaking voice convey an aura about as threatening as Linus in "Peanuts," has been caught in some embarrassing mistakes. For starters, he has acknowledged fabricating an entire conversation with a local environmentalist, Lewis McAdams, for a cover story he wrote for L.A. Weekly a decade ago; he defends it as an early attempt at journalistic scene-setting.
In "City of Quartz" (Verso, 1990), discussing the power divisions between the city's old and new elites, he misidentified the late Howard Ahmanson, the founder of the giant Home Savings empire and a conservative Christian, as Jewish, and he also described Hancock Park, one of the city's oldest WASP enclaves, as a Jewish neighborhood.
He also acknowledges that he cannot find the source for his assertion in "Ecology of Fear" that as many as 30 bodies a year have been found in drug-plagued MacArthur Park near downtown, a claim the police dismiss as wildly off-base.
"The book is a, you know, polemic, with a lot of irony and humor in it," Mr. Davis said in a two-hour interview at a pub near his home in Pasadena. "It has sailed over the heads of some people."
But Mr. Davis's critics say he has so twisted the facts as to make honest debate impossible. The latest critique of Mr. Davis, for example, in the weekly New Times L.A., leaves little doubt that his new book's portrait of suburban Pomona as a deserted husk is at best outdated, ignoring a decade of revival.
Joel Kotkin, a fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu and one of Mr. Davis's most vociferous critics, said, "What bothers me even as a person who was trained as a Marxist is that somebody would so bastardize Marxist theory to the point of making things up."
Mr. Davis's particular calling card has been his unearthing of obscure, even fantastic, facts about Los Angeles's experience with natural and scientific phenomena, from monsoon-intensity rain to little-noticed tornados to mountain lions that prowl the city's suburban fringe. One chapter in "Ecology of Fear," on wildfires, is titled, "The Case for Letting Malibu Burn."
But Brady Westwater, a Malibu real-estate agent and amateur local historian who has appointed himself Mr. Davis's one-man truth squad, has produced reams of material, circulated on the Internet and among publications here and in New York, questioning almost every claim he makes.
"There's something pathological about it," said Mr. Westwater, who cites, as just one example among dozens, Mr. Davis's assertion that local news organizations have long played down Southern California's experience with tornado-like storms.
"I checked the L.A. Times article he actually cites as evidence of this reluctance, and it uses the words 'tornado' or 'twister' 13 times," Mr. Westwater said. "You don't even have to check other sources to prove he's lying. He does it himself."
Mr. Davis calmly contends that any book of such length and ambition (it is 461 pages, including footnotes) is bound to contain errors. "The thing you have to understand about these books is I'm a socialist," he said. "This book has an utterly radical political agenda, no holds barred."
In fact, Mr. Davis, who has taught at the Southern California Institute of Architecture and is now on the verge of accepting a three-year appointment to teach history "deep in the faux-Colonial architecture of Suffolk County," at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, seems to slide reflexively into hyperbole.
He referred to a friend, William Deverell, a respected professor in his late 30's at the California Institute of Technology, as "the dean of L.A. historians." He mused of his recent visit to a Times Square seemingly devoid of homeless people: "What's Giuliani done? Built gas chambers in Queens or something?"
Doug Dutton, who owns the respected independent bookstore in Brentwood that bears his name, had a long list of orders for "Ecology" before it was even published. He said Mr. Davis has "an enormous following" among his upscale customers.
"I can't help but think to a certain extent that if you agree with his theories, you'll like the book, and if you don't, you won't," Mr. Dutton said. "It's a kind of analysis that's very personal, almost a grand unified theory for Los Angeles."
Mr. Davis insists he loves the city, which is why he is so hard on it, and says he is trying to inspire a new generation of labor activists, environmentalists and academics to carry on the battles for social justice that he himself fought as a civil rights protester and member of Students for a Democratic Society in the 60's.
But he acknowledged: "Some people like the book because they like the glamor of decay and apocalypse. Those people aren't the people I write for, although they probably help sell the book."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
S.E.C. Official Takes Position At Bear Stearns

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Richard R. Lindsey, the director of market regulation for the Securities and Exchange Commission, is stepping down to join a unit of the Bear Stearns Companies that is being investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney and Federal regulators.
Mr. Lindsey, 44, will become a senior managing director at the company and the No. 2 person at the Bear Stearns Clearing Corporation, which processes and guarantees the trades of small firms, maintains their customers' accounts and lends them money. He is expected to begin in March. 
 Mr. Lindsey's move to a company that is under scrutiny by regulators and the authorities is sure to raise eyebrows. At issue in the investigations is Bear Stearns's role in the demise of A. R. Baron & Company, a small brokerage firm in New York City that failed in 1996. Bear Stearns was Baron's clearing firm. Customers of A. R. Baron lost $75 million in what the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, called a criminal enterprise. Mr. Morgenthau's office won convictions against 14 Baron employees in 1997.
"This is an intriguing move by Bear Stearns," said Lewis D. Lowenfels, a securities lawyer in New York who represents a firm that lost money with A. R. Baron. "The larger question is what effect this will have on their pending investigations and litigation."
As is its custom, the S.E.C. would neither confirm nor deny that it is investigating Bear Stearns's role in the failure. Mr. Morgenthau had no comment on what effect Mr. Lindsey's hiring might have on his office's continuing investigation.
James E. Cayne, the president and chief executive of Bear Stearns, said that Mr. Lindsey's hiring was not an effort to shore up the brokerage firm's reputation or credibility. "His basic function is to come into the correspondent clearing company at Bear Stearns," Mr. Cayne said. "It is a very big part of our business. He is a visionary; he's got a terrific reputation."
According to Mr. Cayne, Richard Harriton, head of the Bear Stearns clearing unit, will remain in the top job. There is currently no second in command.
Mr. Lindsey became director of market regulation at the S.E.C. in November 1995 after serving as the commission's chief economist. He came to the S.E.C. from Yale University, where he was a professor of finance.
Before teaching, Mr. Lindsey was a research engineer for Owens Corning Fiberglas and later worked for the Certainteed Corporation, a privately held maker of fiberglass, first as manager of process engineering and then as plant manager for the company's plant in Dallas. Mr. Lindsey has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology, an M.B.A. from the University of Dallas and a doctorate in finance from the University of California at Berkeley.
As the chief regulator of the securities markets, Mr. Lindsey has been responsible for a number of S.E.C. initiatives, including regulations developed late last year that allow for the creation of new stock exchanges through alternative trading systems. He was the first director of market regulation who was not a lawyer.
But Mr. Lindsey's biggest accomplishment was carrying out the S.E.C.'s order-handling rules in 1997, which required that customers who wanted to buy or sell Nasdaq stocks at prices in between the current bid and asked prices could have their orders displayed on the national quotation system. This rule change, which came out of the enforcement action brought in 1996 by the S.E.C. against Nasdaq for unfair trading practices, has made it easier for individual investors to meet on Nasdaq rather than having to place trades through an intermediary.
"Richard Lindsey was the catalyst for dramatic changes in the way our markets operate, saving investors billions of dollars a year," said Arthur Levitt, chairman of the S.E.C. "He really was the architect of the order-handling rules, and he went around to firms and he sold it."
Even though he was the commission's chief market regulator, people close to Mr. Lindsey said he had not been involved in the Bear Stearns matter. As a Bear Stearns employee, he must follow strict Government guidelines in dealing with his former colleagues at the S.E.C.. He cannot appear before the commission, for example, or telephone or write to former colleagues there for a year after he leaves. And Mr. Lindsey cannot ever lobby the S.E.C. on any matter that he may have worked on while he was a regulator.
Mr. Lindsey said his decision to join Bear Stearns crystallized in the last two weeks. He declined to comment on what his pay would be.
"I believe that I have a lot of things to contribute," Mr. Lindsey said. "I've had a long management history working in a lot of different types of organizations. That usually brings something to the table to see where you need to take things."

Brazil's Currency Plunges In a Day of Wide Swings

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Brazil's currency swung wildly in foreign-exchange dealings today and briefly fell to a low of nearly two to the dollar because of growing uncertainty about the country's economic health.
The volatility in the currency, the real, came as another credit rating service lowered its assessment of Brazil's ability to repay debts. The action by Fitch IBCA, coming atop a downgrade by the Duff & Phelps service on Monday, partly reflected worries that the Government lacks the leadership to deal with an economic crisis that is growing more acute. 
 But the anxiety about Latin America's largest economy appeared to have little effect on the stock market, where the key index rose 6.33 percent on purchases by investors who thought shares were selling at bargain levels.
Brazil has been in an increased state of economic turmoil since the Government abruptly decided more than a week ago to stop defending the value of the real by buying the currency in the foreign-exchange market. It had spent billions of dollars in foreign reserves with that approach but the real's value kept falling.
The cheapened currency, in turn, has unnerved consumers and investors because it threatens the return of higher inflation and has raised the costs of servicing the country's foreign debts. An estimated $42 billion in debts is coming due in the next few months.
But with pressure growing for economic austerity measures from the Government, the central bank's president, Francisco Lopes, told the Brazilian Senate today that no new steps were forthcoming.
A team of technical experts from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Brazil to review the country's economic performance under an agreement for a $41.5 billion standby loan. The fund's approval will be needed before a second allotment of the loan, originally due to be disbursed in late February, can be released.
The main barometer of Brazil's economic slide has become the real, which fell to 1.955 to the dollar before rebounding to settle at 1.85, compared with 1.78 on Monday. At many banks, which charge foreign-exchange fees, citizens and tourists had to pay a rate of two reais to the dollar.
This week, the Brazilian Congress is scheduled to vote on 28 billion reais ($16 billion) of cuts to this year's budget, and to finish voting on Social Security reform legislation. It will also vote on extending and increasing a tax on financial transactions.
But without any more ambitious plans to cut costs, economists said, the Brazilian Government risks a repeat of the kind of capital flight and panic that has gripped the nation for much of this month.
"If you look at the events of the last week or so, you get the impression that the Government has just taken a back seat," said Philip Smith, a banking expert at Fitch IBCA. "What you've got is very much a void where people don't know what the strategy is."
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, simultaneously facing a punishing recession and the return of high inflation, convened panels of ministers to find ways to invigorate economic growth. The Finance Minister, Pedro Malan, was not included on either of the panels. Joao Pimenta da Veiga, the Government's Communications Minister, said, however, that Mr. Malan would be consulted.
Telling the Senate Economic Affairs Committee not to expect any new austerity package, the central bank's Mr. Lopes said the votes that would be taken this week were "of the greatest importance, and are sufficient for the consolidation of the program of stability."

Warner-Lambert to Acquire Agouron for $2.1 Billion
Warner-Lambert, one of the hottest companies in the drug industry, said that it would acquire Agouron Pharmaceuticals, a small biotechnology firm, for $2.1 billion in stock.
The deal enables Warner-Lambert to add Agouron's Viracept, the nation's leading protease inhibitor, to its pipeline along with several other anti-viral and cancer drugs. Although the deal was announced after the market closed, shares of both stocks climbed steadily throughout the day before they were halted in afternoon trading. Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $1.625, to $69.125, while Agouron jumped $3.65625, or 6.9 percent, to $56.8125. Page C4. 

Earnings at four of the largest drug companies -- Merck, American Home Products, Schering-Plough and Johnson & Johnson -- met or slightly beat Wall Street expectations. C4.
 
More Instability in Brazil
Brazil's currency briefly tumbled to a rate of nearly two to the dollar as another credit-rating agency lowered its assessment of the nation's economic prospects and ability to repay debts. But the stock market rallied as buyers sensed bargains, pushing the main index up 6.33 percent. C5.
 
Mexico has weathered the worst blows of the global economic crisis and is not likely to suffer severe trauma from Brazil's instability, top finance officials said. C5.
 
Boeing Beats Wall Street Forecasts
Boeing, which released fourth-quarter results that were 3 cents a share better than expected, tried to reassure investors that it was finally turning itself around. But Wall Street remained skeptical, sending shares of the aerospace company down $1, to $35. C4.
 
Microsoft Witness on Competition
A senior Microsoft official testified in the Government's antitrust case that the company tried to persuade Netscape Communications, its main rival in the Internet software market, to become less of a head-on competitor. C2.
 
Coca-Cola Earnings Decline 27%
Confirming the bad news it had warned Wall Street analysts about last month, Coca-Cola reported its fourth-quarter earnings fell 27 percent as volume and revenue dropped in many parts of the world. C6.
 
Amazon.com, the on-line retailer, said its fourth-quarter loss widened less than expected, while sales almost quadrupled, as more holiday shoppers used it to buy gifts. C7.
 
Strong international sales and a rejuvenated United States restaurant business lifted McDonald's fourth-quarter profit 9 percent. C4.
 
Compaq Offers Stake in Alta Vista
Rod Schrock, the executive who introduced Compaq's Presario line of personal computers, was named president and chief executive of the new Alta Vista. Compaq Computer, which owns the Internet search engine, plans to sell a minority stake in it to the public as part of an effort to expand Alta Vista into a leading player in on-line advertising and shopping. The news follows the collapse of talks in which Compaq hoped to sell a stake in Alta Vista to Time Warner. C2.
 
Moody's Lowers Ratings on Mazda
Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on Mazda Motor's long-term unsecured debt to below investment grade, citing continued deterioration in the Japanese car market. C5.
 
British Newspaper Executive Quits
David Montgomery resigned as chief executive of Mirror Group, pressured to leave by board members and stockholders angry over his refusal to consider purchase offers for the company. Mr. Montgomery's departure opens the way for a takeover battle for one of Britain's oldest tabloid newspapers. C7.
 
Sotheby's Seeks Exclusive Deals
In an apparent attempt to undermine its archrival Christie's entry into the potentially lucrative on-line auction business, Sotheby's is asking art dealers to sign exclusive contracts that would prevent them from selling wares through other auction houses on line. B3.

HEADLINE: A Much-Shunned Terrorist Is Said to Find Haven in Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Abu Nidal, one of the world's most infamous terrorists, moved to Baghdad late last year and obtained the protection of President Saddam Hussein, according to intelligence reports received by United States and Middle Eastern government officials. The reports have raised questions about whether Iraq is pushing to establish a terrorism network, American and Middle Eastern officials say.
Abu Nidal, a brutal survivor of the Middle East's terrorist wars dating to the 1970's, had been living in Cairo for more than a year, according to Middle Eastern government officials who say they have information from inside his organization. While intelligence information about terrorist groups is hard to corroborate, American intelligence officials say they consider these Middle Eastern officials to be highly reliable. 
 Although Abu Nidal's organization is a shadow of the terrorist machine that staged airport killings in the mid-1980's and raids on Arab, Jewish and other targets, since he moved to Egypt he has been directing attacks on Islamic radicals at war with the Egyptian Government, the Middle Eastern officials said.
United States intelligence officials said he has been hard-pressed financially and has been seeking a new government sponsor since Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, looking for ways to persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions, backed away from him in the early 1990's.
Abu Nidal's move to Iraq, which he was forced to leave 15 years ago because of his ties to Syria, suggests that he may have renewed a relationship with President Hussein. "He could become a more significant threat again if he finds more effective state sponsorship," an American intelligence official said.
Abu Nidal still has 200 to 300 followers in his organization, and President Hussein lacks such hard-earned expertise at terrorism.
Officials caution that there is no evidence that Abu Nidal is planning to conduct terrorism on Iraq's behalf. In recent years he has not attacked American targets and thus has become a lower priority for American officials, who have focused instead on Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who officials say ordered the bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August.
But counterterrorism experts in the Middle East say Abu Nidal remains a significant threat. One official who has watched Abu Nidal for years said, "Osama bin Laden is a student by comparison."
About 10 days before American and British again attacked Iraq on Dec. 16, Abu Nidal traveled from Cairo to Baghdad through Teheran, Middle Eastern officials said.
Egyptian authorities have denied that he was recently in their country. But other Middle Eastern officials said Abu Nidal arrived in Cairo from Libya in 1997, and was in Egypt with the knowledge of Egypt's internal security service.
A coup attempt within his organization forced the Egyptians to take him into custody, which eventually drew wider attention to his presence in Egypt, posing a problem for the Government, the Middle Eastern officials said. Abu Nidal's move to Baghdad ended any embarrassing attention for Egypt, they added.
Though American officials had concluded that the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence services had blunted Iraq's previous efforts to sponsor terrorism, officials in Washington say that could change with the arrival of Abu Nidal.
Abu Nidal was once America's most wanted terrorist. A 1989 State Department report called his organization the most dangerous in the world, and a 1991 report calculated that it had been responsible for more than 100 attacks and the deaths of more than 280 people since 1974.
Abu Nidal, now about 60, is a Palestinian renegade who broke with the Palestinian Liberation Organization to launch his own terrorist campaign. He has had a long-running war with both the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan, accusing them of being too willing to compromise with Israel. He has vowed to kill both men, and the P.L.O. sentenced him to death in absentia in 1974.
Abu Nidal and President Hussein also have a tortured history, and their relationship is not built on mutual trust. Iraq helped Abu Nidal become an international terrorist in the early 1970's, but he left Baghdad in the early 1980's, in part because President Hussein had discovered that he was also working with Syria. "He was double dealing on Iraq," says one Middle Eastern expert.
Although he has a history of conducting terrorist acts on behalf of his hosts, Abu Nidal has also often worn out his welcome because of his willingness to betray his sponsors.
Reports last year that he was in Cairo proved awkward for the Clinton Administration because Egyptian support is vital to American policies in the region. Yet the United States has also expressed qualms about Egypt's counterterrorism, especially its ruthless tactics. The C.I.A. suspended a counterterrorism training program for a hostage-rescue unit from Egypt.
Washington did not press the Egyptians about Abu Nidal's presence: When the Administration asked about him last fall, Cairo denied that he was in the country, and Washington did not publicly protest.
Egyptian officials continue to deny that Abu Nidal was in Cairo, or that Egyptian intelligence was complicit in his terrorism. They note that Egypt was the victim of Abu Nidal in the past, and say their country would not deal with him.
"There is absolutely no foundation for any of these allegations," said an Egyptian Embassy spokesman, Abdelaleem Elabyad. "I was told to deny them in the most affirmative way."
American intelligence officials declined to comment on allegations that Abu Nidal conducted terrorist acts while in Egypt, or that the Egyptians knew of his actions. State Department officials said they were unaware of the allegations.
Born Sabri al-Banna in Palestine in 1938, Abu Nidal grew into a Palestinian nationalist. After briefly working in Saudi Arabia, he moved to Jordan and joined Fatah, the Palestinian movement that was the forerunner of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Arafat, the leader of Fatah, sent him to Sudan in 1969, and while there he apparently first came in contact with Iraqi intelligence officers. He briefly returned to Fatah headquarters in Amman, Jordan, but soon came to believe that Mr. Arafat was too willing to compromise with Israel.
Abu Nidal was next sent to be the P.L.O. representative in Baghdad, just as Iraq's relations with the Palestinian organization were souring. Baghdad refused to turn its army loose to support the Palestinians during the Black September uprising against Jordan in 1970. Abu Nidal, already out of favor with the P.L.O. leadership, allied himself with the new Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, and in 1973 he confiscated the organization's offices in Baghdad and declared that he had officially broken with the Palestinian group.
In 1973, with Iraqi weapons, training and intelligence support, he began a wave of terrorism when his group occupied the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Paris and took 11 people hostage.
Abu Nidal stayed in Iraq until November 1983, when he was forced out by President Hussein, who was seeking Western support in his war with Iran. Mr. Hussein had also discovered that Abu Nidal had established a secret intelligence relationship with Syria.
He then moved to Syria, staying until 1987 and carrying out a long string of terrorist acts against other Arab and Jewish targets, often working with Syrian intelligence. In 1986 he provided Syrian Air Force intelligence with the suitcase bomb used in an abortive attempt to blow up an El Al airliner in London, Middle Eastern officials say. A Syrian intelligence agent, Nezar Hindawi, was later convicted for trying to have his girlfriend carry the suitcase aboard an El Al plane at Heathrow.
But Abu Nidal once again had a falling out with his hosts after Syrian agents caught one of his lieutenants at the Damascus airport carrying sensitive documents and found weapons he had stored in Syria without their knowledge, according to Middle Eastern government officials.
In 1987 his organization shifted to Libya, while Abu Nidal moved to Poland for a year, where he was apparently protected by the Communist security service.
In Libya, internal feuds ripped his group apart. In 1989 and 1990, hundreds died in battles between Abu Nidal and dissidents supported by the P.L.O. who sought to take control of his operations in Libya and Lebanon.
In April 1998, after Abu Nidal moved to Egypt, a fundamentalist mosque in Sana, Yemen, was bombed. In July an Egyptian radical sheik, Mohammed Salah Abdal Mottalib, was killed at another mosque in Yemen. Al Hayat, a London-based Arab newspaper often used by militant groups, reported that one suspect in the killing was affiliated with the Abu Nidal organization.
Middle Eastern government officials also say his group was behind the mosque bombing and the attack on the sheik. In May 1998, the officials said, he met with a colleague, Rifqi al-Mahseri, and told him to plan the sheik's killing, but to act only after receiving a message from Abu Nidal.
On July 3, 1998, while living in Cairo, Abu Nidal was confronted by 10 members of his organization who wanted to end his control over the group. But the Government, tipped off to the coup attempt by a member of the group, convinced them to hold off. Two days later, on July 5, the Egyptians arrested Abu Nidal, and eventually ordered the 10 dissidents out of Egypt.
Abu Nidal was apparently able to order the murder of Sheik Salah from jail in Cairo, the Middle Eastern officials say. But his time in Egypt was limited. While it is not clear how long he remained in jail, the officials said, Abu Nidal remained in Cairo until his move to Baghdad.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Brazil Effect On Commodities;
Steel and Soybean Prices Dive (And Forget the New Tractor)

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 26

 BODY:
From a pit on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, Steven P. Bruce has been watching events in Brazil make the prices of wheat and soybeans swing with impunity.
"All commodity prices have been slipping," he said, shouting above a crowd of futures traders who were bidding down the long-term prices of a variety of commodities. "We will sell less wheat to Brazil and they will compete with us on soybeans; it's that simple." 
 While the overall economy remains vibrant, calculations by futures traders like Mr. Bruce are an indication that the crisis in Brazil is already reverberating in the United States -- both positively and negatively. As the value of Brazil's currency, the real, has dropped by more than a third in the last two weeks, the wholesale prices of a broad range of goods, including wheat and soybeans, have fallen 7 percent, according to key measures of commodity prices.
Indeed, the benchmark Commodities Research Bureau/Bridge index reached another recent low today, settling at 187.60, down 0.97.
All this comes on top of double-digit declines in commodity prices in the last few years. Prices for basic industrial products like steel have been similarly hit by events in Brazil. These declines are sending new shock waves through the United States' grain belt and industrial heartland.
For consumers, the drop in wholesale prices means that inflation -- which has been lower than at any time in recent decades -- is even more likely to remain in check. But economists and retailers say the lower wholesale prices will not necessarily translate into broadly falling prices at the supermarket or the auto showroom.
At the same time, bakers, benefiting from lower wheat and flour prices, will probably enjoy fatter profits. And auto manufacturers, which get just modest gains from the falling price of steel, will have a little more margin to play with.
Still, even if consumers are not reaping all the benefits of the drop in commodity prices, most economists see the outlook for inflation as extremely favorable. And as long as most Americans enjoy real pocketbook gains -- wage gains go further in the absence of inflation -- the United States economy should continue to enjoy steady growth this year.
"You'd have to go back to the 1960's to see this kind of environment," said Patrick Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the nation's Consumer Price Index. "While lower commodity prices might not generally translate into sharp declines in consumer prices, they translate into more stable prices. And viewing it from the point of view of the consumer, if you find that prices have not gone up, you're usually satisfied."
Of course, commodity prices started to decline well before Brazil stopped defending its currency earlier this month. Financial crises that began a year and a half ago and swept through Asia and Russia had already begun to dry up the demand for commodities worldwide, including some mainstays of the Midwest. And with steep currency devaluations in countries like South Korea, American exports have been competing against cheaper goods, forcing depressed prices lower. Brazil's problems have worsened the crisis abroad and the export price cycle.
"Brazil is really reinforcing the slowdown in the global economy," said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Securities.
At its simplest, Brazil's decision to devalue its currency means that the country will reduce imports while exporting its own cheaper products like iron and steel, soybeans, wheat and coffee. That could cause lower commodity prices throughout Latin America, forcing United States producers to sell their commodities for even less, and in some cases much less.
But while consumers and a lot of manufacturers have seen benefits from lower commodity prices, many basic industry- and agriculture-related companies have been suffering for months from the various foreign financial crises.
Cargill, the nation's largest private company and shipper of much of the world's grain, has lost money in the last two quarters. USX, which operates U.S. Steel, has idled one of its blast furnaces in Gary, Ind., and laid off contract workers.
U.S. Steel, which supplies galvanized steel to the auto industry that is usually sold on long-term contract, may have to lower its prices to compete with cheaper foreign imports. The price of soybeans, already down 40 percent from two years ago, may have to fall further because of decreased demand in Asia and elsewhere. In trading today at the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for March delivery settled at $5.14 a bushel, down 3.5 cents, a four-month closing low.
Economists say that ripples from the slowdown overseas are already causing losses for the nation's farmers. Problems are particularly acute across the northern tier of states -- from Illinois, where farmers are getting a cash price of just $2.07 for a bushel of corn, down from $3.97 a few years ago, to Idaho, where wheat is being sold at $2.69 a bushel, down from $5.49 a few years ago.
"This industry is not well," said Bill Flory, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, noting that many farmers in North and South Dakota are putting their land up for sale. "It's a liquidation year for the industry, and there's not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel."
Many Midwestern farmers are storing their corn and soybeans in huge grain elevators, in hope that prices will bounce back. But the Agriculture Department projects that 1999 could be just as weak as 1998, with farm exports expected to decline 10 percent further from their already depressed levels.
Instead of looking ahead to next year's crops, many farmers are retrenching, holding off on fertilizer purchases or that new pickup truck, and depressing those merchants' business.
"If farmers don't make money they don't replace their equipment," said Larry Mitchell, an Agriculture Department spokesman. "It means the local equipment dealer doesn't make the sale. The people who haul the equipment don't have anything to haul. The equipment maker doesn't make the equipment. This all begins to ripple."
Deere & Company, the nation's largest maker of farm equipment, said in November that it would lay off 2,400 workers, or 7 percent of its work force after demand for its tractors and combines plummeted. Now, with recession in Brazil, the company's problems are mounting.
Fewer farmers, for instance, are lining up to purchase Deere's new, $160,000 Maximizer combine. "People are cutting back," said Dick Gady, chief economist at Conagra, the giant food-processing company. "$2 corn doesn't buy them a lot of combines."
Just about any company that makes heavy equipment for the farm is being hurt. Even Caterpillar, which is the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, has seen its profit growth slow.
Cargill, which has more than 80,000 employees in 65 countries, says that its once-vibrant grain trade is sagging, and there has been weaker demand for food products in emerging nations.
"People out there just don't have the purchasing power to buy more food and better food," said Linda Thrane, a Cargill spokeswoman.
Around the same time, the steel industry has asked the Government to impose higher import duties on Japan, Russia and Brazil, asserting that they are dumping steel at a loss into markets here. In the last few months, several smaller steel companies have filed for bankruptcy protection. And bigger steelmakers are reeling. On Friday, for instance, U.S. Steel reported a 50 percent drop in profit from a year ago.
"If you go back to the 1970's, when the steel industry had it tough, it looks like that all over again," said William Szakacs, 50, an employee at Gary Works, the U.S. Steel mill in Gary, Ind., that is the largest in North America. "Things are getting tighter every day. There's not a lot of steel to roll."
For other companies as well as most consumers, the commodity collapse has brought benefits. Oil prices have declined because of slowing global demand, cutting transportation costs for big companies as well as for millions of Americans filling their tanks at gasoline stations.
Other commodities are more complex. In automobiles, for example, steel is just one component. There is only $700 worth of steel in a $25,000 vehicle, so prices will not be affected sharply, steel experts say.
And when it comes to food -- coffee, sugar, corn, soybeans for cooking oil and wheat -- Americans are not seeing significantly lower prices.
Indeed, even though the commodity price of wheat has plummeted 40 percent in the last two years, bread prices have increased slightly, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Food companies and retailers contend that is because commodities make up a small part of their expenses, which include labor and manufacturing costs, as well as substantial processing, transportation and marketing expenses. Many economists say that in fact food companies and retailers, particularly those that operate on low margins, enjoy heftier profits when wholesale prices drop.
So while Mr. Flory, who grows wheat on 7,000 acres of farmland in northern Idaho, sells his grain at some of the lowest prices in a decade, a company like Interstate Bakeries, the distributor of products like Wonder Bread and Hostess Twinkies, holds prices steady.
"There's no question from a cost perspective, a bakery would benefit from lower wheat prices," said Mark Dirkes, an Interstate spokesman. "Flour is the single largest commodity we purchase."
For every $1 decline in the wholesale price of wheat, he said, Interstate plans to pass along a 1.5-cent saving to the consumer. Still, despite the windfall from cheaper wheat, he said that the bottom line slipped at Interstate in the most recent quarter, primarily because of fierce competition and higher operating costs, including labor.

HEADLINE: Commission Nears a Consensus on Redesigning Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
A Federal advisory commission inched toward a fragile consensus today on a plan to redesign Medicare as a marketplace in which the Government would compete with private insurers. But Democrats insisted that elderly people get coverage for prescription drugs, raising doubts about whether the plan would save money.
No votes were taken. But it appeared that 8 Republicans were ready to join 3 Democrats in support of the basic framework proposed by Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the 17-member commission. 
 Today's debate, though vehement, was civil. After it ended, Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is co-chairman of the commission, said: "Nobody turned over a table and walked out. Nobody blew up the basic structure. People complained about parts of the proposal."
The panel, created by law in August 1997, is supposed to recommend ways of solving Medicare's long-term financial problems. The deadline for its final report is in just five weeks.
Commission members debated radical changes in Medicare that would affect virtually every baby boomer. Under Mr. Breaux's proposal, Medicare officials, rather than setting prices and reimbursing doctors and health care providers separately for each medical service, would offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to purchase insurance from a private health plan or from the Government.
Supporters of this approach say, without definitive proof, that it could save money because beneficiaries would be more sensitive to prices and premiums, and would shop around for the best deal. For the same reason, critics say, elderly beneficiaries would be more exposed to financial risks and ruin if health costs rose more than expected, as has often happened.
Liberal Democrats on the commission -- Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan and Bruce C. Vladeck, who ran Medicare for the first five years of the Clinton Administration -- denounced Mr. Breaux's proposal.
Mr. Vladeck told Senator Breaux, "You are disentitling a generation of American workers" to benefits they have been guaranteed since 1965. Mr. Dingell said Mr. Breaux assumed that "the private sector will have some wonderful mechanism, which I don't quite understand, to save money."
Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, enthusiastically supported Mr. Breaux's proposal. Two pivotal Democrats on the panel -- Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chief economic adviser to President Clinton, and Stuart H. Altman, a professor of health policy at Brandeis University -- said they could support it if elderly people were assured of prescription drug coverage in both the original fee-for-service Medicare program and in the private health plans.
"Drug coverage is the condition of my support," Ms. Tyson said in an interview.
Administration officials, while holding back public comment till they see the panel's final report on March 1, have told the commission staff that they have many concerns about Mr. Breaux's proposal. They worry, for example, that benefits would erode and that the Federal subsidy would become less and less adequate over the years.
It became clear today that President Clinton's recent proposal to use some of the Federal budget surplus for Medicare had altered the politics of the issue.
Senator Kerrey said the President might have made the commission's work more difficult because Mr. Clinton "left the impression that there are no tough choices, that it's fairly easy" to solve Medicare's financial problems. On the other hand, Ms. Tyson said Mr. Clinton's suggestion was helpful because it "put a new source of financing on the table" -- $650 billion to $700 billion over 15 years.
Drug companies fear that Medicare coverage of prescription drugs would lead to Federal price controls, which they say would reduce their profits and the money available for pharmaceutical research. But there may be ways of limiting the Government's role, commission members said.
For example, private companies could manage prescription drug benefits for Medicare, in an effort to obtain discounts from drug makers and pharmacies and to encourage doctors to use lower-cost drugs. Moreover, economists said, thought the manufacturers' average profit on each prescription might decline, the loss of revenue could be partly offset because the demand for drugs would increase if Medicare covered them.
Mr. Breaux said his proposal was likely to succeed because it was modeled on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which covers nine million people. Many lawmakers say H.M.O.'s can slow the growth of Medicare spending, but H.M.O.'s have dropped more than 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the last six months, saying Federal payments were not keeping up with their costs.
Under Mr. Breaux's proposal, a new Government agency, known as the Medicare Board, would supervise both the Government-run program and private health plans for the elderly. H.M.O.'s would have to provide the same types of benefits now covered by Medicare, but Congress would leave the details to be worked out in negotiations between the board and private health plans.
Commission members of both parties said they were dissatisfied with the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which now runs Medicare. Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, described it as "a huge, unresponsive bureaucracy."
Under Mr. Breaux's proposal, the Health Care Financing Administration would run the original Medicare program, but would no longer regulate H.M.O.'s. It would be given new power to negotiate prices and sign contracts with selected doctors and hospitals, so it could compete with private health plans.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Atlanta Games' Organizers Set to Face Questions

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 26

 BODY:
In the Olympic family, the Atlanta Olympic organizers have often been looked on as poor relations -- the long-shot bunch from this Southern city who were, in a stunning upset, awarded the 1996 Centennial Games, then managed to make a mess of them.
Before the 1996 Summer Games, they were criticized for being too crass in seeking sponsor dollars. During the Olympics, the Games, mocked by some as the "Bubba Games," were plagued by poor transportation, problems with the athletes' living quarters and a bombing. 
 At the end, in what was perceived as an international insult, the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, failed to call the $1.7 billion Games the greatest ever, a standard bouquet thrown to previous host cities.
Now, more than two years after the Olympic flame was extinguished in Atlanta, Olympic organizers here are set to face the most serious inquiry into their performance: did they do anything unethical in obtaining the Games in the first place?
The I.O.C., having uncovered widespread misconduct in Salt Lake City's effort to gain the 2002 Winter Games, has said it will investigate how each city for the last decade earned its designation as an Olympic site. For the moment, the Atlanta organizers have been almost defiantly confident.
"No cash, no scholarships, nothing illegal, unethical, inappropriate or untoward," Billy Payne, the chief architect of the Atlanta Games, said of his organization's efforts to win the Olympics. "We are more than delighted and willing to show that all that is good about the Olympic Games can be acquired following the bid rules and doing something as simple as making friends."
The Atlanta organizers are particularly defensive about their behavior during the bid process because winning the bid in 1990 was a rare and, by their telling, pure moment of euphoria. By their account, they began the bid process as a core of seven to a dozen civic-minded lawyers and bureaucrats who, on a relatively small budget of $7.4 million, traveled to more than 40 countries, befriending Olympic committee members through Southern charm and hospitality. Athens reportedly spent more than $30 million in its failed effort.
They say the gifts they gave ranged from the gimmicky -- pillowcases stitched with "Georgia on My Mind" -- to the more personal. When the late committee member from Cuba, Manuel Gonzalez Guerra, admired a ceramic bulldog on Payne's desk, the former football star at the University of Georgia bought a live bulldog and made sure the dog had its shots and was waiting on the plane when the Cuban member left.
Charlie Battle, the bid committee's roving ambassador, said he was aware of the so-called agents, or vote brokers who claimed they could deliver members, but said he was never approached by them. He joked that the worst indignity he suffered was having to brave the icy, polluted waters of the Danube River to swim with a granddaughter of a Slovak I.O.C. member.
"I can say that I never asked anyone if they were going to vote for us," said Battle, who traveled to more than 40 countries to enlist support for Atlanta's bid.
There were other actions, however, that perhaps pushed at the margins of appropriateness and that ultimately spurred others to speak of what became known as the "Atlanta model."
This past weekend, Australia's Olympic chief, John Coates, said that Andrew Young, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations and an Atlanta bid committee member, had toured Africa dispensing aid commitments in exchange for support for Atlanta's successful bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Coates's remarks came as he explained why he pledged $35,000 each to the Olympic committees of two I.O.C. members from Africa in a last-ditch effort to ingratiate himself with voters. Sydney was awarded the 2000 Summer Games by 2 votes over Beijing, 45-43.
"I drafted the original strategies, and early on had identified that we had to do something in Africa," said Coates, who offered no evidence of his allegation against Young. "I came to grips with that because I knew that's how Atlanta had achieved it, so I didn't feel uncomfortable."
Through a spokesman, Young denied the allegation. "It was an irresponsible comment by John Coates," said Lee Echols, the spokesman. "It really upset Andy. It was an insulting comment to make." Young has been traveling, and has not returned several telephone calls.
The former Atlanta mayor, who has maintained ties to Africa throughout his life, has a long relationship with one of the key figures in the Salt Lake City scandal -- the I.O.C. member from the Congo Republic, Jean-Claude Ganga. He was one of six committee members expelled Sunday by the organization's executive board after it found he had accepted direct payments, free medical care, gifts and travel subsidies amounting to $216,010 from Salt Lake City's organizing committee.
Young has acknowledged that in August 1990 -- a month before the bid vote -- he went to the Congo Republic with sports equipment. Doug Gatlin, executive director of the committee then, said he was with Young when they delivered 50 soccer balls, 100 handballs and 200 pairs of gym shorts, all of it donated.
"We handed it out directly to kids in the villages," Gatlin said. "He has enormous respect in Africa because he helped put Africa on the U.S. radar scope while serving for President Carter. He helped make human rights in Africa part of the theme of the Administration. He never needed to bribe anyone."
Gatlin said Young never promised foreign aid on their trips to Africa. Referring to himself, Gatlin said he made calls to international sports organizations to inquire about coaching and athletic exchange programs, but nothing more. He said he shared Young's belief that their work fell under humanitarian aid and not under vote buying.
Many African nations benefited from Young's and the Atlanta organizers' attentions, but the Atlanta organizers emphasize that it was after the Games were awarded to the city. When told by Mozambique officials that their female marathoners couldn't afford proper foods, for example, Young helped send food and protein supplements to the country.
After getting the Games, the Atlanta organizers helped set up a training center for African athletes in LaGrange, Ga. With funds from local residents and the I.O.C.'s Olympic solidarity program, the training center hit full stride in 1994, with 20 athletes from Africa and the Mideast. They also allowed an association of African nations, headed by Ganga, the unusual privilege of marketing its own merchandise during the Games. Host committees are usually vigilant about honoring licenses to the paying rights holders.
"We had told every country that we intended to set up a training center for weather acclimation, and that we'd help in whatever way we could to make sure teams and athletes got here," Battle said. "We wanted every country to have an opportunity to compete in the games. But it was never a 'vote for us and we'll do this' kind of deal."
As soon as Atlanta won the 1996 Games over Athens, the Atlanta organizers said they contended with the rumors about how they did it. The Greek news media charged that Coca-Cola -- one of the Olympics oldest sponsors -- bought the Games for its home city. "That's one of the biggest myths," Battle said. "Heck, Coke would rather have them in Beijing, where there's 400 billion potential Coke drinkers."
Coca-Cola's Olympic spokesman, Ben Deutsch, said the company policy was not to provide financial support to any host-city bid.
In 1991, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Atlanta Olympic officials offered I.O.C. members gold credit cards, free heart surgery and scholarships for their children, as well as cash. The Atlanta organizers vigorously deny the charges. Two incidents involving two of the I.O.C. members implicated in the corruption scandal, however, have been acknowledged by Payne.
David Sibandze, a member from Swaziland, had a heart attack while visiting during the bid process. Atlanta organizers paid for part of his treatment while Piedmont Hospital absorbed the rest. Sibandze resigned from the I.O.C. over the weekend after it was discovered that his son was given a job at the Salt Lake City Economic Development Office.
And Payne said he made calls in 1991 to the University of Georgia on behalf of the stepson of the I.O.C. member from Russia, Vitaly Smirnov. The stepson was enrolled at Georgia from 1992 to 1994, but received no scholarship money from the school, according to university officials.
"It was nine months after the vote, and all I did was make some calls like I often do when asked by friends," Payne said.
Several Atlanta officials say they were approached in a subtle fashion by certain members "to meet privately" or to discuss Atlanta's "chance of winning," including once before the vote in Tokyo.
And so the Atlanta organizers insist that they will answer fully and honestly a letter expected to arrive any day from the I.O.C. asking for details. They are currently reviewing documents chronicling the two years spent chasing and entertaining Olympic committee members across the globe. But they have refused to make those records public.
For Payne, this last look at Atlanta's Olympic experience offers a chance for, if not vindication, some reclamation of the Atlanta Games' legacy. "Hundreds of thousands of Georgians spared no effort in welcoming the world into our state and community," Payne said. "I represented them and they should know, as I do, that we shouldn't bow our heads. We should all feel good about it."

HEADLINE: State Will Increase Aid to Most, but Not All, Schools

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The Whitman administration announced today that it would budget $5.2 billion in state aid to public schools for the coming fiscal year, the highest allocation ever in a state that already spends more per pupil than any other in the nation.
While not all school districts will benefit, the new budget represents a $330 million increase in education money from the previous year, and more funds for special education, early childhood programs and improved technology. 
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said the increased spending in education is possible largely because an improved economy has driven up tax receipts and the windfall from the nationwide tobacco settlement has provided an additional financial cushion.
"The state's economy is in excellent shape," the Governor said, "and I can think of no more important place to invest our resources than in the futures of our children."
Under the education spending plan for 1999-2000, 405 of the 596 districts in the state will get more money. But it will mean less money for 191 districts, and it revives a perennial debate in New Jersey over how best to finance public schools.
The state provides aid to all districts to help with transportation, special education and bilingual education programs. Most districts are also given additional aid on a per-pupil basis, depending on need, while wealthier districts must carry more of the burden through property taxes.
Last year, in an effort to close the financial gap between rich and poor districts, the state began relying on data from 1995 state income tax forms instead of information from the 1990 census to determine a community's local wealth. In some districts, like Randolph Township Schools, the income tax data showed greater wealth, which meant a decrease in state aid.
"We've become wealthier overnight, but we can't seem to find the money," said John Battles, the Superintendent of the Randolph Township Schools.
Initially, based on the new data, Randolph's allotment of per-pupil aid would have been reduced to $3.57 million in the next fiscal year from $6 million in the current year. But to help soften the blow, the state decided to cap the loss of per-pupil aid at 2 percent. For Randolph, that means a cut of $892,000.
Dr. Battles said his district, with a growing enrollment that now stands at 5,000 and the highest SAT scores in Morris County, also happens to have very little industry, so it depends mostly on residential state property taxes for its education dollars.
"Any aid formula that penalizes a growing district, where we have low costs and high academic performance," Dr. Battles said, "is an aid formula that is flawed."
Dr. Battles said the district had formed a committee to examine how to reduce costs. So far, district officials are considering dropping one period from the high school day. With eight periods rather than nine, the district would need fewer teachers and would save about $500,000. Randolph is also considering the elimination of a team-teaching concept in the middle school that allowed teachers, in groups of four or five, to take time out to discuss curriculum plans and meet with parents. Putting those teachers back into the classrooms for the period would save another half million dollars, Dr. Battles said.
Also new this year, school districts will be receiving their state aid allocation based on more accurate enrollment figures. For districts that have grown in the last few years, there will be an additional infusion of cash, in some cases canceling out losses from the new income data.
But for the Toms River Regional District, which has a growing enrollment, the new provision will not help, because of the extent to which its income and property wealth has increased, and because the district has fewer special education students. The district will lose $2.9 million.
Cherry Hill will lose $1.9 million, also because of income increases and a decrease in the number of special education students. And Middletown Township, in Monmouth County, will lose $1.8 million because of an increase in its property wealth, even though enrollment has remained flat.
Lynn Strickland, executive director of the Garden State Coalition, which represents the state's wealthiest districts, pointed out that already, about 240 of the state's districts, or about 40 percent, receive no per-pupil aid. Only a third of districts were in the same category in 1991, she said, but this year, as another sign of the growing wealth in the state, another handful have joined their number.
"It means more communities are relying primarily on their property taxes to fund schools," Ms. Strickland said. "And that means that property tax rates go up in those communities every year to pay for schools."
Frank Belluscio, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said the new financing formulas were unfair to many districts.
"We've never believed that income should be used as a factor to determine state aid," he said. "Property values, yes, but if income is going to be used, it has to be phased in very, very slowly. Too many districts are losing a significant amount of money under these new formulas."

HEADLINE: Budget Offers Rise in Municipal Aid

 BODY:
Aid to New Jersey's 566 municipalities would rise $16.3 million for the fiscal year that begins in July under the state budget proposed Monday by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the state announced yesterday.
Newark tops the proposed list, at $100.9 million in aid, while Pine Valley, with all of 21 residents, is to get $2,546, according to figures from the State Department of Community Affairs. In all, state aid would total $1.6 billion, The Associated Press reported. 
 The figures are calculated assuming passage of legislation that pegs aid to a Government cost index derived from, but lower than, the rate of inflation. The index, known as the implicit price deflator, is 1.5 percent for the coming budget year. The legislation is scheduled for a vote by the Senate and Assembly tomorrow.
William Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said he would welcome the use of an inflation index as a long-term way to help local governments meet rising costs.
But Mr. Dressel said he was disappointed by the proposed budget's 14 percent increase in municipalities' annual contributions to the statewide police and firefighters pension fund. Mr. Dressel said, "I see where pension increases are going to eat up most of those increases, and you say, 'Where's the relief?' "

HEADLINE: THE POPE'S VISIT: THE OVERVIEW;
POPE SETS FORTH A MORAL AGENDA IN ST. LOUIS VISIT

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Ignoring the moral lapses of President Clinton, Pope John Paul II flew to St. Louis today and addressed the broader moral issues facing the nation.
In a crowded airport hangar, the Pope referred to the Dred Scott decision upholding slavery in 1857. He called the case, which was heard here, a "time of testing" that the United States failed.
"America faces a similar time of trial today," the Pope said. "Today, the conflict is between a culture that affirms, cherishes and celebrates the gift of life and a culture that seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped and others considered 'unuseful' -- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection."
The President and Mrs. Clinton greeted the Pope, who shook hands with them briefly before turning his attention to the cheers and outstretched hands in the first row of seats. There, he blessed about 2,000 people -- mainly Roman Catholic families with young children selected by their parishes -- and bent over to pat a small child.
 Mr. Clinton, who guided the fragile Pope down a red carpet with a protective hand on his elbow, smiled broadly and introduced him to people in the audience like a solicitous host.
Many people throughout the world had been tut-tutting about the uneasy juxtaposition of the highest moral authority of the Roman Catholic Church shaking hands with an American President on trial on charges related to extramarital sex. Mr. Clinton looked completely at ease. And the Pope was unlikely to have been shaken by Mr. Clinton's noisy scandal.
The Vatican's main concern seemed to be that the Pope's message to Americans not be drowned out by the awkward iconography of the moment. A year ago, the breaking Clinton scandal overshadowed coverage of the Pope's visit to Cuba.
"Only a higher moral vision can motivate the choice for life," the Pope said to strong applause. "And the values underlying that vision will greatly depend on whether this nation continues to honor and revere the family as the basic unit of society."
Afterward, the two leaders sat on white armchairs posing for photographs before their 20-minute meeting. They exchanged a few words, and Mr. Clinton told reporters that he, following the Pope, was planning his own trip to Mexico soon.
"We want to increase the involvement of the United States," Mr. Clinton said, words that seemed intended to please his guest, who throughout his stay in Mexico had repeatedly reminded the United States of its responsibility to poorer nations in Latin America. "I am looking forward to hearing what the Holy Father has to say about his trip."
The Vatican has often expressed its opposition to some areas of United States policy including abortion, the death penalty, the bombing of Iraq and the Clinton Administration's delay in signing the international treaty banning land mines.
John Paul's prepared text had references to those issues, but the Pope skipped over them in his speech. Vatican officials said that even in private the Pope was unlikely to raise issues where the disagreements between Washington and the Vatican were deep, longstanding and well known.
Instead, the White house said the two men discussed the need for continental solidarity and stressed the role of the United States. The Pope praised American efforts to help victims in Central America, as well as United States efforts to promote religious freedom in totalitarian countries. The Pope alluded to abortion by emphasizing the need to protect all human life. They also discussed Mexico and Cuba. The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Vals, said they did not discuss the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
The White House said the Pope told Mr. Clinton he "and all American leaders" were in his prayers.
The Vatican was fully aware ahead of time that the State of Missouri had decided to postpone the execution of a death-row inmate while the Pope was in St. Louis. The Pope apparently did not mention it. On the plane from Mexico, the Pope's spokesman described the postponement as a "mockery."
For John Paul, who spent four days in Mexico engulfed by adoring crowds who lined up by the tens of thousands along his motorcade routes, camped out overnight in front of the Vatican's diplomatic residence in Mexico City, where the Pope stayed, serenading him all through the night, the thin welcome at the St. Louis airport was starkly different.
For security reasons, crowds had been discouraged from going to the airport, and the sidewalks along the motorcade route into the city were empty. When his plane left Mexico, thousands of people climbed onto rooftops for miles all over the city and flashed mirrors to glint like stars in farewell.
By the time the Pope reached Kiel Center in St. Louis, a huge indoor sports arena, to address a raucous, strobe-lit youth rally, the mood warmed up.
The crowd of 20,000 teen-agers waved yellow scarves, screamed and chanted "We love you" as the Pope drove into the arena in a white golf cart blessing the crowds. Before the Pope entered the arena, he was greeted by Mark McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinal, who is a Catholic.
John Paul urged the youths to train for their vocation as Catholics the way McGwire and Sammy Sosa would train for the World Series.
"Christians are always in training," he said. "Freedom is not the ability to do anything we want," he warned. "Rather, freedom is the ability to live responsibly the truth of our relationship with God and with one another."
Sean Asher, 15, who drove to St. Louis from Springfield, Mo., to see the Pope along with his Catholic youth group, said, "He's a really awe-inspiring guy. You've got to see him in person; pictures just aren't enough."
Mr. Clinton did not attend the rally, and instead flew back to Washington.
The Pope has met with President Clinton three times, always cordially, but neither Washington nor the Vatican claims their relationship to be anything more than that. If anything, it may be less; Mr. Clinton dismayed the Vatican when he took communion at a Mass in Soweto, South Africa, in March last year. The Pope never said anything publicly, but John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, expressed his disapproval openly and firmly.
Vatican officials have never publicly discussed the Lewinsky affair or Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial. The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano ran a neutral article on the scandal the day the President was impeached.
Privately, Vatican officials make the same kind of jokes about the scandal as officials and diplomats in other European capitals. But church leaders have not entirely hidden their disapproval from their followers. Avvenire, the daily newspaper of the Italian Catholic bishops' conference, has printed regular reports. A few have quite vividly expressed deep disapproval of the American President and the voters who continue to support him.
A columnist for Avvenire, Romanello Cantini, wrote last July: "Unfortunately, the average American, converted by widespread permissiveness and complete indifference to what goes on in the private domain, no longer seems to be shaken by old-fashioned puritan indignation. The majority of Americans believe that Clinton has lied but that he is above all a simpatico Pinocchio who must be forgiven that his nose is growing at least as long as the economy grows alongside it."

Raise Lending Rates

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As details begin to emerge regarding President Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of the Social Security reserves in the stock market (letters, Jan. 26), I was struck by the fact, mentioned in a Jan. 20 news article, that the plan assumes an annual rate of return of 6.75 percent, which would be 3.8 percent more than the average for Treasury bonds, which is where the reserves are invested now.
The Government has been getting a good deal from this arrangement, borrowing money at very low interest rates and lowering its interest burden by not having to go to commercial sources to borrow. 
 It seems to me that if the Government paid more reasonable interest rates for its access to the Social Security reserves, the whole idea of having to go to the stock market, with its inherent risks, would evaporate.

HEADLINE: As Expected, Coca-Cola Reports a Weakened 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Confirming the bad news it had warned Wall Street about last month, the Coca-Cola Company reported its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, which showed that the global soft-drink giant suffered significant declines in volume and revenue in many parts of the world.
Even though much of the damage had been expected, Wall Street seemed unsettled by the details. Shares of Coca-Cola fell 37.5 cents, to $62.5625, after losing about 3.5 percent at one point during the day. 
 Net income fell 27 percent, to $597 million, or 24 cents a diluted share, compared with $817 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The earnings were in line with analyst expectations, which had been revised after a meeting with Coke's senior managers last month.
Coke's revenue for the quarter was $4.46 billion, down 5 percent from $4.7 billion. While its costs declined by 11 percent, its selling, administrative and other expenses rose 7 percent. Operating income declined by 20 percent, to $937 million from $1.17 billion, and the company posted a $71 million loss in equity income, largely from the company's selloff of some bottling operations and losses encountered by some bottlers that it still owns.
The company's spending on marketing and other expenses rose to $2.22 billion in the quarter, nearly 50 percent of its revenue. Case volume sales fell 1 percent worldwide in the quarter, but individual countries revealed more drastic declines.
Volume dropped 3 percent in Brazil, the company's second-largest international market, and rose just 1 percent in Japan, the source of 20 percent of Coke's profits. Volume in Japan for the full year was flat, the company said.
"Japan is crucial to their near-term and long-term outlook," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, who added that the situation there remained "sticky" for the foreseeable future.
Volume fell 1 percent in Germany, Coke's fifth-largest market, in the fourth quarter and was down 2 percent for the year. South Africa sales fell 14 percent for the quarter because of deteriorating economic conditions that began with the devaluation of the rand in May, a Coca-Cola spokesman said.
The bright spots included the United States, where sales increased by 5 percent in the quarter; China, where sales grew by 24 percent, and India, which posted growth of 26 percent. Worldwide, Coca-Cola's volume rose 3 percent for the year, compared with 10 percent in 1997.
Earnings for the full year were $3.5 billion, or $1.42 a share, compared with $4.1 billion, or $1.64 a share, in 1997. Annual revenue was $18.81 billion, down slightly from $18.87 in 1997.
The company's full-year earnings statement highlighted various bottler acquisitions and investments, including an acquisition in Russia, the spinoff of Coca-Cola Beverages from Coca-Cola Amatil, another anchor bottler, and investment in bottling businesses in India.
Full-year results were affected by the fourth-quarter performance. In Latin America, volume grew just 7 percent, compared with 12 percent in 1997. In the Middle East and Southeast Asia, operating income declined 7 percent for the year, primarily because of currency devaluation.
"The key driver for 1999 will be how well will key profit centers like Japan and Germany perform," said Andrew M. Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He expects currencies to stabilize, which should benefit the company, which he estimates lost 12 cents a share in earnings for the year because of currency devaluations.
"There's not an awful lot they can do," Mr. Goldman said. "Sometimes, they're not the master of their own destiny."

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
The Last Gasp For the American Living Room

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
WITH the nonchalance of Zeus and Hera leaning over the balcony of Olympus, Chris and Vivian Tai, two prospective house buyers visiting a model home in Mount Kisco, N.Y., peered down from a landing and hurled a few thunderbolts at the living room below.
 "Who needs it?" said Mrs. Tai, 33, a computer programmer, although she conceded that a living room might come in handy on occasion -- "so that my kids can practice the piano and they'll be far enough away that I won't have to hear them." 
 Let us consider the dwindling circumstances of the American living room, once so central to the domestic universe that Tom Wolfe, in "Bonfire of the Vanities" (1987), described it with acid admiration as "this gloriously stuffed little planet."
Yet, during a recent visit to the Mount Kisco model home, not one person in a steady stream of visitors stepped across the threshold into the living room. Instead, they made a beeline straight back to the double-height family room, a congenial open space adjacent to the kitchen, where they chatted amiably on Dumbo-size sofas or gathered about its unlit fireplace as if it were a 51-inch television screen.
Pity the living room's polite suite of sofas and armchairs. In matching white brocade, they looked as coolly unapproachable as a museum diorama. The telltale sign of customer indifference: No cushion bore a single dent.
"The living room is gasping its last breath," said Wayne Foley, a builder in Great Falls, Va., and a member of the design committee of the National Association of Home Builders. It is shrinking in size as well as prestige: in 1978, the living room in a typical model by Toll Brothers -- builders of upscale houses, including the present one in Mount Kisco -- measured 20 feet by 13.4 feet. The one the Tais viewed last week had shrunk to 15 feet by 13 feet. Its decline has fed the voracious family room, which in the 70's was a youth Siberia south of the mudroom: here it has ascended and grown to 20 feet 8 inches by 15 feet.
Last summer, when Country Home magazine built a show house at the World Financial Center based on an informal reader survey, it had no living room at all. "It just didn't appear on anybody's wish list," said Dennis Wedlick, the architect. Taking its place were a double-height medieval "great hall," which ran the length of the house with two huge chandeliers and a cyclopean fireplace, and a family "gathering room," with kitchen, at the rear.
Carol Sheehan, Country Home's editor in chief, was thrilled when she saw no living room in the floor plans. "I thought, 'Hurray!' " she recalled. "There's no life, no living there. I could live without it. In fact, I already am." She added that in her own home, a Cape Codder in Ashfield, Mass., everyone tends to congregate around a wood-burning stove in the kitchen. "When I pulled in a love seat, the kitchen became the most comfortable room in the house," she said.
Mr. Wedlick's design for the Country Home show house attracted a developer, Gerald Hines, who commissioned him to design similar houses with loftlike plans and, Mr. Wedlick said, "no rooms defined in the traditional sense." The 2,800-square-foot homes will be constructed this summer in Carbondale, Colo.
Mr. Foley in Virginia, way ahead of the curve, eliminated the living room in his own house back in the 70's and now finds customers telling him they don't want one, either. He said: "For years, you heard people saying, 'My parents never used it and I'm not using it.' And finally they're confident enough to say, 'So don't give me one.' "
And when it comes time to renovate, the family room is again the winner. Kermit Baker, an economist at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, said, "It just makes a lot of sense that the family room would grow at the expense of the more formal living room." He added: "Most of the renovations in the last 10 to 15 years have been generated by baby boomers making more livable space for their growing families. The last thing they need is more formal space -- they need space for playing around."
A BRIEF history of the post-World War II suburban home, the aspirational archetype for housing all over the world, shows how inextricably the living room's fortunes have been bound to the ever-expanding family room. The living room in America was a 19th-century invention, evolving from a small parlor reserved for "at home" receptions into a large gracious space with a fireplace meant for the entire family to enjoy. After World War II, parents found they needed to put some distance between themselves and their baby-boom children. So the "rec room" was born, tucked away in the basement where ritual games of Twister could be enacted without wreaking havoc on the rest of the house. A precedent was established: the family room was fun; the living room, its furniture frozen in Scotchguarded perfection, was serious, the place to face the vacuum-cleaner salesman.
No surprise, then, that the television set, at first a welcome novelty in the living room, soon followed the children out. But the most serious blow to the living room's sense of purpose came when the family room hitched up with the kitchen to be crowned grandiloquently by builders as the great room or gathering room. This movement started in the 70's (the Toll Brothers were building them even then), but it really took hold in the 80's. The combination of television and easy access to the fridge was hard to beat: soon, even the fireplace turned cold on the living room. Today, those Electrolux meetings happen in cyberspace.
"We hardly know what purpose the living room is supposed to serve anymore," said Akiko Busch, the author of a forthcoming book, "Geography of Home." "We don't need it. As the rest of the house becomes much less private, the living room has fallen through the cracks."
Changes in the family are also having an impact on the shape of the home. According to the 1990 United States Census, half the households in America consist of married couples without children, while one-quarter of the population live alone. Traditional three-bedroom family home life has given way to houses for two-career couples, empty-nesters, the remarried with children, gay couples and the extended family with in-laws at home.
With demographic change has come the breakdown of the need for rooms at all, a notion of informality popularized by television shows like "Friends" and "Home Improvement," which hint at the kind of open-plan living so beloved by early modernists.
"What we're seeing is a reconfiguration not only of the demographics of the home but of the very notion of public and private domains and appropriate spaces for work and leisure," said Gwendolyn Wright, author of "Building the Dream: A Social History of Housing in America" (Pantheon, 1981). She sees families moving farther away from artificially segregated, sex-related zones -- the men's den, the women's parlor -- toward an entirely open, multifunctional space.
Without children at home, "the need for acoustic and visual privacy is less compelling," said Terence Riley, curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. This summer, Mr. Riley is planning to examine the impact of all the new forces shaping the architecture of the home in his exhibition "The Un-Private House." The show will cover everything from a loft for Wall Street traders furnished with little more than trading screens and television sets, to a house where digital screens replace walls, to kitchens where recipes (even images of chefs) are projected on the backsplash, to dining rooms inhabited by virtual guests -- all places where one can be alone but always connected.
But the brave new home, Mr. Riley said, owes a lot to the past, namely "the medieval hall where spaces were essentially loftlike, in the sense that they were large and open and used for multiple functions." These great halls were not even specifically domestic in nature but were public as well, in the manner of today's living-and-working arrangements.
As revolutionary in conception as in looks, a new home designed by Preston Scott Cohen, a Boston architect, for Eric Wolf, an artist, is true to the medieval order. "Eric wanted to be able to see everything all at once," Mr. Cohen said. "We didn't discuss the space as rooms at all, but as places to sit, places to eat and places to sleep." Mr. Wolf, who lives alone and wanted as few walls and furnishings as possible between himself and the landscapes he paints, said he planned "to haul furniture in" as occasions arose.
IT'S not necessary to go to a museum to see radical change. Steven Harris, a co-editor with Deborah Berke, of "Architecture of the Everyday" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1997) and a professor at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture, notes that even that model of decorum Celebration, the town created by the Walt Disney Company near Orlando, Fla., has homes with a futuristic spin. He points out that behind those classic Southern verandas and beyond small vestigial living rooms "decorated like a mausoleum," the rooms are giving way to generic space. "You realize people are actually living in a vast warehouse," he said.
David Weekly, a Texas developer who designed several models at Celebration, deliberately put realistic interiors behind nostalgic facades. "The notion that people would come visit you to be entertained and to be served in the living room just doesn't happen anymore," he said.
Defenders of the living room say that its obituary is premature. "The 'death of the living room' reminds me of the 'death of the theater' -- it's not going to happen," said the architect Robert A. M. Stern. "Where are you going to entertain the in-laws when they come to meet you? As you climb the corporate ladder, where are you going to bring your associates? You can't take them into the family room, where your 9-year-old is eating dinner and playing video games. Give me a break."
Back at the Toll Brothers show house in Mount Kisco, Marcia and Michael Cooney, both 52 and relocating from Michigan, liked the living room, however tiny, for their antiques. "Even if it's a room that will never be used, it's nice to have for display," Mrs. Cooney said.
But the living room may have a value beyond its image-conscious displays, said Bill Stumpf, author of "The Ice Palace That Melted Away" (Pantheon, 1998), a book of essays about design and society. Mr. Stumpf, the designer of the first ergonomic chair, has seen his own children and grandchildren abandon the living room. Yet, he praises its civilizing influence, calling it "the most photogenic room, the home of the Christmas tree, of taking family portraits, holding weddings and, historically, funerals."
But perhaps it is the designer Kitty Hawks who most adroitly taps into the subconscious desire to hold on to the living room, for a while at least. Asked to describe a great living room, she recalled one in the Dakota on Central Park West that once belonged to the glamorous Amanda and Carter Burden. "It was when they were impossibly young and rich and beautiful," she said, already sounding dreamy. "Their living room had pale blue glazes on the wall and the curtains were pink silk. I remember the rug as an Aubusson, or at least a very good Oriental. It was like they were playing grown-up, but the gentleness of the pastel colors was so welcoming. Mostly, I remember that the room made everyone look great."
Now how many glorified kitchens can you say that about?

HEADLINE: China's Suicide Rate

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Suicides Reveal Bitter Roots of China's Rural Life" (front page, Jan. 24) exposes the shockingly high suicide rate of rural Chinese women, but does not mention one important factor partly responsible for these tragedies: 
 The lack of social security in rural China has made living with one's extended family the most common living arrangement for the elderly and the young. In such families, the young daughters-in-law have the lowest status, bear the greatest burden and are in frequent conflict with their mothers-in-law. For some of them, committing suicide is not only a way to escape suffering, but also a way to exact revenge, since many Chinese people believe that the dead can return to life to get even with their enemies.

HEADLINE: Euro Hits 2-Week Low Against Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The euro fell to a two-week low against the dollar yesterday on expectations the United States economy's growth will keep growing at a faster rate than those of the 11 nations that have joined Europe's single currency.
Traders said the chances of an interest rate reduction in Europe had increased, which would make assets denominated in euros less attractive. 
 The euro fell to $1.14300 in New York, from $1.15530 on Wednesday.
The economy of the euro region "is clearly weaker than people thought," said Paul Brain, who helps manage more than $17 billion at Investec Guinness Flight in London.
The German Finance Ministry appears to agree. It said the European Central Bank may have to exert an "economy boosting" influence on the German economy this year, hinting the Government anticipates the benchmark interest rate -- currently 3 percent -- will be cut. The ministry forecast growth in Europe's largest economy would slow to 2 percent in 1999 from 2.8 percent in 1998.

Blue Chips Decline 124.35 In a Profit-Taking Session

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for the first time in three sessions yesterday as investors took profits before Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Selling was particularly pronounced in computer and bank shares. But it was another good day for Internet stocks, which were lifted by better-than-expected earnings reports from Amazon.com and Ebay. After the market closed, America Online released fourth-quarter figures that also beat estimates. 
 Still, two stocks fell in price for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Big Board, volume was 894 million shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average gave back all its gains from Tuesday, falling 124.35 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,200.23. Declines in I.B.M., J. P. Morgan and Chevron were the biggest negative influences on the blue-chip index. Computer-generated sell programs were responsible for virtually all the Dow's decline.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 9.14, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,243.17. And the Nasdaq composite index, which has been on a torrid pace this year, declined 26.27, or 1.1 percent, to 2,407.14. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell 4.21 points, or 1 percent, to 421.12. But Thestreet.com's index of 20 Internet stocks gained 14.51, or 2.8 percent, to 534.60.
Despite the broad-based selloff, analysts said the decline was orderly and understandable.
"The market is at price levels that concern me, but there is no sense that this is anything beyond profit-taking and hesitancy ahead of Mr. Greenspan's remarks and what people are certain is going to be a strong report on the economy on Friday," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. This morning, Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to testify before the Senate Budget Committee. And on Friday, the Commerce Department is expected to release its first report on fourth-quarter economic growth.
"It was a great day for Internet and some technology stocks and not much else," said Karl Mills, executive vice president at Junka & Voyles, a firm based in Oakland, Calif., with $5 billion under management.
It was a particularly good day for Ebay, the on-line auction company.
Ebay, which reported its fourth-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday, soared 82 5/8, to 303 1/2. The company said it earned 7 cents a share in the fourth quarter, comfortably beating consensus estimates of 4 cents a share. It also said it would split its stock 3 for 1.
But the session was a dismal one for First Union and other bank stocks. First Union led bank shares lower after it said higher expenses and an accounting change would cut into its profits this year. The stock fell 4 7/8, to 52 3/16, after the report.
BankAmerica lost 2 13/16, to 62 1/8. J. P. Morgan slipped 4 3/16, to 100 1/16. And Mellon Bank fell 2 3/16, to 64 15/16.
I.B.M. and Compaq Computer led computer shares lower. I.B.M. lost 7 5/16, to 178 5/16. And Compaq, which has seen its stock price more than double since early October, fell 1 3/4, to 47 1/2, despite posting fourth-quarter results that were better than expected.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Says Americorps Workers Can Help With Census

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
To help count Americans for the 2000 census, a House Republican leader said today that he would call on volunteers from Americorps, the national service program that, as a favorite of President Clinton, House Republicans have tried to eliminate.
The proposal was in a package of measures that Representative Dan Miller of Florida, the census subcommittee chairman, said would help insure an accurate count, now that the Supreme Court has ruled that the census must reflect a head count, not statistical sampling, for the apportionment of Congressional seats. 
 Republicans and Democrats disagree over whether the court ruling allows for sampling methods to be used for other purposes, like determining state legislative districts. The prospect of a second count has led to the possibility that the census will produce two different population numbers for some places.
Speaking at a forum sponsored by the United States Conference of Mayors, Mr. Miller said the Americorps volunteers would be part of an additional 100,000 counters who should be hired to work in communities where accuracy had been most difficult to achieve. For the 1990 census, the Government used more than 500,000 counters at one time or another.
"When a Republican proposes to expand the Americorps program," Mr. Miller said, "you know something is different. But if we're going to have Americorps, I can think of no better civic service than helping count America."
Americorps was created in 1993 with $365 million from Congress for its first year of operation, 1994, when 20,000 volunteers were placed in jobs. Since then, the program has endured attacks from many Republican House members who have favored ending the program. But with Democrats joining Republicans who support it, Americorps has generally emerged each year from the budget process in better shape than before. The current appropriation, $435 million, represents a third straight year of increases, and there are now more than 40,000 volunteers.
Harris Wofford, a former Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania who is Americorps' chief executive, said in an interview that he was "delighted that Congressman Miller has joined the chorus of people who were skeptical about Americorps coming to see its value and need."
Mr. Wofford acknowledged a paradox in Republicans' seeking Americorps workers for the census after passing legislation in 1966 that barred their securing positions from Federal agencies. To have them collect census data, he said, would require new legislation.
"I don't really want to be the one who says it's ironic," Mr. Wofford said. "I'm out fishing for more support to make national service non-partisan."
To insure greater accuracy in 2000 -- capturing people hardest to find, including low-income families in urban and rural communities, members of minorities and homeless people -- Republicans have favored improving the counting techniques while Democrats have supported the use of statistical sampling. Both parties believe that the people hardest to find tend to vote Democratic.
Mr. Miller said his plan would go a long way toward achieving a fuller and more accurate count. Besides enlisting Americorps volunteers, he proposed allowing local leaders to review data, expanding school programs that raise awareness of the census, sending a second questionnaire to households that did not respond the first time and increasing to 33, from 5, the number of languages in which census forms are printed.
Mr. Miller said he could not predict how much his measures would cost. But "if more is needed," over projections of $4 billion to $6 billion, he said, "I will support it all."
John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said Mr. Hastert was "totally supportive" of Mr. Miller's proposals but had not reviewed the plan's components.

HEADLINE: Turmoil Fazes Philip Morris Only a Bitas Revenue Rises

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Despite domestic price increases for cigarettes and weaker demand from overseas, revenue at the Philip Morris Companies increased 6.4 percent and underlying earnings rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the company reported yesterday. Full-year earnings for 1998 grew by 8.9 percent, to $3.17 a share.
The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. Nevertheless, the company's share price fell yesterday by $1.8125, to $46.4375, on a day when the stock market declined. Several analysts said jitters about more lawsuits against tobacco companies caused the stock slide, although it appears increasingly unlikely that the Federal lawsuit President Clinton mentioned in his State of the Union address will go forward. 
 One analyst, Emanuel Goldman of Merrill Lynch, said the company's cigarette sales in the United States were off only about 1 percent, even though Philip Morris raised its prices by more than 20 percent, or 45 cents a pack, in November. The company was the first to raise prices after the tobacco industry reached a $206 billion settlement with 46 states, although other companies quickly followed suit.
"They seem to be managing their pricing reasonably effectively," Mr. Goldman said of Philip Morris executives. "They are offering discounts to minimize the sticker shock and phasing in the net price increase. What they have in mind is minimizing the trading down by consumers from Marlboros to minor brands, because the lion's share of the money this company makes is from Marlboros."
The company said that its market share rose to 52.6 percent and that Marlboro sales rose to 37.6 percent, their highest level ever. At the same time, the company's sales costs, general and administrative costs went up almost 45 percent in the quarter, suggesting deep promotions and other expenses, said Marc Cohen, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Philip Morris said net earnings were down 79 percent, to $274 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, mostly because of $3.8 billion in tobacco litigation settlements. Without those considerations, the company said, its earnings rose 9 percent in the quarter. By contrast, net earnings were $1.3 billion, or 53 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1997.
Operating revenue in the recent quarter reached $18.4 billion, up from $17.33 billion.
The company's Kraft Foods division increased revenue by 7.2 percent, to $3.1 billion, in the quarter, although profits were pinched by higher costs for cheese and other dairy ingredients. The company said sales of such products as frozen pizza, Lunchables meals, Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee all grew. Altoids mints turned in double-digit growth, the company said.
Kraft announced a voluntary retirement program for 600 employees yesterday and said it would take a $150 million pretax charge for it in the first quarter of this year. The program is expected to generate $50 million in pretax savings annually.
Overseas, income from tobacco sales rose 10 percent, though volume fell 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Marlboro sales grew 3.8 percent in markets ranging from Western Europe to Japan. Sales declined in Eastern Europe and Russia, reflecting weakened economies there.

HEADLINE: Social Security: The Basics, With a Tally Sheet

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
When President Clinton unexpectedly used his State of the Union Message last week to propose vast changes in the way Social Security is financed, he touched off what may become the hottest policy debate of the year.
No other Government program has ever been relied on by so many people. Nor has one been so popular or so expensive. And probably no other measure affecting the general public is so complicated and so misunderstood. 
 As a guide in following the debate, here is a primer describing the basics of the program, its problems and its politics and what the President and the Republicans in Congress want to do about it.
 
Social Security And How It Works
A payroll tax is imposed on almost all workers and their employers -- 6.2 percent each on all wages below $72,600. (The workers and employers pay an additional 1.45 percent each in Medicare taxes.)
Nearly 90 percent of the money is now used to pay monthly benefits. Most of the money goes to retirees and their widows and widowers. A much smaller amount is paid to the survivors of workers who died before they retired and to disabled people.
Today's workers are taxed to pay retirement benefits for their parents' generation. When today's workers retire, their benefits will be covered by their children's generation. The principle is different from an investment or an insurance policy, in which individuals pay premiums and the income from those premiums is used to pay their benefits later.
When, as is now true, the Government receives more money in Social Security taxes than it must pay in benefits, the reserves are credited to a trust fund. The money is invested in Government bonds. The interest on the bonds is credited to the fund.
The trust fund is no more than a bookkeeping entry, a collection of Government i.o.u.'s promising to pay benefits to future retirees. This obligation will be fulfilled only to the extent that politicians are willing to raise the necessary money through taxes or borrowing. But as a political matter, it is an obligation that would be hard to ignore.
For years, the surplus in the trust fund has been used to meet part of the operating expenses of the Government and to offset part of the overall budget deficit. But this is no longer necessary because, for the next 15 years, the Government is expected to run a total budget surplus of $4.4 trillion.
 
The Problem: Graying of the Babies
Despite today's surplus, the future is far from rosy.
The ratio of workers paying taxes to retirees drawing benefits has long been shrinking. In 1950, there were 16 workers for each Social Security beneficiary. Today, there are slightly more than three. By the second or third decade of the next century, when most baby boomers will have retired, actuaries project there will be only two people at work for each person receiving benefits. When that happens, unless changes are made, the trust fund will go into the red.
The latest estimate is that Social Security taxes will continue to exceed benefits until 2013. Because of interest payments owed on the bonds credited to the trust fund, the income in the fund will be more than what is paid out until 2021. After that, the trust fund will begin to shrink rapidly year after year until the money runs out in 2032.
Economists and politicians agree that the sooner the problem is addressed, the less painful and abrupt the solution will be.
 
The President's Proposal: Surplus, Stocks and Savings
The President's plan would keep the Social Security tax and benefit structure. He has proposed giving 62 percent of the budget surplus over the next 15 years to the Social Security trust fund, $2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion projected surplus. (The rest would be spent on Medicare, the military and other programs.)
Of the $2.7 trillion, Mr. Clinton proposed that the trust fund invest $700 million in the stock market. The White House insisted that steps would be taken to insulate the investments from political tampering, but no details were offered.
The other $2 trillion would be used to buy Government bonds from the public to lower the outstanding public debt -- the sum of all the annual budget deficits over the decades -- from nearly $4 trillion to less than $2 trillion. As a proportion of the total economy, the national debt would fall from about 45 percent today to 10 percent in 2014, the lowest level since the nation entered World War I.
Mr. Clinton sees three advantages for Social Security in this approach:
*Historically, the average return on stock investments over a long period has been much higher than the return on Government bonds. The return on stocks is about 7 percent above the rate of inflation, as against 3 percent for bonds. Over the next 50 years, based on the long-term average return of stocks, investing $700 billion in the stock market instead of Government securities would extend the life of the trust fund by five years, the White House says.
*Paying off $2 trillion in public debt over the next 15 years should strengthen the economy by lowering interest rates and opening the way for more productive private investments. A stronger economy would increase the number of people working and the size of their paychecks and make it less painful for workers to pay the taxes needed to support Social Security.
*The interest on the $2 trillion in additional bonds would be credited by the Treasury to the Social Security trust fund, increasing the amount promised for retirement benefits.
These proposals, the President believes, would extend the life of the Social Security trust fund until 2055.
In addition, the President would allow people ages 65 to 69 to continue to work and receive full benefits. Under the existing law, their benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 earned. And the President would improve benefits for widows. But he offered no means of paying for these additional benefits.
Outside of Social Security, Mr. Clinton would set aside $500 billion from the surplus to create "universal savings accounts." To encourage workers to save and invest, the Government would give low- and middle-income Americans seed money to invest in their own accounts in financial markets. Then the Government would match a portion of people's own money that they invested, similar to the way that many companies match their employees' contributions to 401(k) plans.
The White House concedes the plan would not fix Social Security's problems for good and that ultimately, to keep the program solvent for the next 75 years, taxes will have to be raised or benefits cut. But Mr. Clinton avoided dealing with this question. For the present, his proposal would not require any sacrifice by taxpayers or retirees.
 
The G.O.P. Position: A Work in Progress
The Republicans, who control Congress, have not developed a single proposal of their own. But they are united on three points:
*The Government should not invest in the stock market.
*The Social Security system should be overhauled so that workers could themselves invest in financial markets some of the money they now pay in taxes.
*The 62 percent of the surplus that the President wants to use for Social Security is the proper proportion, but much or all of the rest of the surplus should be used for tax cuts.
Republicans say Government investments in financial markets would be a mistake as a matter of principle and of economics. They say it would give the Government too much control over private companies. And they argue that the return on investments would be reduced because politicians could not be prevented from abandoning fiduciary responsibility and voting, for instance, to prohibit investments in companies that make cigarettes or firearms or contraceptives.
One approach considered by Republicans would allow workers to invest part of what they now pay in Social Security taxes. Guaranteed Social Security benefits would have to be reduced accordingly.
Another Republican approach would be to maintain the current Social Security tax and benefit structure but give workers an income tax cut if they invested the money in retirement accounts. This would eventually cause the Federal deficit to rise again if other taxes were not raised or spending cut to offset the income-tax cut.
 
The Politics: Tinkering With an Icon
Social Security was born in 1935 over Republican opposition, and Democrats from Franklin Roosevelt through Bill Clinton have trumpeted it to their political advantage.
Whenever Republicans have tried to tinker with the system, they have suffered politically. For instance, Republican support for a cut in benefits was seen by many as a reason the party lost control of the Senate in the 1986 elections. In the 1995 budget struggle with Congress and in his 1996 race for re-election against Bob Dole, President Clinton made headway with his accusation that Republicans wanted to cut Medicare, Social Security's close cousin, in order to give a tax cut to the wealthy.
The President and Republicans in Congress agree that sooner or later a solution must be found and that it must be bipartisan. But given this history of political mistrust and the added divisions arising from the President's impeachment, it will be extraordinarily difficult to reach an accord this year.

HEADLINE: Gun Liability Suit Is Built On Poor Data, Analyst Says

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
In a lawsuit seeking to hold gun manufacturers liable for shootings with illegally obtained handguns, an economist testified yesterday that the plaintiffs' main contention was based on flawed statistics.
The economist, Gustavo Bamberger, attacked the plaintiffs' case that the manufacturers oversupply dealers in states with weak gun-control laws, particularly in the South, and that many of the excess guns end up in the hands of illegal traffickers who resell them in states with tough gun laws, like New York. 
 His testimony formed the heart of the companies' case in fighting the potentially precedent-setting suit, now in its fourth week of trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
The plaintiffs -- relatives of six people killed with illegally obtained handguns in the New York City area, and a seventh person severely wounded by such a gun -- maintain that the gun makers are collectively liable for the shootings, even if it cannot be proved which company's gun was used in a particular shooting. They argue for such liability because, they say, the companies market and distribute handguns so negligently that they foster illegal trafficking in the weapons.
But Mr. Bamberger, a specialist in statistical analysis, told the jury that the plaintiffs' "whole measure of oversupply is unreliable."
Reviewing figures offered earlier by the plaintiffs' economic consultants, Mr. Bamberger said that even if some states were oversupplied with guns, oversupply explains "virtually nothing" regarding why guns go from one state to another.
Mr. Bamberger noted that the plaintiffs' consultants, from National Economic Research Associates, a New York company, had estimated oversupply of newly manufactured handguns in various states by estimating the difference between the sales of such guns in the states and the "legitimate demand" for them. But the way they calculated the estimates of sales and legitimate demand was flawed because it was based on data that were too limited, said Mr. Bamberger, the vice president of Lexecon, an economic consulting company in Chicago.
He said the plaintiffs' consultants had projected the sales of new handguns in various states largely by using figures on sales that eight wholesalers made to dealers over the last decade. But considering that there have been an estimated 3,000 wholesalers in this period, and that the 8 accounted for only about 11 percent of such sales nationally, the sample was too limited to be valid, Mr. Bamberger said.
He also maintained that the sample had led to an exaggerated estimate of sales to dealers in the South because one of the eight wholesalers did most of its business in the South.
The plaintiffs' lawyers have said they used whatever sales figures they could pry out of an industry reluctant to provide the information, and the plaintiffs' consultants have defended their projections from the data.
Mr. Bamberger also contended that the estimates of legitimate demand in the various states were unreliable, and probably too low, because they were based on warranty cards filled out by buyers of guns made by Smith & Wesson. He said many buyers did not return such cards to the manufacturer. Smith & Wesson is among the defendants.
On cross-examination, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Michael S. Feldberg, got Mr. Bamberger to admit that he did not challenge the plaintiffs' estimate, based on Federal data, that 90 percent of handguns used in crimes in New York State in recent years were originally sold in other states, often in the South.
"I just challenge the explanation behind it," he said of the plaintiffs' case.

HEADLINE: Pataki Presents A Tight Budget, Despite Surplus

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
After a two-year detour into government largess, Gov. George E. Pataki today returned to the conservative path of his early years, proposing a $72.66 billion state budget with substantial cuts in health care and education. He proposed eliminating programs aimed at expanding prekindergarten classes and lowering class sizes.
Though the state is flush with money, with a surplus expected to top $2 billion, Mr. Pataki called for a spending increase of just 1.8 percent in the fiscal year that begins April 1. That follows a 13 percent increase in spending, in part on education and Medicaid, during the two previous years, which helped enhance the Governor's popularity and propel him to a second term last November. 
 Mr. Pataki proposed deep cuts in Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, and in tuition assistance for low-income college students. Anticipating a continued decline in welfare rolls, he asked for a sharp drop in welfare spending.
The Governor called for an increase of barely 1 percent in aid to schools, to $11.9 billion. He sought to back away from a 1997 agreement that called for several years of spending increases to make kindergarten and prekindergarten available in every community, and to reduce class sizes in the early grades.
"This plan chooses smarter government over bigger government," the Republican Governor said in his annual budget address. "It commits to smart ideas that work. It better meets the needs of our citizens. And it does all this at a cost the people can afford. Not one nickel more."
The plan, the opening salvo in the Governor's annual budget struggle with the State Legislature, drew venomous responses from Democrats, who declared it dead on arrival, and from legions of interest groups predicting dire consequences.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, asserted that the budget had less to do with New York than with Mr. Pataki's ambitions for national office. He said the Governor had tailored his policies to appeal to conservative Republican primary voters in other states.
"In one stroke of this budget, he eliminated everything that we stood up for," said Mr. Silver, who was the chief sponsor of the 1997 deal to expand school programs. "It's unacceptable, this budget."
Medicaid, the largest part of the budget at $28 billion, has long been the Governor's favorite target for cuts. New York spends more on the program than does any other state, and its costs have tended to rise faster than those of other programs.
Hospital groups estimated the full impact of Mr. Pataki's latest proposed Medicaid cuts at $727 million to $850 million, most of it in lower payments to hospitals and nursing homes. Mr. Pataki contended that when a tax cut for medical institutions that he is proposing is included, they will lose less than $600 million.
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said: "He's creating a dire fiscal situation for hospitals and nursing homes throughout New York. If these policies go forward, there will be layoffs, service reductions and significant reductions in the quality of the health care system."
Mr. Pataki's $11.9 billion school aid proposal set off a sharp exchange between his aides and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's surrogates. Under the Governor's plan, New York City schools, with 38 percent of the state's public school students, would get 12 percent of the additional aid.
Joseph J. Lhota, Deputy Mayor for Operations, linked the budget and the Governor's appointment of a commission last weekend to investigate mishandled school construction contracts in New York City, and possible fraud in attendance figures at some city schools. "It appears that the commission is cover for the cut that they want to have for the New York City schools," he said.
Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's communications director, said state support for city schools has grown much faster in recent years than the city's contribution.
In only a handful of areas would Mr. Pataki significantly increase spending: the Office of Children and Family Services, a much-criticized agency that is supposed to monitor and prevent child abuse and run the foster care system; the state prison system, which would get more operating money and a new maximum-security prison, and school construction, which would continue a strong three-year rise in state support.
The Governor also proposed a $120 million increase, to $580 million, in state support for child care programs for the poor, including people trying to leave welfare. And he would dedicate $200 million to a new job-training effort for welfare recipients.
Most areas of spending, like school aid, would essentially be frozen, with increases too small to keep up with inflation.
As he promised, the Governor's budget would not spend any of the state's huge surplus, instead salting it away to help pay for tax cuts that are already law, but have not taken effect. He also mentioned two programs he had announced recently: steps to rein in the state's rapidly growing debt, including using money from the nationwide tobacco settlement; and almost $1 billion annually in new tax cuts, most of which would not go into effect for a few years.
So far, Mr. Pataki's fiscal policies have been like a roller coaster ride, and the reactions have been no less head-swerving. In his first two years, to close budget gaps and pay for tax cuts, he held spending essentially unchanged by cutting health care and other programs. He was widely excoriated as an unfeeling conservative, and his popularity plummeted.
But as Wall Street boomed, the state found its coffers overflowing with tax revenues. State spending rose more than $3 billion in 1997-98, then more than $5 billion this fiscal year, even as the state continued to cut taxes. Mr. Pataki's standing soared, and he cruised to re-election.
The new budget may be more restrained, but it is a reflection of the last two years' free-wheeling ones. In addition to pouring record sums into popular programs, the 1997 and 1998 budget deals included tax cuts that have barely been felt yet, but whose sizes would climb yearly, to almost $4 billion a year in 2001. It is because of that combination of spending increases and promised tax cuts that Mr. Pataki now feels that he must be more restrained.
The Governor scoffed at the notion that any plan that built on those increases could be called austere. The spending increases are small, he said, but "one of the reasons is that we've done so much."
Many analysts said the last two budgets set a course for fiscal collapse, but they praised today's plan as a correction. "We think that the Governor deserves support for standing up for fiscal prudence," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission.
The 1997 budget agreement centered on one large trade. The Republicans, including the Governor, got a cut in property taxes levied by school districts. It started at $700 million this fiscal year and would grow to $2.7 billion in 2001-02.
In return, the Democrats won a commitment to make all-day kindergarten, and prekindergarten classes for 4-year-olds, available in every system in the state, and to lower class sizes in kindergarten through third grade. It also included an increase for school construction. All told, the package promised a series of increases, over and above any increases in basic school aid, reaching $1.3 billion in 2001-02.
Only the construction money would survive Mr. Pataki's budget. He eliminated more than $300 million in promised increases for the other parts of the program.
The Governor asserted that he would replace the program with $200 million in block grants to school districts, but that money could be used for almost any purpose. Not counting those grants and the program they replaced, aid to schools would actually decline in Mr. Pataki's plan.

HEADLINE: Crowd of 200 Greets Suspect In the Slaying Of an Officer

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 27

 BODY:
Police dogs lunged and growled, officers and dispatchers wept with relief and citizens applauded as detectives led a homeless Hartford man into the police station here today where he was charged with murder in the shooting of an East Hartford police officer on Saturday night.
The suspect, Noel Sostre, 23, was led through the gantlet in the handcuffs that once hung on the belt of the 26-year-old policeman he is accused of killing, Officer Brian Aselton. 
 Mr. Sostre was delivered to the police station in the police cruiser that Officer Aselton had driven. He was led past a framed photo of the officer and through a door draped in a black shroud.
Mr. Sostre was charged with 10 crimes, including capital murder, which carries the death penalty. Bond was set at $5 million.
The killing and search had drawn hundreds of officers from central Connecticut and hours of live coverage on local television. The suspect had been questioned first in the Hartford police headquarters, and the crowd in East Hartford, across the Connecticut River from the capital, built to about 200 over several hours as word spread that he was being transferred.
Gov. John G. Rowland said at a news conference later in the afternoon that Mr. Sostre had provided "a full written confession." Late this afternoon, the police charged two women with helping with the crime, and officials said they, too, had given statements admitting involvement.
For four days officers from the Connecticut State Police and 23 local departments had searched ponds, roofs, fields and culverts in search of evidence, using dogs, a helicopter and metal detectors. Young officers checked nightclubs and areas known to be frequented by drug dealers, looking for someone who knew something.
A reward fund grew to $80,000.
The break came on Monday night, an unexpected tip from what amounted to a random encounter. A car was stopped for speeding on Main Street in Hartford, and when the officer decided not to give the driver a ticket, a grateful occupant volunteered information that led officers to the three suspects, said an official involved in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Police Chief James W. Shay said the reward offer had played "a significant role" in encouraging the tipster.
Officials said Mr. Sostre, also known as Alex, came to the United States from Puerto Rico about 10 years ago, and had been living with his wife in Hartford. But he told officials that for the last four months, he has been homeless. He is unemployed, prosecutors said. He has been convicted of a felony in Connecticut, and has a criminal record that includes using a vehicle without permission, larceny, assault, and failure to appear in court.
In an effort to protect the informant, very little information about the arrest was released today and officials sealed the affidavit for the arrest warrant. At a bond hearing for Mr. Sostre in Superior Court in Manchester, prosecutors agreed to release the document to Mr. Sostre's court-appointed lawyer, but insisted that it not be shown to him.
Bond was set at $3 million each for the two women, who live in adjacent apartment buildings in Hartford. Nency Forty, 29, was charged with capital murder and six other crimes. Erica Vilchel, 23, was charged with felony murder and four other crimes.
When Mr. Sostre was brought to the police station, he was wearing a plaid shirt, black pants and low-topped boots without laces. He kept his head down and did not answer shouted questions. When he was arraigned four hours later, he spoke to Judge E. Curtissa Cofield of Superior Court through a Spanish translator. Four rows in the cramped courtroom were filled with East Hartford officers, wearing black bands on their badges.
Mr. Sostre was on probation in an assault conviction at the time of the shooting, the authorities said. He is to appear in court next on Feb. 2. The two women are to be arraigned on Thursday. The police said that more arrests were possible, but that "the main players" were now behind bars.
Officer Aselton was killed on Saturday night when he came upon what authorities believe was a robbery and assault while he was investigating a complaint about noise in an apartment building. Investigators said that Officer Aselton was shot in the forehead at close range and that a resident of the building had just been beaten and robbed.
A backup officer found Officer Aselton, mortally wounded, and the building resident near him. The beating victim, who has since been released from the hospital, was able to give the police an assumed name of one of his assailants, but not the real name.
Relatives and officers said they could take some comfort in the arrests as they gathered for a wake for Officer Aselton tonight. State troopers plan a ceremonial two-mile march to his funeral in South Windsor on Thursday.
Bouquets, some with red, white and blue ribbons, continued to pour into the police station, along with a teddy bear in a Harley-Davidson sweater in tribute to Officer Aselton's interest in motorcycle racing.
A letter from a couple who called themselves "average citizens" was posted on the window of the dispatch center. "As my husband and I rested, safe and comfortable in our East Hartford home on Saturday night, this young man gave his life to keep us that way," the woman wrote. "I wish I could have thanked him."

HEADLINE: Straying Fiscal Conservative Returns to His Roots

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In presenting a spartan budget, Gov. George E. Pataki sought today to reclaim his reputation as an unwavering fiscal conservative and to expunge the memories of a spending surge during his re-election campaign that caused some of his most faithful supporters to grouse that he was as eager to sign checks as any old Democrat.
Other Republican Governors eying their national standing, including Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and George W. Bush of Texas, are trying to make their marks in this year of good economic times and swollen government coffers by advocating innovative spending programs, particularly for education. But Mr. Pataki seems to have concluded that he can cement his statewide popularity and burnish his image around the country largely by promoting tight-fisted fiscal practices, including significant tax cuts. 
 "In a state where the guiding principle is respect for the people," he said in today's budget address, "big government and big government taxation simply does not compute."
Mr. Pataki may feel that he has to propose a lean budget, at least if he wants to hold up his tenure nationally as a model of prudent management that turned around a state many in his party thought was foundering because of that liberal icon, Mario M. Cuomo.
In the current budget, spending is slated to rise by 8 percent, an amount that left many conservatives cringing and questioning Mr. Pataki's commitment to their beliefs. In the next one, which begins April 1, he proposes growth of 1.8 percent, less than the rate of inflation. He is also calling for Albany to keep in reserve a current surplus that is expected to top $2 billion to insure that the state's finances are not battered by an economic downturn.
If the Governor had again sought a large spending increase -- even before the Legislature pushed its own new programs -- he would essentially be undoing the work of his first two years in office, when he kept a tight rein over the budget. The signal would be that last year was not an election-year aberration but a fundamental shift in course. Mr. Pataki would also be raising the alarms not only of conservatives, but also of many fiscal monitors, who contend that the current rate of growth is unsustainable.
New York State has for decades had one of the worst fiscal records in the nation, including the largest debt of any state by far. Mr. Pataki's proposal would for the first time seek to check the increase in debt.
"He's returning to his fiscally conservative roots," said Thomas Carroll, president of Change New York, an advocacy group that had long backed Mr. Pataki, only to upbraid him over last year's increases. "He had a consistent record from his days in the Assembly and Senate and his first two years as Governor of being very hawkish on keeping spending under control and cutting. In the run-up to the election, that obviously was suspended. It is clear that he is going back to positions that he has held a long time."
Still, the Governor is taking pains not to flaunt his agenda as overtly conservative, mindful that New Yorkers are generally hostile to the style of Republicanism symbolized by the party's southern wing. In his speech and in comments later, he rarely if ever used ideological terms or the word "conservative," relying instead on phrases like "achieving fiscal balance."
His budget was also not as provocative to the Legislature and some advocacy groups as his first one in 1995, which called for sharp cuts and led to months of vitriol between the two branches of government.
When asked today about complaints from some lawmakers that his proposal was too austere, Mr. Pataki repeatedly noted that in the last two years he had spearheaded sizable increases in education and other spending. "Last year we were criticized because we provided so much more help to local governments and schools," he said at a news conference. "This year, they're saying, 'Why didn't you do enough?' Well, one of the reasons is that we have done so much last year -- record school aid increases for the second year in a row."
Whatever the Governor's overall record, Democratic lawmakers are certain to try to portray this new budget as part of an insidious plan to court Republicans nationally by using the state as a laboratory for archconservative policies.
"More than ever, we can see now that this is more of a national political agenda than it is doing the right thing for New York State," said Michael J. Bragman, a Syracuse-area Democrat who is the Assembly majority leader.
The Governor dismissed such criticism, though he declined to say how the budget might play to the party. "My budget is guided by my view of the best interests of the future of the people of New York," he said. "It is focused on New York. And that is the motivation, and that is what I hope the Legislature focuses on, so that we can meet the needs of the people quickly and move forward."

HEADLINE: Highlights From the Governor's Spending Proposal

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's $72.66 billion spending proposal would increase the size of the state budget by 1.8 percent, or $1.3 billion, figures that include Federal aid for programs like Medicaid and welfare. The total derived from the state's own money would also increase by 1.8 percent, to $49.3 billion.
Here are some highlights of the plan: 

MEDICAID -- Without any changes, the program would have grown to almost $29 billion next year, because of built-in increases to account for inflation. But Mr. Pataki is calling for a $266 million reduction in state spending for the program. When matching Federal and local contributions are factored in, his proposal means that there would be at least $727 million less next year for the program than the level it was on course to reach. That money would come mostly from cuts to hospitals, nursing homes and home-care providers. Mr. Pataki's plan would lower Medicaid reimbursement rates by $374 million for hospitals, $239 million for nursing homes and $114 million for home-care providers.
The Governor is seeking to eliminate, in part, a complex reimbursement system that in most cases pays hospitals, nursing homes and home-care providers based on the rate of inflation and the cost of specific procedures. He proposes to replace that system with set fees for each patient. The Pataki administration believes that such an approach would encourage health care providers to lower their costs, because they would be permitted to keep any Medicaid dollars that they did not spend.
 
SCHOOL AID -- After two years in which the Governor and the Legislature have approved record increases in spending for primary and secondary education, Mr. Pataki has proposed a more modest, 1.3 percent increase for schools next year -- worth $154 million to a proposed $11.91 billion. Of the total increase, $17.5 million would go to New York City schools.
Mr. Pataki also backed away from a deal that he made with the Legislature in 1997 to finance a program that would pay for all-day kindergarten and prekindergarten in communities across the state, and decrease the size of classes in the first, second and third grades. Mr. Pataki instead proposed to provide school districts with a more modest cash grant that they could use for programs of their choosing.
Mr. Pataki called on the Legislature to provide slightly more than $2 million to help community groups and others pay for the costs associated with opening so-called charter schools, which operate outside of local school boards' control. He also renewed his call for overhauling the state's program for educating disabled children.
He said the current system provides educators with a financial incentive to classify children as disabled, even when those children could be taught in regular classroom settings.
WELFARE -- The bulk of Mr. Pataki's proposed $345 million decrease comes from a sharp decline in the welfare rolls, which have fallen by more than 600,000 recipients since the Governor took office in 1995, a 36 percent decrease. But unlike in previous years, Mr. Pataki is not proposing cuts in cash grants or other services for the poor.
Instead, Mr. Pataki would increase spending on child care for the poor, mostly welfare recipients -- by $120 million -- to $580 million. Mr. Pataki also proposed setting aside $200 million in a reserve fund that counties could use over the next three years to cope with increasing demands for child care.
 
HIGHER EDUCATION -- The proposed $135 million of savings in this area -- to a total of $4.87 billion -- would come from cuts to the state's Tuition Assistance Plan. Mr. Pataki has proposed reducing the financing for the plan to $501 million for next year from this year's $633 million.
Mr. Pataki's proposal would wring most of that savings by reducing the maximum grant from 90 percent of annual tuition costs to 75 percent. The proposal would change the income eligibility for the program so that fewer students would qualify and reducing awards to students who do not take a full course load, which is expected to hurt poorer students because they must often take fewer classes to leave time for work. The Governor's plan also essentially freezes spending for the state and city University systems.
 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE -- Of the $70 million increase the Governor is proposing for criminal-justice agencies -- to a total of $1.83 billion -- Mr. Pataki is setting aside $21 million to operate a new 1,500-bed, maximum security prison in Franklin County, near the Canadian border. The proposed increase also includes $18 million to replace aircraft in the New York State Police Department's aging fleet.

To the Editor:
Thomas Geoghegan (Op-Ed, Jan. 24) relies on anecdotal evidence rather than statistics to argue that American employers steal increasing amounts of their employees' leisure time. 
 By insisting that most of unpaid labor is off the books, Mr. Geoghegan would reject statistics like those gathered by researchers at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank that show that the number of hours worked each week by a typical American worker fell from 39.8 in 1950 to 36.9 in 1973 and to 34.4 in 1996 -- a particularly noteworthy trend, since it corresponds with a period of decreased labor-union power.
In fact, there is ample evidence indicating that American workers enjoy more leisure time today than at any time in the past. For example, the amount of inflation-adjusted dollars that Americans spend on recreational activities has more than tripled since 1970.

Shaky Union Connection

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas Geoghegan (Op-Ed, Jan. 24) argues that workers work more hours for less pay because, among other reasons, unions cover only 10 percent of the private work force. 
 However, unions have been declining in power since the mid-1950's. Moreover, during the mid-1980's, nonagriculture union membership was already quite low (17 percent), but concurrently, there were strong wage increases followed by higher inflation. Mr. Geoghegan's argument also does not explain why many European countries with much higher rates of union membership have also recently experienced low inflation.

HEADLINE: Nafta Invoked to Challenge Court Award

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Some business executives have argued for years that large jury verdicts against big companies show that American courts are out of control.
Now a Canadian company that lost a huge case against a competitor in Mississippi is using a novel legal tool to seek at least $725 million from the United States Government. 
 Legal experts say the claim, the first against the United States under a little noted provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement, will encourage other companies to try the new tactic. And critics say the precedent could provide a potent back-door way for corporations to challenge the American legal system.
Loewen Group Inc., a Canadian funeral home company that lost a $500 million verdict in a 1995 Mississippi suit over fraudulent business practices, announced last fall that it had filed an international arbitration claim against the Government.
But Loewen's specific assertions and the large sum it was seeking were secret until this month. Among other things, Loewen, which is based in Burnaby, British Columbia, said the verdict against it was "infected by repeated appeals to the jury's anti-Canadian, racial and class biases."
Some legal experts said the Loewen claim advances a creative but plausible legal argument. Other experts said the case would test whether international trade agreements will be a new forum for business discontent with the American court system.
"It is an important case because it raises the question of the extent to which domestic civil judicial proceedings will be subject to international re-examination," said David W. Leebron, an expert on trade law and the dean at Columbia Law School.
The claim asserted that the Government should pay Loewen damages for what the company said was unfair treatment in the suit it lost to a Mississippi funeral home entrepreneur, Jeremiah O'Keefe 3d. Loewen settled the Mississippi case for $175 million in 1996.
In its claim, Loewen is seeking compensation not only for what it paid under the settlement but also for damage to its business.
The North American Free Trade Agreement promises fair treatment to foreign investors. Loewen said the court proceedings against it breached that promise, and argues that the Federal Government is responsible for the damage it says it suffered. But even some of those who were most involved in the debate over the trade agreement five years ago say they did not anticipate claims based on court verdicts.
Loewen's settlement with Mr. O'Keefe would stand no matter what happened in the arbitration panel designated under Nafta, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is a division of the World Bank. Under Nafta's rules, the arbitrators are to be selected from a roster of international trade and investment specialists. Each side is to select one arbitrator with a third to be chosen by agreement of the two sides. The panel is likely to be named soon, with proceedings to follow within a few months.
If the United States loses, public funds would be used to pay Loewen. The case does not involve the Canadian Government.
In its claim, Loewen attacked the Mississippi verdict, which involved a jury finding that Loewen used fraudulent practices to try to drive Mr. O'Keefe out of business. Loewen called the Mississippi court action an "uncompensated expropriation" of its property.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment except to say the Government was fighting the claim, which she said lacked merit. But in the months since Loewen disclosed the existence of its case, critics have been warning about what they say are the dangers of it.
A victory by Loewen "would completely undermine the American civil justice system," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a watchdog group that has been critical of Nafta. Forcing American taxpayers to pay Loewen for its losses, she said, would erode the aim of American courts to punish and deter wrongdoing.
James A. Wilderotter, a lawyer for Loewen, declined to respond to critics in detail. But he said, "Nafta is part of the American legal system and the right to bring the action we have brought is clearly found within Nafta."
In its claim, Loewen included statements from political and legal authorities who, the company said, agreed that its treatment in the Mississippi courts should be considered a violation of the trade agreement.
Among others, Loewen quoted Mississippi's Governor, Kirk Fordice. "The O'Keefe verdict," Governor Fordice wrote, "represents to me everything that is wrong with the court system." Critics of Loewen say several of its experts, including Governor Fordice, have long records of criticizing the American court system.
But some trade-law experts said the case was a sign that the United States would come under increasing pressure in trade battles to moderate jury verdicts as the world economy grows more unified. "This is the globalized economy we've all been talking about," said John H. Jackson, an expert on trade law and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Leebron both noted that business leaders in other countries have for years complained that America's large jury verdicts make investment here unpredictable. They both said those assertions were much like the worries of American business executives about other countries' expropriations.
Nafta, like most agreements that use arbitration in business disputes, permits the handling of cases in confidential proceedings. Under those confidentiality rules, Loewen's case is to be heard in closed hearings by an arbitration panel unless Loewen and the Government agree to public proceedings.
Some critics of Loewen's filing say they are especially troubled by the fact that a case with large legal and financial ramifications could be decided in a closed proceeding.
"This is wrong and harmful to America because it substitutes for our judicial system a confidential arbitration panel that's not open to public scrutiny," said Mark S. Mandell, the president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
Under the confidentiality rules, Loewen's claim documents were not publicly released until this month. Mr. Wilderotter acknowledged that Loewen released its claim documents only after it learned the Government was preparing to release them because the documents had been requested under the Freedom of Information Act.
The Mississippi court battle, which drew national attention, involved a bitter fight between Mr. O'Keefe and Loewen, a publicly traded funeral home chain with a reputation for hardball tactics.
After a hard-fought trial in Mississippi, Mr. O'Keefe's lawyers succeeded in arguments to jurors that Loewen tried to drive Mr. O'Keefe from business, sought to monopolize the regional funeral-home business and planned to raise prices to the bereaved.
Jurors said that they were angered by Loewen's tactics and awarded Mr. O'Keefe $100 million in compensatory and $400 million in punitive damages. In its Nafta claim, Loewen said Mr. O'Keefe's lawyers unfairly suggested to the jury. which included blacks, that Loewen was biased against blacks. The company said the plaintiff's lawyers also inflamed xenophobic passions by analogizing Loewen's move into Mississippi to the Japanese "sneak attack" on Pearl Harbor.
Loewen contended the verdict, the largest in Mississippi's history, was out of proportion to any losses Mr. O'Keefe might have suffered. And it said it was put at a disadvantage by Mississippi law governing appeals.
Mississippi, like many states, required a losing party to post a bond to appeal. Based on the $500 million verdict, the bond, too, would have been huge: $625 million. Loewen fought the bond requirement. But the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the $625 million bond was required.
Loewen said it could not post such a large bond. "Loewen," it said, "was forced to settle the case under conditions of extreme duress."
Mr. O'Keefe's lawyer, Michael S. Allred of Jackson, Miss., said in an interview that the verdict against Loewen was fair and that Loewen should have pursued its appeal if it felt it had been wronged. In addition, he argued that Nafta's confidentiality provisions attack the integrity of the American court system.
Although the settlement Mr. O'Keefe received from Loewen would be beyond the reach of the Nafta arbitration panel, Mr. Allred said he and his client were offended that the jury's effort to punish Loewen would be nullified if the Government was forced to compensate Loewen in a proceeding that took place behind closed doors.

HEADLINE: No Currency Devaluation, China Reiterates

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 27

 BODY:
With world markets once again jittery about a possible devaluation of China's currency, the yuan, the governor of the Chinese central bank said today that there were no plans to do so, pointing out that there is even less pressure on the currency, also known as the renminbi, than there was last year.
"As the person in charge, I can say the renminbi will not be devalued," the bank chief, Dai Xianglong, said at a news conference in Beijing. "During the Asian crisis, the renminbi was not devalued and at the moment it is not necessary for the renminbi to be devalued." 
 Mr. Dai's comments touched off a strong rally in China-related stocks in Hong Kong, where there is deep concern that a possible devaluation would force Hong Kong to shift its currency's link to the United States dollar. Hong Kong's index of H-shares, or China-based companies, surged more than 7 percent, while the broader Hang Seng index rose 209.83 points, or 2.21 percent, to 9,719.66.
Mr. Dai also said China would move ahead with plans to tighten regulation while gradually liberalizing its financial industry practices. All large cities will be opened to foreign banks, which were previously limited to Shanghai and Shenzhen, the city in southern Guangdong province that borders Hong Kong.
The central bank will also relax control over the interest rate allowed on foreign loans, Mr. Dai said, giving commercial banks more freedom to attract borrowers.
At the same time, Beijing plans to continue attacking irregularities at banks and other financial institutions, cracking down on improper foreign-currency dealings to protect foreign-exchange reserves and to deter the smuggling of goods into the country.
Last year, Mr. Dai said, the central bank discovered $6.42 billion in fraudulent purchases, and adding, "A number of underground markets and illegal money exchanges have been eliminated."
He said as well that many of China's trust and investment companies would be reorganized. These financial institutions have been blamed for fueling wild speculation in stock and property markets, often creating liabilities that far outweigh assets.
Yet Mr. Dai was vague about plans, described by other bankers in recent weeks, to reduce the number of trust and investment companies to about 40 from 240. "Some will be preserved; some will be merged," he said. "The restructuring will be based on commercial principles."
International bankers were recently surprised by bankruptcy proceedings against the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, or Gitic, where local officials said loans might not be repaid at all.
Gitic was shut down in October with $4.3 billion in debts and assets of $2.6 billion, and the Government placed the company in bankruptcy earlier this month. The move put foreign banks at the end of a long line of creditors seeking repayment.
Yet Mr. Dai said Beijing would like to see Gitic reorganize its debts rather than face its creditors in court. "If they can, through negotiation, agree on a restructuring scheme, the central bank would be very glad to see that," he said.
He added that creditor claims would be decided by the Guangdong Supreme Court, though in China most courts take advice from Beijing on important cases.
But it was Mr. Dai's comments about China's currency that drew the most attention from traders and analysts in markets around the world. Only when China faces a large international payments deficit, Mr. Dai said, would the authorities be forced to consider a devaluation.
China currently runs a healthy balance of payments, even though exports are faltering and foreign investment is slowing. The trade surplus last year reached a record $43.6 billion, while foreign-exchange reserves are still at a robust $145 billion.
Mr. Dai said a devaluation would hurt foreign investment, increase the country's foreign debt burden and cause instability in other Asian financial markets. He also reaffirmed Beijing's support for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the United States dollar.
Surveying China's larger economic situation, Mr. Dai said that the economy was likely to grow around 7 percent this year. In 1998, the economy grew by 7.8 percent.
China's consumer price index, he predicted, would increase by 4 to 5 percent this year. The index fell eight-tenths of a percent last year.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Official Defends Company's Strategy at Trial

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
A senior executive of the Microsoft Corporation delivered a forceful defense of the company's actions in the Internet software market today, saying it had acted mainly in the pursuit of a "Holy Grail of software development" by making its products more powerful, easier to use and seamlessly integrated.
The executive, James Allchin, the second company official to appear as a witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, also argued that other software makers have done what the Government says is anticompetitive in Microsoft's case and presented a detailed history of his company's product plans for the Internet. 
 In his 139-page written testimony, Mr. Allchin repeatedly struck the theme that the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft are making an ill-advised effort to tamper with innovation and product design in a leading high-technology industry.
"I am not a lawyer or an economist," Mr. Allchin wrote, "but I do not understand how a company's efforts to improve its products can ever be 'anticompetitive.' "
The testimony of Mr. Allchin, a senior vice president in charge of the technical development of the company's Windows operating system, is a salvo in Microsoft's legal fight with the Government over how the lawsuit is framed, which is crucial to the outcome of the case.
Microsoft says its decision to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system and give the browser away free was a straightforward product-design decision that benefits consumers.
But the Government contends that those moves represent the abuse of Microsoft's monopoly power to thwart competition.
Most antitrust experts say that Microsoft's strongest defense is to frame the case as a debate over its product decisions.
Indeed, in a related case, a Federal appeals court ruled last June that Microsoft had the right to bundle its browser with Windows, warning of "the undesirability of having courts oversee product design."
But the Government views Microsoft's bundling decision as simply one step in a pattern of what it regards as predatory business practices intended to stifle competition.
The prosecution case, according to antitrust experts, is strengthened by framing the courtroom debate around Microsoft's business practices and contracts.
At the trial today, the Government kept that focus in its third day of cross-examining Microsoft's first executive witness, Paul Maritz, trying to show that the company pressured the Intel Corporation to stop developing technology that conflicted with Microsoft's plans.
Intel is mainly a producer of the microprocessor chips that serve as the "electronic brain" of most PC's, but it also develops software. Microsoft's conflict with Intel in 1995 centered on Intel's work on multimedia software called "native signal processing," or N.S.P.
Intel wanted to distribute its N.S.P. software to PC makers, but it pulled back after protests from Microsoft. The Government contends that Microsoft muscled both Intel and the computer makers not to adopt any software that conflicted with Microsoft's plans.
Microsoft replies that Intel stepped back on its own, after realizing that there were problems with its N.S.P. software.
The Justice Department pointed to internal Microsoft E-mail to try to show that the big software maker did pressure Intel and the industry. An Oct. 18, 1995, E-mail to Mr. Maritz, written by William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, said that Intel felt PC makers were resisting Intel's software because of "our N.S.P. chill." Later, Mr. Gates added, "If Intel is not sticking totally to its part of the deal, let me know."
"Did you ask Mr. Gates: 'What bargain are you talking about? What deal are you talking about?' " David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, asked Mr. Maritz.
Mr. Maritz, the senior executive in charge of most software development and marketing at Microsoft, replied that he had not.
But he maintained that Intel ultimately abandoned N.S.P. because it was technically flawed and would not work with recent versions of Windows.
In what Mr. Boies portrayed as another example of Microsoft's attempting to co-opt or pressure potential competitors, he also questioned Mr. Maritz about the company's investment in Real Networks Inc., a developer of software that allows audio and video to be transmitted over the Internet.
Mr. Maritz acknowledged that executives from Real Networks, then known as Progressive Networks, told Microsoft in 1997 that if Microsoft invested in the company, it would shift its business to other kinds of software and services to avoid competing. But Mr. Maritz noted that Real Networks continues to compete with Microsoft nonetheless.
A Real Networks spokesman said yesterday that the company never agreed to get out of the streaming media business.
Microsoft is in the process of selling its 10 percent stake in Real Networks.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
It's hard to tell who won in the High Court local phone ruling.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
JUDGING from reactions, it was hard to figure out exactly who won this week's decision by the Supreme Court to uphold Federal rules designed to open up the local telephone market to competition.
The AT&T Corporation and other long-distance carriers declared victory, saying the decision would allow them to go after local customers as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 had intended. The Federal Communications Commission, which issued the rules, declared vindication. Even some of the losing plaintiffs, the local phone companies, pointed with glee at the part of the decision that would require the commission to reconsider part of its rule making. 
 But no matter what the parties to the dispute say, the big winner, according to many economists and consumer advocates, will be ordinary phone customers. Gene Kimmelman, a top official at Consumers Union, said, "This decision will help small companies to come into the local market and take on the reigning monopolist." Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said that "on balance, I'm happy that the court erred on the side of the commission rather than the local Bell companies."
The commission's rules were designed to create competition in local phone service, breaking the monopoly of the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the other regional Bell carriers. The Bells struck back and found a Federal court willing to throw out the rules on the ground that the commission had strayed beyond its legislative mandate. This week the Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision, voting to let competition unfurl.
The idea behind the 1996 act was to give consumers a choice by inviting long-distance carriers like AT&T and cable and wireless concerns to enter the market for local phone service. In return, after opening their sanctuary to competition, the local Bell companies would be allowed to enter long distance.
Congress left it up to the commission to figure out the rules. The problem was that no company was in a position to provide local service using only its own equipment. Entrants would need to use, at least initially, some or all of the Bell network, including wires into homes, switching equipment and operator services. The threat was that the Baby Bells would overcharge for their network or deny access to key components entirely, blocking entry into local service even as they drove hard into the long-distance market. That posed the danger that the Bells would exploit the 1996 act to dominate telecommunications markets, making a mockery of Congress's will.
In surprisingly short time, about six months, the commission came up, in Mr. Kimmelman's judgment, with "smart rules that compel the Bell companies to compete on fair terms with potential rivals." The commission set down two key principles. There would be one national pricing policy, with 50 state variations to take account of regional cost differences, making it easy for companies to enter any and all states at once. And the regional Bells would be required to rent all their network or any important component of the network. AT&T might need to rent wires into the home, but not signaling equipment. A wireless company might not need the wires, but might need to rent directory assistance.
Second, the commission ruled that the Bells could charge only enough to cover the costs that an efficient concern would incur to provide the switch, wire, operators assistance, or whatever other equipment or service the entrant needed to rent. Said another way, the Bells would not be allowed to pass along the bloated costs that they had actually incurred as an inefficient, government-protected monopolist.
Some state commissions have set prices at levels well above the commission's efficient-provider rule. But under the commission's rules, the Baby Bells would charge enough to cover legitimate costs -- the costs of a low-cost provider -- and not one penny more. That way, entrants could enter and drive down prices to the level of the lowest-cost producer.
The Bells challenged the rules, arguing that the 1996 act did not empower the commission to set prices. Though their position might not make a lot of economic sense, they could point to ambiguities and contradictions in the statutory language of the act that made their interpretation plausible. A Federal appeals court sided with the Baby Bells. The Supreme Court sided with the commission. Whatever the pros and cons of its legal reasoning, the Supreme Court's decision gives, after more than two years of legal deadlock, long-distance and other potential entrants a fair shot at the local phone market.
The Court did accept one part of the Baby Bell argument. It ruled that the commission had forced the Bells to rent a long list of components and software services without determining that entrants truly needed those components and services in order to compete. The commission was instructed to reconsider its list, dropping items, perhaps like operator assistance, that entrants could provide themselves or rent from non-Bell companies.
The GTE Corporation points to this provision of the High Court's decision as grounds to declare victory. Others say that this order for re-examination will delay efforts to open the local phone market. But these claims appear exaggerated. The commission took only six months to issue its entire package of rules in 1996. It surely needs less time to revise a small portion of those rules. So, at worst, the Court has imposed a delay of a few months.
Besides, delay is of tertiary importance. If the Court had gone the other way -- permitting states to set rental prices according to historical costs or permit the Bells to deny access to key parts of their network -- it would have risked putting some of the Bells in charge of telecommunications until Congress took up another bout of reform. Here, history is sobering. The 1996 act revised legislation dating back to 1934.
Waiting a few months while the commission revises its rule making hardly matters if the result is to create a competitive maelstrom from which consumers should reap benefits for decades to come.

Ford Said to Be in Deal For Volvo's Car Business
Ford Motor plans to announce today that it will acquire the passenger car operations of Sweden's Volvo for $6 billion to $7 billion, people close to the talks said last night.
Ford's deal, which beat a rival bid from Italy's Fiat and strengthens its position as the No. 2 auto maker in the world, marks the latest step in the consolidation of the global automotive industry. Car makers worldwide are rushing into deals because they fear a coming shakeout in the industry, in which the only survivors will be the lowest-cost producers with the greatest economies of scale. Page A1. 

Yahoo in Deal to Buy Geocities
In a move meant to defend its position as the world's leading site on the Internet, Yahoo Inc. has agreed to buy Geocities, another popular site, for an estimated $3 billion, financial executives close to the deal said. The deal could be announced as early as today. C4.
 
Compaq Profit Beats Forecast
Compaq Computer said that its fourth-quarter results reached a record $758 million, surpassing Wall Street estimates. But investors were not impressed. Shares of Compaq fell $1.75, to $47.50, after rising 5.5 percent on Tuesday when the company announced that it planned a public offering of a stake in Alta Vista, its Internet search engine. C4.
 
America Online posted a profit of $122 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, surpassing Wall Street expectations. C21.
 
Stocks Decline on Profit-Taking
Stocks fell for the first time in three sessions as investors took profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 124.35 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,200.23. The S.& P. 500 slipped 9.14 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,243.17. And Nasdaq declined 26.27 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,407.14. One of the big winners was Ebay, which rose $82.625, to $303.50. C9.
 
Analysts Decide to Be Advocates
A group of analysts has decided to use National Presto, a publicly traded company that makes pressure cookers, corn poppers and microwave bacon cookers, as an example of how investors may be able to benefit from shareholder advocacy. Market Place. C10.
 
Nafta Invoked in Court Challenge
A Canadian company that lost a huge case against a competitor in Mississippi is seeking $725 million from the United States Government under a little noted provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move some say could provide a way for corporations to challenge the American legal system. C6.
 
China Vows No Devaluation
With world markets once again jittery about a possible devaluation of China's currency, the yuan, Dai Xianglong, the governor of the Chinese central bank, said that there were no plans to do so, pointing out that there is even less pressure on the currency than there was last year. Mr. Dai's comments touched off a strong rally in China-related stocks in Hong Kong. C6.
 
Insider Trading Charges Brought
A group of Long Island stockbrokers has been charged with insider trading in a scheme involving obtaining advance copies of Business Week's "Inside Wall Street" column and then making securities purchases based on the information. C21.
 
Executive Defends Microsoft
A Microsoft executive defended the company's actions in the Internet software market at the software giant's antitrust trial. He also argued that other software makers have done what the Government and 19 states say is anticompetitive in Microsoft's case. C2.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 8. 

Now Playing
 
 * "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
 
 * "ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE," starring James Woods and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Larry Clark (R, 101 minutes). From the director of the bruising and ominous "Kids," this vibrant, unapologetically seedy road movie is a virtual day at the beach. Mr. Clark's second feature may not have the sting of his first, but it comes closer to establishing him as William S. Burroughs with a swooping, pivoting movie camera, bringing bizarrely innocent enthusiasm to material that might otherwise ooze druggy shock value, and making decadence as basic as the weather. Mr. Woods, as a junkie, thief and absurdly unlikely father figure, revels in this full-throttle role (Maslin).
 
 "AT FIRST SIGHT," starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong and often desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr. Oliver Sacks, Mr. Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness was suddenly alleviated by surgery. Ms. Sorvino plays the bright-eyed New York career woman who falls in love with him, then urges him to change his once-peaceful life. But the film brings little more than case-study data to communicating how this man's restored sight affected him, or what made it a mixed blessing. Sample dialogue: "Have you ever listened to the rain? I mean, really listened?" (Maslin).
 
 * "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
 * "A CIVIL ACTION," starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall and William H. Macy. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Mr. Travolta first rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But Mr. Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn, Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Mr. Duvall is outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
 
 * "THE GENERAL," starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight. Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Mr. Boorman's best and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin Cahill. Nicknamed "the General" for his crime-plotting strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with splendid brio by Mr. Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his singular difficulties with the I.R.A. and the law. Mr. Voight is outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
 
 * "HILARY AND JACKIE," starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms. Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her career, and her slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be "ordinary," is one of the most insightful studies of sibling rivalry ever filmed. Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Ms. Watson's Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity (Stephen Holden).
 
 "IN DREAMS," starring Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn and Robert Downey Jr. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 112 minutes). At heart this is just a campfire story, and a pretty loony one at that. But Mr. Jordan directs it furiously a la "Interview With the Vampire" with a lush, insinuating visual style that gets right under the skin. Working with the inventive cinematographer Darius Khondji, he stirs up a nightmare brooding and intuitive enough to recall at times the richly textured mysteries of Nicolas Roeg's "Don't Look Now." Ms. Bening plays a psychic plagued by the thoughts of a serial killer, whom Mr. Downey makes as bizarre and disturbing as he can, in a performance that makes this story's craziest dreams come true (Maslin).
 
 * "MY NAME IS JOE," starring Peter Mullan and Louise Goodall. Directed by Ken Loach (R, 92 minutes). A splendid, feisty performance by Mr. Mullan energizes this film about a recovering alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. With humor and scrappy intensity, Joe throws himself into coaching young athletes and embarking tenuously on a love affair, only to find the expected challenges to his new sobriety everywhere. Mr. Loach's commitment to delineating social issues is accentuated by the way his star breathes life into Joe and makes viewers root for his success. Special bonus: this film breaks the brogue-and-burr barrier by including helpful subtitles for the overlapping, heavily Scottish-accented dialogue (Maslin).
 
 "PATCH ADAMS," starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter. Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor intent on making terminal patients laugh, Mr. Williams delivers a little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's "Ace Ventura" days. He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine excuse for Mr. Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist (Maslin).
 
 * "THE PRINCE OF EGYPT," starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
 
 * "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
 * "A SIMPLE PLAN," starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance from Mr. Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
 
 "STEPMOM," starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense of fun. As in "Home Alone," Mr. Columbus directs with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
 
 "STILL CRAZY," starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Bill Nighy and Jimmy Nail. Directed by Brian Gibson (R, 96 minutes). Twenty years after they last dropped acid in a Druid circle, an over-the-hill English rock band tries to reunite, and the results are meant to be both funny and heartwarming. Not an easy mix, unless Spinal Tap really is your idea of a band that needs a second chance. Despite an extremely likable cast that fits right into the spirit of things, the director of "What's Love Got to Do With It" and the writers of "The Commitments" don't drum up enough drama or sustained humor to make the most of their premise. The cast is cheery and game, the material hit-or-miss (Maslin).
 
 "THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: no one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).
 
 Film Series

 BODY:
Lured by a $350 million stadium, guaranteed revenue from luxury seating and a $1 billion riverfront redevelopment, the National Football League's New England Patriots will move to Hartford beginning with the 2001 season.
"We want to redefine Hartford's place on the map," Connecticut's Governor, John Rowland, said when the move was first announced. 
 What could they have in mind?
MEMPHIS, Jan. 29, 1999 -- Graceland, the Memphis-based home of Elvis Presley, will move to Hartford, Conn., beginning in 2002, officials announced today.
With the ranks of departed celebrities growing, Graceland executives said, they needed to "find a new place to dwell" to compete with larger market shrines.
The Graceland ownership has been threatening to leave since April, when Tennessee voters rejected a proposed $400 million Hyatt-Regency Heartbreak Hotel Convention Center.
To get Graceland, Hartford agreed to build the 70,000-seat mausoleum-theme park, to be called Graceworld, which will be financed through a 5 percent surcharge on velvet portraits.
"Elvis has left their state!" Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut gloated. "Viva Hartford!"
PAGE, Ariz., June 22, 2000 -- Grand Canyon officials announced plans today to move the popular national park to Hartford, Conn., where it will co-anchor a $30 billion downtown redevelopment, beginning in fiscal year 2003.
After failing last May to renegotiate its two-million-year lease with Arizona, the Canyon made no secret of its plans to seek a larger media market. Ever since, Arizona officials have sought a suitable replacement, rumored to be Knott's Berry Farm.
The new, 700,000-seat Grand Hartford Canyon will feature a retractable dome, artificial turf, an Imax theater and the Trump Palace Casino. The 30-year agreement calls for Hartford to guarantee $200 million annually from canyon wall advertising.
"The future looks grand!" Gov. John Rowland said. "Hartford is gorges!"
WASHINGTON, July 4, 2001 -- Government officials confirmed today that the United States Congress has signed a memorandum of intent to move its headquarters to Hartford, Conn., beginning with the 2004 term.
The proposed $900 million "Hartford District of Connecticut" includes a domed Philip Morris House Voting Chamber, the N.R.A. Atrium Lobby and the Impeachment Hall of Fame/Planet Hollywood.
The move fulfills Hartford's 213-year quest to obtain a nation's capital. Last May, efforts to lure Moscow fell through after Russian voters rejected relocation in favor of a plan to construct a 600,000-bed retail/residential collective on their home soil, to be called "Creme de la Kremlin."
Officials in the District of Columbia are said to be seeking a replacement for Congress, possibly a petting zoo.
To lure Congress, Hartford will guarantee $270 million annually in soft-money campaign contributions.
"We, the people, love Hartford!" Gov. John Rowland proclaimed. "This land is our land!"
MILKY WAY, June 23, 2004 -- Officials said today that the Center of the Universe will move to Hartford, Conn., beginning in 2009.
"I always believed that the world revolves around Hartford," Gov. John Rowland said. "Now, if only the Patriots could win a Super Bowl. . . ."

HEADLINE: Report Finds Banks Failed To Oversee Big Hedge Fund

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
A handful of the world's largest commercial and investment banks failed to adequately oversee lending and trading activities with the hedge-fund giant Long-Term Capital Management, a regulatory study has found.
William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, oversaw the study and said that the banks had been blinded by what he called the "magic" of the once high-flying firm's vaunted reputation, a situation he suggested could recur if banks did not tighten their monitoring of such funds. 
 Mr. McDonough's comments accompanied the release yesterday of a lengthy international review on the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital in September, which Mr. McDonough said would have posed a threat to the stability of the global economy.
The report detailed many lapses in judgment by banks in their dealings with Long-Term Capital and similar hedge funds, but it noted that such funds were still very difficult to regulate and that the most effective way of preventing potential disasters was for lenders to be far more circumspect. The report said that banks had become better attuned to the dangers posed by lax supervision of their dealings with hedge funds since the Long-Term Capital debacle.
But denizens of Wall Street, even the very largest and brightest, never have been known to possess particularly good memories, a fact Mr. McDonough was quick to note again yesterday. "Financial institutions can learn lessons well, but the question is how long they continue to remember them," he said.
Chase Manhattan; Citigroup; J. P. Morgan; Merrill Lynch; Morgan Stanley; Goldman, Sachs; Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were the nation's financial services firms with the closest lending or trading relationships with Long-Term Capital. Foreign firms close to the hedge fund included UBS, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and Societe Generale.
Hedge funds are largely unregulated, private investment pools typically open only to wealthy individuals and large institutional investors. The most free-wheeling hedge funds borrow huge sums of money to make complex trades in stocks, bonds, currencies and more exotic financial products known as derivatives.
Yesterday's report was issued under the auspices of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which consists of senior representatives of the world's leading central banks. Mr. McDonough is the committee's current chairman. The report was compiled with the help of other United States banking regulators, including the Comptroller of the Currency.
Asked whether the problem arose because banks failed to review Long-Term Capital's borrowing and trading enough or because the hedge fund failed to disclose sufficient information when queried by lenders, Mr. McDonough said "some of both."
"The competitive pressure kept banks from asking basic questions and getting fundamental information in some cases," said Michael L. Brosnan, head of risk evaluation for the Comptroller's office. "That should never happen."
The report also noted that commercial and investment banks relied too much on the day-to-day value of Long-Term Capital's assets when deciding if they had enough collateral to cover any losses.
In extremely volatile financial markets, such as the panic that followed Russia's decision in August to devalue its currency and declare a debt moratorium, the value of assets, and thus collateral, can plunge. Because of that, banks had less secure collateral at Long-Term Capital than they believed. The report said that banks need to "stress test" their exposure to hedge funds more regularly, taking into account the likelihood of financial meltdowns.
The report said more stringent public regulation of hedge funds may be required, but it noted the challenges of carrying out such a task in a world of computerized, nearly borderless financial transactions.
Because most hedge funds "are registered in offshore centers, any direct regulation would therefore have to extend to those jurisdictions in order to be effective," the report said. "Such an extension would require a high level of political initiative and would involve consideration by political, legislative and judiciary bodies."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
1924 Building Is Restored in Midtown

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
After a $3.5 million yearlong modernization and restoration program, a 75-year-old building at 40 West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan, used mainly for offices and clothing showrooms for the last three decades, has been returned to its original role as a rental apartment building.
The Macklowe Organization completed the work last month, transforming the inside of the building, just west of Fifth Avenue, from a maze of commercial spaces into 36 apartments, including two penthouses with wraparound terraces. That is the same number of units with virtually the same layouts originally contained in the 10-story structure, which was built in 1924 and designed by the noted architect Rosario Candela. The architect, recognized for his spacious interior layouts, designed many grand apartment houses on Fifth and Park Avenues. 
 Because the building at 40 West 55th Street was for years a commercial property, including a period as the headquarters for Ralph Lauren Polo, "50 percent of it was changed beyond recognition," said Dan Shannon, a principal at Moed de Armas & Shannon of Manhattan, architects for the restoration project. The suspended ceilings and the walls installed to reconfigure the interior for commercial use were removed. The space was redesigned in accordance with the original layouts, Mr. Shannon said, adding that "we could work forever and never get layouts as nice as these."
Of the 36 apartments, 35 have two bedrooms, and one has one bedroom. The apartments range from 1,100 to 1,400 square feet; all have nine-foot-high ceilings, entry galleries, separate service entrances, windowed kitchens and baths, and fireplaces. Half of the units also have formal dining rooms.
The project also involved modernizing the building's mechanical systems, installing new windows and upgrading its lobby, including restoring its terrazzo flooring and adding a Venetian-style fresco to its oval-shaped ceiling. The building's red brick and stucco exterior, featuring decorative terra cotta trim around the windows and cornices, has also been cleaned.
The Macklowe Organization acquired the building for $8 million to $9 million in 1997 from Emigrant Savings Bank, which had taken it back from the previous owner, who had defaulted on the mortgage. The company did so because "it is in an exceptional location in the heart of midtown and there is a strong demand for spacious prewar rentals, which are in limited supply," said Jessica Schick, the company's director of sales.
The building is adjacent to the Rockefeller Apartments, a landmarked 138-unit co-op, and shares the same block with La Cote Basque and La Caravelle restaurants and the Peninsula and Shoreham hotels.
At the time of the purchase, the building housed fewer than a dozen occupants, most of them commercial tenants but including three apartment dwellers. Since then, all but two residential tenants have relocated. Those tenants lease rent-regulated apartments and by law are allowed to remain in their units at regulated rents; the developer is challenging the validity of one tenant's lease.
The building opened for leasing last month, during the traditionally slower winter rental season and when there is a larger supply than usual of luxury apartments available, including six recently built or converted buildings, brokers said. The supply is partly the result of the stock market's slump last August, which slowed the pace of leasing and in turn "kept the lid on rental price increases at the end of last year," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage in Manhattan.
A report by her concern showed that at the end of 1998, asking rents for apartments in doorman buildings on the Upper East and Upper West Sides have risen by 8.9 percent, compared with the end of 1997 -- about the same increase recorded in 1997 over 1996. The report put the average monthly rent at the end of last year at $2,568 for a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side and at $2,550 for the same size unit on the Upper West Side.
But Ms. Packes said she expected the larger than usual supply of available rentals to be short-lived. "In the last two weeks, leasing activity has been strong, indicating a pent-up demand for rentals," she said. "And if the economy continues to expand and people's salaries increase proportionately, rental rates will resume their rise." That will be reinforced, she added, "by the limitations on new supply."
The Macklowe Organization is offering the incentive of a month's free rent on a 13-month lease, Ms. Schick, the company's sales director said, noting that the offer is to be discontinued next month. So far, she said, 12 apartments have been leased at monthly rents of $3,650 to $4,650, which brokers said was competitive with apartments in buildings in the 40's and 50's. Monthly rents for the penthouses are $4,500 for the 1,100-square-foot one-bedroom and $6,000 for the 1,150-square-foot two-bedroom.
Ms. Schick said the building has drawn mainly renters from Europe as well as some business executives who want a Manhattan pied-a-terre and who are attracted "to the intimate old-world character of the building and its convenient address."
That is what appealed to Yuri Bohaievsky, the Consul General of Ukraine, who next week will move, with his wife and adult son, into a two-bedroom apartment in the building.
"We like that the building is not very big, offering a close environment, and that the apartment has enough room to receive guests for small parties," Mr. Bohaievsky said. It is also close to Central Park and just a 15-minute walk to his midtown office, he said.

70.20 Rise on Nasdaq Leads Gains Across the Board

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Buoyed by Intel's fourth split since 1993 and other evidence of prosperity for high-technology companies, the Nasdaq stock market rocketed to a gain of nearly 3 percent yesterday, pacing a broad market rally.
Prices gathered strength throughout the session, exhibiting less of their recent volatility as investors digested fresh news of a strong, low-inflation economy, more upbeat earnings reports and some big takeovers along with Alan Greenspan's latest remarks about valuations. 
 In comments before the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, did not repeat warnings about irrational exuberance but did compare investing in Internet stocks to playing the lottery. His remarks did little to dampen enthusiasm.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, resuming its sharp advance that now amounts to 13 percent so far this year, climbed 70.20 points, to 2,477.34.
"Techs are the sector," said John F. Snyder, executive vice president of John Hancock/Sovereign Investors. "The feeling among many people is that if they're underweighted there, they've got to get in."
But lesser strength was found across a broad front, reflected in a hefty 1.53 percent advance for the Wilshire 5000 and a 1.79 percent advance for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 22.20 points, to 1,265.37.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished with a gain of 81.10 points, or nearly nine-tenths of 1 percent, though close to half of the increase was the result of surges in two stocks: AT&T, up 4 5/8, to 89 15/16, and J. P. Morgan, up 4 5/16, to 104 3/8.
"There's a lot of good news out there today," said Peter Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments. "We're on our way to Dow 10,000."
Analysts cited among other things Government reports of a surprisingly big jump in orders for durable goods and of contained employment costs, the latter likely to reassure Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet next week, that inflation remains well in check.
America Online, which late on Wednesday announced strong earnings and a stock split, climbed 8 15/16, to 174 7/16, but many other computer-oriented companies did even better. Yahoo, which said it was buying Geocities, rose 31 7/8, to 367 3/4; Geocities soared 42 1/4, to 117 1/4. Infoseek rose 12 1/2, to 83 15/16, and Lycos shot up 11 5/8, to 123 1/8. .
Intel rose 4 7/8, to 137 3/16, as the company announced a 2-for-1 split and a 50 percent dividend increase.
Ebay, however, slumped 10 7/8, to 292 5/8, as it responded to news reports about possibly fraudulent items sold by other companies on its auction site, and Amazon.com eased 2 3/4, to 122 7/8.
The relative sluggishness of the Dow industrials, still up only 1.09 percent in 1999, and other traditional market favorites was said to reflect their big run-ups over the last four years.
"Investors may still be around to buy the dips," said Christine A. Callies, chief strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But they're clearly having second thoughts about chasing high valuations."
Pfizer stood out in the drug group, rising 5 5/8, to 127 9/16. It said directors would vote on a 3-for-1 split.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 852.4 million shares changed hands, with advancing issues holding only a small margin over declining ones, 1,561 to 1,454. New 52-week lows outnumbered new highs by 86 to 65.
Overseas, stocks rose 3.9 percent in Sao Paulo, 2.5 percent in Paris and 0.8 percent in Frankfurt. Prices were 3.7 percent lower in Hong Kong, 0.7 in Tokyo and almost 0.1 percent in London.

Treasury Prices Rise
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices rose as a Government report on labor costs fueled optimism that inflation would stay low and as the Federal Reserve bought Treasury securities.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 10/32, to 10 28/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.10 percent, from 5.12 percent on Wednesday.
Bonds received a boost when the Fed bought $615 million of Treasuries maturing between February 2019 and November 2021. The central bank makes these purchases periodically to add money permanently to the banking system.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: A Crash Course InEconomics;
Rethinking What's Driving The Emerging-Markets Crisis

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Among the movers and shakers gathered here for the World Economic Forum, a striking metaphor is helping to frame the debate over the global financial crisis that began in Asia and has spread to several other developing countries. The debacle, some say, brings to mind a slick stretch of highway, scene of a half-dozen recent auto accidents. So is it careless driving or the highway that is the cause of the accidents?
Substitute free-wheeling worldwide capital flows and unrestricted lending for the slippery, fast-moving highway. Make South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil stand-ins for the drivers and their cars. The accidents are the panics and recessions -- the crackups -- that have devastated each of these countries. And the question now so widely debated is simple enough: Are the countries mostly to blame or the unrestricted capital flows, or both? 
 After the first accidents, the countries came in for almost all the blame. It was because of crony capitalism, bad banking and overleveraged real estate investments, many experts said. Fix the sloppy financial practices and also make enough bailout money available when a country gets into trouble -- basically the current strategy of the International Monetary Fund for Brazil -- and the accidents will be avoided or, at worst, will be mere fender benders. But spectacular wrecks have occurred with alarming frequency and severity the last 18 months, even in Brazil, and some who had mostly blamed the countries have begun to argue, here and in earlier interviews, that the system needs serious fixing, too.
The Clinton Administration had mostly blamed the countries, and still does. But its view, like that of the I.M.F., is starting to reflect a more nuanced appraisal. "We have seen that countries need to pursue sounder policies and avoid lurching for short-term capital, as Mexico and Thailand did," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. But in a phone interview this week from Washington, he also called for "more prudence on the part of the lenders."
And in the Administration's most direct acknowledgment so far that it is not necessarily always committed to unrestricted capital flows, he added, "Where countries have controls that restrict short-term lending, we have not in general sought to dismantle them."
Some on Wall Street are similarly shifting ground. "It is appropriate to certainly consider fixing the system," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Morgan Stanley normally makes more money when capital flows freely and the firm can lend where and how it sees best.
But the recent string of crackups has given Mr. Roach second thoughts. "I am not completely convinced that restrictions on the system are necessary," he said, "but unstable capital flows have clearly been a precipitant of these crises."
At the top of many lists for fixing the system are proposals to limit the flow of short-term foreign loans to developing countries, loans that often contributed to more rapid growth but which piled up in huge amounts in Asia, Russia and Brazil. Then, at the first hint of trouble, investors, both at home and abroad, pulled their money out, precipitating and worsening a full-scale financial collapse.
But other systemwide suggestions are winning favor as well. Pursing flexible exchange rates, for example, to avoid sudden, frightening devaluations. Introducing bankruptcy laws that let companies deep in foreign debt borrow and resume operations even before they pay off the old debts. And standstill provisions in lending agreements that would temporarily prevent a foreign lender from withdrawing loans from a South Korea or a Brazil in the midst of a crisis.
What they have in common is an effort to put more of the burden on international banks and other lenders to evaluate risks more carefully early on and suffer more of the consequences later if things go bad.
"The banks don't like this; they value liquidity of lending," said Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "But if they had a provision in their loan agreements that they cannot pull out their money right away when a crisis is developing, maybe they would not lend the money in the first place."
Some experts now favor rules that prevent not only foreign lenders, but also wealthy nationals -- Brazilians, for example -- from canceling their short-term loans and investments, then converting this money from local currencies into dollars and taking the dollars out of the country. Wealthy Brazilians, many of them already moving chunks of capital abroad, hold more than $150 billion in their Government's debt and rushing this money out of the country would quickly exhaust Brazil's dollar reserves.
"My view is that basically all short-term debt constitutes potential capital flight," said Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Brazil is at risk not only from foreign lenders, but from anyone who can take money out of the country."
Perhaps some of these measures would make the highway safer for ordinary drivers. But before the dangerous stretch of road is rebuilt in hopes of preventing future accidents, the smashed cars of the last 18 months have to be repaired and put back in operation. There is little agreement on how to do that. Rather there are two diametrically opposite, so far unyielding, approaches.
The current practice, carried out at the insistence of the Clinton Administration and the I.M.F., is to require countries in trouble to adopt policies intended to limit devaluations of a country's currency and restore the confidence of international lenders. If currencies plunge too far, the argument goes, then foreign loans become much harder to repay and inflation sets in as imports shoot up in price.
"The mainstream view would still be that the key solutions to crises remain policy adjustments within the countries themselves," said William Cline, chief economist at the Institute for International Finance, which represents lenders. "Once you restore confidence in a country's financial system then you can get its economy growing again."
The chief tools in this approach are sharply higher interest rates and cutbacks in public spending. But the high rates and spending cutbacks invariably produce recessions.
The Clinton Administration argues that once confidence in a financial system is restored, interest rates can then come down, as they have in South Korea and Thailand, and nations can begin the long climb out of recession. But even Thailand and South Korea are still on the side of the road, their economies spinning their wheels rather than moving forward again. "It is too facile to say, 'Look at Korea and Thailand, they are turning around,' " said Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist. "Their economies have taken bigger hits than either country has experienced in the last 30 years."
Like the East Asian countries, Brazil, the latest victim of a financial panic, is hewing to policies that are plunging that country into recession. And as the hobbling of giant Brazil slows economic activity everywhere in Latin America, the odds rise that even the United States and Europe could be caught in the spreading global crisis. That would not happen so much because of recession in Latin America, but because some new blow -- a major bankruptcy, for example, or a sharp decline in American stock prices -- undermines confidence in an American financial system still nervous about Asia and Brazil.
The contrasting view is argued most vehemently by Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, who insists that high interest rates and austerity measures are bringing disaster to many emerging markets. He would keep interest rates down to encourage economic activity and let exchange rates find their own level. A growing economy is more likely to restore investor confidence, he says, than a recessionary one burdened by high interest rates.
"The Treasury and the I.M.F. have driven a large part of the developing world into recession," said Mr. Sachs, who directs Harvard's Institute for International Development. "And the Brazil case makes absolutely clear that the first step is not to defend overvalued currencies. The punishing cost of this is overwhelmingly high. This is a lesson that the I.M.F. and the Treasury have continued to ignore. I don't understand why."
For all the disagreement over how to repair the damaged East Asian and Latin economies, much of the debate centers not on the present, but on how to avoid financial crises in the future. And here the proposals increasingly involve a mixture of fixing the system and fixing the countries -- repairing the highway and making the drivers more cautious and skilled.
On the country side, several proposals have been made to set up a super central bank that would make huge amounts of money available to bail out a country in the event of a crisis. George Soros, the speculator and philanthropist, has offered one version, and another comes from Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director. But to qualify for such bailouts in the future, the countries would have to strengthen their banking and financial systems.
"You would shore up the international system by providing a more meaningful lender of last resort," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
Those who focus mostly on the system would require, among other things, that banks put aside extra money in a reserve fund if they lent into emerging countries heavily burdened with foreign debt. "Putting aside money in that fashion reduces the profitability of a loan, which in turn makes lenders more cautious," said Ricardo French-Davis, a Chilean economist who works in Santiago with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America.
Mr. Krugman goes further in blaming the system and in arguing that the need to fix structural problems in individual countries should not stand in the way of broader macro-economic measures, particularly those designed to stimulate growth in hard times.
In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, he writes that over the last 25 years, much of the global economy has returned in many ways to a "pre-Depression free-market capitalism," with its virtues but also its vices -- the main vice being a vulnerability to spectacular crackups.
"It is hard to avoid concluding that sooner or later we will have to turn the clock at least part of the way back," he writes. "To limit capital flows for countries that are unsuitable for either currency unions or free floating; to reregulate financial markets to some extent, and to seek low, but not too low, inflation rather than price stability. We must heed the lessons of Depression economics, lest we be forced to relearn them the hard way."

More Weakness in Brazil
 SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 28 (Bloomberg News) -- The Brazilian currency fell for a seventh day today, as two failed bond auctions increased concern the Government may be unable to repay its ballooning debt.
The real fell 2.1 percent, closing at 1.9450 to the dollar. The currency has declined 37 percent since a devaluation on Jan. 13.
"Banks are reducing their holdings in Government debt as they are not so sure that the Government will be able pay them back," said Joaquim Kokudai, money market trader at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo.
Brazil failed twice today to auction Government bonds, rejecting yields of up to 35 percent demanded by investors concerned that the Government may be unable to repay its debts.
In the stock market, however, the currency's depressed value was viewed as a further reason to buy Brazilian shares. The Bovespa index rose 3.9 percent, its third consecutive gain.

HEADLINE: Nine West Plans To Cut More Jobs

 BODY:
Nine West Group will cut 144 jobs in its corporate offices, the latest attempt by the struggling maker of women's shoes to reduce costs and improve its profitability.
The layoffs announced yesterday come two months after Nine West said it would eliminate 700 jobs, close two factories and reduce the number of shoes it makes annually. 
 Including the latest cuts, the White Plains-based Nine West has eliminated about 6 percent of its work force of 13,000 since November.
The company will take a charge of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998 to cover the costs.
It has been a difficult year for Nine West, which estimates it sells about 20 percent of all the women's shoes sold in the United States.
Women's footwear sales have been weak, leaving Nine West with excess inventory that it has had to sell at reduced prices. The company closed 20 stores in the second quarter and has become more aggressive in promoting its other products, including sunglasses and handbags.
Nine West was also named earlier this month in a price-fixing lawsuit, which accused the company and several large retail chains of keeping prices artificially high for years on 12 brands of women's shoes.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A generation shaped by digital media presents fresh marketing challenges, a study finds.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere

 BODY:
TO effectively reach the youngest generation of Americans, whose lives are being shaped by digital media, marketers must deliver smarter, more sophisticated messages and build brands with them rather than for them, a new study by Saatchi & Saatchi suggests.
Saatchi & Saatchi, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., based its study on interviews by child psychologists with 84 people ages 6 to 20 across the United States. They were asked what they thought about digital media like personal computers, the Internet, CD-ROM's, video games and cellular phones and other communication devices, and how these media affected their lives. Cultural anthropologists also observed 10 families at home for 50 hours each. 
 According to the agency, the digital media serve several functions for the 80 million Americans born since 1977, the largest generation in the nation's history. The media serve as toys for these young people but also provide developmental challenges. Digital media also function as a virtual hearth at home, the study said. It found that "most families have their digital media set up in a public room of the house; consequently, a lot of digital activities are shared by the family, making these media a center of family life."
In addition, the study found that the new media could function as a "cool library" for the new generation, known as Generation Y. "Generation Y uses digital media as an extension of self socially, intellectually and emotionally," the study said. "By extending the self in these ways, the new media help young people find their identity." And it concluded that digital media act as "power tools" for Generation Y, giving them tremendous access to knowledge.
According to Saatchi, digital media have collectively made Generation Y members more positive and optimistic than Generation X, instilling in the former greater confidence in mastering their destiny. The agency thinks digital media also enhance Generation Y's intellectual and social sophistication by increasing its access to information.
Thus, the study found that Generation Y's values include "connexity," which Saatchi defines as the importance of staying connected to the outside world in order to grow; "coolness" of knowledge, and the importance of self-reliance. "It's the death of the nerd," said Myra Stark, senior vice president at Saatchi. "Knowledge is power for Generation Y, who know that people like Bill Gates rule the world."
The study also found that "kids are still kids and fun is still what matters most," said Anne Adriance, executive vice president at Saatchi. "Being a kid is still about fun, even if it's an edgier fun today."
To respond to this new sense of fun, Saatchi recommends that marketers "advertise up," by pitching Generation Y more adult messages. "If advertising sounds too young, they will tune out," Ms. Adriance said. One campaign that effectively delivers such a message to children and teen-agers, the Saatchi executives said, is the television campaign by Arnell Group Brand Consulting last fall for Tommy Jeans, a division of the Tommy Hilgifer Corporation. "The advertising speaks to kids in an adult fashion, and Usher, the rapper who appears in it, is a teen icon," said Johann Wachs, a Saatchi & Saatchi vice president.
Successful marketing to Generation Y will also challenge their intellectual abilities, the study said. Good examples of this, according to agency executives, include Home Depot Inc.'s "Homer's Workshop," a syndicated how-to television program for children, and its in-store children's workshops, as well as the public television program "Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?"
Not surprisingly, Saatchi also recommends that advertisers create campaigns that speak Generation Y's language, which is visually and verbally sophisticated. One example they cited was a 1998 television spot by Thomas & Perkins for the Denver Zoo. The ad featured a "gigapet," a portable computer some children treat like a digital pet, footage of live zoo animals, and the tag line "Denver Zoo, interactive by nature."
Finally, the agency urges marketers to build connexity brands. "These brands go well beyond a simple product, they facilitate who the child wants to be," Ms. Adriance said. "Nickelodeon's 'Big Help' volunteer program and 'Kids' Choice' awards envelop and empower children. These validate them and give them tools to be what they want to be. Nickelodeon doesn't speak down to them."
Besides stimulating what many consider positive social changes, Saatchi said digital media had also created a potential "digital divide," a division between families and schools that can provide high technology and those that cannot.
According to Mediamark Research Inc., in 1993, 18.6 percent of United States households had computers, while 24.3 percent of households with children younger than 18 had this equipment. In 1998, 35.3 percent of households had computers, including 46.4 percent of households with children younger than 18. However, as of last year, more than one-half of all households with children did not have a computer.
Although the Saatchi study raises the possibility of two-tier marketing to children -- one set of messages for children with access to computers and a second for those without -- agency executives declined to make any definitive conclusions about the need for this.
"We're in a wait-and-see mode," Ms. Adriance said. "Part of it depends on the economics of technology and what technology manufacturers can do to drive their prices down."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Asked About Internet Issues, The Fed Chairman Shrugs

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
He has made a habit of worrying in public that stock prices are getting out of hand, but when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was asked today about the highest-flying investments of all, Internet companies, his answer was tinged as much with fascination and even enthusiasm as with caution.
Mr. Greenspan hardly suggested that he had become a day trader, one of a new breed of investor who goes on line to trade technology stocks on rumor and whim. He left no doubt, though, that he sees more good than bad in a phenomenon that has driven the market value of America Online higher than that of General Motors and pushed the share price of a new company like Ebay from $18 to more than $300 in just four months. 
 The upward march of Internet stocks continued again today. Reaction to better-than-expected earnings from America Online, the dominant Internet access provider, and an announced acquisition by Yahoo, the largest World Wide Web search engine, of Geocities, the biggest provider of personal Web pages, pushed technology indexes and many company shares to new highs.
Asked during a Senate Budget Committee hearing this morning by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, about the attention surrounding Internet stocks, Mr. Greenspan cited not irrational exuberance but the very real prospect of success for at least some companies.
"First of all, you wouldn't get hype working if there weren't something fundamentally sound under it," Mr. Greenspan said. "The issue really gets to the increasing evidence that a significant part of the distribution of goods and services in this country is going to move from conventional channels into some form of Internet system -- whether it's retail goods or services or a variety of other things."
The potential market is so big, he Greenspan said, that there are "pie in the sky" growth opportunities for many companies.
"And undoubtedly some of these small companies, which have stock prices going through the roof, will succeed and they very well may justify even higher prices," Mr. Greenspan said. "The vast majority are almost sure to fail. That's the way the markets work in this regard."
Lest he come across like an analyst promoting a hot sector, Mr. Greenspan quickly added that he viewed the entire Internet-stock phenomenon as another example of human willingness to bet on a long shot.
He compared buying Internet stocks to playing the lottery. For centuries, he said, people have been willing to pay more for a lottery ticket than their chances of winning would justify, simply because they are captivated by the possibility, however remote, of a big score.
"What that means is that when you are dealing with stocks -- the possibilities of which are it's going to be valued at zero or some huge number -- you get a premium in that stock price which is exactly the same sort of price-evaluation process that goes on in the lottery," Mr. Greenspan said.
There has always been a certain dissonance between Mr. Greenspan's libertarian faith in the market and his fretfulness about the ability of investors to gauge risk. And there has been a disconnect of late between Mr. Greenspan's concerns that Wall Street could be in for a downturn and the policy of interest-rate cuts he pursued last fall, probably the single biggest factor in the market's latest rise.
But today Mr. Greenspan sounded downright sanguine.
"Of course, there's some hype," he said, but the securities markets seemed to be doing a good job of funneling capital to promising ideas even if they had not yet proved profitable.
"That's good for our system," Mr. Greenspan said. "With all of this hype and craziness, that is something that at the end of the day probably is more plus than minus."

Durable Goods Orders Rise
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (Bloomberg News) -- Factory orders for big-ticket goods increased in December for the sixth time in seven months as demand for industrial hardware, electronics and electrical equipment accelerated, the Commerce Department said today.
Total orders for durable goods rose 1.9 percent, more than expected, to $192.68 billion last month. In November, orders rose a revised three-tenths of 1 percent, to $189.08 billion.
For 1998, orders rose 3.5 percent after increasing 7.1 percent during 1997, the Commerce Department said. That was the smallest annual gain since 1991, when the economy was emerging from recession.
In another report today, the Labor Department said wages and salaries in the fourth quarter grew at their slowest pace in two years. The employment cost index -- the broadest measure of wage, salary and benefit costs -- rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, less than the third quarter's rise of 1 percent.
In addition, first-time jobless claims fell 15,000 in the week ended last Saturday to a seasonally adjusted 301,000, the lowest level in more than a month. The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure of claims, fell to 333,250, from 351,000 a week earlier.

HEADLINE: Inflated Stocks Cushion Pitfalls Of Net Mergers

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
A handful of leading companies will come to dominate cyberspace.
That snippet of rhetoric has become all the analytical underpinning there is to justify the unprecedented stock market values of the prominent Internet companies like Yahoo, America Online and Amazon.com.
On the face of it, that well could be true. On the other hand, the Internet may make it easier for new competitors to constantly challenge the leaders. 
 Yet one of the byproducts of the irrational exuberance in Internet stock prices is that the prophesied greatness of certain companies becomes self-fulfilling. Their huge market values allow them to grow by acquisitions.
Look at the $3.6 billion purchase announced yesterday by the investors' darling Internet site, Yahoo, of Geocities, the leading creator of electronic communities organized around people's hobbies, passions and peccadilloes.
Geocities is, in fact, an extreme example of the sort of tantalizing potential implicit in many Internet companies. It is the fifth- most-trafficked Web site, on which 3.5 million people have created home pages that were viewed 53 million times a day in December. Geocities has the right to put advertising on or next to all of those pages, but in all of 1998, its revenues totaled a meager $18.4 million. (Profits? Nah. It lost $19.8 million last year, double the loss of a year before.)
Those modest (to be generous) fundamentals did not stop investors from valuing Geocities at $2.2 billion on Wednesday, before the acquisition was announced. With that price tag, Geocities was essentially too expensive for any company, no matter how big, for which traditional rules of finance applied.
But Yahoo, which has a market value of $38 billion, an infinite multiple of its just more than break-even earnings, was easily able to exchange its shares for those of Geocities without breaking a sweat. Indeed, Yahoo's offer of stock worth $113.66 for each Geocities share, was a 52 percent premium over the company's share price Wednesday.
Nonetheless, because Yahoo's value is so high -- and the price it paid represents only about 10 percent of its shares -- Yahoo is telling investors that the deal will have no effect on its per-share earnings after it closes in the second quarter. Indeed Yahoo is promising that it can turn around Geocities and make it add to earnings next year.
As is usual with Internet stocks, investors leaped at any sign of motion. Yahoo's stock surged by $31.875, to $367.75. Normally, companies' stocks fall when they announce expensive acquisitions.
Thus the market is in many ways encouraging the big companies like Yahoo to buy up other Internet companies. The same economics has been behind the other Net deals recently, including the purchase of Excite by At Home and of Netscape by America Online. And many analysts expect Amazon to make some big acquisitions, as well.
But while the mystical multiplication of the stock market limits Yahoo's risk from buying Geocities, the potential rewards from turning the site's huge audience into profits will come much harder.
"Yahoo's plans to seek incremental revenue from Geocities are difficult to see," said Brian C. Oakes, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "If I have a Web page that says I love the New York Jets, who will want to advertise there if they don't control the content?"
Yahoo does have a bigger advertising sales staff than Geocities does and has technical resources that can cut that company's costs.
Moreover, Jeff Mallett, Yahoo's president, says the company sees two areas beyond advertising on the home pages for growth at Geocities. First, it hopes that people who publish home pages will include links to related stores on their pages. For example, a page on cooking would have a link to a kitchen supply site, which in turn would pay a commission on any sales that would be split by Yahoo and the creator of the site.
In addition, Yahoo sees Geocities as a great source of information about the interests of both the creators of the home pages and the people who look at them. It hopes to use this information to expand the profiles it is creating about people's interests -- profiles it uses to send people electronic mail with advertising customized to their particular interests.
Yet whether or not Geocities ever produces much in incremental profits for Yahoo, the acquisition may well pay for itself simply by bolstering Yahoo's perceived "leadership" in the market. Most important, Geocities will substantially strengthen Yahoo's position in the highly watched Media Metrix rating of how many people visit a Web site at least once in a month, a measure they call reach.
Yahoo's sites now rank third, reaching 48.2 percent of the Internet audience. All of America Online's properties combined reach 54.5 percent of the audience, while Microsoft's sites reach 48.4 percent. Geocities, by itself, reaches 33.4 percent of Web users.
Though Yahoo's reach has mostly been flat, Lycos, another Internet service known as a portal because it is a gateway to other on-line services, has been climbing the rating charts. The main reason is that it has been buying up other sites including many of the community sites that compete with Geocities. All of the Lycos sites in December had a reach of 46.5 percent of the audience.
Even amid constant speculation that Lycos will soon be acquired, it is worth $5.3 billion, a huge number but a small fraction of the value of Yahoo. Many Lycos investors, as well as its management, were hoping that if it were able to surge past Yahoo, it might well gain some of the market value accorded to leaders.
"You can never have too much cash or too much reach," said Chris A. Kitze, the chairman of Xoom.com, a community site that competes with Geocities.
No such luck, Lycos.
With Geocities, Yahoo says its reach will increase to 58 percent of the Web audience, an undisputed top position, for now. And that will allow the magic multiplication of Internet stock values to keep working and let the company make even more acquisitions, just maybe allowing it to fulfill the prophecies of its cyber-dominance.

The substantial value placed on Internet companies by investors --despite the scarcity of profits in the industry -- has fueled a spate of mergers among the most popular sites. Yesterday, Yahoo agreed to buy Geocities for $3.6 billion. Last week, At Home agreed to pay $6.7 billion for Excite. And late last year, America Online agreed to pay $4.2 billion for Netscape.

HEADLINE: A New State for Inuit: Frigid but Optimistic

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: IQALUIT, Northwest Territories, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The day the map of Canada is redrawn and native people in the frigid north start to govern themselves is still more than two months off. But this frontier city, which will become North America's newest capital on April 1, is already undergoing a strange Arctic boom.
The new territory has a name, Nunavut. But streets do not, which means that houses do not have addresses, just haphazardly assigned numbers like items in a catalogue. 
 Yet Iqaluit (ee-KA-loo-eet) has its third bank, which will start taking cash deposits as soon as the ice clears and a cargo ship can deliver a safe. And by the end of the month it will be the northernmost community in Canada to have cellular telephone service.
Many of the 4,200 residents still have to flick on a red light at the side of their houses to signal the water-delivery man that their tanks need refilling. But there are now two tanning salons in this new capital, which used to be called Frobisher Bay, and a Chinese restaurant, a local Internet service provider and a Kentucky Fried Chicken outpost.
All over town construction crews are working 10-hour days where the wind-chill sometimes sinks to minus 94 Fahrenheit to finish commercial buildings, dozens of apartments and the new Nunavut legislative building by April 1.
"I try not to get too involved emotionally over what's happening," said Tagak Curley, president of the Nunavut Construction Corporation, an Inuit enterprise that is building the igloo-shape legislative chambers for the Nunavut government. "Otherwise we might lose our focus, eh?"
Mr. Curley, 55, an old Inuit warrior in the battle for native rights, said he felt a great sense of accomplishment now that the vision of an Inuit homeland is taking shape.
"We used to be nervous wrecks, many years ago, worrying about what was going to happen to us," he said. "Now I'm not worried about tomorrow."
What is happening to the people of Nunavut is the latest and biggest example of a trend across the hemisphere. Native groups are demanding self-determination and achieving it.
Indian tribes in the United States have largely won the power to run their reservations. Eskimos in Alaska govern municipalities where they form majorities.
Last year the Nisga'a Indians of northern British Columbia signed a treaty with the Canadian Government that gave them the right to govern themselves in an area more than half the size of Rhode Island.
Nunavut dwarfs them all. But despite optimism as boundless as the sea ice, the capital is uneasy. The extra money of boom times has brought extra problems. Teen-agers' sniffing gasoline for a high last month set fire to and destroyed seven new town houses that were being built for employees of the new government.
The growing mound of trash in the town dump has attracted a huge flock of ravens, whose mad heckling pierces the howling wind. And Inuit lured from the countryside by the possibility of jobs stand in ever longer lines for the night's allotment of vouchers to buy beer and a drink called the paralyzer at the Tulugaq Bar here, one of the few places in Nunavut that serve alcohol.
"We have been anticipating the negative effects of the economic boom," Mayor Jimmy Kilabuk said through an interpreter. "And now they're here."
Nothing but the core functions of the new government -- legislators, courts and tax collectors -- will be up and running by April 1. Other services have been temporarily contracted from the old Northwest Territories government because it has proved impossible to hire enough Inuit with the training to fill new management positions.
About 200 workers have been hired to work for the executive branch. But the goal of having Inuit fill 85 percent of the hundreds of jobs has been reduced, for the time being, to 50 percent.
And no one has yet come up with anything but a vague promissory response to the most nagging question about the future of Nunavut: Will the new territory always be a financial drain on the well-meaning but sometimes resentful rest of Canada?
"Of course there is a danger that Nunavut will end up as a perpetual welfare state," said Graham White, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto who specializes in northern politics. "But it would have been worse to leave things as they were."
The challenges for Nunavut loom like icebergs in these final frantic months before the new territory is created from the eastern 60 percent of what today is the Northwest Territories.
The two current territories in Canada -- the other is Yukon -- have their own governments. But because of their small populations, they rely more on the Federal Government than do the 10 provinces.
Nunavut will be enormous, 770,000 square miles of snow and ice roughly the size of western Europe, without more than a few scrub trees and a few miles of paved roads. Caribou outnumber the 25,000 residents more than 25 to 1.
There are 28 communities within the boundaries of what will become Nunavut on April 1, and most are no bigger than a few hundred hardy souls.
Then there are what the Inuit call the "high statistics." Nunavut will rank among the leaders in unemployment, births, teen-age suicides, spousal abuse and sniffing gasoline and solvents. All are troubles that existed before the Nunavut government was created. All will be dumped in the new government's lap.
And yet Nunavut remains a bold experiment. Its first official step was early this decade, as part of the largest land-claim settlement in Canadian history. Like other native groups, the Inuit sought control of their traditional hunting and camping grounds, as well as demanding compensation for land that the Federal Government had long ago confiscated.
A result was a complicated settlement in which Inuit ownership was recognized over 137,000 square miles, including 14,000 square miles where Inuit also owned subsurface mineral rights. The rest of the land in Nunavut will be federally owned. There was also a settlement of $1 billion to be paid out over 14 years.
Part of the land-claim settlement called for splitting the Northwest Territories in two. The eastern part, Nunavut, would be governed by the Inuit simply because Inuit make up 85 percent of the population.
"This will be a public government with popular elections," said Simon Awa, executive director of the Nunavut Implementation Commission, which studied and then recommended the form of the new government. "We are respecting the Canadian Constitution and Parliamentary system and marrying them with the Inuit traditional knowledge and way of dealing with things."
A result is a government unlike any other in North America. Even though they chose not to restrict the right to vote or run for office to native people, the Inuit of Nunavut will be the first indigenous people in the Americas to govern themselves so completely. It will be something akin to Utah, where the Mormon people, by their numbers and not by law, tend to run things.
There will not be one official language in Nunavut, but three -- English, French and Inuktituk. Many Nunavut planning documents are printed in all three.
Nonpartisan elections for the assembly on Feb. 15 will determine the first 19 members of the legislature, and those lawmakers will select the first premier.
Under a proposal that was narrowly defeated in a referendum, each legislative district will have had two representatives, one man and one woman.
"It was something never tried anywhere in the world," Mr. Awa said. "It may have been too radical an idea to start with. But we may come back to it in two or three elections."
Although the legislature will meet in Iqaluit and the Premier's office will be located here, many of the remaining 10 departments will be spread out over 10 far-flung communities. By decentralizing the government, the Inuit hope to distribute the obvious economic benefits more widely.
Nunavut will have Canada's first Department of Sustainable Development, and a Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth. Managers throughout the government will be instructed to take a more flexible approach to time and will be expected to allow workers time off to pursue traditional activities like seal hunts, which do not always fit into a five-day workweek.
Inuit leaders like Mr. Curley know that many people are ready to declare the folly of Nunavut. "There are a lot of doubters, I know that," he said.
Although he acknowledges that some criticism might be fair, he points out that Nunavut has not enjoyed the advantages that Canada provided to develop other regions.
"They didn't build us a railroad," he said, referring to the supportin the 19th century that built a transcontinental railroad that opened the West. "Economic development in this part of the world is an ongoing challenge."
For now the birth of the government is providing jobs and economic opportunities, especially in Iqaluit. Officials hope that the boom is bigger and longer lasting than earlier ones.
The first flurry of activity was in World War II, when the United States Army, with permission from the Canadian Government, built an airstrip here.
Canadian officials once seriously considered building a dome over the settlement. But when the Northwest Territories were established as a separate government almost 30 years ago, the government constructed a hideous complex on the hill that combines housing, offices, a hotel and even a pool so the government workers would not have to brave the cold.
Although he worries that some poorly qualified people have been put in management positions just because they are Inuit, Kenn Harper, a local entrepreneur who settled here and was for several years involved in the plans to establish Nunavut, remains optimistic. He is building dozens of apartments and plans to build even more next year.
"People are calling me all the time asking about housing," Mr. Harper said. "There will probably be 7,000 people in Iqaluit in a few years."
For Canadians from provinces stuck in economic downturns, Nunavut is a beckoning opportunity, a frozen rainbow. "There's tons of work here," said Terry Charter, a contractor from Nanaimo, British Columbia, who is working on one of the many residential construction sites here. "The creation of Nunavut is great for the people of Nunavut, and it's great for us, too, because it puts us to work."
Mayor Kilabuk, who was born in a native camp 60 miles from Iqaluit, said that as an Inuk, the term for an individual Inuit, he was proud that Nunavut would soon be a reality.
Though he is confident about the town's future, he remembers a story that the elders of his community, now long gone, had told him as a child.
"What I can tell you," he recounted, "is that they said Iqaluit will become a big center and have a lot of problems and a lot of challenges that would come from outside. I don't know how they were able to predict that so accurately, but they did."

Ford-VolvoTie: Europe Rivals at Risk

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: GOTEBORG, Sweden, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's victorious bid for Volvo A.B.'s car business increases the pressure on other European automobile companies to either buy or be bought, industry executives and analysts say.
Those with the most precarious futures are middle-sized companies like Renault S.A. and PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and, as it clearly recognized by trying to buy Volvo itself, Fiat S.p.A. of Italy. Each of those companies lacks the size to compete with the giants like DaimlerChrysler A.G. or the General Motors Corporation. On top of that, they remain bogged down in brutally competitive markets for midsized and small cars. 
 Today's agreement was a particularly big defeat for Fiat, which had openly courted Volvo and was reported to have offered about $7 billion for the entire company. Besides the car business, Fiat executives were also entranced by the idea of combining the two companies' truck and construction equipment businesses.
"Needless to say, the bid failed," said a discouraged Fiat executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Volvo decided to sell exclusively its car-making activity and to hold on to the other businesses, which were, I might add, of greater interest to us."
But analysts said it also marked a setback for Renault and Peugeot, which remain heavily dependent on the French market and on lower-priced and less profitable mass-market vehicles.
"Ford has taken a very appealing brand out of the market, and that is bad news for almost everybody else," said Chiara Tirloni, an automobile analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London.
Ever since Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation announced their $36 billion merger last year, European car manufacturers have been engaged in a frenzy of mixing and matchmaking.
"In the European and in the global automobile market, it's not just fusion but also confusion that you're seeing," said Bernd Gottschalk, the president of the German Automobile Industry Association.
Though Volvo is a small player, producing fewer than 400,000 cars a year, it has important strengths, the most important being its strong appeal to affluent consumers who are willing to pay comparatively higher prices for family cars. In addition, Volvo has a well-established distribution network in the United States.
Europe's automobile industry is divided into several different camps that face somewhat different pressures. DaimlerChrysler is essentially in a league of its own, a goliath with a huge mass-market presence in North America and an equally strong base in high-priced luxury cars in Europe.
BMW A.G. and Porsche A.G., meanwhile, have continued to be successful as smaller producers of more expensive sedans and sports cars. BMW has been the subject of repeated takeover rumors, but the company has adamantly denied any interest in selling.
But most of Europe's other producers are struggling to bridge the gulf between mass and class. Thanks to global overcapacity and a reluctance by European consumers to spend money, competition has been brutal for the last several years among producers of midsized or small cars.
Volkswagen A.G., which has cut costs and streamlined its production, has been one of the biggest sources of pressure for companies ranging from Fiat and Renault to G.M.'s Opel subsidiary.
After a painful reorganization in the early 1990's, Volkswagen's sales and profits have surged in the last year. But even though its Audi subsidiary has been successful as a producer of upscale sedans, a few of which compete with DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes, the company is still searching for ways to move beyond mass-market sedans.
Unlike most of its European peers, Volkswagen is already big enough to compete in today's environment. It produces more than four million cars a year and has about $11 billion in cash to make additional acquisitions.
The situation is considerably grimmer for French and Italian car companies. Though Fiat has a significant international presence, it has far less cash than Volkswagen or Ford and has been under increasing competitive pressure.
Fiat's profits were depressed last year by the end of Government-sponsored rebates in Italy, and weakening in two big overseas markets, Poland and Brazil.
And after announcing its intention to invest $400 million in Russia, the company had to put plans on hold when that nation's economy collapsed last summer.
Fiat had at least a half-dozen meetings with Volvo officials, most of them near Fiat's headquarters in Turin.
But Fiat executives said their real target was Volvo's truck-making unit, which produces heavy trucks that might have complemented Fiat's line of smaller trucks.
Volvo surprised many of its suitors two weeks ago when it bought a 12.8 percent stake in a rival Swedish truck maker, Scania A.B., and said it wanted the two companies to merge their truck operations. But the relationship is still in doubt because it has provoked strenuous objections from Scania's majority shareholder, the investment firm Investor A.B.
Renault of France had a strong year in 1998, thanks to the success of its new Scenic minivan in Europe. But it still produces fewer than two million cars a year, and Peugeot Citroen is only slightly bigger.
Analysts say both companies are in a poor position to keep up with the accelerated pace of developing new models at low prices. The heightened competition means that all companies are under pressure to spread research and development costs over a much wider array of cars.
While companies like BMW and Porsche can avoid the problem to some extent because they charge premium prices, mass-market producers like Renault and Peugeot have no such maneuvering room. And the pressure is intensifying: Toyota is building a $700 million factory in France to make its small Yaris car for the European market.
But the French companies face political in addition to financial challenges. The French Government has traditionally blocked attempts by foreign companies to acquire major French corporations in almost any industry. The Government owns more than 40 percent of Renault and is not likely to relinquish control any time soon.
To be sure, Renault has made its own overtures abroad.
It has held talks about acquiring a minority stake in the Nissan Motor Company of Japan, which is in dire financial straits and needs a new partner. But DaimlerChrysler is also in formal talks with Nissan.
Georg Sturzer, an automobile analyst at Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank in Munich, said that the easiest solution for the French companies would be to merge them.
"But I am not at all sure that would be sensible, in part because they are both in the same market and wouldn't gain that many advantages," he said.

Ford Buys Volvo Car Unit in Bid To Lift Profile of Luxury Models

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company, by agreeing yesterday to buy the car operations of Volvo A.B. of Sweden for $6.45 billion, has taken its biggest step yet toward becoming a large-scale seller of high-profit luxury cars as well as more humble vehicles like the Escort and pickup trucks.
Ford has already bought Jaguar and Aston Martin in recent years, but the acquisition of Volvo, a favorite of affluent urban families in the Northeastern United States and northern Europe, represents a far greater bet on the luxury market. Sales of luxury cars are rising in the United States and Europe while auto makers' profits on less expensive cars have evaporated as low-cost manufacturers in places like South Korea flood markets in the United States and elsewhere with ever- cheaper cars. 
 Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that the auto maker sold 200,000 luxury cars last year but wanted to sell a million annually within several years. Volvo sold 399,700 cars worldwide last year while Ford sold 6.6 million cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks, plus a small number of heavy trucks.
Mr. Nasser and William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman, said that they liked Volvo's current lineup of cars and were not planning immediate changes. Both men also said that they admired Volvo's tradition of paying attention to safety and environmental issues.
"It was very important because it fits very nicely with the social values at Ford," Mr. Ford said.
Ford has increasingly emphasized the same issues as Volvo in recent months, making its sport utility vehicles pollute as little as cars and announcing plans to offer side air bags on all cars. The shift has come as Mr. Ford has reasserted family control over the auto maker in recent months and begun imposing the Ford family's longtime tradition of public service, best shown by the creation of the Ford Foundation.
Ford's purchase of Volvo, while costlier than many auto analysts had predicted, was well received on Wall Street yesterday. Shares of Ford rose $2.1875, to $62.50, while Volvo's American depository receipts fell 81.25 cents, to $26.5625.
While Volvo's popularity among affluent baby boomers may be useful to Ford now, some auto industry experts questioned whether Ford's long-term strategy truly required Volvo.
Susan Jacobs, a consultant in Rutherford, N.J., noted that Lincoln recently introduced its LS cars to appeal to the same market -- sporty vehicles costing $30,000 to $45,000 -- while Jaguar will soon start selling its new S-type cars in the market.
"Lincoln and Jaguar are both evolving toward the market of Volvo," she said.
Mr. Nasser said that Volvo's car business was attractive because it filled gaps in Ford's current lineup. Volvo has a much higher proportion of women buyers than Ford has for its existing luxury brands, Lincoln and Jaguar. Volvo sells 60 percent of its cars in Europe, while Ford sells only 24 percent of its cars there. And Ford has an extensive distribution network that can be used to sell Volvo cars more widely, Mr. Nasser said.
Mr. Ford said that the auto maker also thought it could learn from Volvo's techniques for assembling the main structural parts of cars and for achieving high customer loyalty and customer satisfaction ratings.
Leif Johansson, Volvo's president, said that his company would use the 50 billion Swedish kronor from the sale of its car division to strengthen its huge and more profitable commercial truck and bus division. Volvo took a 12.8 percent stake earlier this month in Scania A.B., its Swedish archrival in the commercial truck industry, and has expressed an interest in taking control of it.
Volvo shareholders will not vote on whether to approve yesterday's agreement until March, which leaves time for other auto makers interested in the company, notably the General Motors Corporation, to decide whether to make hostile bids topping Ford's friendly agreement.
International auto mergers have a history of producing ruinous culture clashes. So Ford executives took great pains yesterday to try to reassure Swedish workers and managers that the change in corporate control would not mean an immediate imposition of American managers and production techniques.
"We've been in Sweden since 1924 -- they know us and they know how we operate," Mr. Ford said. "I don't think we've ever been viewed as a parochial company."
Volvo tried to merge with France's Renault in 1993, but the deal collapsed when midlevel Volvo managers complained publicly that their French counterparts were too bossy. After Renault took control of the American Motors Corporation in the early 1980's through a series of stock purchases, cultural differences produced managerial chaos, and American Motors was eventually sold to the Chrysler Corporation.
When Daimler-Benz A.G. acquired Chrysler last autumn, it tried to avoid cultural differences by leaving virtually all of Chrysler's senior management in place, although Germans still outnumber Americans by 9 to 2 in the top tier of management at the new DaimlerChrysler.
Ford has been unusually successful at international mergers, having bought Jaguar a decade ago and made it profitable while fixing the chronic quality problems that long tarnished Jaguar's reputation. Probably not by coincidence, Ford has also been more aggressive in promoting foreign-born executives to top jobs: Mr. Nasser was born in rural Lebanon and grew up in Australia, while his predecessor, Alexander Trotman, was British.
By contrast, all of the top 16 executives at General Motors, the world's largest company, are American men. G.M. owns half of Volvo's main rival, Saab A.B., and has an agreement to buy the other half, but Saab is still struggling, and its brand image remains murky despite G.M.'s efforts to clarify it.
Ford's success at Jaguar and its international staff were the main reasons why Volvo chose Ford's bid over a slightly higher offer from Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, people close to the negotiations said.
Fiat said yesterday that in any case, it had only been interested in buying all of Volvo, including its big business in heavy trucks and buses.
Mr. Nasser said at a news conference yesterday in Volvo's hometown of Goteborg, Sweden, that Ford would use its experience with Jaguar as a model for its management of Volvo's car operations.
Ford has begun replacing inconspicuous Jaguar parts like suspensions and electrical systems, which it can buy at much lower prices because of the economies of scale available to it as the world's second-largest auto maker.
Ford has also started encouraging dealers to own both Ford and Jaguar dealerships, although seldom selling both kinds of vehicles side by side so as to avoid blurring distinctions between the vehicles.
But even 10 years after Ford's purchase of Jaguar, the biggest savings are still several years away. Ford plans to build the next Ford Thunderbird and Jaguar S-type car on the same underbody it already uses for the Lincoln LS cars.
Unlike Jaguar, Volvo is profitable and has a fairly wide selection of modern car designs. As a result, Ford will only move gradually toward using common parts and building Ford and Volvo cars on virtually identical underbodies.
Ford will pay the $6.45 billion price tag entirely in cash, which will be easy for a company with $23.8 billion in cash reserves.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Define Deviancy Up

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
On just one condition, journalists and lesser Americans have every right to deride the way the Senate is conducting the trial of President Clinton. If they don't, they should.
The senators wear their nonpartisan clothes, walk, talk and probably sleep in them. But when it comes to voting and maneuvering they strip right down to their partisan buff.
The senators cannot stand the strain of their trial regulation forbidding all of them to speechify inside the chamber. So they run outside during the day to line up for TV time; right away they feel better.
The senators are supposed to use any ponder power they possess and however long it takes to come to a decision on whether the President should stay or go. But most act as if their real job is to rid themselves of the whole thing right away and return to more important matters, unspecified. They keep waving their hands, hoping the teacher, or anybody, will let out school.
And they pass up the critical witness on influencing a witness, the President's secretary. She is a nice woman, and understandably nervous. Do you expect them to take the chance of her breaking into tears?
All Democrats and many Republicans decided long in advance of the trial that although they thought Mr. Clinton terribly naughty, his lying and obstructing justice are not grounds serious enough to be convicted.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of my very favorite politicians, goes along with them. In 1993 he warned America against "defining deviancy down" -- acceptance of actions we once regarded as acutely offensive, immoral or illegal.
Derision time right enough -- on that one condition: Remember who got us here, who forced the trial, who put the country brain-deep in his own muck. Forgetting that is like forgetting that Judge Ito did not kill O. J. Simpson's former wife.
Bill Clinton gambled the moral, political and historic reputation of the Presidency -- showing what he thought of the office and himself.
He lied. He lied in private and in public, with or without oath. He lied to friends, enemies, subordinates. He proved what the Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska once said about him -- "Clinton is an unusually good liar, unusually good."
If perjury aggravated by repetition is not enough, examine damage to government. He captured and tied up the entire White House in his lies. He lied directly to some of his government employees, used others as shields, and kept some theoretically ignorant so they could say sorry, we cannot inform the public.
Impeachment is a political and moral matter, as well as legal. Nobody I know except senators even pretends "nonpartisanship" about the trial results.
I voted for him twice -- first with great hope, the second time because near Election Day I thought he might be better equipped than Bob Dole. I was wrong, trapped in the remnants of old hopes about Bill Clinton.
A guilty verdict would repair the Presidency and country. The voters would for at least two years retain the political and economic continuity so many want. The man Mr. Clinton picked would be in the White House.
Republican leaders, in terror of the public, say there is no chance of a two-thirds majority for a guilty verdict, so let's quit trying and get out of here. That is nullification of law by jury, openly and during the trial.
Censure: The Constitution makes no place for any decision on impeachment but guilty or not guilty.
But, atoning for my second Clinton vote by laying down my status as a constitutional expert, temporarily, I sacrifice opposition to censure if the move to convict fails.
Censure must be plain and tough enough to leave a reminding bite mark through history. In The Washington Times of Jan. 15, Jim Guirard Jr., a Washington attorney, proposes one such. The motion of censure, passable by simple majority, would consist of the impeachment articles already approved by the House of Representatives but deleting reference to trial or verdict.
The President would not have to agree or sign -- a demand that would guarantee insipidity. But both Houses would support and preserve the validity of the perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
There would be no punishment but history's. And deviancy would be defined upward.

Greenspan Tells Congress Not to Rely on Surpluses
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told the Senate Budget Committee not to count on Government budget surpluses to solve Social Security's problems. Instead, he suggested that benefits may have to be cut or taxes raised to insure the retirement system's future.
Last week, President Clinton proposed shoring up the system with $2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion in surpluses anticipated over the next 15 years. But Mr. Greenspan pointed out that budget forecasts have been notoriously unreliable in the past and are likely to remain so in the future. Page A1. 

Some of the high-flying Internet stocks are fundamentally sound and will succeed, Mr. Greenspan said in response to a question from Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Others, however, will fail, he said. He attributed the entire Internet-stock phenomenon to human willingness to bet on a long shot. C6.
 
Nasdaq Index at Another High
The Nasdaq composite index gained nearly 3 percent to close at another record. The index finished up 70.2 points at 2,477.34, spurred by a 2-for-1 stock split of Intel.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Scandal Touches African Athletes

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In the West African nation of Senegal, there is one all-weather running track, one indoor basketball court and one Olympic-sized pool, filled with seawater and located not at a training center, but at a hotel.
"We have to arrange for the training of our athletes," said Lamine Diack, the president of the Senegal Olympic Committee. "Now, we are building our first swimming stadium. Our problem is one of having not enough facilities, equipment and coaches. Our dream is to have the same sports system in our schools that the United States has. Then we will raise a lot of champions. But without facilities and coaches, it is impossible." 
The International Olympic Committee, under its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has made the Games a truly global event. Athletes from 197 nations took part in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, a wholesale reversal from the boycott-tainted 1970's and 1980's.
But the far-reaching Olympic corruption scandal could threaten the long-term participation of athletes from developing nations, particularly from Africa, which already struggles to support sport while contending with more urgent problems of poverty, disease and war. In these developing nations, a decent pair of training shoes can be a luxury. Some of the teams arrive at the Olympics without so much as uniforms.
Seven Olympic committee members from Africa -- more than a third of the continent's representation on the world's most influential sports body -- have been dismissed, resigned or remain under investigation in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. An eighth member linked to the scandal died last year. One of those ousted by Samaranch, Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, was perhaps the most influential of Africa's I.O.C. members, serving as president of the continent's association of national Olympic committees. Replacements for the ousted members will not necessarily come from Africa.
Potentially more devastating than a decimated leadership is the threat to aid programs operated by the I.O.C. that provide training scholarships, coaching clinics and equipment and are funded by corporate sponsorships and television fees. If corporate sponsors begin pulling out of the Olympic movement, and television rights are devalued, the financial drought will begin to dry up aid to developing nations that need it most, Olympic officials said.
"The real losers will be millions of kids and athletes who won't be funded," said David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, one of a dozen worldwide corporate sponsors of the Olympic movement. "This scandal, if not handled right, could force governments all over the world to have to take over the funding of these programs, and the quality of athletic programs could be set back 30 years."
The international committee operates a little-known but much appreciated program called Olympic Solidarity, which is budgeted to spend $122 million from 1997 through the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The money, generated by television rights fees, is earmarked for the 198 national Olympic committees worldwide and contains 12 programs designed to train and develop athletes, coaches and administrators. The program has proved especially vital in developing nations.
In Africa, for instance, Olympic Solidarity is funding sprinters at a training center in Senegal, and distance runners at a center in Kenya, while negotiating to train athletes in judo and wrestling in Ivory Coast and boxers in Tunisia. Among other things, Olympic Solidarity pays at least $40,000 a year to each national Olympic committee, and pays travel and accommodation costs for up to six athletes and two officials from every country to attend the Games.
Funds from Olympic Solidarity will be bolstered by another $110 million in corporate sponsorship money distributed by the I.O.C. to international sports federations from 1997 through 2000. Beyond that, the financial pipeline is dependent on continued belief by corporations and television networks in the ideal that the Olympics can contribute to world peace through sport. This notion faces tremendous skepticism at the moment.
"If corporate sponsors pull back, you should see far fewer athletes from underdeveloped nations in Athens in 2004," said John Lucas, an Olympic historian and retired professor at Penn State University.
A decline in Olympic participation by athletes from developing nations, particularly in Africa, would seriously erode one of the pillar achievements of Samaranch's presidency. He took over in 1980, four years after African nations boycotted the 1976 Montreal Games, rebuilt the continent's commitment to the Olympics and has been commended by President Nelson Mandela for his role in edging apartheid toward final collapse by readmitting South Africa into the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, after an absence of three decades.
Because NBC has agreed to pay $3.5 billion for the five Winter and Summer Games to be held between 2000 and 2008, Olympic officials said they are confident that Olympic Solidarity will continue to grow. Michael Payne, the committee's marketing director, said the funding for Solidarity is expected to rise to $200 million for the quadrennium between 2001 and 2004.
But while he has attempted to create a global appeal for the Games, Samaranch was also the one who appointed all eight committee members from Africa who have been connected to accepting cash gifts, medical treatment, tuition aid and lavish gifts from Salt Lake City Olympic officials. Other African officials have joined in the call for a housecleaning of the international committee, although no one has called for Samaranch to step down.
For some, there remains the outside chance that the scandal and the expulsions of African members might ultimately prove beneficial. The Salt Lake City revelations could spur the I.O.C. to offer more training programs to developing nations, said Sam Ramsamy, an I.O.C. member and president of the South African Olympic Committee.
"If more programs were in place, maybe these inducements wouldn't be necessary," he said.
Despite an insatiable need for more financing and training programs, African athletes distinguished themselves at the 1996 Atlanta Games, winning both the men's and women's marathons, the men's 1,500-, 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs, the 3,000-meter steeplechase, two women's swimming events and the men's soccer competition.
Elite athletes earn extravagant salaries and endorsement deals, but they do it largely by leaving the continent. Soccer players go to Europe. Distance runners, courted by agents and shoe companies like Fila, Puma and Nike, have dispersed, at least part of each year, to racing circuits and training camps in England, the Netherlands, Italy, the United States and Japan.
"I think it's better to get rid of these officials," said Jos Hermens of the Netherlands, the manager of Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, the world's top distance runner, who won a gold medal in the 10,000 meters in Atlanta. "Corruption is a big problem. Money always goes to the wrong people, ends up in private bank accounts. It can't get any worse."
But the neediest countries are the most vulnerable to financial inducements, said Keba Mbaye, an international committee member from Senegal, who was on the six-member commission that investigated the Salt Lake City bid committee. It is not clear whether the removal of a number of members will automatically improve the situation.
For instance, Charles Mukora, dismissed last Sunday as an I.O.C. member from Kenya for allegedly receiving payments of $34,650 for his personal benefit, remains the head of his country's national Olympic committee.
Federico Rosa, a sports manager from Italy, whose family represents such Kenyan athletes as Moses Tanui, a two-time winner of the Boston Marathon, said he believed that Mukora had done a commendable job in welcoming sports agents and shoe companies into the East African nation.
"He understood that the more companies were there to get athletes, the more money there would be for everybody," Rosa said. "It is not possible to know that if he loses power it will be better."
In Senegal, Diack said he appreciated the $50,000 or so per year his Olympic committee receives from Olympic Solidarity, but that he could use four times as much. Senegal has taken a common approach of cobbling funds from a variety of sources. The Senegalese Government pays for travel expenses, he said. China built the national track stadium in Dakar, the capital. The French Government and the world governing body of track and field, of which Diack is a senior vice president, constructed a national training center for sprinters and jumpers.
"The money from the I.O.C. must go to the countries to develop sport, not to cities organizing the Olympics," Diack said. "My Olympic committee gets $40,000 or $50,000, and Athens is guaranteed $1 billion to organize the 2004 Summer Games. Something is wrong."

HEADLINE: Global Computer Industry Grew 15% in '98

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 28

 BODY:
The worldwide personal computer industry grew 15 percent last year, led by strong demand in the United States, where 37 percent of all households are now connected to the Internet, according to preliminary statistics being released Friday by Dataquest Inc.
"Affordability and growing relevance of Internet content is sustaining double-digit PC growth in the U.S.," said Bill Schaub, vice president for Dataquest's personal computing and peripherals group. 
 Worldwide, the Compaq Computer Corporation remains the No. 1 seller of personal computers, shipping 12.8 million computers in 1998 to gain 14 percent of the market. I.B.M. kept the No. 2 position with 8.2 percent of the market, but the Dell Computer Corporation decreased the gap, growing 65 percent in 1998 to account for 7.9 percent of all personal computers shipped.
"Dell now has posted 13 consecutive quarters of 50 percent-plus growth, leveraging its business model to insure that they are the price leader in the professional market," Mr. Schaub said.
The Hewlett-Packard Company finished the year as the fourth-largest shipper of personal computers, with 5.8 percent of the market, and Packard Bell NEC Inc. was fifth with 4.3 percent.
A separate report released by the International Data Corporation based on preliminary calculations showed slightly different figures for personal computer sales and market share but concurred with Dataquest as to the top five vendors in 1998.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees Hard Choices To Preserve Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned Congress today not to count on projected Government budget surpluses to solve Social Security's problems, and he suggested that the two parties would still have to cut benefits or raise taxes to insure the retirement system's future.
Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan was clearly trying to interject a dose of hard reality into the debate over Social Security, which for the last week has centered on President Clinton's proposal to shore up the system with $2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion in surpluses the White House anticipates over the next 15 years. 
 Relying on the surplus reduces the sacrifices that would be necessary from today's workers and tomorrow's retirees, and for that reason Republicans, too, have generally endorsed allocating a big portion of the surplus to Social Security.
Mr. Clinton has alluded in general terms to the need for measures in addition to using the surplus, but has avoided specifics, while Republicans have been silent or called for solutions that require neither tax increases nor benefit cuts.
Last week and again today, Mr. Greenspan criticized one element of the White House's Social Security proposal, saying that its call for the Government to invest $700 billion in the stock market would result in political meddling in the free enterprise system. But Mr. Greenspan was supportive again today of Mr. Clinton's call for a large portion of the surplus to be used to bolster Social Security by paying down the national debt.
Mr. Greenspan's main message today was that budget forecasts have been notoriously unreliable in the past and are likely to remain so in the future, making 15-year surplus projections a rickety structure on which to base a solution to Social Security's long-term financial gap.
The country should be wary of assuming "extraordinarily large projected surpluses as far as the eye can see," Mr. Greenspan said. "I use that term advisedly, because it was originally used on the deficit side, and it was obvious that as far as the eye could see wasn't all that far. And I suspect that we may find the same characteristic of nearsightedness re-exhibiting itself in the current period."
Mr. Greenspan noted that the Congressional Budget Office had predicted in February 1997 that the Government would run a deficit in 1998 of $121 billion. The actual outcome was a surplus of $70 billion.
It is unclear how receptive Congress will be to Mr. Greenspan's message. Just hours after he spoke, the Congressional Budget Office gave Congressional leaders a new budget forecast showing a total surplus over the next 11 years of nearly $2.7 trillion.
The budget office projections, which appeared to be roughly in line with the $4.4 trillion, 15-year surplus projected by the White House, show the overall surpluses mounting rapidly, from $107 billion in the current fiscal year to $381 billion in 2009.
They projections include $794 billion in surpluses over the eight years starting in 2001 that are beyond those that come from excess payroll taxes nominally earmarked for Social Security -- in other words, a true surplus derived from annual spending being lower than annual revenues from general tax collections. Republicans have been counting on the emergence of a true surplus to finance their plans for an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates.
Assuming that the overall surpluses materialize and are not used for new spending programs, Mr. Greenspan said, Mr. Clinton's strategy of using the surplus to bolster Social Security by paying down the national debt is the soundest policy option available.
Reducing the debt held by the public would be the best way to strengthen the economy in the long run, Mr. Greenspan said.
But given the risks that a downturn in the economy or the stock market could cause the surpluses to evaporate, Mr. Greenspan said, Congress and the Administration need to keep looking for ways to increase the amount of money available for Social Security or to decrease benefit payments. Mr. Greenspan led a commission in the early 1980's that pushed through both tax increases and benefit cuts.
Raising taxes now or altering the Social Security system to require increased savings and investment through private accounts might prove too politically "burdensome," Mr. Greenspan said.
As a result, he added, the country would have to examine a long menu of potential benefit cuts, in the form of changes like an older retirement age, a reduction in cost-of-living increases or a less generous formula for calculating lifetime earnings.
In his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Clinton said his plan, which also called for the Government to invest a portion of Social Security's reserves in the stock market, would keep the system afloat until 2055, compared with 2032 if no changes are made.
Because of the huge numbers of baby boomers who will begin retiring over the next several decades -- 76 million in all -- Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits starting in 2032, unless changes are made.
But the benchmark for financial health in Social Security is solvency for 75 years, and Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the two parties would have "to make hard-headed but sensible and achievable choices" to meet that goal.
But he did not lay out the possibilities, much less endorse any of them, and most Republicans have avoided the subject altogether.
Asked about Mr. Greenspan's comments, Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said the Administration "could not agree with him more" about the need for further bipartisan steps to insure the system's solvency.
A senior House Republican aide said the issue was a "crucial question" facing both parties, and was part of a broader debate over whether Congress and the Administration should settle for a partial solution on Social Security and defer the hard choices for another day.
Before it became apparent that the budget surplus could ease much of the pain of addressing Social Security's woes, the two parties had been circling warily around a variety of options.
Mr. Clinton had ruled out increasing the 12.4 percent payroll tax rate that finances Social Security. But liberal Democrats were advocating other ways of increasing revenues, including an increase in the wage level subject to the payroll tax, currently $72,000.
Republicans, however, have been adamant that they will not accept any kind of tax increase. They have been more open to other options, including an increase in the retirement age, which is already scheduled to rise gradually to 67 over the next several decades. But organized labor has promised a ferocious effort to block any further increase in the retirement age.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony today came as Republicans continued to question whether Mr. Clinton's plan to use the surplus for Social Security was anything more than an accounting gimmick. And it came at a time when members of both parties are increasingly pessimistic that there will be enough bipartisan trust in the aftermath of the impeachment trial for Congress and the Administration to reach a deal on Social Security.

HEADLINE: CBS Granted More Tax Cuts to Stay Put

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Six years after New York City granted CBS Inc. nearly $50 million in tax breaks to stay in Manhattan until the year 2008, the city has given it an additional $10 million in subsidies -- after being told the company was considering relocating to New Jersey.
Under the old deal, the company had pledged to spend $300 million to upgrade its studios on West 57th Street with digital equipment. But it only started doing so 18 months ago. The new deal extends the company's commitment to Manhattan for an additional 10 years, until 2018, and city officials said it contains new assurances that the network will make the investment that it had earlier promised. 
 CBS told city officials last spring that it was considering moving its studios to the Newport Office Center, on the waterfront in Jersey City. That apparently sent the city scrambling to keep the CBS jobs from heading to New Jersey.
Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said yesterday that the city agreed to provide the additional benefits because there was a real danger that CBS would have moved to New Jersey, despite the company's 1993 pledge to remain in Manhattan until 2008.
"The threat was very real," Mr. Levine said. "We made this deal competitive with the offer from New Jersey that they were considering. The fact that we can secure their presence for the next 20 years is very good for the city." CBS also committed itself to keeping its corporate offices, now at 51st Street and the Avenue of the Americas, in Manhattan.
Critics of such corporate retention deals said that the new subsidies amounted to a reward for a company that was threatening to break its original agreement with the city.
"There are no standards" for granting such subsidies, said Ronnie Eldridge, a City Councilwoman in whose West Side district the CBS studios are situated. "They're just giving away benefits to large companies. If we were as tough on corporations as we are on poor people, the city would have more to spend on schools, bridges and subways."
Dana McClintock, director of communications at CBS, said that the latest agreement, which he called an "amendment" to the original deal with the city, recognized that CBS had undergone many changes in the last six years.
Real-estate developers and economic development officials in Jersey City said they doubted that CBS was serious about relocating
Thomas Gallagher, director of economic development in Jersey City, said that Jersey City officials had met with CBS last spring. But, he said, nothing came of it, and no offer was made to give CBS any benefits.
"We had some conversations," Mr. Gallagher said. "I wouldn't say they were negotiations. At some point, we moved on to other prospects. In their case, a New York location is probably better for them."
City officials have come under increasing criticism for granting tax breaks to a multitude of companies that have threatened to flee New York without assessing whether the threat is real. Critics say the subsidy packages shift the city's tax burden to small and medium-sized companies and rob the city's treasury of desperately needed funds.
The threat of moving is not always illusory, though, and some companies will move, for business reasons, no matter what. Indeed, CIGNA Healthcare and U.S. Trust Company announced yesterday that they would move about 1,000 employees from Manhattan to the Newport Center in Jersey City.
Under the Giuliani administration, the city had given 43 companies, including Conde Nast, Bear Stearns and Reuters, a total of more than $1.5 billion in tax breaks, cash and subsidized electricity. The New York Times received a similar tax break, for a printing plant in College Point, Queens, during the Dinkins administration.
"Now the city has embarked on a potentially costly path of rewarding companies that already have a lucrative retention deal," said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a private research organization.
In CBS's case, for nearly a year the company's executives have said that they were considering a variety of options, including moving the 35-year-old studios to a new building at Donald J. Trump's Riverside South project and the Jersey City waterfront. If the company had moved across the river, Martin Franks, a senior vice president at CBS, acknowledged that CBS would have had to pay back the city for the tax breaks it has received since 1993 if it abandoned Manhattan.
"It's no secret we were being courted by people outside the city," Mr. Franks said. "Had we moved outside the city, we would have made whatever refund was appropriate."
According to city records, between 1993 and July 1997 CBS made use of more than $23 million of the property and sales tax breaks and electricity subsidies that it was allowed.
Under the terms of the 1993 deal, CBS was to invest $300 million in upgrading its studios with digital technology for high-definition television broadcasts. But the installation of equipment at the CBS studios has gone more slowly than the company anticipated in 1993. It only began in 1997, after the Federal Government established standards for the new broadcasting method.
Mr. McClintock also noted that since the original agreement with the city, CBS had acquired Infinity Broadcasting and American Radio Systems, and was acquired itself by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
"Our existing agreement with the city was amended to better reflect the structural changes that have formed the new CBS corporation," Mr. McClintock said.
The new deal with CBS requires the network to maintain at least as many employees in New York City as the 1993 agreement: a minimum of 3,862 full-time employees.
Six years ago, Mayor David Dinkins hailed the $49.5 million deal with CBS as a breakthrough that would encourage private companies to remain competitive by investing in new technology. The subsidy package included $31 million in sales tax exemptions, $6.5 million in property tax credits and about $12 million in subsidized electricity.
After that package, Capital Cities/ ABC immediately demanded its own subsidy package and eventually received $26 million in tax breaks and other incentives for its studios, near Lincoln Center. NBC, which got a $100 million tax break for its studios in Rockefeller Center in 1987, received an additional $7 million benefit in 1996.
After reaching the CBS deal, Laurence A. Tisch, then the chairman of the company, vowed to turn the low slung, red-brick broadcast complex on 57th Street into "a facility for the 21st century."
Mr. Tisch also tried to draw a distinction between CBS and other large companies who routinely threatened to leave Manhattan in order to obtain tax breaks. "We never threatened to leave the city," Mr. Tisch said at the time. "I just wanted us to be treated like everyone else."

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Adding Officers Is Key to City's Health

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
For Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, every aspect of the city's revitalization -- from the demonstrable growth in tourism to the impressionistic sense that residents feel better about their hometown -- can be attributed to its dramatic crime reduction. And that is the reason he gave yesterday to justify his plan to add as many as 1,500 officers to what is already the largest police department in the nation.
Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that increasing the police force to more than 40,000 officers, which he said would cost $32 million, might appear "counterintuitive" given that the crime rate has plummeted to the lowest levels in two generations. But he said the city needed more officers to maintain the reduction in violent crimes, continue a campaign against drugs, and focus on domestic violence and property crimes like automobile thefts and burglaries. 
 "It is going to be difficult for us to continue to reduce crime," the Mayor said, pointing out that New York City had 629 homicides last year, the lowest number since the mid-1960's and fewer than in Chicago, a city less than half its size. "But the further down that we drive them, the more all the other things that it helps to produce" will grow exponentially.
The proposed increase comes at a time when New York City already leads the country's 10 most populous cities in its per-capita complement of police officers. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the city had 5.1 officers for every 1,000 residents in 1997; Chicago had 4.9 per 1,000, followed by Philadelphia with 4.4 per 1,000.
In addition, some of the second-tier crimes that the city plans to tackle with the increased complement of officers have declined in recent years. Auto thefts have fallen 61 percent in the last five years, while burglaries have declined 53 percent.
"This strategy is working," the Mayor said. "Why back away from it now?"
Eli Silverman, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who recently finished a book about the reorganization of the New York Police Department, gave qualified agreement. "If your expectations are to continue to drive down crime, you can't lose momentum," he said. "The truth is, I don't know when we'll hit diminishing returns until we hit it."
The Mayor's proposal, presented as part of his annual discussion of the administration's financial plan, concerns matters of politics as well as that of the city's overall well-being. The Police Department has bolstered its highly touted drug task forces with officers drawn from the precincts, a practice that has annoyed the City Council. The Mayor's plan, which would send replacements to those precincts, seemed yesterday to mollify some Council members.
In addition, the public identity of the Mayor is primarily defined by his reputation as a former Federal prosecutor who reined in a crime-ridden metropolis. That persona has served him well in recent trips to other states, and he is expected to exploit it if he decides to run for the United States Senate or another higher office. Any increase in crime might compromise that get-tough reputation, said Jay Severin, a Republican campaign strategist.
If the crime reduction "disappears, or if it is compromised, then the New York story -- which is the Rudy story -- becomes like Cinderella at midnight," Mr. Severin said. "He turns back into a big-city mayor instead of the knight that led the biggest, most dangerous city in the world into a new heyday."
The Mayor has attributed some of the city's success in fighting crime to the increased number of police officers, although he emphasized the importance of "strategic deployment." The average head count has grown from 36,703 in fiscal year 1994 to a projected number this fiscal year of 39,397, the Mayor's office says. By fiscal year 2000, city officials estimated, the average count will be 40,078. Reminded yesterday that he had proposed cutting the force three years ago -- an action he never took -- the Mayor said simply: "I was wrong. That was a mistake."
Mr. Giuliani explained that the 850 cadets who graduate from the Police Academy next month will be used to expand the antidrug activities, particularly in Queens and the Bronx. Then, in April, about 1,300 cadets scheduled to graduate "are going to be used to backfill precincts that have lost some police officers because of the drug initiatives," he said.
The administration has touted those drug initiatives as major successes, but they have come at a cost: fewer police officers have been available to work in neighborhood precincts. As a result, critics point out that citywide response time -- the average time it takes the police to respond to a 911 call -- rose in fiscal year 1998 to 9.8 minutes, from 9.2 minutes in fiscal year 1997.
City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, the chairman of the Council's public safety committee, said yesterday that he was pleased that more officers would be sent to the precincts. "Before, with the emphasis of the Giuliani administration on drug initiatives, the community policing beats have not been staffed to the extent that we'd like," he said. "This is a time when one should simply say thank you."
Glenn Pasanen, the associate director of City Project, a liberal public-policy organization, was not as willing to offer gratitude. He said that Mr. Giuliani was clearly favoring the Police Department at the expense of other city services, from education and health care to social services. "The Mayor is throwing money at the Police Department, just as he accused other past mayors of throwing money to social services," he said.
The larger question presented by the Mayor's plan was raised by Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council. "The question now is, 'Is the Mayor doing too much?' " he said. "We don't know. We'll take a look at it."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI BROADENS SPLIT WITH PATAKI WITH BUDGET PLAN

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani stepped up his criticism of Gov. George E. Pataki's spending practices yesterday as he proposed a $35.4 billion budget for New York City, setting the stage for a rancorous battle with Albany over school aid.
The centerpiece of Mr. Giuliani's spending plan is a proposal to build new schools using $2.5 billion of the city's anticipated share of the settlement with the tobacco industry. The city is to receive $6.7 billion from the settlement, in installments over two decades. Mr. Giuliani said the city would borrow the money to build the schools over the next three years, then pay off the debt with its annual payments from the tobacco industry. 
 Mr. Giuliani also proposed hiring up to 1,500 new police officers, which he said would help the city expand antidrug efforts.
While the Mayor called for cuts in a number of areas, including libraries and youth programs, he also proposed using several hundred million dollars to expand art and reading initiatives, put computers in every middle school and start an experimental tuition voucher system.
He accused Mr. Pataki, a fellow Republican, of providing insufficient state aid for such initiatives.
The Mayor was angered last week when the Governor ordered a state investigation into the city's school construction practices. And Mr. Giuliani used the opportunity of his budget address to amplify a complaint that he has raised daily since Mr. Pataki announced the investigation: that Albany repeatedly sends New York City less school aid than it is entitled to.
The city has about 38 percent of the state's schoolchildren, according to the Mayor, yet it receives about 35 percent of total state aid to schools.
New York City mayors have long complained about state school aid, but Mr. Giuliani himself took the position early in his tenure that a more serious problem in the city's schools was poor management, not a lack of state funds. More recently, though, he has expressed confidence in the leadership of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and added his voice to the familiar complaint about school financing from Albany.
"In the budget that the Governor released," Mr. Giuliani said, "that disparity would grow, particularly with new dollars, very, very substantially." Such an approach, he added, "doesn't make much sense if you're really interested in children being educated more effectively."
By loudly disparaging the Governor's spending plan, Mr. Giuliani could be putting himself in an awkward political position. He has expressed interest in running for the United States Senate in 2000, and his chances of winning the Republican nomination could be significantly weakened without the support of Mr. Pataki, who has emerged as the unquestioned leader of the state's Republican Party.
Mr. Giuliani could lobby the Legislature to reject Mr. Pataki's spending plan, but in doing so, he would be in the odd position of joining forces with the Democrat-led Assembly when he is hungry for statewide Republican support.
As with previous budget plans, the Mayor was generally conservative in his proposals for new spending yesterday despite a strong local economy that has enabled the city to build a $1.6 billion surplus this fiscal year. He wants to use the surplus to reduce budget shortfalls, which are expected to rise in coming years because of tax cuts and labor settlements that have already been approved.
Mr. Giuliani called for $591 million in program cuts, including $37 million from the budget for public libraries, $23 million from museums and other cultural organizations, and $19 million from youth programs. Among the affected youth programs is an after-school program that the city started last year with help from the financier George Soros. The Mayor recommended cutting $5 million for that program, a move that City Council officials vowed to fight.
The Mayor also proposed $338 million in new tax cuts, including $51 million from eliminating the sales tax on all clothing and footwear, which would require approval from Albany, and $166 million from extending a tax relief program for owners of co-ops and condominiums. He also called for setting aside $100 million for future tax cuts while a newly formed commission comes up with recommendations.
Besides pressing for money for art classes in the schools, Mr. Giuliani said he and Dr. Crew were discussing new funds for school sports programs, which have fallen on hard times recently. He offered no specifics, but his aides later said the Mayor envisioned increased funds for playing fields, uniforms and equipment.
He said during his address at City Hall that the city had every reason to be optimistic about his proposals, which he said held spending virtually flat. "We are proposing a budget next year that in essence, in terms of city funds, will be a no-growth budget," he said. "New York City is now setting the way for fiscal responsibility."
But independent budget monitors said the Mayor's spending plan was actually 2 percent to 3 percent larger than last year's. The city is not projecting a spending increase because under its own accounting rules, the surplus is counted as being spent in the current fiscal year, even though the Mayor is using it to cover next year's anticipated shortfall.
Independent monitors criticized his plan for the surplus yesterday, saying the city should use the $1.6 billion to reduce its heavy debt load.
"Despite the strong economy, the city is using that money to balance the budget," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization. "He is missing a perfect opportunity for the city to show some fiscal discipline and use the surplus to pay down its debt."
But fiscal monitors and Council leaders appeared receptive to Mr. Giuliani's plan to use tobacco money for school construction, saying it was a good alternative to raising the city's debt burden. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who led the Council in rejecting Mr. Giuliani's spending plan last year, said yesterday, "We are really delighted that the Mayor selected our main priority -- schools and the building of schools and our children -- as his main priority in the budget."
But the Speaker, a Democrat, said he would not allow Mr. Giuliani to make cuts to libraries and youth programs. And he expressed discomfort with another of the Mayor's proposals: to squirrel away about $800 million in revenue from the commercial rent tax over four years, for future stadium construction.
"We are not against using government resources to help build stadiums," said Michael Clendenin, a Vallone spokesman. "But the Speaker has serious reservations about keeping the commercial rent tax around to fund that kind of project."
While the Mayor might skirmish with the Council on certain proposals, he suggested yesterday that Mr. Pataki would be his primary opponent in this year's budget battles. While he praised Mr. Pataki's plan to cut Medicaid, he said several times that the education spending that the Governor announced in his budget message on Wednesday was unfair to New York City.
Under the Governor's budget plan, the city would receive $17.7 million of the $154 million increase in statewide education spending, or about 12 percent. Mr. Giuliani said the city had been expecting at least $300 million more than it got in state education aid and now faced a shortfall.
Mr. Pataki did not respond to Mr. Giuliani's comments yesterday, but his spokesman, Michael McKeon, disputed the Mayor's arithmetic, saying the city was to get 38 percent of the proposed increase in school aid. But the spokesman was counting only the largest category of aid. The city also receives several smaller categories of state aid, which Mr. Pataki has proposed cutting.

 BODY:
Eight months after he began construction of an office tower on the Jersey City waterfront, the developer Richard S. LeFrak has lured two companies and almost 1,000 employees from Manhattan to the building.
Cigna Corporation and the United States Trust Company of New York have signed leases for more than half the available space in the 14-story building at the Newport Office Center, Mr. LeFrak said yesterday. 
 With rents rising dramatically in Manhattan, tenants have begun looking for less expensive space in New Jersey for the first time since the office boom that preceded the recession in the early 1990's. New Jersey also offers tax breaks for tenants.
Mr. LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, said that he expected the entire 567,318-square-foot building to be leased by the time it opens at the end of this year.
Early next year, United States Trust will move about 300 employees to Newport Center from several buildings in Manhattan. Cigna, an insurance and financial services company based in Philadelphia, will move its health care division and about 660 people to Jersey City from 770 Broadway, at East Eighth Street, in Manhattan.
"It's about economics," said Josh N. Kuriloff, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield and a leasing agent at Newport Center. "You can get space here at potentially half the cost of first-class office space in Manhattan." CHARLES V. BAGLI

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Collecting;
Cars With Star Quality, Rat Pack to Fab Four

BYLINE: By KEITH MARTIN

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.

 BODY:
THIS may be the biggest weekend of the year in sports, but for car collectors, the Super Bowl has come and gone.
In a four-day buying spree here last weekend at the 28th annual Barrett-Jackson auction, nearly 600 highly desirable cars changed hands at prices ranging from the expected to the extraordinary. Size alone assures Barrett-Jackson a position of prominence among aficionados. But beyond that, over the last four years the event has accurately gauged the prevailing winds driving collectors and investors, serving as an indication of the health of the collector market. 
 Barrett-Jackson has also evolved from a simple auction into a spectator sport that draws a bigger on-hand audience than the Super Bowl. This year, some 125,000 car buffs watched, at various times, as more than 2,000 bidders vied in sometimes heated competition to take home some of the world's most interesting and coveted cars. A total of 734 cars were offered and 567 were sold. That 77.2 percent selling rate compares with 65.5 percent a year earlier.
Total sales reached $20 million, plus $1.7 million from the big-ticket cars in the Exposition Tent, a separate area where cars are sold one-on-one, allowing for more complicated transactions, including trade-ins. Expo sales ranged from $126,500 to $1.2 million, for a 1931 Duesenberg Model J LeBaron Special Phaeton.
"America's economy is booming, America is where the money is, and Americans are buying the dream cars from their youth," Craig Jackson, owner of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, said in summarizing this year's results. "There were plenty of Europeans in the audience, but unlike four or five years ago, when they could cherry-pick through the cars they wanted and take home the best ones at bargain prices, this year they just couldn't match up to what the Americans were bidding."
The highest auction-block sale of the weekend, at $304,500, was a 1973 Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona Spyder, one of 124 built by the factory. Authenticity plays a big part in the market value of Daytonas; coupes were often converted to open cars by after-market specialists; one such Daytona "chop job" sold here for $127,050.
The loudest cheers of the weekend went to the buyer of an immaculately restored 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible who paid $89,250, at least $30,000 above the normal price for this model. Painted turquoise with a white top, it had a 283-cubic-inch V8 and a rare factory fuel-injection setup, a three-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip (positraction) rear end.
Bidders were willing to ante up for vehicles with celebrity ties, like three cars once owned by members of Hollywood's Rat Pack. In their heydey in the 1960's, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin indulged their automotive desires as freely as they flaunted their pursuit of wine, women and the good life. A car formerly owned by each crossed the block here.
A 1956 Ford Thunderbird two-seat roadster originally owned by Frank Sinatra brought $159,600, easily $130,000 more than a standard '56 T-Bird. The custom-colored metallic gunmetal-silver car was laden with options, including a factory hardtop, wire hubcaps, fender skirts, an external spare tire mounted in a Continental kit on the back bumper, a spotlight and dual rear antennas.
Among car collectors, Old Blue Eyes commands the kind of premium that "dot com" adds to common stocks. Last August, Christie's got $178,500 for an ordinary 1989 Jaguar XJS coupe at Pebble Beach, Calif. Without Sinatra's name on the title, such a car would be worth barely $10,000.
The cars of Sinatra's cohorts didn't do as well. A 1962 Dual-Ghia L6.4 coupe once owned by Dean Martin, in slightly disheveled condition with custom-fitted luggage, chrome wire wheels and distinctive appointments including a gun holster under the driver's seat, sold for $63,000 to the Blackhawk Collection in Danville, Calif. Though it was among only 26 Dual-Ghia coupes built, the selling price was in line with those of cars that lack a celebrity connection. These exotics combined Italian coachwork with a powerful 383-cubic-inch Chrysler V8; they were built by Ghia in Italy and distributed in the United States by Dual Motors.
The most impressive of the Rat Pack cars did not find a new home. Davis's 1964 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III convertible -- what the British call a "drophead coupe" -- failed to sell despite a bid of $305,000. With a body by Mulliner, the English coachbuilder, and exquisitely restored with maroon paint and a tan leather interior, this is one of fewer than 30 left-drive Silver Cloud III convertibles built. A car in similar condition sold for $247,500 in December 1997 at an auction in Greenwich, Conn.
While Davis's and Martin's cars failed to move bidders' paddles, Elvis and the Beatles set the crowd rocking. An enormous 1965 Rolls-Royce Phantom V limousine -- with a rare left-hand-drive configuration -- brought $115,500, more than twice what these behemoths normally fetch. The car's providence was extraordinary, however, in that it had a double-Beatle history. John Lennon, the original owner, sold it to Richard Starkey -- better known as Ringo Starr.
Two cars once owned by Elvis Presley also did well. A mundane four-door 1976 Cadillac Seville, two-tone blue with a custom grille and garish gold trim -- typical of Elvis's cars -- sold for $30,450 to the 120-car Klassix Auto Attraction in Daytona Beach, Fla. "We'd been looking for an Elvis car to go in our celebrity section," said David Murray, the winning bidder. "We already own the Batmobile, the Munsters' Dragula, and the Flintstones movie car driven by John Goodman."
Mr. Murray conceded that a seller "would be lucky to get more than $7,000 for the same Cadillac without the Presley history."
The second Elvis car brought more. A 1969 Mercedes-Benz long-wheelbase 600 sold for $72,400, although its air suspension seemed to have collapsed. That flaw was perhaps offset by the gold-lettered "TCB" on the doors -- for "taking care of business." These cars have a reputation for being exceptionally difficult and expensive to repair; $20,000 would be considered a generous offer for a regular 600 in like condition.
Several Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwings, with their trademark flip-up doors, did well. A recently refurbished '55, in silver with a black leather interior, sold for $189,000. The same car had sold last March at an auction in Las Vegas, Nev., for $138,600, demonstrating that even for high-end collector cars, fresh paint and a wax job pay dividends.
Of the many Corvettes sold, the most unusual was a 1963 coupe that was customized by the General Motors styling staff and presented to their long-time boss, the legendary designer Harley Earl, in his retirement. Festooned with 16 gauges and adorned by external exhaust pipes that resembled a bundle of snakes, it brought $152,500. "We've sold this same car four times now," Mr. Jackson said. "And each time we get more money for it."
After the last car had crossed the block, the elaborate auction tents had been taken down and tumbleweeds were again blowing across the Sonoran Desert, Mr. Jackson reflected on the prospects for the market.
He said he saw collectors moving into cars that are not necessarily perfect, but offer good times. "I'd keep an eye on mid-50's Chevys in driving condition," he said. "People want cars they can take to cruise-ins, relive the past and enjoy themselves.
"The buyers we get at Barrett-Jackson, especially the first-timers, aren't looking for show cars to pamper and admire. They just want something they can have fun with."

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption with the Collecting column on the Automobiles page on Jan. 29, about an auction of cars once owned by celebrities, referred incorrectly to one of two Rolls-Royce limousines associated with the Beatles. The car to the left of the caption was indeed once sold to Ringo Starr by John Lennon, and was sold last month for $115,500. But the one shown beneath the caption, with all four Beatles standing in front of it, was a different car. A former manager of the Beatles, Allen Klein, says he bought that car from John Lennon and still owns it.

HEADLINE: A Credit Card for Every Occasion

BYLINE: By Michael Rosenbaum; Michael Rosenbaum is an investor relations consultant.

 BODY:
Every January, inch-thick credit card statements clog the mailbox, the unwelcome aftermath of year-end celebrations. But it could be worse -- $5.7 million worse.
That's how much debt my family would have if we had taken advantage of all the credit cards and home-equity loans offered to us in 1998. Even at low, low introductory rates of 3.9 percent, the interest on $5.7 million comes to a mind-boggling $222,000 per year, or a little more than one minute's income for Bill Gates. 
 Trying to decipher all the offers is a full-time job. We received 150 offers -- and that was just by mail. An equal number came by phone or on the Internet.
Most cards are named after metals, usually gold, platinum or titanium. But companies have added their own spin to names in a hopeless attempt to help customers differentiate among the products. Mastercard comes in nearly a dozen flavors, including Platinum, Platinum Plus, Platinum Edge, Universal Platinum, Purchase Rewards Gold, Platinum Select and, just to be different, Select Platinum.
Mastercard edged out Visa in the total number of cards offered us, 62 to 61, but Visa is the champ in the battle of affinity cards. Most affinity cards came from companies trying to win customers by playing to buying habits or professional interests. As a high school teacher, my wife, Jill, qualified for the $100,000-limit Platinum Edge Mastercard for Educators, offered by invitation only through Advanta. Of course, educators don't really get a special deal: she received the same offer from Advanta without any reference to her status as a teacher.
The most unusual affinity card came from Capital One, whose British Heritage Visa Platinum Card includes a Union Jack on the card, apparently offered because we toured England a year earlier. Otherwise, it appears to be identical to every other Platinum Visa.
Apparently, credit card marketing is much like professional sports and computer programming: signing bonuses are offered everywhere.
The University of Illinois and Northern Illinois University gave us identical offers for Visa cards, but one offered a bonus of a windshirt (a $60 value!!!), and the other enticed us with a free gym bag ($80 value!!!). Ringling Brothers dangled four complimentary tickets to the circus as an inducement to take their Mastercard, and Montgomery Ward offered a mini boombox -- but that deal expired in August 1997, at least four months before the mass mailing reached us.
Interest charges on credit cards must be incredibly profitable these days, because almost every card offered came without an annual fee. More than half the offers cited interest rates in the 3.9 to 5.9 percent range, but those usually applied only to balances transferred from other cards. The lowest fixed rates were in the 8 to 10 percent range, and we were offered that rate three dozen times.
There's no clear pattern to credit limits, at least none apparent to this recipient. AT&T offered us $25,000 and $50,000. Citibank offered us a card with a $1,000 limit; then the limit jumped to $50,000 in a subsequent offer. Twice, Sears offered us a credit line of $4,032. How did the company arrive at that number? Why weren't we good for at least $4,050?
Showing a clear lack of awareness of how money is spent in America, my wife received only 53 offers, while I got 82. Our two teen-aged daughters, Susan and Stephanie, received four offers each -- a dubious honor, since it placed them in a three-way tie with Current Resident.
Three of the offers to Current Resident originated with Unicor Funding, which dangled $25,000 in mortgage money in front of us without any apparent review of our finances. We received 24 such blind mortgage offers in all, from Bank One's offer of up to $250,000 at an attractive rate of 7.74 percent to the more discerning Capital One's offer of $10,768 at an 11.9 percent rate.
Unfortunately, we don't know how much of the $5.7 million we could have added to our credit lines before the pre-approved offers would have stopped or our applications would have been rejected. That's something we could test this year.
This year we've already received a half-dozen Platinum Visa offers and an ill-timed mailing from Discover ("Just in time for the Holidays!") with an increase in our credit limit. At this pace, we'll hit the $6 million mark in no time.

HEADLINE: Value-Free Economics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I was surprised to find the Austrian economist Joseph A. Schumpeter cited in support of a multidisciplinary approach to economics (Arts & Ideas page, Jan. 23). He repeatedly stressed that economists should refrain from annexing the territory of the philosopher, the psychologist or the politician. His goal was an economics on the model of a value-free science. 
 Schumpeter took a dim view of Keynes's concept of social engineering and his proposed use of monetary policy to smooth out the business cycle. Schumpeter believed that to do so would be to rip the motor out of the capitalist economy, as capitalist growth required those "waves of creative destruction" that could land a society in a trough like the Depression.

HEADLINE: Several Major U.S. Airlines Lift Fares Across the Board

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Several major airlines made across-the-board increases in their fares yesterday, sending stock prices in the industry soaring as investors apparently believed that a price increase would finally stick after numerous abortive attempts in recent months.
If the increase does stick, it would be the first industrywide since the fall of 1997. But a number of major airlines, including United Airlines and Trans World Airlines, had not gone along with the price increase as of late yesterday, indicating that its success was far from assured. 
 The increase was initiated by Delta Air Lines, which raised its last-minute, unrestricted business fares 2 percent and advance-purchase, restricted leisure fares 4 percent. Northwest Airlines, which has foiled recent attempts to increase fares, quickly matched Delta, leading many to believe that the other carriers will go along.
"It looks good that this one is going to stick," said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Northwest, which saw its traffic fall as a result of a pilots' strike in September, had been discounting heavily in order to woo back business travelers. "They said that they would be back to status quo in the first quarter," Mr. Murphy said. "Here we are one-third the way through the first quarter, so it makes sense that they have appetite for a fare hike."
The airlines have raised prices on various routes and in various classes over the last year but a systemwide price increase has proved elusive.
Though flights are full and demand is strong, industry revenues fell 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998 compared with the comparable period in 1997, indicating that pricing had weakened. With recent economic indicators for the national economy stronger than previous estimates, many investors believe that the airlines are poised to surpass profit estimates if they can raise prices.
News of the fare increase sent Northwest stock soaring 18 percent yesterday, or $4.125 a share, to close at $27.375. Shares of the other major carriers also rose sharply: Delta increased $4.4375 a share, to $54.5625; the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, gained $4.25 a share, to $58.75, and the UAL Corporation, the parent of United, closed at $62.25, up $3.875.
The airlines can change their fares several times a day by filing them with an electronic clearinghouse. If even one carrier decides not to match a general fare increase, the others will usually back down for fear of losing passengers.
"It only takes one," said Terry Trippler, who closely follows air fares as a columnist for a Web site, 1Travel.com. "T.W.A, even though they aren't one of the big ones, if they don't do it, it will fail."
But an industry executive who insisted on anonymity said that if T.W.A. were the only holdout, the other airlines might simply raise fares on all routes but those flown by T.W.A. That was not possible when Northwest did not go along because it is too large.

HEADLINE: Gore Seeks to Protect Trade From World's Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore warned today that the world had to "prevent the financial crisis of 1998 from becoming the trade crisis of 1999," and said the United States would seek the "outright elimination" of the huge and politically sensitive subsidies that European nations provide to farmers.
Mr. Gore's statement was his first detailed speech on the fragility of the world economy. It came at his debut appearance at the annual gathering here of the world's richest industrialists and the top government officials who are trying to right the world economy after 18 months of market plunges and currency upheavals on three continents. 
 While his audience was from all over the world, his message was intended for farmers and others at home who have been demanding that Washington relieve the effects of extraordinarily low commodity prices that have depressed exports.
In a half-hour speech that leapt from the economic tumult to a new strategy for easing the debt of impoverished countries, Mr. Gore sought to offer a middle ground that would anger neither the labor unions suspicious of the Clinton Administration's trade policies nor the executives suspicious of Mr. Gore's relationships with environmentalists and unions.
But Mr. Gore stopped well short of tackling the most divisive questions being discussed, especially how governments might stem the huge outflows of short-term investment capital that destabilized Asia, Russia and now Brazil.
Instead, he declared that "the global capital market itself needs to be better and more cooperatively managed, not through new global bureaucracies, and not through the laissez-faire approach that has caused so many of today's problems, but through more information, more openness, more cross-border reviews and cooperation."
One executive whom Mr. Gore's staff consulted on the speech said later, "They couldn't decide where to come out on what to do, so they came out in favor of doing more but not too much."
Mr. Gore also met for 90 minutes today with Russia's Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, discussing conditions that Russia must fulfill before the largest Western industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund will resume payments.
But the two men appeared to have made little progress. A senior Administration official, describing the session, said the United States and I.M.F. are still doubtful that Russia has a plan in place to collect taxes and raise sufficient revenues to make its new budget "credible."
Officials familiar with recently resumed negotiations between the fund and Moscow say it will be months before Russia receives additional funding. And if further loans are forthcoming, the first since Russia defaulted on debts last August, they may be designed chiefly to allow Russia to repay debts on older loans.
The two leaders also addressed Russia's export of missile expertise to Iran, with Mr. Gore reiterating Washington's threat to suspend cooperation on commercial space launches until Russia curbs technology sales to Teheran.
In his speech, Mr. Gore said the budget that the Administration sends to Capitol Hill on Monday will include "significant new U.S. funding" to pay off the debts of poor and highly indebted nations, many in Africa.
He was critical, however, of the subsidies European nations pay their farmers, saying they "cost the average European family about $1,500 a year." He also attacked Europe's efforts to restrict sales of beef raised using biotechnological products, a regulation that European officials say is motivated by concerns about public safety, and that Washington says is driven by protectionism.

HEADLINE: Council Puts Strict Limits on Fishing to Save New England Cod

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The New England Fishery Management Council voted on Thursday to reduce the daily cod catch in the Gulf of Maine to 200 pounds per boat from 400 pounds and to ban fishing within 30 miles of shore off a 180-mile stretch of the United States coast from Maine to the top of Cape Cod Bay.
The restrictions were imposed in hopes of saving the cod, once a cornerstone of the fishing industry. 
 The restrictions would ban all gear capable of catching ground fish, including cod and flounder. Scallopers and lobstermen are exempt from the ban. The new limits will be phased in starting in May, pending approval from the Commerce Department in Washington.
Fishermen said the changes could cost thousands of people their jobs.
"If there are varying degrees of death, this is one of them," said Paul Cohan, president of the Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance.
The restricted area will be divided into four sections to be closed one at a time on a rolling basis in May, June, October and November, said Teri Frady, a spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
In the past, restrictions have been imposed to rebuild stocks in the fishing area between Cape Cod and the tip of Maine.
But after scientists in December released a report that the cod population was at its lowest in 30 years, the council determined that the cod catch should be cut by 80 percent.
Testimony was heard from dozens of fishermen on Thursday in a hotel in Portsmouth, N.H. Some said the restrictions would hurt fishermen from Massachusetts and New Hampshire with smaller boats, but would be easier on those from Maine, who typically have larger ships and can fish farther out at sea.
The restrictions could inflict regional economic losses of $19.9 million to $21.8 million, according to an estimate in a draft analysis completed this week.
As many as 2,500 fishermen could be out of work and 700 boats could be grounded, according to an estimate from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Fishermen said they would look for other jobs, and fish brokers said they would look to Canada, Iceland and the Pacific to fill orders. Some predicted that prices for the fish will rise.
"We know this will seriously impact small-boat fishermen," said Chris Kellogg, a council officer. "But unless there was a substantial reduction in fishing levels, the cod stocks would have continued to drop."

Trash Piles Up On Hopes Of Parolees

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
SEVERAL years ago, a pristine plaza sprang up on Second Avenue near East 118th Street, attracting crowds for free food, weddings, parties and revival meetings. The plaza, built by a group of ex-convicts who lived next door at the United Christian Prison Ministry, was a luminous sight in East Harlem. What was once a dumping ground for junk and junkies became a haven lined with skinny palm trees, murals of dreamy clouds and elegant arches. Hovering above it all -- O.K., bolted to the side of an adjoining building -- was a big wooden dove.
Now the bird looks like a cartoon character frozen in flight by a frightful sight: the plaza is a heap of wood, plaster and broken glass. The very men who built it took it apart a month ago when the city -- which had leased the land to them for $150 a month -- auctioned it to a private buyer for $100,000. Soon, illegal dumpers returned at night to turn the lot back into an eyesore. 
 "Forget about it," said the Rev. Ramon Cabrera, the ministry's founder, who is scrambling to raise more than $100,000 to buy the lot. "I have to turn my head when I walk by there."
Ashes to ashes, dumps to dumps was not exactly what Mr. Cabrera expected when he first leased the lot. A weapons charge landed him in prison for eight years. A jailhouse conversion guided him to East Harlem, where in 1992, he and his wife, Mercedes, took in paroled convicts who slept on the floor of the couple's apartment. Later, the ex-convicts roomed in the basement of a Pentecostal church. Finally, Mr. Cabrera rented a building next to the Second Avenue lot, fixing it up with castoffs scavenged in nightly Dumpster raids. He also signed a monthly lease with the city for the lot.
"We wanted to show people that we were not a threat to anybody," he said. "To show everybody we can clean this place up."
Mr. Cabrera planned to turn the plaza's site into an expanded residence and training center for the ex-convicts who arrive there after years upstate. He was preparing a proposal to seek state financing to buy the site and build on it. Some 40 men now live in a hodgepodge of rooms above the ministry, sharing one bathroom per floor and hanging their clothes on bunk beds packed into barracks-like rooms. Although officials ranging from Representative Charles B. Rangel to the local community board members supported him, their pleas did not prevent the auction.
"I understand they didn't have the funds on hand to purchase the property at auction and that although they had tentative plans for development, they didn't have funding secured," said Denise Collins, the spokeswoman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which ran the auction. "But that's not our primary issue. For us it is the fact that this property is surplus, and we have as our priority the disposition of surplus property for which there is no city use."
MEMBERS of the ministry reply that the government has no use for paroled convicts looking to stay straight.
"What makes all this hard is that it is politically correct for politicians to use prisoners as their platform to build up their power base," said an ex-convict in the ministry, Henry Rivera. "Look at the Governor. He's talking about doing away with parole. But it's not politically correct to take a public stance in favor of a program helping ex-offenders."
Assemblyman Nelson Denis, whose district office faces the ministry, said city officials overlooked the ministry's long-term ability to prevent repeat offenses in favor of short-term financial gains.
"The city is divesting itself of any property it can to bolster the balance sheet so they'll look good now," Mr. Denis said. "That looks good financially, but it won't really accommodate the needs of a community like mine." With tens of thousands of dollars spent a year to house an inmate, he said, "it's an ill-founded way of demonstrating economic leadership when you are disemboweling local communities."
While Mr. Cabrera embarks on a fund-raising drive, he has put on hold much of his group's charitable work: without the lot, they have no place to distribute fruits and vegetables from a food bank. The basement chapel is cluttered with chairs and other equipment that used to be in the plaza. It's an obstacle course all around.
"I saw somebody's dream in this place," said Alberto Paez, who arrived at the ministry on May 18 last year. "When you have a dream to do something and you want to set things right, so many obstacles get put in your way. It's crazy."

Nasdaq Passes 2,500 as G.D.P. Rise Revives Profit Hopes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday on news of a surprising surge in United States economic growth, which raised confidence in the outlook for corporate profits. The Nasdaq composite index wrapped up its biggest monthly gain in 24 years.
The Commerce Department's report that gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter was far above the 4.5 percent analysts expected. Prices rose at the slowest pace in 40 years, quelling concern that faster growth would incite inflation and drive up interest rates. 
 "The concern has been, will earnings come through?" said Art Micheletti, chief investment strategist at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money manager in Foster City, Calif. "And when investors saw the stronger number, they interpreted it that maybe we can hit earnings targets."
The Nasdaq index surpassed 2,500 points for the first time, rising 28.55, or 1.2 percent, to 2,505.89. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 77.50, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 9,358.83, with I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard accounting for almost half the gain. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.27, to a record 1,279.64. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by 1,705 to 1,332 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Government report also contributed to a rally in the bond market, even though signs of economic strength are frequently regarded as a reason to sell bonds. Traders said the evidence of benign inflation in the report was viewed positively.
The 30-year Treasury issue rose 11/32 , to 102 19/32 , and its yield, which falls when the price rises, declined to 5.08 percent from 5.10. "We're seeing a pattern here," said John Boritzke, who helps oversee $9 billion at M&I Investment Management in Milwaukee. "That pattern is one of low inflation."
The rally in stocks was strongest among computer makers, which derived strength from a report by the research firm Dataquest that shipments of personal computers rose a greater-than-expected 15 percent last year. I.B.M. rose 4 9/16 , to 183 1/4; Hewlett-Packard rose 4 1/2, to 78 3/8, and Dell Computer rose 5 13/16 , to a record 100.
Computer-related shares sent the Nasdaq up 14 percent in January, the third-biggest monthly advance in its 28-year history and a reflection of the voracious investor appetite for high-technology and Internet companies.
Shares of food companies declined. Those companies lose appeal when the economy is accelerating because they tend to underperform those that do well in expansions. Kellogg fell 1 7/16 , to 40 5/8, after the world's largest cereal maker said fourth-quarter profit fell 41 percent, matching forecasts. Unilever, producer of Lipton tea and Good Humor ice cream, dropped 1 5/8 , to 40 5/8 .
Among other strong performers yesterday, Amgen, the world's biggest biotechnology company, rose 8 1/4, to 127 13/16 , after reporting earnings of 90 cents a share, beating expectations, on strong sales of its anemia drug, Epogen, and plans for a 2-for-1 stock split.
Stocks overcame an early decline caused by a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago that Midwestern manufacturing, a bellwether of broader trends, declined in January.
Investors were also concerned that a renewed slump in Brazil's currency might yet undermine North American financial markets. Brazil's currency dropped for an eighth day, reaching its lowest level since its Jan. 13 devaluation.
Airline shares gained after Northwest Airlines raised full and discount fares, a move that other carriers were expected to follow. Northwest gained 4 1/8, to 27 3/8. Continental Airlines rose 3 3/8, to 34. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, gained 3 7/8, to 62 1/4. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained 4 1/4, to 58 3/4.

HEADLINE: Mayors Applaud President and His Urban Proposals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
President Clinton took advantage of a meeting with mayors from more than 200 cities today to announce that he is seeking a hefty raise for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Mr. Clinton's proposed increase of $2.5 billion would give the agency a record $28 billion at a time the Administration was using every bit of good news to draw attention from the impeachment trial in the Senate. 
 In a meeting that lasted more than an hour in the East Room of the White House, the President thanked the mayors for their role in helping drive down crime rates, expand job growth and improve the living conditions for many low-income Americans. But he emphasized that more work remained.
"The present prosperity is an opportunity and a responsibility to make sure that opportunity and prosperity reaches every person in every corner of this country, into every neighborhood in every city of this country," he said. "If we cannot do this now with what some people believe is the strongest overall economy in our history, believe me, we will never get around to doing the job."
Mr. Clinton's address was the first of several the mayors heard here on the third and last day of the winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors. Over lunch in a hotel ballroom, they listened to speeches on different urban issues by Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican who is the majority leader; Attorney General Janet Reno, and the President's wife, Hillary.
The original speaking schedule included only Mr. Lott and Mrs. Clinton, a plan that left open the possibility that Mrs. Clinton would share a dais with the man who is controlling the impeachment proceedings against her husband.
But other commitments assured that the two would not even be in the hotel at the same time. Mr. Lott, who spoke for 25 minutes, finished at 12:10 and quickly returned to Capitol Hill for meetings. Mrs. Clinton arrived shortly before 1:30 and spoke for half an hour. An aide to the mayoral conference said she had asked to speak last and had told officials that she could not arrive any earlier.
Joined by members of his Cabinet, Mr. Clinton used much of his time with the mayors highlighting aspects of the urban agenda he discussed in his State of the Union address last week. He said the housing increase would help pay for a second round of community empowerment grants to 20 cities, which were announced two weeks ago, and for 100,000 new vouchers for poor and low-income people.
A spokesman for Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Suffolk County Republican who heads the House subcommittee on housing, said the Administration was certain only to get an increase of $2 billion and faced a fight for the remaining $500 million.
After his remarks, Mr. Clinton took questions. Mayor Linda Lawrence of Wausau, Wis., rose and took aim at the impeachment trial, saying, "I want you to know what on behalf of everybody I know, especially my parents who are so damn conservative that I had an 11 P.M. curfew all my life, that they want Congress to stop this to allow you to get on with the business of the country."
At that point, Mayor Lawrence said later, the other mayors stood to applaud, "and I couldn't finish."
Mr. Lott's appearance before the mayors was his first after two previous invitations. Assuring the mayors that the Senate was eager to get busy on a spectrum of issues that affected cities, he made only veiled references to the impeachment trial, saying he was grateful to be away from the Capitol, where he has been "tethered to the floor" of the Senate for three weeks.
"This year we have a particularly difficult responsibility, given to us under the Constitution, to carry out, and we're going to carry out that responsibility," Mr. Lott added. "But it will come to a conclusion, and when it does, it's important that we have a burst of activity to work on those problems that Americans really do care about."
Mr. Lott won respectful applause before and after his remarks. But it was nothing like the ovation showered upon Mrs. Clinton as she walked down the ballroom aisle toward the dais. The mayors stood and clapped loudly; some cheered.
Mrs. Clinton spent the first half of her speech reviewing Administration programs that she portrayed as "tools this President has provided" to help cities and urging the mayors to build support for the President's next budget.
She closed by promoting the Millennium Communities Program, an effort by the White House to encourage communities to plan celebrations that "honor the past and imagine the future."

HEADLINE: In the Red. No, Black.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Republicans leaders are accusing President Clinton of budget gimmickry, saying his plan to shore up reserves in the Social Security trust fund is an accounting trick.
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, says the President's plan "appears to double count the Social Security surpluses," somehow extending the life of the trust fund "without doing anything." 
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire accuses the President of relying on an "accounting trick."
Critics are right that Mr. Clinton's plan double counts surpluses in the Social Security program. But these surpluses have been double counted in the budget for years, so the President's device is no new trick.
Political posturing aside, the real difference between the President's plan and that of his critics is not double counting. Some critics want to use the surplus to cut taxes. Many Republicans want to use it to create individual retirement accounts, which would serve the purpose of raising national savings if individuals did not offset the new accounts by reducing their other forms of private savings. Raising the national savings is widely embraced by economists. Liberal Democrats want to use the surplus to create universal health insurance or for education and other discretionary programs.
The President wants instead to drive down the Federal debt, now about $4 trillion. These are honorable differences in the positions. But, economists point out, most of these proposals double count the surplus in the Social Security program.
The Administration expects Social Security payroll taxes over the next 15 years to exceed outlays by about $2.7 trillion, a surplus that initially goes into the program's trust fund. Mr. Clinton proposes to add $2.8 trillion to the fund, for a total of $5.5 trillion, extending its life by almost 20 years, to 2049.
But most of the $2.8 trillion is the same money that comprises the $2.7 trillion already in the fund. Mr. Clinton, his critics say, proposes adding the first $2.7 trillion twice. To see through the dispute, trace the path of a surplus dollar, a dollar of Social Security payroll taxes that is not currently needed to pay retirees.
Speaking loosely, the dollar passes from a taxpayer to the Social Security trust fund and then on to the Treasury. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin makes the trust fund whole by sending it a $1 bond. He then spends the dollar on public housing, tanks or any other public purpose. Note the double use of the dollar. It is credited first to the trust fund and then to another program.
Under the President's plan, the path is initially the same. Surplus dollars would flow into the trust fund and back out to Mr. Rubin. Mr. Rubin continues to send the fund a $1 bond. But, under Mr. Clinton's proposal, Mr. Rubin would no longer use the surplus dollar to buy tanks or housing. Instead, he would buy back one dollar of Federal debt from the public in the form of a bond. Then he would deposit the repurchased bond into the Social Security trust fund.
The Republicans look at this process and cry double counting: Mr. Clinton has deposited two dollars worth of bonds into the fund from a single dollar of excess payroll taxes. In describing the process, they are correct.
But Administration officials point out that nearly any use of excess Social Security taxes would involve double counting. Indeed, several Republican proposals to reform Social Security would use the surplus to create private retirement accounts, another version of double counting.
So, if the President is guilty of accounting tricks, why aren't his critics?
"All they would change is the use to which the surplus would be put," says the President's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling.
Behind the Administration's thinking is the assumption that, without the President's program, Congress would spend the surpluses on other Federal programs or, if the Republicans get their way, on a large tax cut. Mr. Sperling estimates that buying back Federal debt would instead reduce Federal debt as a percentage of economic output from about 45 percent today to about 7 percent by 2014.
"It is hard to believe," he says, "that a plan that virtually pays off the nation's publicly held debt in 15 years could be criticized as an obtuse Government accounting trick."
The immediate purpose of buying back debt from the public, the Administration contends, is to pump trillions of dollars into the bank accounts of individual investors. These investors would then be able to lend the money to businesses for investment in new plants and equipment. The process would increase the nation's savings rate, channeling less money into consumption and more into investment.
Mr. Sperling repeats the economists' mantra that the only real way to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers is to save and invest, thereby building up the capacity of the economy to produce food, clothing and shelter.
Mr. Clinton could have slipped the charge of double counting if he had proposed doing nothing with the expected surpluses other than to buy back debt. That would be the preference of many other economists.
But the Administration believes that Congress would never sit back and let trillions of dollars slip by without siphoning them away for public programs or tax cuts. So Mr. Clinton devised a backup plan, channeling most of the surplus to Social Security. That would commit those dollars to support the elderly sometime in the future. And it would block their use for tax cuts or programs.
Mr. Clinton's choices are not the only responsible ones. They may not even be the best. But they raise no issue of budget deceit.

HEADLINE: T. C. Mann, 87, a Maker of U.S. Latin Policy

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Thomas C. Mann, a career diplomat and an architect of a switch to an American policy in Latin America in the 1960's that emphasized free enterprise, died last Saturday at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 87.
Mr. Mann's appointment by President Johnson to a high State Department post shortly after the death of President Kennedy was seen as a signal to Kennedy loyalists that the new Administration was going to switch to policies in Latin America that focused on the interests of American and local businesses. Former policies had emphasized the promotion of democracy. 
 On Dec. 14, 1963, just three weeks after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson named Mr. Mann as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Johnson's first major appointment. Four days later Johnson named Mr. Mann to the additional post of special assistant to the President.
The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a Kennedy adherent, praised Mr. Mann for one aspect of his Latin American policy, his opposition to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, recalling that "he thought it was nonsense."
But Mr. Schlesinger faulted him for the way he carried out Johnson's policies in Latin America.
Under Johnson and Mr. Mann, Mr. Schlesinger wrote in "Robert Kennedy and His Times," many of the political and social components of the Alliance for Progress, a program aimed at helping Latin American countries attain democracy and improve living conditions, were removed. Much of what remained, he wrote, was converted "into an instrumentality for North American corporations."
Robert M. Sayre, who served on the National Security Council and was Ambassador to Uruguay, Panama and Brazil, defended his friend and colleague against some of Mr. Schlesinger's statements.
"I don't think he was Tex-Mex," Mr. Sayre said, explaining that the term was once used in the Government to describe those who had a low opinion of Latin American capabilities. He pointed to Mr. Mann's bilingual upbringing along the United States-Mexican border at Laredo and his experience as Ambassador to Mexico and El Salvador as evidence of his affection for the area.
Prof. Walter LaFeber, a Cornell University historian, wrote that Mr. Mann's career "is a case study of how the United States moved from Good Neighbor to the overt use of military power in the hemisphere."
"Mann was by no means primarily responsible for the devolution," Mr. LaFeber wrote, but said it illustrated the way a Washington policy shift originated and developed.
Mr. Mann played important foreign policy roles involving many countries. In 1964 he arranged help for Eduardo Frei Montalva, a moderate, in defeating Salvador Allende Gossens, a Socialist, to become President of Chile. Mr. Allende won the next election, in 1970, and died in a Washington-backed coup that overthrew his Government in 1973.
Also in 1964, Professor LaFeber wrote, Mr. Mann supported military officers after they overthrew the President of Brazil, Joao Goulart, whom he viewed as "an inept President, easily influenced by leftist advisers and cronies."
In 1965, Johnson, at Mr. Mann's urging, sent 22,800 troops to the Dominican Republic to put down what Washington regarded as a Communist threat. That action led to opposition in Congress and Mr. Mann's replacement in the inter-American post in 1966. By then, Mr. LaFeber wrote, "Thomas Mann's policies were the future of U.S. policies in Latin America."
Mr. Mann once said in an interview that he had learned Spanish before English. In high school he stood out as a scholar and quarterback, taking Laredo to an undefeated season in 1927.
Mr. Mann's son, the Rev. Clifton A. Mann, said his father graduated from Baylor University in 1934 with a bachelor's and a law degree and practiced law in Texas until the United States entered World War II.
"After Pearl Harbor he went to take his physical and flunked it because of his eyes, and was despondent," Father Mann said. At that point Mr. Mann saw an advertisement recruiting Spanish-speaking lawyers and wound up working for the Office of Economic Warfare, posted in Uruguay. Professor LaFeber said one of Mr. Mann's jobs had been to monitor Nazi shipping in the South Atlantic.
At the close of the war, Mr. Mann transferred to the Foreign Service, where he spent the rest of his government career, retiring in 1966. He was president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association from 1967 to 1971.
Mr. Mann's wife of 64 years, Nancy, died in 1997. He is survived by his son, Father Mann, an Episcopal priest in Lubbock, Tex.; six granddaughters, and three great-granddaughters.
"My dad was Lyndon Johnson's first appointment, and that caused him a lot of pain," Father Mann said. "He was perceived to be a political figure when he was, in fact, a diplomat."

HEADLINE: L. C. Lewin, Writer of Satire Of Government Plot, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
Leonard C. Lewin, whose Vietnam-era satire of a supposed secret Government study on the dangers of peace, "Report From Iron Mountain," resurfaced nearly 30 years later as proof of Government conspiracies for right-wing paramilitary groups, died on Thursday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 82 lived in Guilford, Conn.
"Report From Iron Mountain," supposedly the work of a topsecret 15-member study group that concluded that even if lasting peace "could be achieved, it would almost certainly not be in the best interests of society to achieve it," caused a sensation when it was published in the fall of 1967. By the next year, it was on the best-seller list of The New York Times. 
 Peace would be catastrophic, the report said in deadpan bureaucratese, unless there was extensive planning to replace the many benefits of war. It was possible that a "sophisticated form of slavery," together with "blood games" might have to be introduced.
Deliberately poisoning the atmosphere, the parody went on, "in a politically acceptable manner" or inventing enemies from another planet might be necessary to maintain social cohesion. The end of war would require some other form of wasteful spending to support the economy, possibly an unlimited space program aimed at reaching unreachable points in space.
The hoax that would not die began one day in 1967 when Victor Navasky and a few other editors of Monocle, a humor magazine that is now defunct, noticed a short newspaper report describing how the stock market had tumbled because of a "peace scare."
It was the height of the Vietnam War. Savoring the Swiftian implications, Mr. Navasky, now the editor of The Nation, and the others began tossing around the idea that Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and the other famously hard-nosed intellectuals brought into Government by President John F. Kennedy had commissioned one of their studies -- research organizations like the Rand Corporation and the Hudson Institute were all the vogue then -- on the threat of peace.
Mr. Lewin, an accomplished political satirist, produced the supposed report, complete with footnotes, most of them from other reports by the Government or research organizations, and a tribute to the "methods" of Herman Kahn of the Hudson Institute that allowed thinking about war without "getting bogged down in questions of morality."
Other plotters included E. L. Doctorow, then an editor at Dial Press, later the author of "Ragtime" and other novels, and the publishing house's president, Richard Baron, who listed the 109 page work as nonfiction and was to turn aside questions about its authenticity by citing the footnotes.
Debate immediately raged about whether the "Report From Iron Mountain" was real.
"One informed source confirmed," U.S. News and World Report said in its Nov. 20, 1967, issue, "that the 'Special Study Group,' " as the book called it, was set up by a top official in the Kennedy Administration. The source added that the report was drafted and eventually submitted to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was said to have 'hit the roof' -- and then ordered that the report be bottled up for all time."
Trans-Action, an influential journal of the period, devoted an entire issue to the debate over the book. Esquire published a 28,000-word excerpt. John Kenneth Galbraith got into the act with a book review in The Washington Post under a pseudonym vouching for the book's authenticity and the validity of its conclusions but expressing reservations about releasing it "to an obviously unconditioned public."
But in 1972, Mr. Lewin finally confessed that he had made up the report. The "Pentagon Papers," the secret history of the Vietnam War, had been published, Mr. Lewin wrote in The New York Times Book Review, and were "as outrageous, morally and intellectually" as his own invention,
"The charade is over," he wrote. "Some of the documents read like parodies of Iron Mountain, rather than the reverse."
Mr. Lewin, a graduate of Harvard University, came to writing after stints as a labor organizer in New England and work in his father's sugar refinery in Indianapolis.
His marriages to Iris Zinn Lewin and Eve Merriam, a poet, playwright and children's book author, ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughter, Julie Lewin of West Hartford, Conn., a son, Michael Z. Lewin of Frome, England, and his longtime companion, Lorraine Davis of Manhattan.
"Report from Iron Mountain" went out of print in 1980, but a few years ago Mr. Lewin was startled to get a request from a white supremacist group in Arkansas wanting to buy any old copies. Then he discovered that the Liberty Lobby, a far-right group, was offering copies of the book as a genuine Government report. His insistence that he had written the book only reinforced the belief among the paramilitary groups that it was a real secret document.
Mr. Lewin successfully sued the Liberty Lobby, which asserted that that there was no copyright for the book because it was a Government document. Neither side would reveal the full terms of the settlement, but Mr. Lewin received more than a thousand copies of the bootlegged version.
Pirated copies -- some of a new edition published by Simon & Schuster's imprint, Free Press -- are still in circulation, along with a six-hour videotape version. Simon & Schuster has been trying to stop right-wing groups from posting versions of the book on their Internet sites under the guise of a Government document.

HEADLINE: U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT FAST 5.6% RATE AT THE END OF '98

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
A year of pleasant economic surprises ended with the biggest one of all: a last-minute burst of growth that surpassed even the most bullish predictions.
America's gross domestic product -- the total of goods and services produced -- surged at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the final quarter of 1998. That is the fastest pace in two years and made 1998 the third consecutive year that the economy had expanded at a nearly 4 percent pace. For all of 1998, the G.D.P. increased 3.9 percent. 
 Despite the go-go growth, inflation was reminiscent of the 50's. After running around 1 percent earlier in the year, it slipped to eight-tenths of a percent -- the lowest in more than 40 years.
"We keep getting stronger growth and less inflation pressure," said John Williams, chief economist at the Bankers Trust Corporation. "At the moment there seems to be nothing to get in the way."
As recently as last October the talk was about a possible recession -- financial markets were quaking, growth in many parts of the world was slowing, or nonexistent, and America's farm and energy industries were slumping. But amid these negative signs, American corporations were pouring billions into new technology, consumers were buying cars and other expensive products, and exporters, who had been struggling all year as markets in Asia and Latin America headed south, saw their overseas sales snap back.
To be sure, some of the fourth-quarter's strength reflected one-time events -- the General Motors Corporation catching up after its strike, the Boeing Company making aircraft deliveries, construction crews taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather -- and most economists expect the latest figures to be trimmed a bit when more data become available and the G.D.P. report is revised next month. But with sales soaring, inventories lean and no sign of inflation, there seemed little question that the economy barreled into the new year with terrific momentum.
"I don't see anything that could trigger recession in 1999," said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation for Independent Business, who noted that business spending and hiring plans remained strong.
Christopher Low, the chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets, said, "Typically, when we have inventories weaker than expected and demand stronger than expected, that portends stronger growth down the road."
As usual, consumers accounted for most of the growth last year. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.8 percent for the year, even though unseasonably warm temperatures meant lower heating bills. Purchases of cars and big-ticket items for homes soared at a 21 percent annual rate. Earlier this month, G.M., the Ford Motor Company and other car makers reported that December sales were running at an annual rate of more than 17 million cars and trucks a month, up 7 percent from a year earlier. New home construction rose at a 10 percent annual rate. Consumers and home buyers have not spent this freely since right after the 1981-82 recession.
There's no sign that they are flagging either. Unemployment and interest rates are at the lowest level in decades, after-tax income jumped 4 percent last year after inflation, and a rebounding stock market is swelling household balance sheets once more.
Consumers are feeling pretty good, too. The University of Michigan reported yesterday that its consumer confidence index, based on surveys of consumers, rose to a lofty 103.9 at the end of January from 100.5 in December. The index reflects consumers' positive assessment of current economic conditions and their optimism about the future.
Less expected was the big bounceback in business spending for new equipment, especially computers and other high-technology products. Capital goods spending, which had leveled out last summer, soared at a 21 percent annual rate as businesses, facing the tightest labor market in a generation, scrambled to improve efficiency and keep costs under control. Meanwhile, businesses increased their stocks at a slower rate than in the third quarter as they struggled to keep up with sales, a favorable development that suggests they will not be cutting production in the months ahead.
The drag from America's $263 billion trade deficit proved less potent than one might expect. While imports shot up in the fall, so did exports. The trade deficit worsened last year, with imports shooting 10.8 percent higher and exports growing only 1.5 percent, the weakest in 15 years.
In retrospect, it seems clear that the economy's surprising stamina, particularly the strength in consumer spending, reflects at least three developments that few forecasters could have predicted a year ago: a sharp decline in inflation from 2 percent to 1 percent; another big run-up, more than 25 percent, in the stock market, and the Federal Reserve's willingness to reduce interest rates last fall in response to global financial turmoil when the domestic economy was showing few signs of slowing. All three factors bolstered incomes and spending power. "We were getting this injection of adrenalin," said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.
Investors agreed, sending stock and bond prices higher yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.5 points, to 9,358.83, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index hit a new high of 1,279.64 after climbing 14.27 points.
And President Clinton, speaking at a meeting of the nation's mayors, cited the strong economy, noting that it continued to defy conventional economic wisdom, and that even his own advisers had once again proved too pessimistic.
The Commerce Under Secretary, Robert J. Shapiro, proclaimed these "the best economic times in living memory."
In fact, in December the economic recovery that started in April 1991 became the longest in peacetime history. The only expansion to last longer was the 60's boom, from 1961 to 1969, which coincided with the Vietnam War buildup and which was accompanied by large Federal deficits and mounting inflationary pressures, both of which are now absent.

A Surge in 1998's G.D.P. Pushes Market Gauges Up
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.27 points, or 1.13 percent, to a record 1,279.64, after the Government announced a surprising surge in United States economic growth.
Other market gauges also soared. The Nasdaq composite index surpassed 2,500 points for the first time, increasing 28.55 points, to 2,505.89, and wrapping up its biggest monthly gain in 24 years. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 77.50 points, to 9,358.83, with I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard accounting for almost half of the gain. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.08 percent, from 5.10 percent on Thursday. Page C3.

HEADLINE: For Radio City Restoration, a $2.5 Million Sales Tax Break

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
As a part of Rockefeller Center, where the rents for prime retail space are now on a par with Madison Avenue, Radio City Music Hall may not seem to be situated in a blighted neighborhood.
Recently, however, the Empire State Development Corporation approved a sales tax exemption of up to $2.5 million for the operators of the landmark theater as an incentive for them to spend $66 million on renovations. 
 A report from the development agency said the tax break was justified, in part, because the "area in which the project is to be located is a substandard or unsanitary area, or in danger of becoming" such an area.
The size of the sales tax break is minuscule in comparison with the total $111.7 million in real estate tax exemptions that the city has given Madison Square Garden since 1983 to keep the Knicks and Rangers from leaving New York. But some local officials have questioned why Cablevision Systems, the parent company of Madison Square Garden, which also manages Radio City Entertainment, deserves this latest gift from the state.
"Cablevision is not saying that it will move Radio City to the Meadowlands," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Democrat of Manhattan. "This is a prize property that is going to become much more profitable for them when they do the technological upgrade. They don't need any incentive to do this job."
Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, said the sales tax exemption was appropriate because the company was making a major investment in a national landmark. She also said that at least 50 new jobs would be created at Radio City, which already employs 1,800 people. The tax relief plan was developed after Radio City's operators requested state assistance, she said.
"We look at these projects on a case by case basis," Ms. Quartararo said. "In the case of Radio City Music Hall, you have a private company investing tens of millions of dollars in a landmark theater. It's appropriate for them to receive some assistance."
She said the reference to "a substandard or unsanitary area" was a reminder of harsher times two decades ago when Radio City was nearly closed. "That's why we're being proactive in this case," she said.
Cablevision also defended the tax break on economic grounds and said it would probably not amount to more than $1.6 million. The project will include the restoration of the theater's blocklong marquee and its backstage hydraulic system.
"A restored Radio City Music Hall will be a showplace for the world while generating tens of millions of dollars in state and local taxes as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in associated economic spinoff," Kenneth W. Munoz, an executive vice president of Madison Square Garden, said in a statement. "This is the very kind of project in which the city and state economic development agencies regularly and properly participate." He declined further comment.
Under the plan, approved on Nov. 18, Radio City Music Hall would be leased to the Empire State Development Corporation, which in turn would sublease it back to Radio City Entertainment during the renovation and for 10 years afterward. The construction materials and equipment, fixtures and furniture acquired for the renovation would be exempt from sales tax, for a saving the state development corporation estimated would amount to $2.5 million.
This type of arrangement permits a private company to be treated as a tax-exempt government entity, said Frank J. Mauro, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Latham, N.Y. He questioned whether it was appropriate to favor one theater over its competitors. "This is clearly government interfering in the free market," Mr. Mauro said.
In addition to the sales tax exemption, Radio City Entertainment may also get a discount of as much as 20 percent on its electric bills. The New York Power Authority is holding talks with the company and the city to determine whether the discount should be offered because new jobs would be created, said Laurence W. Frech, a spokesman for the power authority.
When its property taxes were eliminated, Madison Square Garden was also given a break on its electric bills from Consolidated Edison, amounting to $200,000 to $500,000 a year, a Madison Square Garden official said.

U.S. Would Send Troops To Help Kosovo Cease-Fire
President Clinton's top national security advisers decided that the United States should commit several thousand ground troops to an international force in Kosovo to monitor an eventual cease-fire there, according to Administration officials and members of Congress. The tentative plan would involve 2,000 to 5,000 American troops in a NATO force of more than 20,000 ground troops. A1 

The United States, four Western European nations and Russia, in an unusual show of unity, summoned the warring sides in Kosovo to a peace conference in France next Friday and suggested that if they did not reach agreement within two weeks, air strikes would follow. NATO is expected to vote today to authorize air strikes against the Serbs if they do not agree to a political settlement of autonomy for Kosovo. A6
 
Serbian police killed 24 ethnic Albanians in a raid on a suspected rebel hideout, adding urgency to an international demand that the antagonists settle the Kosovo crisis by mid-February or face NATO action. Later in the day, Yugoslav army tanks began firing on rebel Kosovo Liberation Army positions near a village of a half-dozen homes nine miles north of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. A6
 
Riots Slow Colombia Recovery
Army and police units clashed repeatedly with bands of looters in Armenia, slowing the delivery of relief supplies to tens of thousands of residents made homeless by the big earthquake on Monday. The gangs, composed almost entirely of young men, struck early and often until the authorities were able to restore order through a show of force and numerous arrests. Away from the downtown area, scarred by dozens of damaged and collapsed buildings, relief efforts finally appeared to be moving into high gear, after four days of confusion and complaints. A3
 
Warning on the World Economy
Vice President Al Gore warned that the world had to "prevent the financial crisis of 1998 from becoming the trade crisis of 1999," and said the United States would seek to negotiate the "outright elimination" of the huge and politically sensitive subsidies that European nations provide farmers. Mr. Gore's statement was his first detailed speech on the fragility of the world economy. A5
 
U.S. to Toughen Libya Policy
Clinton Administration officials say they are planning to seek tougher sanctions against Libya because there has been no sign of cooperation a month before an American deadline for Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. A3
 
East Timor Rebel Urges Calm
The imprisoned East Timor rebel leader Xanana Gusmao called for a cease-fire in his homeland after Indonesia said it might free the territory, which it invaded 23 years ago. A5

No Independent Counsel For Former Clinton Aide
Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate whether a former White House aide, Harold M. Ickes, lied to a Senate committee two years ago. Her decision was a significant step toward bringing the Justice Department's long-running campaign finance inquiry to a close, leaving open virtually no investigation that could lead to an independent counsel's examination of President Clinton's re-election fund-raising. A1
 
G.O.P. Internal Tensions
Relations are becoming strained between Republican senators and the Republican House members who are prosecuting Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial. Part of the problem lies in institutional differences between the House and the Senate, but there are also philosophical and strategic differences among the Republicans in their pursuit of a resolution to the matter. A1
 
The White House plans to forgo witnesses of its own in President Clinton's Senate impeachment trial unless the three witnesses giving depositions next week -- Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Sidney Blumenthal -- present damaging new evidence against him, White House advisers said. The decision represents a softening of the White House stance, though officials emphasized that they were keeping their options open. A9
 
Ms. Lewinsky's Senate deposition, which will be videotaped, may cost Barbara Walters of ABC News the opportunity to be the first to present Ms. Lewinsky answering questions on national television. A9
 
Settlement in Au Pair Suit
The British au pair Louise Woodward, who was convicted of manslaughter in the death a Massachusetts infant left in her care, accepted a settlement of a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the baby's parents that bars her from ever profiting from the episode. Ms. Woodward, 20, may not profit from selling her story, and any money she gains in connection with the case must go to UNICEF, the charity of her choice. Ms. Woodward, who is now studying law in England, has maintained her innocence. A7
 
Clinton Seeks Raise for HUD
President Clinton, speaking at a meeting with mayors from more than 200 cities, announced that he was seeking a $2.5 billion budget increase for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. A8
 
Space Station Mission Put Off
Launching of the next section of the International Space Station, a Russian-made module with laboratory and crew space, will be delayed until at least September because of technical problems with the component, NASA officials said. The service module, a crucial component of the space station, was to have been transported into space in July. A10

HEADLINE: SPRING-SUMMER CRUISES;
Cruise Lines' Mantra: More, More

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL, a business reporter for The Times, covers the travel industry.

 BODY:
DURING the Persian Gulf war almost a decade ago, cruise lines hastily improvised alternative itineraries while moving their ships as fast and as far away from the war zone as possible. Within days, the Mediterranean was being referred to in cruising circles as the Dead Sea. But last month's bombing of Iraq by the United States and Britain created scarcely a ripple.
This time most ships had already moved from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean for the start of the winter cruise season, and the sustained bombing of Iraq lasted only a few days. If peace prevails, a record number of cruise ships are expected in the Mediterranean and elsewhere in Europe this year, including the 2,600-passenger Grand Princess, the 2,000-passenger Norway, the recently lengthened 1,748-passenger Norwegian Dream and the 1,800-passenger Legend of the Seas. And if the economy cooperates, the industry is likely to achieve its 10th consecutive year of ever-increasing numbers of passengers. 
 Indeed, even taking into account the recent stock market jitters, a recent forecast by cruise analysts at Bear, Stearns & Company estimates this year's passenger growth at 10 to 11 percent. If that turns out to be the case, that would put the number of passengers at about six million -- and within hailing distance of the seven million passengers in 2000 forecast by the Cruise Lines International Association.
Still unclear is what effect the several setbacks last year will have on the industry this year. These included a fire aboard Carnival's Ecstasy last summer (in which there were no casualties), the Monarch of the Seas' striking a reef in St. Maarten harbor in mid-December and having to cancel 12 cruises (she is scheduled to resume sailing March 14) and postponement of the inaugural voyage of the Disney Wonder, Disney's second ship, from March to Aug. 15, toward the end of the traditional summer cruise season. (Delivery of the first Disney ship, the Disney Magic, was postponed twice last year, forcing cancellation of 40 cruises.)
The industry was also shaken by two recent articles in The New York Times. The first, published in November, examined the growing concern about crime -- particularly allegations of sexual assaults by crew members -- aboard cruise ships, which operate largely outside the laws of any one country. The second, published early this month, detailed how Royal Caribbean knowingly broke the law by dumping oily waste into the ocean, then argued (to no avail) that a private company doing business in the United States was immune from criminal prosecution because its ships fly foreign flags.
"There were six months of bad news," said Michael Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, which is widely read by travel agents. "The industry is worried, and I'm curious to see what impact that will have on the cruise business this year."
On the positive side, passengers continue to give cruising high marks. And many travel agents, who collectively book more than 90 percent of all cruises, have vowed to redouble efforts to sell even more berths, to offset income lost by the latest round of commission caps imposed by the airlines last November.
In addition, the popularity of each new big ship seems to confirm the decision by cruise line officials to compete with resorts, amusement parks, beach towns and ski resorts. Most new big ships, for example, have elegant restaurants and boutiques, luxury spas, high-tech fitness rooms, water slides, conference and meeting rooms, theaters featuring large-cast productions, pubs, playrooms and computer rooms, as well as casinos as glitzy as some in Las Vegas.
And there is more to come. Royal Caribbean's 142,000-ton Voyager of the Seas, scheduled for delivery this fall, will have a full-sized basketball court and ice-skating rink, a rock-climbing wall, a minigolf course, a theater five decks high, a $1 million sea-water aquarium, a wedding chapel and the world's biggest roulette wheel. The Cunard Line's first new ship in about 30 years, tentatively promised in about 2002, will have many of the above amenities plus a microbrewery and the world's biggest maritime museum.
Because cruise ships have not yet figured out how to equip their vessels with actual golf courses, Crystal's Symphony and Harmony have a total of nine cruises this year ranging from 11 to 16 days that provide guaranteed tee times at 21 notable golf courses in the Mediterranean, the British Isles, Central America and the Caribbean. (The first cruise was scheduled to sail Jan. 25; the remainder, including six aboard the Symphony, will sail beginning Aug. 10.)
Still, many cruise passengers prefer smaller ships, including the smaller ones still in the fleets of Carnival, Princess and Royal Caribbean, the three cruise lines that have led the big-ship boom. Holland America's largest ships, including three scheduled for delivery by next year, do not exceed about 1,400 passengers. Crystal's three ships carry about 850 passengers, while Renaissance Cruises plans to build five 690-passenger ships in the next two years.
Silverseas Cruises is building two ships of 290 passengers, while Radisson Seven Seas, only one of whose five ships carries more than 320 passengers, plans to add four more by 2004. Its 320-passenger Paul Gauguin, which went into service last year in French Polynesia, had a 90 percent year-round occupancy, an especially high percentage for a first-year operation and doubly so for a luxury ship with luxury prices. All three Seabourn luxury ships have a capacity of just 204 passengers.
Meantime, other small-ship cruise lines including Windstar, American Canadian Caribbean, Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, Classical Cruises and Clipper Cruise Line offer wide-ranging itineraries for the growing niche markets. Classical's 48-passenger Halcyon, for example, is offering the first and only cruise dedicated to Tunisia, from the Mediterranean to the Sahara, while the 122-passenger Clipper Adventurer will tour both the "bottom of the world," including Antarctica, South Georgia and the Falklands, and the "top of the world," including Greenland, the Arctic and Maritime Canada. Linblad Special Expeditions, a pioneer in out-of-the-way cruising, is offering year-round 10-day voyages from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to the Galapagos Islands aboard the 80-passenger Polaris.
The Caribbean (including Bermuda, which is really in the Atlantic) remains the most popular cruise destination, attracting 46.2 percent of the market. But its share has fallen from 50.5 percent in 1996, in part because the industry has expanded its range and itineraries, while the combined share of European and Caribbean cruises has climbed steadily into second place with 19.6 percent, followed by Alaska with 8.4 percent.
More than 20 cruise lines will sail the Mediterranean and elsewhere in Europe this year, some of them from April to November, about a month longer than in most other years. Celebrity will visit the Mediterranean for the first time, its 1,750-passenger Century sailing 11-night to 14-night cruises between April and October.
Many Americans who choose European cruises have previously sailed the Caribbean, often several times, and readily pay fares 35 to 40 percent higher than for Caribbean cruises of comparable length. Most of them seek the rich cultural mix readily available in European ports or through land packages sold by the cruise ships.
While often criticized as overpriced, the land packages have made more of Europe available to more cruise passengers. Princess, for example, is enhancing its seven 12-day Mediterranean sailings this year with pre- and postcruise tours covering Germany, Austria and Switzerland; Paris, Bordeaux and the Loire Valley, and Italy and the Swiss Alps, including Venice, Milan, St. Moritz, the Matterhorn, Montreux and Geneva. Classical Cruises' 12-day Mediterranean cruise, departing Lisbon on April 11, has a two-night precruise package tour of Lisbon and a two-night postcruise extension in Athens. Orient Lines and Costa Cruises also have extensive Mediterranean cruises and land packages.
Alaska, too, is drawing more passengers. The number of passengers expected to sail on cruises in Alaska is 568,000, up from 373,000 in 1994. This year Holland America and Princess Cruises, the industry leaders, will each sail six ships to Alaska, with 118 and 104 departures respectively, one more than their combined total of 221 last year last year. Norwegian Cruise Line's two ships in Alaska this year will depart from Vancouver, as do most cruise ships, but next year its Norwegian Sky, currently under construction, will become the first big ship with regular cruises to depart from Seattle.
A half-dozen small ships will also sail to or within Alaska this year, including seven from Alaska Sightseeing/Cruise West and two 12-passenger ships from Alaska Yacht Safaris. Although Holland America's Noordam will start the large-ship parade north when she departs Vancouver May 7, three small ships will depart in April. The first of those, Alaska Sightseeing's Spirit of Glacier Bay, will set sail April 10 on an 11-day Seattle to Juneau cruise.
Finally, while southern Florida remains the home port for most major cruise lines, occasional or seasonal cruises are steadily increasing from a variety of other ports. Celebrity will have 11 cruises this spring and summer from Charleston and Newport News, Va., and will replace its Celebration in Tampa with the 2,600-passenger Carnival Sensation, which will sail weekly to Grand Cayman, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel and New Orleans. The Norwegian Majesty will sail from Boston to St. George, Bermuda, every Sunday from April 11 through Oct. 17, while the Norwegian Sea is offering year-round seven-day cruises from Houston to Cancun, Cozumel and Roatan, a Bay Island off the coast of Honduras. One or more major cruise ships will also sail this season from New York, New Orleans, Galveston, Honolulu, Palm Beach and San Diego.
For passengers within driving distance of those "satellite ports," such cruises can be a great convenience. For the cruise lines, which are not likely to loosen their ties to south Florida anytime soon, they are a way to generate interest in cruising among the estimated 89 percent of American adults who, according to Bear, Stearns, have not yet signed on.

HEADLINE: Cuba Draws the Curious, Despite the Law

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO; MIREYA NAVARRO is chief of the Miami bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
AT the Marina Hemingway, a complex of hotels, restaurants and shops in Havana, the grocery store's shelves are stacked with Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies, Nestle chocolate bars and American cigarettes. English is spoken along the aisles. The sights and sounds are so familiar that Americans may have to remind themselves that they are in Cuba.
A popular playground for Americans before the revolution, Cuba has been off limits to tourists from the United States for most of Fidel Castro's four-decade-old rule. Under restrictions imposed by the American economic embargo, now in its 37th year, only certain travelers -- including journalists, Government officials and those visiting close family once a year for humanitarian reasons -- can visit Cuba, spending up to $100 a day for living expenses. In addition, travelers can apply for a specific license to go if they have a religious or educational purpose, for example. 
 Anybody else is banned from spending money under the Trading with the Enemy Act, which in practice deters travel. But while the embargo has minimized American tourism, more Americans have found ways to visit since limited free-market reforms adopted by Cuba in the 1990's legalized the dollar.
Since Pope John Paul II's visit last year, the number of American religious and academic groups wanting to visit has skyrocketed, some travel agencies say. Bob Guild, program director for Marazul Tours in Weehawken, N.J., said his agency has booked 45 such groups just this month, which are traveling legally under Federal licenses, compared to five or six groups during the same period in past years. Neither Cuban nor American officials have estimates of American visitors, saying the number is difficult to gauge because of unauthorized travel.
At any given time, 9 out of 10 boats at Marina Hemingway come from the United States. Americans traveling through third countries like Jamaica on package tours can often be found at the Tropicana, the legendary outdoor nightclub where Las Vegas-type chorus girls dance with chandeliers on their heads to Cuban rhythms. In Varadero, Cuba's premier tourist beach area, the high-end hotels also draw American visitors seeking respite from the decay and hardship that are now staples of this socialist country of about 11 million people.
"Curiosity -- that's what brings everybody," said a 55-year-old boater and construction worker from Key West anchored at the Marina Hemingway for two months, on his third visit since last year. He refused to give his name. "You just want to go visit places and see what it's like."
What Cuba is like can best be described as a time warp. The ride from the Jose Marti International Airport into Havana offers a surreal sight: roads populated by bicycles and 1950's Cadillacs, some decrepit but many in mint condition; billboards filled with revolutionary slogans; the utter absence of fast-food franchises or chain hotels.
In Old Havana, unpainted, sometimes crumbling colonial architecture remains magnificent. And an excursion to the countryside, to places like the Vinales Valley in the Pinar del Rio Province and to beaches and mountains unspoiled by development, makes a visitor feel just plain lucky.
Travel throughout the island is unrestricted; visitors can get around by bus, train, airplane and car. Public transportation is overwhelmed by demand, but tours are available and visitors can also rent a car, or hire a driver with a car.
Some Americans visiting for the first time say they are struck by the friendliness of people and the lack of abject poverty they have found in places such as Africa and India.
"Everyone had shoes, everyone had clothes on their backs," said a 32-year-old Miami woman who traveled illegally through Nassau recently and stayed with the family of a Cuban-American friend. "We didn't see starving people."
But there is also the economic need that makes Cuba ration rice, sugar and other staples for residents and that leads even professionals to moonlight as drivers and "jineteras," Cuba's prostitutes, who are the draw for a thriving sex tourism industry. A heavy-handed Government provides amenities for tourists that the Cuban people can only dream of.
This can all translate into deeply unsettling experiences for a visitor. It is not uncommon, for instance, to dine at a nice restaurant next to kissing couples, teen-aged girls and men three or four times their age, or to have Cuban friends suffer the humiliation of being denied entry to hotels, even to the lobby for a visit. American officials call it "tourism apartheid," but Cuban officials say they are trying to promote equality among Cubans by not allowing special privileges to those with dollars (sent by relatives in the United States or earned by working for tourists).
Dollars, however, are sometimes of no use in the face of shortages. Meat and fresh vegetables can be hard to come by even at better restaurants, and many items taste as if they were cooked in lard.
Havana has a wide range of restaurants and fast-food cafeterias, and outside the capital most hotels have restaurants, all catering to the dollar-carrying customer.
The quality of service varies wildly, with hotel staffs ranging from efficient and friendly to slow and surly. Worn-out carpets and mismatched furniture can be found in some of the highly-rated hotels in Havana, such as the Capri, and hours-long power outages are not uncommon. One hotel in Matanzas, near Varadero, shuts off the water for most of the day. By comparison, Varadero's luxury resorts, the product of Government joint ventures with private companies from countries such as Spain, Germany and Canada, seem like a step into the First World. Almost everything is imported, from fruits and meats to tools, and the feeling is one of pampered comfort.
Cuba is relatively cheap; the most expensive hotels often charge less than $200 a night, depending on the season. Prices can be even lower if a visitor sidesteps the Government infrastructure and deals directly with Cuban solo entrepreneurs. Unauthorized drivers, for instance, charge much less than metered taxis, although many of the cars are not air-conditioned and some seem to be falling apart. Lodging with a family and taking meals at "paladares" -- private restaurants in the owners' homes -- can offer higher quality at lower prices than hotels and bigger restaurants. And because of a thriving black market, it is possible to get Cuban cigars at bargain prices. (Almost every Cuban one encounters claims to know somebody at a cigar factory, but the product can be junk, and tourists are often warned to buy tobacco only at Government stores.)
Before the Communist revolution, Americans made up the largest tourist bloc visiting Cuba. Now Canadians and Europeans have filled the void. Tourism, which the Government began building up in the 1990's, has steadily increased to 1.4 million visitors in 1998, according to officials of Cuba's Tourism Ministry. If an ambitious target of two million visitors by the year 2000 is reached, they said, Cuba will have nearly doubled its tourism since 1996.
"We're bringing more tourists and the tourism infrastructure is also growing," said Manuel Garcia-Crespo, a tourism spokesman. The infrastructure is key at this point for an industry that is still in its infancy but that has become the largest source of foreign currency for Cuba, contributing about $1.8 billion a year to the island's economy, officials said. To accommodate the two million visitors Cuba hopes to attract at the turn of the century, it needs to increase hotel rooms to 34,000 from the current 28,000, Mr. Garcia-Crespo said.
Among the earliest and biggest private investors in Cuba's tourism industry is Spain's Sol Melia hotel chain, which co-owns with the Government four upscale hotels and manages several others; its investment on the island surpasses $55 million. Carlos Pereda-Navarro, general manager of Melia Las Americas in Varadero, considers Cuba an attractive investment because of Government support and the potential for growth. He said this more than compensates for such extra costs as having to import most goods.
"We're just beginning," said Mr. Pereda-Navarro, who has worked in Cuba for the past nine years. The potential would be even greater, he added, if Americans were free to travel to the island.
Mr. Garcia-Crespo said American travel was up but still relatively negligible.
Under regulations enforced by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, travel to Cuba without a specific license is generally limited to Government officials and representatives of international organizations, journalists and those visiting close relatives. (Cuban-Americans on family visits make up the largest group of visiting Americans, numbering about 30,000 a year, United States Government figures show.) Since American carriers do not fly to Cuba, travelers usually go through third countries like Mexico, Canada and the Bahamas, although since last year many have been able to depart from Miami on authorized charter flights that reach Havana in about 40 minutes. In new steps announced this month, the Clinton Administration said it would authorize charter flights from additional United States cities to destinations in Cuba other than Havana.
For those traveling legally, there is a limit of $100 worth of goods such as cigars and rum brought back from Cuba. Because transactions are in cash -- Americans cannot use credit cards issued by American banks -- visitors often go over the spending limit with little risk of being caught. And Cuba enables illegal travel by waiving boating fees at marinas and not stamping passports at airports.
American officials say a big problem is illegal travel through third countries where weekend tour packages in Cuba are commonly offered. Also, they say, some United States-based organizations make travel possible under the guise of educational or cultural trips that are mostly tours.
"The policy is no tourism," an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. "There are people who violate the law and a lot of people in the travel industry who promote this."
Although sailing to Cuba itself is not prohibited, paying for meals, transportation, lodging and mooring fees is, and returning passengers by air or vessel can be the subject of investigation by the United States Customs Service, Federal officials said. While enforcement has been lax, officials say it has become progressively easier over the years for the Government to penalize people for violations. In 1992 civil fines of up to $55,000 for each violation were instituted. The presumption is that a United States citizen traveling to Cuba has spent money there unless he can prove otherwise.
Criminal penalties for violating the travel restrictions are up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for an individual. There have been only 16 criminal prosecutions for Cuba travel violations under the Trading With the Enemy Act since 1983, officials said. But the Treasury Department has collected nearly $1.9 million in civil penalties for embargo violations in 379 separate cases over the last four years as of last September, most related to travel.
"The result is, this can ruin your vacation," the American official said. The United States Interests Section, the American diplomatic mission in Havana, does not refuse consular services such as replacing a lost passport to Americans traveling here illegally (unless the American was born in Cuba, in which case Cuba treats the person as a national and does not allow the Interests Section to get involved). But the diplomatic mission would also refer the case to Treasury for enforcement.
United States Government officials said their policy responds to concerns that override the desire American tourists may have to visit Cuba. "We're trying to get Cuba to make the reforms needed to avoid a chaotic transition when Castro falls, that would create a massive migrant wave," the American official said. But American officials also acknowledge that people almost invariably become more conciliatory toward Cuba, and opposed to the embargo, once they visit. "It creates a constituency," the American official said.
Some of those who flout the law say they do not care about politics. "People can come over, go out fishing and have a good time and it doesn't cost them a fortune," said the boater from Key West at Marina Hemingway, where boats from 30 to 50 feet long sport satellite dishes and American flags and sometimes anchor for months at a time. The American said he stood ready to defend his rights in court if ever prosecuted, arguing that it is unconstitutional for the United States to restrict Americans' right to travel.
"A lot of Americans come here basically because it's a beautiful country," he said.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
At Sea, Extras Can Add Up Fast

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
AS for the all-inclusive cruise: there is no such creature. No matter how high up the caviar chain is a cruise line, with Silversea and Seabourn probably at the top, there is always something to be paid for at the end.
A woman in the industry who took a seven-day Carnival cruise with a companion for $2,300, air fare included, paid $450 for extras. A reporter who took a $2,267 cruise of seven days on the Grand Princess, air fare included, paid $208 in extras, among them a $47.50 phone call, a $50 pedicure and $2.50 milkshake. 
 Whether the number of extra costs is increasing is a matter for debate. Readers have written that they believe more things aboard are for sale. Charges for ice-cream sodas aside, passengers' complaints often focus on pressure to buy: racks of cruise-logo jackets and other clothing are placed in the lobby, one letter-writer said; alcoholic beverages are offered at every turn, another said, and spa employees embarrass passengers into buying expensive products, according to still another. Two cruise-takers, Stanley and Arlene Harris of Brooklyn, spoke unhappily of a "bargain basement" atmosphere aboard one cruise.
Rick James, Princess Cruises' senior vice president for customer services, was asked about the Haagen-Dazs milkshake bought aboard the Grand Princess for $2.50 plus a 15 percent service charge. Mr. James thinks that the changing taste of customers is creating more of such extras aboard -- "boutique items," he calls them. "We always have free ice cream in our dining rooms," Mr. James said, "but if people want Haagen-Dazs, that's a specialty item."
"It's the same thing if you go into a hosted bar ashore," he said. "If you want a standard drink, it's free, but if you call for a brand, you will be paying something extra."
Stewart T. Chiron, vice president of the Cruise Line, a cruise-only agency in North Miami Beach, discussed whether on-board shops and boutiques, whose wares have never been included in the basic price, were flogging their merchandise too vigorously. "The gift shops must handle hordes of people," he said. "So rather than create a pile-up inside, they push racks outside. But it's not intrusive."
 
'People Love It'
Several people in the cruise business noted that shopping was a major part of travel these days. Fran Wenograd Golden, the cruise reporter for Travel Weekly, interviewed while aboard the Sea Princess, said that every day, the ship newsletter carried ads for things to buy. "But people love it," she said.
In a business that is increasingly competitive, the extras are important to cruise companies. Bob Dickinson, president of Carnival Cruise Lines, in his 1996 book "Selling the Sea," said the cruise lines added 10 to 20 percent to their bottom lines with on-board activities, including shore expeditions. And what is the biggest category on the list? Not the casino, Mr. Dickinson said in an interview, estimating that only about 30 percent of passengers visit casinos. Liquor and soft drinks, which cost extra on all but a couple of lines, are the biggest revenue producers.
In her new book "The Complete Idiot's Travel Guide to Cruise Vacations" (Alpha Books-Macmillan, $16.95), Ms. Golden said that typical prices were $1 for a soda and $2.95 and up for an alcoholic drink. In the interview, she said that every ship had a daily special cocktail, often a pina colada or other tropical choice, for around $3, and that prices for premium brands or at martini bars were much higher.
Mr. Dickinson said that his company's "sanity check" on its prices was to compare them with what was charged by on-shore resorts. "On our three- and four-day product," he said, "we compare prices with Disney and Universal Studios."
But cruise lines have a big added starter, Ms. Golden said, in ship-to-shore calls, which can run $7 to $15 a minute.
Other usual extra-cost items are baby-sitting; haircuts, facials and massages; dry-cleaning and laundry, and photographs. A new one, supporting Mr. James's contention that customer tastes are creating change, is cappuccino. Carnival has now added espresso bars. Aly Bello, a Carnival spokeswoman, sent along a menu for Cafe on the Way, with espresso at $1.50, cappuccino at $1.95 and a chocolate-covered strawberry at $1 (three for $2).
 
Day of Plastic Reckoning
Like Carnival, most cruise lines give the passenger a card that enables extra expenditures, including gambling, to be charged to the cabin. Charging gambling losses, like charging liquor, is a process that worries organizations that treat addictions, but it is markedly easier for the cruise ship to operate as a cashless society. The reckoning comes on the last day, when the charges on the card must be cleared, often on a credit card.
Usually, Mr. Chiron of the Cruise Line said, the passenger gets a leaflet on boarding that tells what is going to cost extra, particularly the shore excursions. The Travel Company, the Cruise Line's parent organization, has published "Guide to Family Cruising," a leaflet giving information on activities for 10 major lines and sometimes, their baby-sitting fees. Fees for sitting, where quoted, range from $8 an hour for two children in a family to $10 an hour a child. To get the booklet, call (800) 777-0707 on a touch-tone phone.
One thing is standard: There is no standard set of charges in any price category. Room service (from the regular dining room fare) is always included. Caviar seldom is, but all Seabourn cruises include it. Caviar is also free on the two Sea Goddesses, owned by Cunard, and for grille-class passengers aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2.
Silversea advertises an all-inclusive price, including liquor, tips, port charges, transfers, porter charges and economy air fare. Dale DiBello, a spokeswoman, said that there was one free shore excursion on particular cruises, a total of 27 out of 62 this season.
Haircuts and massages cost extra, as do dry-cleaning and laundry, Ms. DiBello said. Photographs are free for previous cruisers. There are no extra charges for aerobics classes, deck chairs and towels.
Ernie Beyl of the Cunard division of Carnival said the prices on Seabourn, another division, included "stocking liquor in the suites and in bars throughout," as well as wine. That is, with the exception of very expensive brands. For instance? "For example, Johnnie Walker Blue, and an $800 brandy called La Tasche," he said.
Tips are covered. And that caviar, too. Some excursions are covered, particularly those in Southeast Asia "where there is no place else to go," he said. "But not ballooning over Stockholm," he added. Haircuts and massages must be paid for separately. There is a charge for photos.
Baby-sitting? Pause. "This is not an ideal cruise for children, although on occasion we have them," he said. "Those parents must make their own contacts with the staff members."
Yes, dry-cleaning and laundry must be paid for, he said, "although we have free laundries on board."
As a free activity aboard a cruise ship, watching the spin cycle does not do it for me. Waiter, please bring strawberries. Bring caviar. Bring the bill.

 BODY:
Shouldn't colleges take an honest look at the reality that parents are buying test scores for their children? What if colleges insisted that students inform them that they had been tutored as part of their application?
 Colleges know which applicants go to public schools and which go to elite prep schools and are well aware of which schools routinely inflate grades and which ones do not. Let them demand honesty about one more factor on the application.
 Arun Alagappan calls himself a teacher, but he is really just another successful capitalist, cheerfully exploiting the anxieties of wealthy parents.

Sharp-Eyed Collectors Drive Up the Price of Folk Art

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
OUTSIDER art continues to upstage American folk art in gallery and museum exhibitions as well as in the press. But at the auctions, traditional American folk art chalks up spectacular prices for the choicest examples, while the quirky, visionary Outsider art lags far behind in prices fetched at auction.
This month's folk-art sales began with the proverbial bang at Christie's when two extraordinary paintings by Edward Hicks rewrote the records for the artist and for folk art. The first painting, "The Residence of David Twining," which had never been on the market previously, was sold by Dr. Thomas Lincoln, a descendant of Twining and of Abraham Lincoln, for $1.4 million. Seconds later, a second painting, "Peaceable Kingdom," from 1837, was sold for $4.7 million to Richard York, a New York dealer. The total sales of folk art at Christie's was $9.3 million and $2.6 million at Sotheby's. 
 The rise in prices for folk art reflects the broadening and maturing of the market. Twenty five years ago, most collectors bought largely on instinct because the field was still relatively new and few books had been written on the subject. Today's collectors come armed with scholarly studies and advice from experts, and as a consequence, they are knowledgeable about the minutest details of objects, what makes them rare and even who owned them.
The sale of "Peaceable Kingdom" sheds light on how the prices for folk-art masterpieces have escalated over the last 20 years. The painting metaphorically depicts Isaiah's prophecy of the animals of the earth in a wooded idyll while in the background William Penn signs a treaty with Indians. It was auctioned in 1980 at Samuel T. Freeman in Philadelphia for $210,000, which was then the record for the artist and for folk art. Long admired as among the most gripping of the 62 versions of "Peaceable Kingdom," it is also considered desirable because it is one of few that include every animal in Isaiah's prophecy.
The sales at Christie's and Sotheby's offered works from important collections, each of which exceeded the totals expected. The largest was the 660-piece collection of John Gordon, a folk-art dealer in New York who had amassed pottery, weathervanes, painted furniture and watercolors as well as the idiosyncratic 20th-century works of Bill Traylor, Minnie Evans and Edgar Tolson. The pieces fetched a total of $2.8 million at Christie's.
Susan Kleckner, director of folk art sales at Christie's, attributed the success of the Gordon sale in part to new findings by scholars over the last five years. Three frakturs in the sale from Bucks County in Pennsylvania, for example, which were identified as having been painted by a man called the Rockhill Township artist, brought from two to four times expectations. When not attributed to an artist, similar works sold below estimates.
Likewise, an 18th century floral-decorated redware bowl was expected to sell for at most $3,500 but brought $13,800. Until recently, Ms. Klechner said, the bowl would have been identified as generic redware from Pennsylvania, but because its origins could now be pinpointed to Hagerstown, Md., it was more valuable.
At Sotheby's, traditional portraits, landscapes and marine paintings from the collection of Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, well-known collectors of Americana, were sold for the Whitney Museum of American Art for a total of $685,000. And the collection of Outsider art works by Traylor, Henry Darger, Nelly Mae Rowe and Lee Godie, assembled by Herbert Waide Hemphill Jr., a pioneer collector in this field. The collection was sold for $239,200 by the National Museum of American Art. The costliest lot was a surreal Traylor drawing of a leaping man on the head of a bird, which was sold for $46,000 to James Curtis, a New York private dealer in 20th century prints.
"We had the best economic environment for this sale," said Nancy Druckman, the director of folk art at Sotheby's. "And we had an unusually high number of pieces that were fresh to the market. This was really the last public chunk of the Garbisch folk art."
DAVID WHEATCROFT, a folk-art dealer from Westboro, Mass., was an active buyer at both houses this month, spending in all more than $330,000 for about about 30 items. His buying ranged from redware pottery and paper cutwork to a Garbisch prize, a richly detailed watercolor, "Berks County Almhouse, Hospital and Lunatic Asylum" by C. C. Hofmann. The painting is the only such watercolor on paper known by Hofmann, and it sold for $112,500, more than three times what Sotheby's had expected.
"Serious money was spent this month on folk art," Mr. Wheatcroft said. "It's pretty obvious that the folk art field is carried by the economy. This market is not so superheated as the late 1980's when it was almost as good as sold when you bought it. But we did see some wild abandon at these sales."

A Caravaggio Leaves Its Dublin Home to Visit Boston

BYLINE: By KEN SHULMAN; Ken Shulman writes about art from Boston.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
SINCE it was rediscovered in the Jesuit Residence in Dublin in 1990, Caravaggio's "Taking of Christ" has left Ireland only twice. In 1995, the painting spent a month at the National Gallery in London and two months in Rome. "The Taking of Christ" was not scheduled to leave Dublin -- where the Jesuit Fathers have left it on indefinite loan at the National Gallery of Ireland -- for the next 25 years. Yet tomorrow it will be on view in Boston, as the centerpiece of "Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image," a show of 17th-century Italian religious art that opens at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston College, through May 24.
"This is simply a case of one Jesuit institution helping out another Jesuit institution," says Franco Mormando, the director of "Saints and Sinners" and a Jesuit priest who teaches art history at the college. "There are also long-standing ties between the Catholic communities of Dublin and Boston, as well as the Jesuits in those two cities." 
 "Saints and Sinners" is ostensibly a show about the stylistic and thematic changes that occurred in Italian religious art following the Protestant Reformation and the Council of Trent. The art of this period, which is known traditionally as the Italian Baroque, is characterized by a heightened sense of drama and naturalism designed to draw the viewer into the composition. The Boston College exhibition features 30 paintings, including canvases by Guido Reni, Domenichino, Bernardo Strozzi and Ludovico Carracci. But the long-lost Dublin Caravaggio -- one of two Caravaggio compositions in the show, and the only work coming from outside the United States -- is definitely the show stopper, and it's reason for being.
 Caravaggio's "Taking of Christ" depicts the moment when Jesus is captured in the Garden of Gethsemane. At the center of the painting, Jesus and Judas Iscariot lock in an embrace, an instant after the traitorous apostle has planted what is perhaps the most famous kiss in Western tradition on the Savior's cheek. The pair is pressed together by a handful of armor-clad guards come to arrest Jesus. Caravaggio himself is also present in the drama, a figure on the right-hand edge of the group holding the lantern that illuminates part of the scene.
Approximately 5 1/2 feet wide by 4 feet high, "The Taking of Christ" was rediscovered in 1990 by Sergio Benedetti, a conservator at the National Gallery of Ireland whom the Jesuit Fathers invited to their residence during a renovation. Caravaggio executed the painting in 1602 on a generous commission from Ciriaco Mattei, a merchant banker from Rome. The work hung in the Mattei family palace through 1802, when one of Mattei's heirs sold it to William Hamilton Nisbet of Scotland. Somewhere along the way, the attribution was changed from Caravaggio to Gerrit von Honthorst, a Dutch follower of Caravaggio. In 1921, "The Taking of Christ" and five other Nesbit paintings were offered for sale at an Edinburgh auction house. The lot was withdrawn when bids did not reach the eight-guinea ($50) minimum estimate.
"The Taking of Christ" entered the Jesuit residence in the 1930's as a gift from a Dublin woman. It was hanging in the library when Mr. Benedetti first saw it. On close inspection, he was stunned by the quality of the painting and suspected it might be by Caravaggio. His intuition grew stronger as he restored the painting over the next several months. For two years, Mr. Benedetti did extensive archival research to retrace the itinerary of the masterpiece and invited several leading Caravaggio scholars to authenticate the attribution. All of them concurred. In 1993, the Dublin Caravaggio was made public. The exquisite and rare painting -- there are fewer than 60 known Caravaggios -- made headlines around the world.
"Saints and Sinners" is not, despite its full title, a show about Caravaggio. It is an intimate and elastic period show. Too small to be encyclopedic, it aims instead for effect. Apart from an economical wall text, the Baroque atmosphere is evoked entirely through inflection, through the selection and juxtaposition of the paintings. The show's pedantry is subtle, almost subliminal, a series of images that re-create some of the sensations -- if not the knowledge -- of 17th-century Italian spirituality. "There was a sense of the whole world living within a tradition both classical and Christian," says John O'Malley, a professor of church history, a Jesuit priest and a collaborator on the exhibition. "For these people, the past was incredibly vivid and had an immediate import in the present. For them, the stories of saints were not mere curiosities. They were relevant to daily life. This is something most of us in the 20th century seem to have lost."
FOLLOWING the Protestant Reformation, which began in 1517 with Martin Luther in Wittenburg, Germany, leaders of the Roman Catholic Church met in Trent from 1545 through 1563. There the Council of Trent drafted its strategy for countering the Protestant challenge. It also discussed long-neglected matters of internal Church reform. One of the subjects of the council was the use of images in religious art. The Tridentine document stipulated that "in the use of sacred images, all superstition shall be removed, all filthy quest for gain eliminated, and all lasciviousness avoided." In 1564, the year after the council concluded, Pope Pius IV ordered Daniele da Volterra to paint braghe or loincloths over some of the racier nudes in Michelangelo's "Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel.
Yet the religious art of Baroque Italy, a period historians chart between 1580 and 1700, is hardly puritan. If anything, it is more carnal and sensual than the religious art that preceded it. There may be less nudity than in the paintings of the High Renaissance, but the figures in Baroque art are usually real people, with real pain and passion. "The element of flesh was hardly expunged from Italian religious art," says Mr. O'Malley. "The proscriptions against avarice and lasciviousness in art that came out of Trent are incredibly mild when compared with Erasmus's strictures against seductiveness in churches. Erasmus educated the rest of Europe to be prudish in this regard, while Italy pretty much followed its own path. I also think there was much more of a sense about the goodness of the flesh in Italy."
The Catholic Church had always used painted images as devotional aids. But the Baroque images represented both a thematic and stylistic departure from the images that preceded them. Saints began to be featured in the moments of their martyrdom. Penitence and conversion paintings became extremely popular. There was a tremendous resurgence in "fallible" saints like Mary Magdalene and St. Peter. Indeed, an entire section of the Boston College show is dedicated to them. "Mary Magdalene and Peter became popular as penitential icons," says Mr. Mormando. "They were effective role models precisely because they had sinned. They had failures. They repented. And they were forgiven. In short, they were human."
This same humanism seeped into the treatment of religious subjects in Baroque art. Artists working in 17th-century Italy focused on breaking down the visual barrier that kept viewers from participating in the drama of their religious subjects. They set their figures at the forefront of their canvases, and heightened their already moving scenes with acute effects of light and shade. It was the 17th-century equivalent of today's hand-held movie camera. "This is something that Caravaggio did with remarkable power," says Pamela Jones, the head of the Department of Art History at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and a member of the curatorial committee for the Boston College show. "He was acutely aware that there was going to be somebody there looking at his paintings. It just makes his art look very different from anything that came before it."
The Italian Baroque was an age of paradox. During the Papacy of Clement VIII (1592-1605), the Pontiff issued a strict edict against prostitution, and even banned nude swimming in the Tiber. Yet during those same years, Caravaggio used nude street boys and prostitutes as models in paintings he then sold to some of the most refined -- and devout -- connoisseurs in Rome. It was an age that vacillated tra il devoto, et profano -- between the sacred and the profane -- as Cardinal Ottavio Paravicino described the art of Caravaggio in a 1603 letter.
This friction animated Baroque art, which in turn injected new vitality into a church still smarting from the blow of the Reformation. "One could even argue that this art speaks toward a new legitimization of Catholicism, and of the Catholic Church," says Mr. O'Malley. "Toward the validity of sacrament and of confession. For Lutherans and Calvinists, once you're saved, you're saved. Sinning and getting up again is very Catholic."

HEADLINE: Caught in the Undertow

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK

 BODY:
SUMMER and winter are different here only because of the weather. The ocean breeze blows across an empty boardwalk and right through the spectral hulk that was supposed to become a condominium building. The streets off Ocean Avenue are lined with parking meters that rarely see a car, in January or in August.
And in winter as in summer, Asbury Park residents line up at City Council meetings to plead for attention to the oceanfront blocks that many compare with Beirut. They have been devastated for 15 years, ever since the city made a deal with a developer who bought up acres, bought out businesses and then went bankrupt -- a failure that had a shriveling effect on the rest of the city, too. 
 At the last meeting, Thomas Hayes, president of the Chamber of Commerce, given two minutes to speak like everybody else, told the five council members: "Just this past week I talked to several businesses who said, 'We can't hang in anymore.' We need an answer from the council people."
The question, asked over and over in Asbury Park, is: Why did the council turn down an offer from the state to set up a redevelopment authority that would extricate the city from its tortured dealings with the developer, pay his $7 million in back taxes and get started again?
The council's 3-to-2 vote last fall against opening discussions with the state was especially frustrating to the residents who have staked their futures on the handsome old houses and small businesses here. They had been looking to an infusion of capital -- it will take hundreds of millions of dollars just to rebuild the redevelopment zone -- in the city that was once a magic kingdom resort with manicured lakes, elegant hotels and a mile-long carnival of a boardwalk.
There were 200 hotels in 1938, and now there is one, the Berkeley Carteret, whose grand front entrance is nevertheless locked night and day. Except for a roller rink with a few video games, the amusements have vanished. The Stone Pony nightclub closed in September. And while real estate prices keep climbing along the Jersey Shore, the tax base -- the total value of taxable property -- in Asbury has shrunk each year since 1993.
Innumerable hopes for revival have come to grief in local politics scarred by racial resentments, disruptions in city government and feuds that are too intricate to chronicle. Residents of all political stripes refer to sinister absentee landlords and developers' back pockets, though for all the criminal indictments of public officials over the last decade, none has shown corruption linked to the redevelopment mess.
It is hardly clear what anyone has to gain from years of delay in development. Eugene M. LaVergne, a lawyer who moved his office to Asbury several years ago "because I think it has a future," said: "Everything's always been for sale in the city. What's enraging and ironic is that they're buying the town to keep it down."
The city government's resistance to state help is even more puzzling to outsiders. "I've kind of walked away," said State Senator John O. Bennett of Little Silver, who was Asbury Park's city attorney for eight months in 1997 and 1998. "I don't know what else you can do for a city. This is the absolute best chance for the city. I can't understand why it doesn't happen. Is what they have now better? If not the state, why not?"
William E. Best, the executive director of the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority, acknowledged "a degree of dismay" at the council's vote, taken a few weeks after he addressed a standing-room-only meeting where dozens of speakers cheered on the state's proposal. "We've said time and time again that it was our intent to work with the city as the plan was being modified," Mr. Best said. "We want not only to work with the city but with community support."
But the council members who opposed the plan reply that they are hamstrung by litigation with the original developer, Joseph Carabetta, and are close to a settlement that would transfer control of the redevelopment zone to the city or another developer. Finally, they say, they cannot accept the state's proposed local redevelopment authority, which would have a majority of members appointed by the state.
"They want a majority on the board," said Mayor Kenneth Saunders, one of the three council members who opposes the plan. "No. This is our town, and we should have a majority."
"In the meantime," Mr. Saunders said, "I've got some other things going, and I hope to be able to make a big announcement over the next few weeks. We've had 17 years of going back and forth, and we're closer than we've ever been."
 Those "other things" are settlement talks with Mr. Carabetta as well as other prospective developers. Mr. Carabetta, whose offices are in Meriden, Conn., declined to answer any questions for this article, and city officials say they cannot estimate his total investment in the project. But one group of investors interested in taking over the project reached an agreement with Mr. Carabetta last summer to pay more than $16 million of the developer's debts. This group was rejected by the City Council because it could not guarantee financing for the construction.
Carabetta Enterprises Inc. went bankrupt in 1992, after negotiating an extension with the city and recasting the development plan to include entertainment centers and theme restaurants. The only construction that had materialized from the original plan was the skeleton of the Ocean Mile condominium high-rise and a row of town houses that burned before they were sold.
As for who else might acquire the property and the redevelopment rights, Mayor Saunders said: "I'm willing to work with anyone. I'd work with Daffy Duck. The first ones that come in and show me the money I can work with."
Asbury Park has seen many builders express interest, only to recoil because of the bankruptcy proceedings and the litigation over the redevelopment agreement. Others, including K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, have withdrawn in exasperation over the city's political leadership.
I N recent months, three groups of investors have put plans before the City Council. After the Council rejected the first for its failure to guarantee financing, a second group also dropped out. The third, a consortium of builders that have completed projects in Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken, remains interested, if frustrated. "We have been trying to do what we thought the city wanted," said Brian Doherty, the group's lawyer. "We'd work with the city, we'd work with the state."
But Mr. Doherty added that the city was poorly equipped to evaluate and broker a huge real estate development. "There's no planning staff and no economic development staff," he said. "There's no strong voice on City Council. You're dealing with laypeople who have other jobs and are called upon to be Council people. Twelve or 13 years later, it hasn't dawned on them that you've got to build something."
The city is indeed in political shambles. It has had seven mayors in 10 years, and the Council seats have rotated with each election, including a recall vote in 1996. The recently departed city planner is suing the city, claiming his dismissal was racially motivated; the former public safety director is suing, too, claiming he was dismissed because he refused to fix a parking ticket for the Mayor. The school board attorney, who was subsequently removed, and the assistant city manager, among others, were indicted last year on bid-rigging charges and awaiting trial dates.
The council members snap at one another in their meetings, which one former Councilman said he tried to persuade a television station to film because "they're much better than Judge Judy." In their vote on the state plan, the two supporters contended that two of the opponents had conflicts stemming from business connections to Mr. Carabetta or his former partner.
After the last Council meeting, Councilwoman Sheila C. Solomon, a supporter of state intervention, was fuming because Mr. Hayes had been cut off while pleading for a public forum to discuss the state's offer. "All this time they've blocked out having a hearing," Ms. Solomon said. "All these people are asking for is a hearing."
"This is wrong," she went on. "In July it will be two years I've been sitting up here, and nothing has been accomplished. I wrote letters to the press, I had people calling me and I said, 'Keep up the pressure.' I've written the Attorney General. I've written the Governor. Somebody's got to listen."
Councilman John J. Hamilton Jr., the first to ask the state Redevelopment Authority to intercede, said: "I've spoken to Assembly people who say, 'What's wrong with people there?' We've spent more than $1 million on legal fees fighting Carabetta, and the state would take over all our litigation."
"I'm kind of stuck," Mr. Hamilton added. "I've spoken out. I don't want to attack the council."
But Councilwoman Louise Murray responds that it would be better to let the city or another developer strike a deal with Mr. Carabetta than to wait for the state to wrest redevelopment rights from him. Meanwhile, Ms. Murray said, "I'm not ready to put Asbury Park in somebody else's hands."
"I laid awake nights when I made this decision," she said. "I slept with a pad of paper by the bed. But every Council since Carabetta has thought they had the answers. They've all just made more of a mess."
Councilman James G. Condos, who like the Mayor and Ms. Murray will not agree to a redevelopment board with a majority appointed by the state, said most residents did not want to cede local control. "It's a vocal minority that shows up at Council meetings," Mr. Condos said.
Another opponent of state involvement is Henry Vaccaro, Mr. Carabetta's partner in the original redevelopment contract with the city. Mr. Vaccaro, who says the developer's failure wiped out his assets too, is trying to organize a group to buy out Mr. Carabetta and hopes to get construction contracts in the eventual rebuilding. While Mr. Vaccaro said of the council that "there's not a brain among them," he has no use for the state. "Look at what the state's given us so far," he said. "Subsidized housing all over the west side. Mental patients who ruined the beachfront."
Mr. Vaccaro has a long history in Asbury Park politics. Though he no longer lives here, he runs a guitar manufacturing company in town and has bought and sold numerous properties in and near the redevelopment zone. In what he said was an attempt to revive the project, even though he had sold out to Mr. Carabetta years ago, Mr. Vaccaro backed a successful campaign in 1996 to recall two Council members.
The recall also became a cause for a group of black activists who called themselves Asbury United. Recent campaigns have been vicious. An unsigned flyer supporting Mr. Saunders urged blacks, who make up about 60 percent of Asbury Park's population, to "drop white supremacy"; it showed tombstones bearing the names of political enemies, including two African-Americans identified with the label "slave."
Still, opinions on redevelopment do not divide along racial lines, or even on discernible political lines. In September, for example, 16 civic groups issued an open letter to the Mayor supporting the state's offer; many minority organizations, including Asbury United, were represented, as were the Salvation Army and the Chamber of Commerce.
"It's not a matter of black or white," said Mr. Mauro, the former Council candidate, who has lived here for eight years. "It's a matter of green, and of ignorance and greed. This city has been bled so dry with back-room deals." In running for office, Mr. Mauro said, "you're vilified, you're threatened. They've made it so good people won't get involved. When it was over, I said, I must have been crazy to do that."
Mr. Mauro's civic life began with the Asbury Park Garden Club, which he and a few friends formed to restore the once-spectacular gardens around the city. Both the club and the gardens flourished for a time, then withered from vandalism and official neglect. When the slate that defeated his Council candidacy took office, Mr. Mauro said, the Council scheduled concerts on the park grounds that had been the garden club's flagship project, and the plantings were trampled. "That's when I threw in the towel," he said. "It broke my heart."
THERE still is a garden club, and Mr. Mauro, a lab technician, is still a keeper of the city's esthetic history, which he presents in a video -- another garden club project -- that uses restored frames of a 1938 promotional film to trace Asbury Park's stunning decline. When he showed the film at a housing complex for the elderly, he said, people were sobbing. "One little old lady said, 'The developers have done to this city what the Depression couldn't do.' "
Dr. Angelo Chinnici, a former Council member, recalled how his tuition was paid by his family's restaurant and his own summers selling hot dogs on the boardwalk. "In the 70's the typical boardwalk lease was $16,000 to $18,000 for concession space," Dr. Chinnici said. "Now you'd be lucky to get $500."
Dr. Chinnici is largely credited with regaining possession of the Paramount Theater and Convention Hall -- the elegant city-owned buildings that once generated so much boardwalk business -- when he was on the Council several years ago. The complex has been restored and is host to the New Jersey Shorecats basketball team and to concerts, though it is hardly lucrative.
"I invite the Attorney General and the state of New Jersey to take a good, hard look at what's going on," Dr. Chinnici said. "There's no other city in the U.S. that's suffered so much financial blight because of a few individuals."
While most properties near the beach remain in Mr. Carabetta's control, a few others have recently changed hands and raised hopes. The Berkeley Carteret was sold last month to a Queens businessman for $5.1 million. Preservationists keep fighting to save the Palace Amusements building -- they have already recovered its original Ferris wheel -- and a group of Bruce Springsteen fans is making contingency plans to save Tillie, the grinning clown face painted on the Palace building and pictured in Springsteen videos and posters.
The state's more unsentimental interest remains alive, Mr. Best said. He noted that control of the board that would oversee the project is not negotiable, since the legislation providing state financing for urban redevelopment requires that a majority of board members be members or employees of the state Redevelopment Authority.
But he insisted that the state's role would be limited in time -- to 10 years or until 80 percent of construction is completed -- and in substance. He said the funds to pay back taxes remain available, without any legislative approval, though they would have to be repaid when the development becomes financially viable.
Mr. Best, who had met with City Council members individually in coffee shops to explain the plan, said he was baffled by their vote. He said that a few weeks later, in October, he wrote to the City Manager, the Mayor and Council members, asking them to outline their concerns. But except for a phone call from Mr. Hamilton, he said, he received no response.
The City Manager, Wilbert C. Russell, said the state's offer, which does not exist in any written form, was vague. "It's unclear what the state's intention is," Mr. Russell said, "other than to give a loan and set up a board with a majority."
John Loffredo, president of the Asbury Park Homeowners Association, said the Mayor had made campaign promises to seek help from the state. And while the state proposal "isn't that great," Mr. Loffredo said, "you don't dismiss it out of hand. You go back and talk."
"Everybody is waiting for some savior to drop out of the sky, whether it's the state or a redeveloper," he said. "If we'd been running the city for the last 15 years the way we should have, we'd be fine. We'd be ahead of the game."

HEADLINE: The Neighborhood Bank Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
THE small-town bank, a fading institution that's been written off as a victim of mergers, is making a comeback.
Four new banks, three of them in Fairfield County, opened in the state last year. And three more are in the application process, according to the state's Department of Banking. 
 Those figures, to be sure, are dwarfed by the spate of small start-ups that occurred in the mid-80's banking boom. Nonetheless, the numbers show a turnaround from the early '90's, when banks, hammered by real estate-related loan losses and a deep recession, were being shut down throughout New England.
"It's a significant trend, a fallout from all the merger and acquisitions activity," said John S. Carusone, president of the Bank Analysis Center in Hartford. "There is a segment of banking customers that wants to deal with a familiar face at their local bank and not a toll-free telephone number."
William R. Berkley, the chief executive officer of the W. R. Berkley Corporation, a property and casualty insurance firm, has helped finance two of the new Fairfield County banks: Greenwich Bank and Trust, which opened last February, and Westport National Bank, which opened last month.
Mr. Berkley, a Greenwich resident, said his interest in beginning local banks was prompted, in part, by his wife's inability to get through to a live human being on her bank's 800 number. "The drive for efficiency and optimum profits has left the customer who wants personal service out of the picture," said Mr. Berkley. "And people want that kind of service. If someone has a question or a problem, they want to talk to their banker. They don't want to be forwarded to an operator in South Dakota."
The resurgence of banks in Connecticut is part of a national trend. There were 216 new banks formed in the nation in 1998, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, compared with 68 five years earlier.
Most of these banks, called de novos by regulators, are created in affluent areas and are run by people who worked at banks swallowed up in mergers.
Michael M. Cassell, a Greenwich resident and the president and chief executive at the Greenwich Bank and Trust Company, for example, held the same positions at the Putnam Trust Company in Greenwich, which was bought by the Bank of New York in 1995.
And Michael H. Flynn, a Fairfield resident and the president and chief executive at Westport National Bank, used to hold the same jobs at the Westport Bank and Trust Company and at Lafayette American Bank in Bridgeport, after its parent company, Hubco Inc. of Mahwah, N.J., took over Westport Bank and Trust in December 1996. Despite the flurry of new banks in the state, the recent growth of local banks, according to the F.D.I.C., has taken place mostly in the West, where the industry is considered more trend-setting and independent-minded, than in the tradition-bound Northeast, bank analysts say. Even so, the consolidation of the banking industry in New England in the 90's, along with a resurgent regional economy, has made markets like Connecticut fertile ground for new banks.
"You are seeing a lot of interest in starting banks these days," said Robert J. Oca, a Greenwich resident and the president and chief executive of the Bank of Westport, which opened in October.
"There has been a gap left by all the mergers, and people are looking to fill that gap," added Mr. Oca, who like Mr. Flynn and Mr. Cassell, is an alumnus of banks that have vanished. Mr. Oca was an executive at Connecticut Community Bank in Greenwich and later Connecticut Bank and Trust in Fairfield County. Connecticut Community Bank was taken over by Connecticut Bank and Trust, which was taken over by the Bank of New England in Boston and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary. Connecticut Bank and Trust went out of business in 1991; the Bank of New England was bought by Fleet Financial Group a year later.
Some bank analysts say there are now too many banks in some areas. "Greenwich is fully banked, at this point," Mr. Carusone said, noting that there are nine banks in the town.
The same, he added, may be true for Westport, particularly since Westport National Bank and the Bank of Westport are in direct competition.
Mr. Flynn downplays the rivalry. "There is enough there for both of us," he said, adding that the Bank of Westport appears to be focusing more on downtown Westport, while Westport National Bank will also seek to serve northern and eastern areas around Westport, such as Fairfield and Easton.
Mr. Carusone also said that both Westport banks could survive. He added that Westport is one of most promising areas in which to found a bank, due to its affluent population.
The Westport area, which includes Norwalk and Fairfield, encompasses 58,000 households and 7,600 businesses, he said. And more than 58 percent of the households have incomes of more than $50,000. Twenty-three percent have incomes of more than $100,000 annually.
"Fairfield County, as a whole, is one of the most attractive banking markets in the country," said Mr. Carusone, adding that not only is the area wealthy but also that Darien and New Canaan have lost hometown banks in recent years and may be missing such services. The Bank of Darien was taken over by Hubco, and New Canaan Bank and Trust was taken over by Summit Bancorp of Princeton, N.J.
The new Fairfield County banks raised between $5 million and $10 million each capitalization, much of it from local investors. (Regulators require a minimum of $5 million.) The three banks are aggressively seeking new deposits, against which they will make loans. Westport National Bank, for example, has begun an advertising and telephone marketing campaign. Bank officials are also meeting with lawyers and accountants to make a pitch for their business as well as making presentations to professional groups, Mr. Flynn said.
All the banks expect to take at least 18 months to turn a profit. Regulators, according to Mr. Carusone, generally prohibit the banks from selling out to competitors for at least three years.
To compete against the mega-banks and super-regionals -- Fleet, Chase Manhattan and First Union among others -- the new banks say they are emphasizing personal service. Officials say waits on the telephone will be shorter and employees will answer phones instead of relying on voice mail. They also say that standards for loans will be more flexible, the officers more accessible and the approvals quicker. Shorter lines at cashiers' windows and fewer small fees are also being promised. Westport National Bank, for example, waives most fees for customers for six months and does not charge for using A.T.M.s other than their own.
"If someone writes a check to the I.R.S. and there's not enough in the account, we might cover it for a customer and give them a call," Mr. Flynn said. "You think a larger out-of-state bank is going to do that?"
"And if someone has, say, an $800,000 balance in their account with us and they are doing a closing, we'll run that check over to them," he added. "That kind of customer with that size deposit is small change to larger banks."
Mr. Flynn also said that local banks are not fee-driven. "Larger banks, even if they get a tenth of a cent on billions, that's a lot," he said. "We don't make our money that way. We make it on the spread between interest we pay on deposits and interest we charge on loans. We're not service-charge happy."
James W. Schepker, senior vice president for media relations at Fleet National Bank in Hartford, part of Fleet Financial Group of Boston, said that the new smaller banks fill a niche market, and they indeed might be more willing to reduce fees and be more flexible in loan rates, but not necessarily faster in processing loans. "We can do it now in 24 hours," he said.
Mr. Schepker added that improved service to many customers means more than just discounted fees and rates, a polite call from the bank when a check bounces or a friendly receptionist answering the telephone. It also means, he said, offering services that only larger banks can -- like global A.T.M. access, Internet banking, 24-hour telephone banking and branch locations. "We do not necessarily believe that smaller is better," he said.
Richard Batten, a Westport detective who recently opened an account at Westport National Bank, does not necessarily agree. He closed an account at Lafayette American, which he had opened 23 years ago when it was Westport Bank and Trust.
He said Lafayette American repeatedly charged him for overdraft cash reserves he was not using and could not explain the glitches. "They couldn't answer the question," he said. "They couldn't tell me why." Officials with Hubco, Lafayette American's parent company, did not respond to repeated telephone calls seeking comment.
"They've lost all personality," Mr. Batten said. "It's a bank in Jersey. You got to flag someone down to help you. You don't get through when you call. It's not the same anymore."

HEADLINE: Bygone Era's Revival: Hauling Goods by Rail

BYLINE: By CAROL STEINBERG 

 BODY:
AS Long Island Rail Road commuter trains zip by on the main track just east of the Deer Park train station, the engineer, Alex Raia, and conductor, Mark Myers, get their 19-car freight train into position so they can drop off three rail cars loaded with 159 rolls of paper weighing 465,000 pounds.
The cars are headed to a spur of tracks leading to the AJM Packaging Corporation in Brentwood. There, the paper will be unloaded and eventually converted into paper plates. 
 After the drop-off, the train will switch to the main track and head east, delivering five empty gondolas to be filled with scrap iron to the Gershow Recycling Corporation in Medford, plywood to the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Yaphank, and propane to the Paraco Gas Corporation in Riverhead before returning west with other shipments.
Timing is everything. Since the service operates on rails of the nation's busiest commuter line, it adheres strictly to the L.I.R.R.'s timetable, dodging on and off the main tracks between commuter trains.
Rail freight has operated here since the mid-19th century, but in May 1997, the New York & Atlantic Railway took over the service from the Long Island Rail Road, and it has been attempting to revitalize the moribund operation since.
"The railroad lost freight step by step over many years and it will take many years to build it up again," said Bruce Lieberman, chairman of New York & Atlantic, which is owned by Anacostia Rail Holdings, an affiliate of Anacostia & Pacific Company of Manhattan and Chicago. New York & Atlantic is based in Fresh Pond, Queens, which is also the site of its only rail yard.
With the new carrier, "we're talking a lot more about rail freight, and that's the good part of it," said Wayne Ugolik of the Long Island regional office of the state Department of Transportation. He said it could reduce the number of trucks on the road and cut pollution.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Long Island Rail Road's parent agency, privatized rail freight to allow management to focus on its core business, said Brian Dolan, a spokesman for the railroad.
The sale of the operation came after the L.I.R.R. attempted earlier in the 1990's to upgrade its freight division, which was criticized for poor service and inattention. In its last year, the division had a net profit of $576,000 on $6.29 million in revenues, according to the railroad, and had about 24 employees.
Gary Gross, a retired engineer hired by New York & Atlantic as a consultant, remembers 800 freight cars a day when he started with the L.I.R.R. 30 years ago. Riding a green-and-white locomotive recently, he recalled former customers -- "old friends," he said, like Hills supermarkets, San Salvage, Brentwood Lumber and Waldbaum's, whose sidings have since been paved over.
"You name it, we delivered it," Mr. Gross said.
But as many major shippers began to use trucks for speedier -- although costlier -- service and as the economy shifted from heavy manufacturing and agriculture to high-value smaller items, rail freight tumbled. Between 1987 and 1996, it fell from 17,131 carloads and 1.1 million tons to 11,683 carloads and 865,857 tons. Each rail car can hold two to three truckloads of material.
Rail accounts for only 1 percent of all freight transportation on the Island and almost all the rest comes from trucks, said the state Department of Transportation. Nationwide, railroads' share of freight transport was 39.2 percent in 1997, according to the Eno Transportation Foundation, a research group in Washington.
One of five bidders, Anacostia & Pacific paid $12.7 million for a 20-year concession to be run by its new subsidiary, New York & Atlantic Railway. Annual trackage and switch maintenance fees increased the total deal to $26 million to $27 million, Mr. Lieberman said.
Founded in 1985, the company had revitalized a bankrupt freight service operating over busy commuter tracks from South Bend, Ind., to Chicago. It also owns the Louisville & Indiana Railroad, and Pacific Harbor Lines, serving the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Today, New York & Atlantic runs seven trains a day, five days a week, on its 269-mile route, which includes freight-only tracks in Brooklyn and Queens and extends east over commuter lines to Southold and Montauk.
In 1998, the company's total tonnage was about 40 percent rocks, stone and brick; 20 percent scrap paper and scrap metal; 15 percent paper; 10 percent lumber and the remainder food, plastics and fuel.
Since the takeover, the carrier has added six customers to the 75 on board and employs 30 people. Annual volume has risen to about 15,000 carloads and about 1.2 million tons.
Mr. Lieberman conceded that most of the increase stems from one large project, moving rock excavated from the New York City water tunnel project to Prima Asphalt Inc. in Holtsville. It will end later this year.
Compared with the commuter line, which operates 734 passenger trains with 265,000 passengers daily, "we're essentially invisible," Mr. Lieberman said.
Larry Silverman, chairman of the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council, said the two carriers "seem to be functioning without incident right now." He said the council would be concerned if there were an increase in daytime freight runs or derailments.
To insure that the commuter and freight lines co-exist safely, the L.I.R.R.'s operations center oversees the entire system. "There are prescribed windows of time where the freight train operates," said Sam Zambuto, a spokesman for the railroad.
He said the New York & Atlantic could expand by adding runs or increasing the length of trains within these windows, "as long as it doesn't impact the commuter train."
Still, the potential for disruption exists. In February 1997, an eastbound freight train loaded with gravel derailed in Westbury, delaying commuters for hours.
When the freight operation changed hands, kinks had to be worked out. At AJM Packaging, "deliveries showed up, but I had to be on their back, calling a couple of times a day," said the plant manager, Joseph Kijak. Now, he said, "Everything clicks."
The carrier had expected to use the railroad's small intermodal yard in Garden City, the only yard east of Queens with a ramp for loading and unloading to move cargo between rail and trucks.
However, responding to community outcry about increased traffic, the Long Island Rail Road closed the yard pending an environmental review.
"We need a yard in order to grow," Mr. Lieberman said.
A state Department of Transportation-sponsored regional planning study, Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, is exploring cargo-related issues, with an eye on reducing the 35,000 nonpassenger vehicles that cross the Nassau-Queens border daily.
Its cargo subcommittee has recommended building a large intermodal facility here for multiple modes, such as marine, air, rail and truck, which would reduce long-haul trucking through New York City.
Possible sites are Pilgrim State Hospital in Brentwood and the Grumman properties in Bethpage and Calverton. Any construction would be at least five years away, Mr. Ugolik said.
Local leaders agree that New York & Atlantic faces a big educational task.
"No question, the history of rail freight has turned customers off," said Mitchell Pally, vice president for legislative and economic affairs at the Long Island Association.
Further, most companies just naturally put freight on trucks. "We have to change the mindset of businesses on Long Island to at least look at rail as an option," Mr. Pally said.
One way to change that is by emphasizing the price difference. The New York & Atlantic would not release its shipping fees, but the Eno Transportation Foundation said the average price paid by shippers in 1997 was $2.40 a ton mile by rail, versus $26.12 by truck.
Mr. Lieberman said logical companies to attract are those near sidings who never used rail or "had given up on rail service." So far, the railway has added three switches, each at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to accommodate new clients.
At the 39-store P.C. Richard & Son, trucks transport electronics and appliances, leaving idle the rail sidings near its clearance center in Deer Park and warehouse in Farmingdale.
The president and chief executive, Gary Richard, said it was too hard and too expensive to unload rail cars. "It just doesn't work anymore," he said.
Don't tell that to Mid-Island Wholesale Fruit & Produce. Last September, it moved into a building with an existing rail siding in Hicksville. "When I saw it, it was a big plus," said the owner, Craig Greissman.
After some hesitation, Mr. Greissman brought in a rail car stuffed with 125,000 pounds of potatoes from Idaho last month. Although delivery took two weeks, versus five days by truck, Mid-Island saved more than $2,000 on one shipment.
Still, there are those who doubt a rail freight resurgence here.
Lee Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said that besides technical issues, "It's very hard to recapture a market once it is lost. Couple that with the changing nature of the produce, there is less market share to garner."
Noted Mr. Pally: "It will never be a major part of Long Island transportation, but it can be a bigger player than it is now."

HEADLINE: Why Gasoline Costs More Here

BYLINE: By TODD SHAPERA

 BODY:
DRIVERS in Westchester may be wondering why record low oil prices have not translated into commensurate savings at the pump. By year's end, county drivers were paying $1.23 for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline, according to a survey of gas stations provided by the County Department of Weights and Measures. At the same time, the nationwide average retail price fell to 93.7 cents, the lowest inflation-adjusted level since record keeping began in 1920, according to the United States Department of Energy.
Moreover, Westchester drivers appear to be losing ground. While around the country the average price of unleaded regular gasoline fell 27.9 cents at the end of last year, average Westchester prices dropped only 17.3 cents. And pump prices here are not only well above the national average, they have also been the highest in the state outside of New York City. 
 Why? First, few drivers may know that the biggest single part of what they pay at the pump goes to Albany and the Federal Government. For every gallon of 87 octane gasoline, local drivers pay about 50 cents a gallon in Federal and state taxes. It is more tax than drivers pay in all but three states -- Connecticut, Hawaii and Nevada -- according to the American Petroleum Institute. Put 12 gallons in your car, and pay $6 in taxes. Drive 15,000 miles a year in a vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon, and you pay $375 in taxes.
Every driver in the United States pays 18.4 cents a gallon in Federal taxes, up from 4 cents in 1980. Then Westchester drivers pay nearly 32 cents a gallon in state and local taxes, 43 percent more than the 22.4 cent average for state taxes nationwide, according to American Petroleum Institute. How does the 32 cents a gallon break down? New York State taxes drivers, then taxes them again. There is 14 cents for the state's petroleum business tax (down from 14.6 cents last year), 8 cents for a state excise tax and another half cent for fuel testing and an oil-spill fund. Then Albany and the county government add sales tax onto the other tax, of 6.75 percent in most towns, which is at the low end. In Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and Yonkers, the state and county sales tax is 8.25 percent, the high end.
According to Leslie Bennett, Deputy Budget Director in the County Executive's Office, of those sales taxes, 4 percent goes to the state, 0.25 percent goes to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent goes to the county, depending on where the gas is sold. Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and Yonkers add 2.5 percent and White Plains levies 2 percent, making the city of White Plains' total tax 7.75 percent.
According to the study "How We Pay for Gasoline," published last year by the American Petroleum Institute, New York is one of only seven states collecting sales tax on gasoline purchases. And it is one of only four states to impose its sales tax on other state and Federal taxes. Consequently, while drivers nationwide pay, on average, one-third of their pump bill to the tax collector, the New York tax bite rises to 47 percent at $1.05 a gallon. Rayola Dougher, author of the "How We Pay" study, said: "Most people don't have a clue that almost half of what they are paying is tax. I wish they put it on the pump."
No wonder pump prices are lower in New Jersey. Taxes there are 16 cents a gallon less, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Massachusetts takes 8 cents less and Pennsylvania 4 cents. In Connecticut, though, drivers pay 3.5 cents more in state taxes than New York, even after a 4 cent cut last July, Ms. Dougher says.
Still, this tax burden explains only about 10 cents of the 29-cent difference between average county prices and the average national price at year end. And it does not explain at all why Westchester prices are higher than every county in New York State outside of those that make up New York City. In 1997, the State Attorney General issued weekly surveys of prices by county. Westchester gasoline prices were consistently higher than 10 upstate counties surveyed, as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties. (New York City was not included.)
As one example, on Labor Day weekend 1997, while the average gas price statewide for unleaded 87 octane was $1.36 a gallon, and was as low as $1.31 in Binghamton, Westchester drivers were paying $1.45. The Attorney General's office discontinued the survey last year. A spokesman for the Attorney General, Marc Violette, said that the office had no regulatory authority over gasoline prices, and that another state agency, the Energy Research and Development Authority, tracks those prices.
Still, picking random dates of April 27 and Sept. 14 last year, New York State prices were about 9 cents above the national average (which can be explained by the higher taxes). In Westchester, they were another 10 cents a gallon above the state's average price.
There seem to be several reasons why county residents pay more. A few pennies a gallon are raised because of environmental requirements in Westchester, Putnam and Rockland Counties as well as in New York City and on Long Island, which mandate oxygenated gasoline in winter months and reformulated gasoline in the summer. County station owners also face higher business costs (for labor, property and other taxes, repairs, and the like) than their Albany or Rochester counterparts. Moreover, in some regions like Rochester, American Indian station owners receive a partial tax break from the state, which they pass on to drivers, ultimately forcing down competitors' prices.
Then there is the role of the major oil companies. "Gasoline prices are influenced by what the market will bear," said Ben Brockwell, editor in chief at the Oil Price Information Service. He contends that the local market is more easily controlled by big companies because there is less competition from unbranded or independent operators.
Of about 430 stations in the county, Mobil's 70 stations account for one-fourth of all volume sold, Ida Walker, a Mobil spokeswoman, said. Mobil owns only 7 of those stations, however, she added, and franchisees set their own prices. Yet, in several interviews, Mobil and Texaco station operators said they are forced to buy the company's gasoline at prices higher than independent stations only blocks away sell their gas for.
Barbara Spruck, owner of the Mobil station in Pleasantville, said she has frequently complained to her Mobil sales representative about paying higher prices to Mobil than three nearby Coastal, Citgo and Getty stations sell gas for. "They are selling below my costs," she said. She said her Mobil sales representative replied that even so Ms. Spruck's station's volumes have not fallen. Ms. Spruck said any price decreases at her station in the last year have come only when Mobil has lowered her price. "When they go down 2 cents, I drop 2 cents," she said.
The Mobil station in Pleasantville survives, Ms. Spruck said, in part because of longevity and customer loyalty. The station has been in the community for 59 years and, she said, "Our customers know that what we charge is what we have to charge." Some motorists also believe in Mobil's brand value, she added. "They are people who won't put anything but Mobil in their car."
Mobil's prices fluctuate in part because Mobil does not charge all stations in the county the same price. "We don't price by county," Ms. Walker said. "We price by consumer market, based on buying behavior." While refusing to give specific details, she said Mobil divides Westchester County into several markets. "About half the county constitutes one consumer market, and there are various smaller markets."
Texaco's manager of strategic pricing, Shawn Carsten, refused to give specifics, saying only: "We never talk about strategies or price. It is proprietary information."
Although the major oil companies contribute to the high cost of gasoline in the county, they passed along the drop in domestic crude oil prices almost to the penny last year.
It works out like this: the decline in domestic crude to $11.30 a barrel in December from $18.30 a year earlier, represented a price decline for a gallon of crude of 16.7 cents. (There are 42 gallons in a barrel. So an $11.30 barrel works out to 26.9 cents a gallon, down from 43.6 cents.) Westchester drivers did slightly better, according to the county's survey, seeing their pump price fall 17.3 cents to $1.225 a gallon from $1.398 in December 1997.
Mr. Brockwell, the Oil Price Information Service editor in chief, said he feels that the major oil companies are making a healthy profit. By adding New York taxes to the roughly 39 cents a gallon wholesale price of unleaded regular gas in the region in December, the price becomes 89 cents. After adding a few pennies for delivery costs, a major company selling gasoline to stations for $1.11, as Mobil was earlier this month, is receiving a profit of 20 cents a gallon. "They are very nice profits," he said. He said the companies may be relying on that cushion to offset losses from the sharp drop in crude oil prices.
 
Is All Gas Really the Same, Somehow?
RON GOLDSTEIN, who changed his station from Sunoco to Coastal last year, said drivers who believe they are getting better gas by paying more for major brands, or that discount stations sell inferior quality, may be surprised to learn that it isn't so.
On a recent visit to Mr. Goldstein's Coastal station, the operator produced three receipts showing deliveries from the truck of an independent company's, Barrier Oil, which filled up at Mobil's terminal in Inwood, Queens, and Shell terminals in Brooklyn. He also said he has had deliveries that originated at Texaco terminals.
Ida Walker, a Mobil spokeswoman, disputed Mr. Goldstein's contention. "We don't sell Mobil gasoline to unbranded stations," she said, but she added, "gas is fungible, like white cake mix." Mobil sells gasoline to independent stations but with a generic additive, Ms. Walker said, which is different from Mobil's additive.
Referring to Mr. Goldstein, she said: "He may get gasoline from a terminal that we operate, but that doesn't mean he gets Mobil gasoline. Our additives make our gas our gas."
While the composition of the additive is a secret, Ms. Walker said it contains a detergent formula that helps engines run cleaner, a claim in Mobil advertisements. Ms. Walker said the Federal Trade Commissionrequired oil companies to have internal data to support such advertising.
Wayne Jeffers, president of Barrier Oil, based in Tarrytown, said: "Mobil may have its studies, but all gasoline additives have detergents. The Environmental Protection Agency requires it."
He supplies about 50 Citgo stations and 2 Coastal stations, including Mr. Goldstein's, which typically sell gas for less than the major companies. "Eighty-seven octane is 87 octane. If one oil company had a superior product they would advertise that their gasoline is the best. But they can't make those claims."
Although consumers have no way of knowing how an oil company's additive affects performance, if at all, the county's Department of Weights and Measures runs periodic tests to make sure that the octane rating is the same as that stated on the pump.
John Gaccione, a senior inspector at the department, said inspectors rarely find mislabeled gas. TODD SHAPERA

HEADLINE: In the Region / Long Island;
Riverhead Moves Ahead on Marketing Navy Site

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

 BODY:
LAST week, within five months of Riverhead's securing ownership of 2,550 acres at the Navy-owned Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in Calverton, the Town Board approved offers totaling $36 million on 1,625 acres of its property.
One of three interested buyers is Lazarus Burman Associates, a Syosset development group, which has offered to purchase the 525-acre industrial core of the property for $17 million. That portion contains 1.1 million square feet of industrial and office space and a 10,000-foot-long runway. 
 Landmark National, a developer of golf-oriented communities, is proposing to buy 800 acres for $13.6 million. It intends to build a 300-room hotel-conference center, two 18-hole courses and up to 300 single-family houses for buyers 55 and older to be grouped around the golf courses.
The group, which is based in New Albany, Ohio, has built several top-rated golf courses including Palm Beach Polo in Palm Beach, Fla., and PGA West in Palm Springs, Calif. In Riverhead, it intends to spend more than $30 million just on the two golf courses said Spencer M. Waxman, a vice president of the company.
The third potential buyer is NHL Skate, an affiliate of the Mentmore Holdings Corporation of Manhattan, a conglomerate that owns steel, life insurance, entertainment and development companies, among others. It has proposed building a baseball stadium, a sports complex and a family entertainment center on 300 acres, for which it would pay $5.4 million.
Last week, the Riverhead Town Board authorized the Riverhead Development Corporation, a board consisting of town residents and regional business leaders experienced in real estate development, to draw up sales contracts with all three entities. Offers are all-cash, with no financing contingencies.
Public hearings will be held on each proposal before closings.
It has been almost three years since Northrop Grumman closed its operations at the 5,900-acre Calverton site. Its departure eliminated hundreds of high-paying jobs and ended the military contractor's $1 million annual payment in lieu of property taxes to the town of Riverhead.
Still to be transferred by the Navy to Riverhead's Community Development Agency are 350 acres which will be conveyed once the Navy completes an environmental cleanup.
The remaining 3,000 acres of Navy property will be turned over to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and will become a nature preserve. That land had been used as a buffer zone around the former aircraft manufacturing complex that Grumman had occupied for almost 40 years, leasing it from the Navy to build and test fighter aircraft.
"The town feels it is on the brink ofsignificant economic development and the impact is expected to be far-reaching throughout the county," said Andrea H. Lohneiss, the director of Riverhead's Community Development Agency, referring to the proposals for the town's property.
THE Grumman operation, which at one time employed 3,000 people, drew its labor force from a radius of at least 30 miles, Ms. Lohneiss noted, "so the town never anticipated this being a benefit only to the town in terms of job creation."
A 20-year strategy to devise new uses for the property was developed for the town in 1996 by Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, a Manhattan real estate and economic consulting firm. It lays out a mixed-use planned development with a 525-acre industrial park -- the portion Lazarus Burman has offered to buy -- at its core.
The firm projected that within five years, 2,200 jobs with an annual payroll of $25.7 million would be created, and that within 20 years, 6,400 people with a total annual payroll of $78.5 million would be at work at the former Northrop Grumman site. Annual property taxes were projected to reach $1.7 million in five years, and $3.1 million in 20 years.
The industrial park would include the existing buildings and allow for construction of up to 2 million square feet of additional office and industrial space.
The 10,000-foot runway, the longer of two airstrips Grumman had used, would be used only for the aviation-related needs of the industrial users, and not for commercial flights.
Of the remaining 2,375 acres, 410 are part of the Pine Barrens and can never be developed.
The balance would be devoted to leisure and tourism-oriented uses including golf, and to public parks. The plan also called for a hotel and conference center.
The town began marketing its Enterprise Park at Calverton, as it has named the property, before receiving ownership, but a previous deal for the 525-acre industrial park fell through. A $17 million purchase offer from First Industrial Realty Trust was accepted by the town last June, but the Chicago-based real estate investment trust, which had a 120-day period to study the market and other factors, backed out last month.
Peter F. Murphy, the managing director of First Industrial's eastern region, said the company had unsucessfully tried to attract a major tenant and had ultimately decided to withdraw from the deal because it felt that it could not make a sufficient return on its investment.
Last year Mentmore Development, another affiliate of Mentmore Holdings, the parent company of NHL Skate, had offered to buy the entire Calverton site for $35 million plus a share to the town of future profits, but town officials favored the First Industrial offer.
Once the three current transactions are completed, the town will still have about 200 acres available for sale, Ms. Lohneiss of the Community Development Agency said. Prices range from $17,000 to $20,000 an acre. The remainder of the property will be used for parks, open space and buffer areas.
While searching for purchasers, the town also sought tenants for the existing buildings. Annual asking rents are in the $4 to $4.75 a square foot range for the industrial space, and $10 a square foot for the office space.
BY preleasing space before a sale, the town felt it could offer a potential purchaser an immediate return on investment, making the project less speculative, said Jack O'Connor, the president of Grubb & Ellis/Island Realty of Melville, the brokerage firm that is helping the town market the property.
A 300,200-square-foot building, the largest in the industrial complex, contains the remains of Flight 800, the TWA airliner that exploded off the South Shore in July 1996. The building is leased to the National Transportation Safety Board on a year-to-year basis and the agency can elect to vacate the structure with three months' notice.
Two additional rental transactions with 10-year leases are close to being signed, Mr. O'Connor said. One, a woodworking company and furniture manufacturer, would occupy 65,000 square feet. The other, a boat builder, wants 30,000 square feet. Negotiations for additional deals totaling 100,000 square feet are also under way, he added.
Ms. Lohneiss said the Calverton property had many advantages for potential users. Its buildings are in excellent condition, she said, and it has a railroad spur that could be reactivated for freight. Furthermore, Ms. Lohneiss said, last June, Gov. George E. Pataki designated 1,248 of the 2,900 acres an Economic Development Zone within which industrial and commercial tenants and owners receive a variety of tax reductions and other cost-cutting incentives. Companies within the Economic Development Zone get reduced utility rates, sales-tax exemptions on construction materials, tax credits for job creation, and a seven-year property tax abatement on new construction or improvements. Thereafter, tax increases are phased in over three years.
Ms. Lohneiss also pointed out that the Navy, before transferring ownership, had completed a full environmental review based on the reuse plan, and that a rezoning of the entire property to allow the various uses could be in place as early as April. Those two processes often delay new development for months if not years.
For local residents, success of the park is vital, said William D. Talmage, a developer whose family has lived in the town for five generations.
"This is so important to Riverhead because we are caught in the middle," he said. "We don't have the industrial and office space development to the west, and we don't have the second-home mansions to the east. We are kind of a no-man's land, and our taxes are killing us."

HEADLINE: Yonkers Bias Case, the 'Ongoing Saga'

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
IN retrospect, Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan may have spoken prematurely last December when he predicted that two decades of frustration over housing desegregation here would soon draw to a close.
"There will, at long last, be an end to this phase of the ongoing saga," said the judge, who has been the umpire since 1980 when the United States Department of Justice sued Yonkers, saying that it intentionally discriminated against minorities in housing and schools. 
 The cause of Judge Sands' optimism was an agreement by the state to pay some of the cost of integrating housing in Yonkers -- an outcome that had been sought by both the Mayor's office and leaders of the Yonkers branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
But less than two months later, the on-again, off-again alliance between the city and the N.A.A.C.P. is clearly off again, with an escalating war of words over who should benefit from the new housing.
"Money is not the issue anymore," said Symra D. Brandon, an N.A.A.C.P. member and a City Councilwoman representing parts of Yonkers' west side. "Now there are deeper concerns at stake."
The housing agreement affords no explicit advantages to black and Hispanic residents over whites, although there are preferences in the plan for people who live in subsidized or public housing in southwest Yonkers, many of them who are nonwhite.
Mayor John D. Spencer has said that the point of the agreement is to provide housing to anyone who meets the income qualifications, regardless of race, and he has been interested as well in making housing available to the city's firefighters and police officers. In an interview last week he reiterated his view that the agreement was "not about color."
But the N.A.A.C.P. says that the implicit point of the case has always been to help poor Hispanic residents and blacks move from the city's west side to its predominantly white and more prosperous east side.
In an interview, Kenneth W. Jenkins, a past president of the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter and now a member of its board of directors, described Yonkers' efforts as "abysmal" and "unacceptable" in the two years since city officials persuaded the Federal government to give them more control over the housing program.
And Leonard Buddington Jr., the N.A.A.C.P. branch's president, said, "What we've gotten from the city is a lot of promises and little action."
City officials say, however, that in the last two years they have made 171 units of affordable housing available to those who qualify, and Mayor Spencer says there will soon be more units. The N.A.A.C.P. says, however, that the numbers are not that high because some of those housing units are not yet ready for occupancy. The city's records for 1997 and last year show that 42 percent of the affordable units went to blacks, 42 percent went to Hispanic residents and the rest went to whites and other racial groups like Asians.
But critics say that the numbers failed to paint an accurate picture because the housing is not going to the poorest people.
Mr. Buddington is particularly concerned that only seven of the housing units allotted so far have gone to the people for whom the N.A.A.C.P. originally sought relief -- minority residents of the city's low- and moderate-income housing whom the Federal Government has designated as top-priority clients for the program. Other units have gone to people who meet the income qualifications but have significantly higher household income.
For example, Mr. Buddington and Mr. Jenkins have questioned the case of Rhonda Lewis Warren and her husband, Tammie, a black couple who received a housing grant under the program to buy a $155,000, four-bedroom house in the Runyon Heights section of the city, a middle- and upper-class black neighborhood on the predominantly white east side.
"I took advantage of an opportunity that was presented and ran with it," Mrs. Warren said in an interview, adding that the program made it possible for her family to make a larger down payment.
The N.A.A.C.P. officials -- acknowledging that their position was not a popular one -- said that moving a minority couple from an apartment in Runyon Heights to a house in Runyon Heights -- the same segregated neighborhood -- although on the east side, did not advance the cause of desegregation.
Even though Mr. Spencer has deemed the program "a stunning success" under his leadership, he acknowledged that only a few west side residents responded to the city's publicity about the housing opportunities, which included letters and brochures sent to people living in subsidized housing.
"If people don't apply or they don't qualify economically, that's not our fault," the Mayor said. "Nor can we turn away others who qualify but are in the category of second or third priority."
Mr. Jenkins of the N.A.A.C.P. said, however, that the city should do more to alert the poorest residents about the housing opportunities, including advertisements in local newspapers and on cable television.
The amount of assistance available to families depends on income, with families earning less than 50 percent of the Westchester median income eligible for as much as $20,000. In 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, the Westchester County Department of Planning lists the median household income as $61,861 in 1996. Those earning between 50 and 80 percent of the median can receive as much as $15,000. And households earning between 80 and 100 percent of the median income can receive $10,000.
In an attempt to resolve the disagreements without formally returning to court, Joseph M. Pastore Jr., one of the court-appointed monitors in the case, said a meeting was being scheduled, probably within the next several weeks, with the judge, N.A.A.C.P. representatives and officials from the Mayor's office.
Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Buddington said in interviews that if the results of the meeting did not satisfy them, they would officially take the case back to the judge.
"Right now, today, this case is far from over," said "Judge Sand and the Mayor think it's over, but it's not."
Responding to that comment in another interview, the Mayor said: "Be my guest! I'll see them in court."
Such heated language has not been unusual over the 20-year history of the desegregation fight, particularly after the City Council voted in August 1988 to reject a court-ordered housing desegregation plan in defiance of the judge's threat of imposing heavy fines.
But more recently, the language used by all the parties involved in the case has been more accommodating.
Both the city and the N.A.A.C.P. applauded Judge Sand's finding in February last year that the state -- and not just Yonkers -- was responsible for segregated patterns of housing because the New York Urban Development Corporation in the 1960's and 70's built many of its low-income apartments in the southwest section of the city.
In December, the state agreed to pay $16.4 million to help Yonkers build new housing and buy existing homes for black and Hispanic families and other income-qualified buyers. The settlement committed the state over the next five years to pay $7.5 million for 600 single-family homes and condominiums, including subsidies of as much as $20,000 for the lowest-earning families for down payments, closing costs and repairs.
Under the agreement, the state will also have to pay $6.4 million for building 118 new houses and rental apartments in three locations in Yonkers -- Yonkers Avenue, Hoover Road and East Grassy Sprain Road. Yonkers is about to break ground on a fourth site required by the Federal Court order, 22 homes on Cross Street.
Besides the housing issues, there are also unresolved issues affecting the educational phase of the court order, in particular how to remove vestiges of segregation that remain in the classroom.
In 1980, the United States Justice Department, which was later joined by the N.A.A.C.P., accused Yonkers of intentionally maintaining segregated schools by confining black and Hispanic families to the southwestern section of the city.
The city implemented the first phase of school desegregation in 1986 and recently began what it called its Educational Improvement Plan, Part 2.

Another Link for Barnegat Bay's 'Emerald Necklace'

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
FOR the last two years there have been competing visions for the 365 acres of salt marsh and woodlands that jut into Barnegat Bay in Berkeley Township in Ocean County. But the matter was resolved earlier this month when the Trust for Public Land, bought the site from the local representative of a Dallas land investor, insuring that it will never be turned into housing.
Using money raised by county residents for preservation purposes, the trust, a national nonprofit conservation group, paid $771,250 for the site, known as Good Luck Point. It is among the 16 parcels totaling some 1,575 acres that the trust has purchased over the last three years or will soon purchase to create what it calls "an emerald necklace" along the western shore of Barnegat Bay. 
 The trust has conveyed the Good Luck Point site, at the mouth of the Toms River, to the county, which will manage it as a wildlife habitat with public access to the water.
The time it took to negotiate the deal underscores the fact that, in contrast to the site's name, it takes a lot more than luck to realize such purchases today. Just as New Jersey's economy and real estate market have grown stronger, so has the competition between developers and conservation groups to buy land. And the cost of land has risen over the last two years.
The increase varies depending on location. Peter Matone, a principal at Welsh Chester Galiney Matone, a real estate advisory firm in Morristown, said the average price of a quarter-acre lot in Ocean and Monmouth Counties rose 6 to 10 percent over the last two years to $65,000 to $75,000; in Middlesex County, the price rose 10 to 14 percent to $75,000 to $100,000 and in Essex County, the price rose 14 to 20 percent to $100,000 to $150,000.
"It is definitely a seller's market today given the increase in demand for land and the shortage of supply," said John Schilp, president of Schilp & Company, a residential and land brokerage in Chester.
New Jersey residents responded last November by supporting in a referendum the state's largest conservation effort, the first time the state established a stable source of paying for land.
Under it the state will spend nearly $1 billion over the next decade, or $98 million a year in state tax revenues, to buy a million acres of undeveloped land and retire bonds. It also gives the state the authority to issue an additional $1 billion in bonds for preservation purposes.
At the same time, residents of six counties and 45 municipalities also voted to pay a little more in property taxes to acquire open space or to increase the open-space taxes they currently pay. The state now has 98 municipalities and 13 counties with open space taxes -- including Ocean County, which established its tax of 1.2 cents per $100 of assessment in 1997, collecting some $4 million for preservation purposes since its implementation on Jan. 1, 1998. On a $100,000 home, the annual tax would amount to $12.
Typically, the Trust for Public Land contracts to buy land and uses public and private funds to consummate a transaction. It then conveys the property to a public entity.
Given today's economic realities these additional financing sources "give us the capacity to stay in the game and compete," said John Klevins, senior project manager at the Morristown office of the Trust for Public Land, who negotiated the purchase of the Good Luck Point site. The area has seen significant development and is threatened with more, Mr. Klevins said, adding: "Without the county funding the property may have been lost."
The statewide referendum approved by New Jersey voters Nov. 3 will replenish the state's 37-year old Green Acres Program, which has been the main source of funds to state, county and local government agencies for preservation projects. Since its creation the program has raised $1.39 billion in nine voter-approved bond issues to preserve 922,000 acres of open space, including farmland.
With a stable funding source in place "we are now sorting out how to promote ourselves in so competitive an environment," said Dennis B. Davidson, deputy administrator of the program within the state's Department of Environmental Protection. He said the first $98 million in funding is expected to be available the middle of the summer.
The additional supply of public money, however, has resulted in one unwelcome side effect -- the perception by sellers that the state will be willing to pay more for land.
"It is obviously on people's minds," Mr. Davidson said. "Sellers we didn't buy from before because we were unwilling to pay their purchase price are calling us now because they know there is money."
WILL such beliefs lead sellers to hold out for unrealistic prices and, in turn, cause rising land prices to rise even further? Mr. Davidson said he did not think so because the state pays only fair market prices for land. The same is true for conservation groups.
But a key advantage over other buyers, particularly developers, who may offer to pay higher prices "is that we come to the table with cash," Mr. Davidson said. Moreover, he added, buyers of land for conservation purposes do not require approvals on parcels, as a developer might in today's tight market, speeding the sales process.
And there are also tax benefits, said Mr. Klevins, such as Federal income-tax savings if a landowner donates all or part of his land for preservation. In other situations, there could be savings on capital gains or inheritance taxes.
Moreover, said David F. Moore, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, a private nonprofit land trust in Far Hills, even in the face of rising real estate prices there is "a growing sensitivity toward preservation" in so crowded a state as New Jersey.
All those factors played a part in a recently completed transaction by the conservation foundation, which specializes in farmland preservation. Under it the foundation purchased a 150-acre farm in Washington Township in Morris County from a developer who planned to build houses on it.
The foundation then sold the development rights to a conservation group in the county under the state's Green Acres program and in a tax-free land swap traded the farm with a deed restricting it to farming to the owner of a 278-acre farm in Hardwick Township in Warren County. The new owner, who plans to use the Morris County site as a horse farm, is able to defer the capital gains tax on the sale of his Warren County farm until he sells the Morris County farm, said Mr. Moore.
The development rights on the Warren County farm were then sold to a local conservation group and the farm itself was sold with deed restrictions to a private owner, Mr. Moore said. "In the end we saved two farms for the roughly $1.5 million we paid for one," he added, noting that additional money from Warren County's open-space trust fund solidified the deal.
Having money available from Ocean County's trust fund was critical to the purchase of the Good Luck Point site, which was zoned for several hundred housing units, and was part of a larger property owned by the developer, Lifetime Homes.
The 365-acre site acquired by the trust comprises three separate parcels. On land abutting the largest parcel, approvals are being sought to build 367 active-adult homes. Ninety town houses are to be developed on land between the two smaller parcels. Mr. Klevins said his organization got involved in the purchase of the Good Luck Point site "because of the public outcry against continued development in the area."
The area is an important bird migration and wintering spot along the Atlantic Flyway. Birds found at the site, include the endangered peregrine falcon and threatened American bittern, bald eagle and osprey.
Sixty percent of the Good Luck Point site contains wetlands, which under state law cannot be developed. Given that and the local sentiment, Mr. Kevins said, "we offered the developer a price that made sense to sell the 365 acres." He added that his group closed last Thursday on a $1.7 million purchase from AT&T of an additional 375 acres south of Good Luck Point, in Lacey Township. He said the trust would use state, Federal and private sources to finance the purchase.
Mr. Davidson of the Green Acres Program sees such partnerships as an effective way to stretch state dollars and compete for large land purchases. "We're not afraid to attack the big land deals," he said, adding that buying a 1,000-acre parcel preserves it from becoming "a bunch of five-acre lots."

HEADLINE: How One Man Fights City Hall

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK

 BODY:
THE characters and interests that run this city of 17,000 City Hall and school board, landlords, politicians -- are all intertwined. Robert L. Sanders keeps tugging at the twine.
Mr. Sanders, 66, soft-spoken and not quite portly, often rises at City Council meetings to ask why the state's offer of redevelopment aid has been tabled. He is better known, though, for irritating the school board. 
 "I'm the one they arrested for taking videos," Mr. Sanders offered pleasantly. That was in November 1997, when he was thrown out of a Board of Education meeting that he was taping with a video camera. Arrested on a disorderly conduct charge, he was led out in handcuffs.
A judge dismissed the charge against Mr. Sanders. Later, the board's lawyer and three members were removed from office for other reasons.
Mr. Sanders and his wife, Cleo, moved to their four-bedroom frame house 31 years ago but paid little attention to city politics until recently, after Mr. Sanders retired from his job as area plant manager for Bell Atlantic. Their daughter, Sheree, an A student at Asbury Park High School, entered Delaware State University and nearly flunked out, and Mr. Sanders concluded "There's no education going on here."
Mr. Sanders's retirement also allowed time for the Homeowners Association, an unsuccessful City Council candidacy and regular attention to City Hall.
He discovered Asbury Park while stationed at Fort Monmouth. "Every chance you got, you went to Asbury," he recalled, "to the beach, the theaters, the clubs."
When Bell Atlantic hired him and asked where the area office should be, he chose Asbury Park. "It was such a beautiful city," he said. "We had elaborate movie houses, hundreds of thousands of people came to town every weekend, and you had some of the best clubs in the world."
Then, he said, ineptitude and corruption devastated the downtown and cost the city its golf course, water works and sanitation department.
"A lot of people got rich on this poor little town," he said, "a lot of people who don't live here."
After years of strangled hopes for the city's recovery, he said, "last summer, the state gave us the best offer we had; everybody was for it, and you see where we're at." LAURA MANSNERUS

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT;
As Aid Is Reduced, the Rodent Problem Explodes in Urban Areas

BYLINE: By KIRSTY SUCATO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
Henry Jones, an exterminator for the Camden County Health Department, could smell the rats as soon as he entered the dilapidated East Camden row house on Wednesday morning.
A breathtaking, acrid odor, something like a combination of urine and rotten food. Mr. Jones followed the stench through the darkened living room, where a young woman sat nursing a 2-week-old infant, to the kitchen, where the linoleum floor was worn away in large, damp patches and the sink brimmed with dishes clotted with a white, pasty batter. There, behind the stove, which was thickly crusted with burned food and aluminum foil, lay a large, dead rat, killed by poison left by Mr. Jones and his rodent control team a week before. 
 Nyesha Cherry, who rents the house on North 22d Street with the young mother, who is her sister, and their three brothers, told the men she had found four other dead rats "the size of kittens" in the kitchen during the past week. Her landlord had ignored her complaints of scrabbling noises, chewed clothing, rodent droppings and finally a live rat in the dining room. So she called the county health department.
"Somebody has got to get the rats out of here," she said.
The four-member Camden County Rodent Control team is the last line of defense for the residents of Camden and 57 surrounding municipalities. From Monday to Friday they respond to a never-ending supply of agitated callers. The complaints are just as likely to come from wealthy suburbs like Cherry Hill and Pennsauken, where bird feeders and restaurant dumpsters provide food for the ubiquitous scavengers. With complaints growing each year, the officers know they are fighting a losing battle.
It was not always this way. In the early 1970's, Federal assistance allowed Camden to hire 20 health education workers who conducted door-to-door inspections, lectured in schools and day-care centers and organized block-cleaning awards. The idea was to teach residents how to prevent rat infestations by keeping food and garbage tightly sealed and repairing cracks and broken windows where rodents enter homes. Poisoning is a last resort, Mr. Jones said. Rats always rebound where there is food and shelter, often in greater numbers.
"Sanitation and education is what keeps the rats down in the long term," he said. "The killing of rats is always the last thing. But now it's just the killing, and education as far as we can."
In the 1970's and early 1980's, the Federal Government gave New Jersey as much as $2 million a year for urban rodent control programs. But the aid ended in the early 1980's, when the responsibility for rodent control was transferred from the United States Public Health Service to the Department of Agriculture. Since 1993, New Jersey has spent only $177,000 a year for rodent control programs in four cities: Camden, Paterson, Newark and Jersey City. The money comes from a Federal block grant for preventive health services, leaving rat control to compete with other priorities like childhood immunizations and hypertension screening, said David Adam, of the State Department of Health and Human Services.
But the rats pose a significant public health threat. As well as causing fear and revulsion, they carry bacterial diseases like salmonella and leptospirosis, which can cause illness and even death. Norway rats, most common in New Jersey, are host to disease-carrying ticks and fleas. They also cause economic damage like house fires by gnawing through electrical cables
Rats can survive on almost any food, including waste in sewers, and they need only a half-inch crack to enter any dwelling, where they scurry along the walls, urinating and defecating more than 100 times a day. But surprisingly little is known about the extent of the damage they cause. Bruce A. Colvin, an environmental consultant and rat expert, said there is currently not a single Federal or academic study into the habits of urban rats in the United States, although there are thought to be as many rats as people. He said their numbers seem to be increasing even as state and Federal assistance to eliminate them decreases, but there is little scientific data to prove it.
"The vast majority of the public has just been left to fend for itself," Mr. Colvin said. "This is really a national issue and it is an issue of national shame."
Camden's $500,000-a-year program, financed mainly by county taxpayers, is one of the best in the state. Many cities, including Atlantic City, East Orange, Passaic and Plainfield, do not even have rodent control units. Homeowners and municipalities must hire private pest control companies, which tend to focus on extermination rather than prevention, Mr. Adam said.
Paterson's program was so poorly financed that it stopped for several years, resuming only last year. The hiatus prompted Assemblywoman Nellie Poe, a Democrat, to ask the State Legislature to spend an extra $336,000 for rat control in the four cities this year. The bill was approved by the Assembly Health Committee on Jan. 21 and now heads to the Assembly Appropriations Committee for consideration.
But the Assemblywoman acknowledged that even the additional aid was not enough.
"I am sure that if research is done we would come upon other areas that are in just as much need," she said. "But this is a step in the right direction."
The Camden team will probably continue to spend most days visiting the sites of known rat infestation, where Miguel Nunez, an exterminator, drops plastic bags filled with Telon, a bright blue-green poison pellet, into rat holes. The characteristic burrows are about the circumference of a baseball, often capped with soggy layers of garbage.
On Morton Street in the Whitman Park section, the holes were at the grassy edge of a badly cracked sidewalk littered with glistening plastic wrappers and wet cardboard. Nearby, a vacant lot between two narrow houses was piled high with brush and garbage: plastic juice bottles, candy wrappers, sheets of green felt and a jar of creamy pesto sauce. The unmistakable smell of rats lingered in the air. "It is certainly going to get worse if they don't curtail it," said Ralph Green, the principal sanitarian for Camden County. "It should be more preventative. They need to put more resources into it. We've become reactionary now."

Winners and Losers in the Governor's Budget

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
After years of trimming various projects and programs, Governor Whitman offered a budget last week that recommends spending a little more here and a little more there for the second year in a row.
The strong economy is largely responsible for this largess. Hundreds of millions of dollars in additional tax revenue is pouring into the state's already overflowing coffers, giving Mrs. Whitman more than $1.1 billion to spend in the fiscal year starts July 1. 
 As a result, state workers do not have to worry about layoffs. And low-income elderly residents who participate in the state-subsidized prescription program need not be concerned about rising co-payments.
"This is a Christmas budget," said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County who wore a necktie festooned with Santa Claus for the Governor's annual budget address to lawmakers. "Everyone should be happy with it."
Mrs. Whitman is not recommending that every dime get spent in the $19.16 billion budget. She proposes keeping $750 million in the state's rainy day fund should the economy bottom out.
She has also recommended giving $200 million back to property tax payers with the property tax relief program she announced earlier this month. By Labor Day, she said, she hoped to get checks averaging about $200 to homeowners. Under her five-year plan, the rebates would increase every year until 2002, when they would reach an average of $600.
Is there any more in this budget that the average taxpayer can count on putting back in his wallet? What about all of this extra spending? How will it benefit residents?
Of course, not everyone thinks that spending increases are appropriate and prudent. Some fiscal conservatives say they think Mrs. Whitman should be salting away more money to pay down the state's debt or cover the eventual $1 billion annual price tag for her property tax plan.
At the same time, there are many people who say she is not spending enough in some areas -- from social services to road repairs. Take public schools, for example. Of the $1.1 billion more to spend in the coming fiscal year, more than $300 million in new assistance has been proposed for schools. Not all school districts are happy.
Two-thirds of the state's school districts would see state aid go up or remain the same. But the other districts were notified that their aid will decline, which could cause property taxes to rise in some towns.
Mrs. Whitman's budget is just a proposal at this point. The General Assembly and the Senate, both controlled by Republicans, need to look it over and vote on it before it becomes law. While Mr. Collins and other Republican leaders say they think the budget is likely to receive bipartisan support, no one can remember a state budget that was not changed, at least at the margins.
Here is a look at how Mrs. Whitman's proposals might affect residents:
COLLEGE STUDENTS Those enrolled in the state's public colleges or universities might want to question any significant tuition increases. They might also want to ask whether the school is getting a new library, classrooms or gymnasium in a few years. The proposed budget includes a net increase of $70 million over last year's budget, including $12.4 million to help colleges cover some of their borrowing costs for deferred maintenance and capital projects.
SENIOR CITIZENS There is $10.3 million for a new initiative aimed at offering alternatives to seniors who do not want to move into a nursing home. For example, one alternative would include a new caregiver assistance program, which would allow payments to help certain family caregivers purchase at-home care services for a senior citizen who otherwise might be in a nursing home.
TAXES In addition to the property tax rebates, the new budget includes enough money so that 200,000 low-income New Jerseyans would be excused from paying state income tax. The budget also includes extra money for a new program that freezes property tax rates for senior citizens.
PARKS In addition to the borrowed money that voters approved last year to preserve open space, there is $3.5 million to hire 100 additional full-time and seasonal park rangers and maintenance staff for 52 state parks, forests and recreation areas. Another $10 million will be made available to municipalities and counties to develop local parks.
HEALTH INSURANCE There is $10.2 million more to expand the subsidized health care program for children, called KidCare. The extra dollars would increase the eligibility requirements so that a family of four earning up to $57,575 a year could enroll. The program would also make the program available for those who have not had health care insurance for 6 months, rather than 12 months. The change means that 6,000 more children are expected to enroll.
CRIME To give county prosecutors more access to DNA testing, the budget includes $380,000 for DNA testing to investigate and prosecute crimes.

Bridging a 'Generation Next' Gap

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y.

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, Pepsi-Cola was marking its 100th anniversary, but no amount of corporate merrymaking could conceal the problems plaguing the brand. Bottlers attending a company extravaganza in Hawaii spent much of their time fuming about Pepsi ads, particularly one set to the Rolling Stones song "Brown Sugar." Pepsi was losing market share to its perennial rival, Coca-Cola Classic. And it was going through an identity crisis. Just who was supposed to be buying it -- teen-agers? Generation X'ers? Retirees?
Now, however, there's been a changing of the guard within the streamlined, art-covered walls of Pepsico headquarters here in Purchase. Among the newcomers is Dawn Hudson, whose many tasks as chief of marketing for Pepsi-Cola North America include overseeing the creation of a new slogan for Pepsi -- one that will stake out the elusive middle ground between uncool and too cool. 
 Ms. Hudson has tackled the task with an old-fashioned thoroughness that critics say had been sadly lacking at the company: a lot of brainstorming, formal research, consumer testing and revisiting everything to squeeze out every last drop of improvement. "I think we're very close to having something good that knits the brand back together," said Ms. Hudson, 40, who even in business attire exudes an outdoorsy manner. Until recently, she added, "Pepsi had a history of changing too frequently and getting schizophrenic."
The new slogan remains top secret. It will be introduced to the public in March, and will replace the two-year-old "Generation next," which is widely maligned for conveying a hip image that alienated older Pepsi drinkers.
After nearly two decades in advertising, Ms. Hudson was hired in 1996 by Roger A. Enrico, Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, to head up the marketing of Frito-Lay products. Last year, she was named to her current job, replacing Brian R. Swette, who left after Philip A. Marineau, the president of Pepsi-Cola North America, made remarks suggesting that "Generation next" would soon be put out to pasture.
Her quick ascent marks Ms. Hudson as a rising star within Pepsico; she is whispered to be one of the few who might run it one day. And it is no secret why the company took such a shine to her. As an executive with DDB Needham, the advertising agency, she developed a campaign for Frito-Lay's Rold Gold pretzels, including television commercials starring the "Seinfeld" actor Jason Alexander, that pumped up the company's market share from 11 percent to 30 percent.
"They really put it on the map," recalls Steven S Reinemund, chairman and chief executive of Frito-Lay. "She's a very smart and pragmatic marketer who gets things done."
And she appears to manage that without losing her perspective or sense of humor. During an interview late last month, her two daughters, 8 and 1, arriving for a holiday party, ran in and out of her office. Several assistants, some secretaries dressed in sequined holiday garb and a job candidate who had arrived too early for his interview also burst in. She remained calm throughout, smiling frequently as she discussed Pepsi's marketing priorities, sometimes with both children balanced on her lap.
People at the company know, however, that beneath her tranquil surface lurks a highly competitive player. Within Pepsi's Mountain Dew division, she has earned the code name Leopard.
In her spare time, Ms. Hudson reads, skis, plays tennis and visits child-friendly places like the zoo. She is married to Bruce Beach, the president of an executive-search firm. Her home in Bronxville, N.Y., is just a short hop from Pepsico, and Ms. Hudson is often home on weeknights, watching "The Brady Bunch" with Morgan, her 8-year-old. A year ago she gave birth to Kendall, whose name, she likes to point out, was not chosen to curry favor with Donald M. Kendall, a co-founder and former chairman of Pepsico.
Her whole career, she says, was something she just fell into. After graduating from Dartmouth College as an English and economics major, she took a job in the school's fund-raising office. Walking across the campus one day, she ran into a friend who told her that an advertising agency was interviewing prospects that afternoon. With no appointment, and with a hastily typed resume, Ms. Hudson waited on the doorstep until someone agreed to talk to her.
She got the job, with Compton Advertising, since absorbed by Saatchi & Saatchi. "I tried it, and I loved it," she recalls. A few years later she landed at DDB Needham, where she eventually became a managing partner.
 THE eldest of three sisters growing up in Winchester, Mass., Ms. Hudson early on felt a desire to prove herself in a way that would be distinct from what her parents (in law and banking) had done. "You want to chart your own course," she said.
Unlike many other marketers, she shuns jargon. And she is known for sitting down with company reports and examining every page, crossing out hackneyed adjectives and cringing, she says, over "anything that reeks of hyperbole."
What she does like, though, is clever marketing.
A summer '99 promotion for Pepsi, built around the latest installment in the "Star Wars" series, has impressed her. "What's critical is how we leverage it in a way that gets our brands moving," she said. She plans to push hard to make Pepsi available in places large and small, with the formation of a "channel strategy group" that examines where consumers shop and what kinds of products, as well as package size and shape, they prefer. And marketing to the 8- to-12-year-old set is a priority. "We're absolutely going to look at preteens," she said.
Ms. Hudson counsels her marketing team to "work hard, play hard," on the theory that if they don't have lives outside the office, their performance at Pepsi will suffer. "Part of being a good marketer," she said, "is just being a regular person."

The Battle Is On: Whose Kids Need the Most Help?

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR

 BODY:
In doling out about $4 million a year to the city's many youth groups, the Department of Youth and Community Development has used something called the Fair Share Formula since 1983.
But critics say that the formula is anything but fair. Based largely on 1980 Census data, the formula, they say, is outdated and flawed and has led to gross inequities. 
 For that reason, the department asked the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York to recommend improvements, which it did last summer. There are actually nine proposed formulas, ranging from one that looks just at the population of young people in a community district to others that weigh such factors as the number of teen-age mothers.
With the department set to decide on a new formula next month, leaders of some of the city's 59 community boards are blasting the new options.
Craig Hammerman, district manager for Brooklyn's Community Board 6, which covers a region from Cobble Hill and Park Slope to Carroll Gardens and Red Hook, said his district's portion would drop to around $40,000 from just over $70,000 under any of the new formulas.
"It means that good groups that have good programs are going to be punished," he said.
One of those groups is the St. Francis Xavier Action Youth Center, a nonsectarian program in Park Slope that offers after-school programs involving arts and crafts, homework tutoring, basketball and leadership training.
"We are really going to suffer," said Dr. Annette Hall, the center's executive director, noting that the $11,500 her group received last year -- about 15 percent of its revenue -- might be halved.
But Robert Mascali, the department's assistant commissioner, pointed out inequities in the current formula, under which Brooklyn's Board 6 gets $4.51 per child but Board 13, in Coney Island, gets $2.08 per child.
"What sense does this make?" he asked.
An even greater difference: Community Board 1 in downtown Manhattan now gets $26 per child, while Community Board 8 on the Upper East Side gets $2.
"These numbers have to be revised," Mr. Mascali said. "Populations have changed. We are talking 1980."
The existing formula uses several factors -- the number of children, the number of families on welfare, the number of single parents and the number of unemployed youths -- to determine a community's share. It also sets a $40,000 minimum share per district.
The authors of the new formulas favor using housing and vacancy surveys, which are conducted every three years, instead of census data, which are collected only once a decade. They also prefer shedding the $40,000 minimum, and claim that statistics like the number of school dropouts and admissions to juvenile detention centers are better indicators of need than such economic factors as the number of families on welfare.
The best approach, said Timothy Ross, one of the authors, "is to send the money where the problems are."
But others are upset. If the $40,000 minimum is dropped, said Paul Goldstein, the district manager of Community Board 1 in Manhattan, "they may as well tell our kids to go play in the Hudson River."
And while Community Board 1 in Staten Island may get more money under a new formula, the board's district manager, Joe Carroll, still detects an overall problem.
"There is," he said, "just not enough money." RICHARD WEIR

Not So Fly (for This White Guy)

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS CENTURY; Douglas Century is the author of "Street Kingdom," an account of street life in Brooklyn, to be published next month by Warner Books.

 BODY:
ON a recent wintry morning, walking a desolate strip of Flatbush Avenue in downtown Brooklyn, I heard a baritone voice growl my name, followed by an emphatic, "Yo! What's the deal?" The menacing bark emanated from the driver's side of a passing Mercury Sable, the tinted window of which was now rapidly descending.
Fortunately, I soon saw that the grimace and hard glare, half concealed under a jet-black Fubu baseball hat, belonged to my good friend Justice. His look of mock anger dissolved into a broad smile, gold cap gleaming in the sun. A hulking construction worker and hip-hop clotheshorse, Justice was going on one of his marathon shopping sprees, and invited me along. 
 En route to a Costco in Sunset Park, I took in the impressive effect of his urban uniform du jour. He was, as he put it, "Fubued out to the max." Not just the ball cap, but the black satin Fubu baseball jacket and the baggy, prefaded Fubu jeans, impeccably pressed and cuffed.
"It'd be kind of hard for a white guy to pull off that look," I told him with a laugh.
"No," Justice countered, "a lot of white people are rockin' Fubu right now."
That may be so, but I knew I would never attempt Justice's Fubu flush. Although I've dabbled in hip-hop fashion over the years, it's always been with some uneasiness. Street trends change so quickly, they're hard for an outsider to keep track of. Even the letters of the Fubu logo are an acronym of exclusion: "For us, by us."
As a white, rap-music-obsessed journalist based in Manhattan, I have spent much of the last decade traveling through the city's hip-hop underground. For several years in the mid 1990's, much to my amazement, I found myself moonlighting as the de facto manager for an aspiring rapper called Big K.
Almost from the first night we met, in the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side, Big K would howl at my lack of street panache -- the way I'd allow my sneakers to get scuffed up and filthy (he'd clean his nightly with a toothbrush, and moisturize the leather with Jergen's hand cream), the way my baseball caps were sweat-stained and shapeless (his collection of some 50 ball caps remained, miraculously, virginal).
How could I possibly be his right-hand man, K would loudly wonder, if I insisted on dressing like such a cornball?
Under the guidance of guys like Big K and Justice -- my bedroom closet has become a veritable archive of failed hip-hop fashion experiments. There's the black quilted zip-front hunting vest, street chic on rap groups like Naughty by Nature, but an accessory that tends to make a diminutive Jewish male, like me, resemble Chico Marx on an ice-fishing expedition. Or my black Kangol Spitfire cap, which when spun backward -- and worn beret style, a la Samuel L. Jackson -- makes me look about as tough as one of the Backstreet Boys.
Then, there's the pair of burgundy suede "British walker" loafers that Big K gave me two winters back, no doubt the strangest Hanukkah gift I've ever received. On K, as on countless other Brooklyn "rudeboys" (homeboys, in the West Indian variant), the crepe-soled shoes available in myriad shades, including hot yellow, have long been a hallmark of a tough streetwise fashion.
On me, however, they were eerily reminiscent of those hated Hush Puppies that would have earned any seventh grader a strafing of noogies on his way out of homeroom.
But it's the ascendancy of black-owned, black-oriented clothiers like Fubu, Shabazz Brothers, Pure Playaz and Mecca that's given me the most pause. Yes, it's true, as my friend Justice noted, that a lot of white people are rockin' Fubu today. A headline in Women's Wear Daily recently proclaimed "Fubu's Move to the Suburbs." But can a white consumer really get away with wearing a product designed and marketed by a youthful African-American company whose very name is a rallying cry of racial solidarity and economic empowerment?
In the hit video "Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)" by the alternative band the Offspring, a white hip-hop wannabe is seen flashing ersatz gang signs and making a foolish attempt at break dancing while dressed in a powder blue Fubu football jersey. Fubu merchandise should come with a warning label: "Can backfire with humiliating consequences."
And there are many other fashion hazards out there in the streets. Regional distinctions and subtleties abound. These days, for instance, the Brooklyn hip-hop demimonde is riven by fashion-related isms and schisms.
There's the so-called Big Willie look (flashy designer labels), popularized by the late Notorious B.I.G., in sharp contrast to the "roughneck" gear (camouflage and boots) of rappers like Jeru the Damaja, Buckshot and M.O.P. And now, with many of the leading rappers hitting their 30's, a more conservative, GQ-influenced hip-hop style is emerging, even in the streets of Brooklyn. Witness the basic-black wiseguy ensemble sported by Jay-Z, a rapper from Bedford-Stuyvesant, on the cover of his chart-topping CD, "Vol. 2 . . . Hard Knock Life." He appears in a black four-button blazer over black cashmere sports shirt, buttoned to the neck. Diamond pinky ring optional.
Today, hip-hop fashion is a big tent, encompassing both the flamboyant matador-on-speed get-ups of Busta Rhymes and the understated, surburban-friendly T-shirts and baggy khakis of the XL boutiques owned by Mike D of the Beastie Boys. Hip-hop runs through so many trends you never know what will turn up next.
A few years back, it seemed that even my own personal style (I grew up in Western Canada) had come into vogue during the great hip-hop hockey jersey craze, when rap superstars like Snoop Doggy Dogg had, for inexplicable reasons, fallen in love with the regulation National Hockey League uniforms of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Flipping through fashion spreads in Vibe and the Source, I was bemused but delighted: my northern compatriots, suddenly and unwittingly, had become the height of homeboy fashion.
Sadly, the hip-hop-hockey nexus was short lived. By the time I dusted off my vintage Rangers jersey to accompany Big K to a rap showcase downtown, I felt myself the object of countless smirks and glares.
That's because of the ineffable element of all street fashion: attitude. Snoop can sport a regulation N.H.L. jersey without being taken for a gap-toothed Canadian on skates, just as he can adorn his braids with baby-girl baubles or colorful rubber bands without looking like a long-missing member of Hanson.
Attitude seems to have no strict correlation with age, class, or even ethnicity. My friend Jack, an Ivy League-trained clinical psychologist -- like me, in his early 30's -- counsels patients at St. Luke's-Roosevelt by day and is a devotee of the downtown drum-and-bass scene by night. Shedding his suit and tie, he opts for the ultra-baggy jeans and exotic skateboarding sneakers that are de rigueur in such after-hours spots as Jungle Nation.
One night last summer, as we were heading out to a club, Jack insisted that I try on his latest accessory: a tan-colored Eddie Bauer fishing cap. On him, the soft cloth hat was either old-school hip-hop or new-school drum-and-bass. But on me, I realized, the droopy cap made an even bolder statement: Gilligan.
With the advent of the new year (and my wife's repeated requests that I start dressing like a grown-up), I've resolved to do away with all such overreaching attempts at youth-culture fashion.
I'll still head out on my regular shopping runs with Justice, and I may try on some of the more mature outfits at Phat Farm. But the next time I throw on my vintage hockey jersey, I'll be sitting in the icy glow of the MSG Network, rooting for Gretzky and the other Ranger old timers.

A Pox on the High-Rates 'Cure'

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
WHEN financial crisis strikes and a currency plunges, the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund press the suffering country to raise interest rates. Sometimes the currency recovers, but the higher interest rates always produce a recession. Critics of this remedy, ever more vociferous, are suggesting that high rates are akin to the 18th-century medical practice of bleeding patients to try to cure disease. George Washington's last illness was a bad cold; doctors bled him, and he died within a week.
Much has been staked on high interest rates as the treatment of choice for sick economies, but evidence is accumulating that suggests it is the wrong prescription, capable of turning a global financial crisis into a global recession reminiscent of the 1930's. The high rates applied in East Asian countries, Russia and now Brazil were supposed to restore confidence in each nation's financial system and draw foreign investors and lenders back in. Currencies would then stabilize, interest rates would fall, borrowing and investment would resume and, most important of all, the damaged economies would revive. 
 That is not what has happened in South Korea and Thailand, the first countries to be caught in the financial panic that started in East Asia 19 months ago. Rates have indeed fallen and their currencies are now stronger, but recessions continue in both countries.
"High interest rates are harmful, not helpful; they signal that debtors are in danger of defaulting on foreign loans," said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, who is making the critics' case at the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering here of political, cultural and economic leaders from many countries. "You put up rates to 35 percent, and that makes investors nervous about a nation's currency. By insisting on higher rates, the Treasury and the I.M.F. have helped to create economic contractions all over the developing world."
 FLEXIBLE interest rates that are allowed to find their own level are more to the liking of critics like Mr. Sachs. He would leave interest rates alone even in a crisis, a tactic that in his view is more likely to keep an economy out of recession. "You show investors that you have economic growth and a way to get out of a financial crisis, and they will come back, strengthening the currency as they come," Mr. Sachs said.
He subscribes to a recent World Bank study that found no correlation between the movements of interest rates and exchange rates in a number of cases. Too many other factors besides interest rates affect currency values: Political upheaval, for example, or too much capacity in manufacturing, which drives down profits and thereby discourages investment.
The World Bank study reflects the views of Joseph Stiglitz, the bank's chief economist, who signed the preface. He, too, has argued that high rates are viewed as a signal that borrowers in the nations offering the high rates are likely to default. Economists who see the issue his way say high rates can be counted on to stabilize a currency only in a fanciful world that somehow has no risk, no bankruptcies, no defaults. Only in such a sure-fire, risk-free world could foreign investors be counted on to respond to higher interest rates, certain they wouldn't lose their money.
 THE United States Treasury and the I.M.F., speaking pretty much as one voice, have disagreed. They have argued, for example, that if Korea and Thailand had not raised interest rates when disaster struck, the devaluations of their currencies would have been even steeper. Debtors would have had much more difficulty repaying foreign lenders in hard currency, and excessive devaluations would eventually accelerate inflation.
But in the face of the recessions that high rates have generated, the Treasury appears to be moving toward a middle ground.
"There is a balance needed," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said in an interview here on Friday. "High rates have important costs that have to be recognized. At the same time, too much liquidity" -- rates that, in effect, are too low -- "can be a prescription for disaster. A balance has to be found."
That compromise view appears to reflect current thinking on Wall Street.
Securities investors are effectively lenders, so the institutions that reflect their views are eager to keep exchange rates in developing countries as calm and predictable as possible.
"Investors recognize the political and social costs of trying to keep interest rates too high for too long," said Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs. "When a good-faith effort to sustain a currency with high rates turns sour, you have to be flexible."
And so the harsh medicine of high interest rates that has put a half-dozen emerging economies into recession over the last 19 months may be losing favor -- perhaps in time to soften the damage to the Brazilian economy in a world that starts putting economic growth first, with exchange rate stability to follow.

Confidently Riding the Technology Bubble

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT is pretty easy to be excited and amazed about exciting and amazing technology stocks. It is equally easy to be scared to death of them.
Last year, the 250 stocks that make up Hambrecht & Quist's technology index rose 55.4 percent, the biggest annual gain ever. 
 And the gains have not stopped; for 1999 through Friday, the index, which does not include Internet stocks, was up 13.7 percent. The firm's Internet index is up 48.6 percent so far this year.
All good things, of course, come to an end. And expectations are high and rising that sooner rather than later the bubble will burst, particularly for Internet stocks.
But from his office in Half Moon Bay, Calif., Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, took some time last week to share his views on why technology stocks are likely to remain white-hot.
 
Q. Last summer, technology stocks stumbled badly, along with everything else. You don't think that selloff was justified, do you?
 
A. No, I don't. There was a real fear last summer and early fall that personal computer sales were not growing and communications and semiconductor sales were never going to pick up. It was utterly wrong. At the time, we were in the process of seeing accelerating sales, which have continued into this year.
On the communications side -- hardware, routers and switches -- there never was a slowdown.
Semiconductor pricing bottomed in May or June, and now we are hearing that there is a real imbalance of supply and demand for certain, mostly higher-valued, chips. And that has translated pretty quickly into orders for semiconductor equipment. So the business looks like it may be approaching a year of normal growth in 1999. And 2000 may be a boom year.
 
Q. Why is that?
 
A. There are three legs to technology: communications, computing and biotech. All three are having very strong positive product cycles. It is those product cycles that drive the business, not the economy.
At the semiconductor industry's forecasting meeting in Monterey earlier this month, they were talking about sales growth of 7 percent for 1999, but with sales exiting the year at a 20 percent growth rate, which is a tremendous amount of momentum.
At the end of this year, we will get Windows 2000 from Microsoft, which should further personal computer spending. The Internet will continue its build-out, which will further communications spending. In biotech, we had 50 new drugs approved last year, almost double 1997, and this year we expect that 80 new drugs will be approved. There are 10 profitable biotech companies today. That number will probably double this year.
 
Q. How do you think this forecast will play itself out in the stock market?
 
A. For the last 18 to 24 months, we have had a very strong rally in the big technology stocks, the Microsofts, the Dells, the MCI Worldcoms. If this move is going to continue, it will spread out to the smaller-cap issues. If it doesn't, I think the rally will die.
For example, Oracle is selling at or close to an all-time high, but Informix is selling at half its previous all-time high. Cisco Systems is extremely overpriced, but Premisys, another data communications company, is underpriced. There are lots of mid-cap, second-tier companies that are selling at big disparities to the leaders.
 
Q. Speaking of overpriced stocks, what is your opinion of Internet shares?
 
A. We are short most of the Internet stocks. My theory has been that you can pop a bubble like this without taking the rest of the market down.
The Internet bubble has to pop because the supply of stock is so large. Investment bankers are filing as many offerings as they can, and lots of stock is beginning to unlock from I.P.O.'s done last year as insiders are allowed to sell their shares.
 
Q. Has Internet mania inflated prices of issues that are not pure Web plays?
 
A. The Internet has infected the rest a lot more than I thought it would have. Cisco, for example, has gotten an extra run because people believe the overwhelming demand will spread out.
 
Q. What do you tell people who own shares in companies you consider overpriced or fully priced -- the Microsofts, Intels, Ciscos and Lucents of the world?
 
A. I tell people that companies like these are core holdings, that even if in the short term they go down, don't buy them so you can trade the shares. There are none I would run out and buy this minute, but none I would sell right now because they are grossly overpriced.
I think people should have 30 percent to 50 percent of their portfolio in these kinds of stocks. If you don't already own them, start dollar cost averaging into them over a six-month period.

Trial Balloon Has Evolved Into Religion

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
The Super Bowl may indeed be the quintessence of American boys behaving badly, but it has never pretended to be anything else. Because it is the national holy day of a secular religion linked to illegal gambling, domestic violence, steroid abuse and institutional racism, it is beyond scandal and star-fall. We should be particularly grateful in these days of Olympic disgrace and pro basketball depression.
I began appreciating the Super Bowl 30 years ago, at what was then called the American Football League-National Football League world championship. An evening before the game, I was offered a glimpse into the future if I promised to keep it in "deep background." Even more easily seducible then, I soon found myself rocking gently on a luxurious yacht, drinking with Commissioner Pete Rozelle and several owners. 
 Rozelle took me aside, murmured of his concerns that pro football was becoming too big too quickly, too intrinsic to the national fabric. Could it sustain? He was as serious as any head of state dreaming of an empire. He went on to leak the legend, which he would soon share with everyone, that the term "Super Bowl," then coming into vogue, had been coined by the son of the Kansas City Chiefs' owner, Lamar Hunt, who was playing with a high-bouncer called "the super ball." Rozelle, the public relations master, told this story with such elaborate reluctance that, in retrospect, it is clear he was releasing a trial balloon he figured the news media would either shoot down or claim to have sent up.
As New York fans were reminded recently, that game, retroactively called Super Bowl III, helped bring us into this rich new Jock Pop world in which the Olympics became just another super-spectacle competing for the entertainment dollar and short white men made hoopla dreams come true. I wish I had been smart enough that balmy night off Miami Beach to see that the fix was already in, that these guys knew what they were doing. The N.F.L. and its Super Bowl were about franchising and marketing, about cities desperate to appear "major league," about cars and beer for 18-to-34-year-old male viewers who needed to watch mostly faceless big guys whomp the cartilage out of one another. This was a boy's dream of studly quarterbacks and their loyal meatball guards, "Braveheart" without the blue paint, 60-minute wars without women or the responsibilities of peace. And it was all under the benign fatherhood of intense coaches who would make them men.
No wonder the Olympics and the National Basketball Association started to scramble.
Since the olive oil payoffs of ancient Greece (winners got sales franchises despite the amateur rules), the Olympics have been a model of hypocrisy, continually bending their own rules for the sake of business. All was justified for the survival of a "movement" that was supposedly larger than nationalism. The Olympics fed on nationalistic rivalry, especially when it could be televised.
This is why it is so hard not to enjoy certain aspects of the current bribery scandal (which will turn out to be far more systemic than first reported) in much the way that agnostics enjoyed the fall of those television preachers who always knew so much about sin.
The Olympics lost its last claim to specialness in 1992, when it opened its arms to the Dream Team, the N.B.A.'s Roman legion, which claimed the world in ways that even the late Commissioner Rozelle probably envied. Basketball is more portable and exportable than football, but perhaps more fragile. All its players have faces. Because individual stars become larger than the game itself, the game is more dependent on them. The process of replacing Michael Jordan (perhaps by a whole team, a rookie class or the redemption of Latrell Sprewell) has already begun, but until it is complete the game will be in recession. But the Super Bowl, with its red meat soul, its aroma of beer, cigars and new car leather seats, prospers and rumbles on.
Illegal football betting, from office pools to serious gambling, has become intrinsic to the national fabric. The only important players who were ever suspended for an entire season, Paul Hornung and Alex Karras, were punished because they bet on games, giving the appearance of being inside traders. The nastiest backlash I've ever had from a story was when I offered anecdotal evidence from hot-lines and women's shelters that big games, such as the Super Bowl, provoked male-on-female domestic violence. Right-wing commentators in particular seemed incensed at this assault on American manhood.
That every level of the game encourages football players to use anabolic steroids and other drugs that enhance performance, build muscle mass or aid strenuous training is no longer even interesting; fascinating will be how the pharmaceutical companies, in their rush to cash in on the current men's health boom, will use the game's image of manhood to market drugs. The continuing, almost perverse, refusal to promote black coaches seems like a one-industry refutation of a century of progress. So does the pigskin curtain on what seems like an epidemic of players with police records. Is it the drugs, a shared psychological profile of player and felon or a sense that the super ball has just bounced out of sight of everyday morality?
Beats me. All I know is that today I will be grateful and pay homage.

Shunning Emerging Markets, Except One

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
DIEGO ESPINOSA, the co-manager of the Scudder Global Fund, is not interested at the moment in Brazil or most of the rest of the world's major emerging markets.
His $1.59 billion fund, which he runs with William Holzer, has cut back its exposure to emerging markets to 1 percent from 5 percent in the summer of 1997. 
And as long as the global financial environment is as it is now, he said, "it is going to be hard for us to make the case to invest in emerging markets."
The environment is bad because it is harder and more expensive for emerging market countries and companies to borrow, there is downward pressure on the prices paid for goods from emerging markets and the overall world economy -- especially the markets of Europe and the United States -- appear to be headed for a slowdown.
Despite his hands-off view, Mr. Espinosa has begun to consider an exception -- Argentina. Since Brazil devalued its currency on Jan. 13, raising new questions about the world's emerging markets, Argentina has done several things to get his attention.
One, its Government has renewed, in a convincing way, its determination to keep its currency, the peso, pegged directly to the dollar. The Government is even considering junking the peso in favor of the dollar itself. "That shows a lot of commitment from the Government," he said.
Another is the performance of the country's foreign debt. While it was sold in the wake of the Brazilian devaluation, it has performed better than expected.
At the end of last year, the difference in yields between United States Treasury bonds and 30-year global bonds from Mexico and Argentina were 5.41 percentage points and 5.61 percentage points, respectively, while Brazil's was far higher at 9.86 percentage points. Argentina was being treated like less risky Mexico, though many investors had always linked its outlook to Brazil's.
The spread on the same bonds jumped to 7.20 percentage points for Argentina compared with 5.75 percentage points for Mexico after the devaluation. But it did not take off like Brazil, which rose to 12.47 percentage points. And since then, the Argentina spread has narrowed to 6.61 percentage points , while Brazil has fallen only to 11.47 percentage points, according to Bloomberg News data.
All this may signal that investors are beginning to distinguish between Brazil and Argentina, though their economic fates are still tightly tied because of their trade dependence.
Two other factors also figure in Mr. Espinosa's thinking. One is that Argentina borrowed heavily in global bond markets last year and, therefore, has much of the money it needs to meet its foreign debt payments this year. And the Argentinian stocks he likes are not very sensitive to overall economic growth and are at very attractive valuations right now. He said he was not allowed to name his favorites, but stocks that appear to meet his definition are YPF, the oil and gas company, and the Argentine telephone companies, Telefonica de Argentina and Telecom Argentina.
"This is the time to think about delinking" Argentina, he said. But he is still only thinking. Asemerging markets continue to be very volatile, he has not bought anythintg yet.
 WHILE there have been few reverberations in the world's developed markets since Brazil's renewed crisis, there were shocks throughout emerging markets. Over all, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index, these markets are down 3 percent since Jan. 12. The index for Asia is off 5.7 percent, while Latin America is down nine tenths of one percent, in dollar terms, after a nice rebound last week.
And turning around Brazil will not be easy. Raising interest rates could help stop the decline of the currency, already down 41 percent in value. But higher interest rates could also push the economy deeper into recession. But a weakening currency could reignite inflation. And the spending cuts needed to cut the Government deficit will mean laying off state workers.
"Emerging markets need periods of global stability to grow," Mr. Espinosa said, because their fragile political systems cannot adjust to the current environment.

Big Food Distributor's New Chief Performs Emergency Surgery

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
LIKE a surgeon wielding a scalpel, Mark S. Hansen has cut swiftly and deeply into the Fleming Companies, closing plants, eliminating departments and dismissing workers.
He has been chief executive of Fleming, the nation's second-largest food distributor after Supervalu Inc., for just two months. But swift action was essential: The fat and decay at the ailing company, which has $15 billion in sales, posed too great a threat, and its complacent culture was too big an obstacle in a rapidly evolving business. The ordeal will be painful, but Mr. Hansen says he believes it will ultimately put Fleming on the mend. 
 He is intent on "repositioning the thinking process at Fleming as a company that wins as opposed to one that doesn't," he said. That includes a plan endorsed by Mr. Hansen, 44, to make the company's leadership more accountable to shareholders, by requiring directors -- including Mr. Hansen, who is also chairman -- to be re-elected annually instead of every three years.
"We have not had a history of very kind shareholder relationships," Mr. Hansen said. "This is absolutely an olive branch to our shareholders that says we are concerned about what your issues are and are willing to change accordingly." He added that the proposal reflects management's confidence that the Oklahoma City-based company, which distributes food products to 3,000 supermarkets in 42 states, including nearly 300 stores of its own, will be able to right itself and thrive again.
To be sure, much of the strategy to revamp Fleming, including the plan for shorter board terms, was devised long before Mr. Hansen was hired in November to run the company after an extensive search. Last year, after a string of disappointing quarters, Fleming conducted an eight-month internal assessment of its operations and laid out a restructuring strategy. It is Mr. Hansen's mandate to expand on and execute the plan at a company that is clearly in need of a new and clearer vision.
Fleming's numbers remain bad. In the third quarter of 1998, the latest it has reported, Fleming had a net loss of $2.3 million, or 5 cents a diluted share, on sales of $3.4 billion. The quarter a year earlier was worse, with a $3.8 million net loss on essentially the same sales. Fleming is expected to report results for all of 1998 on Feb. 18, and it has projected that annual revenue will decrease by a total of $1 billion over the next two years.
In an industry where profit margins are already razor-thin, Fleming's lag behind competitors. And its stock has lost nearly three-fifths of its value since 1994, closing at $8.093 Friday.
Mr. Hansen wants to move margins closer to 1 percent of sales, from one-fourth of 1 percent, and to lift the stock out of the basement. It is these lofty goals that call for the major surgery he is performing.
To start, he said, the company is too bureaucratic. So he has reduced the number of operating units to 14 from 57 and eliminated 220 corporate jobs, or about 12 percent of the headquarters staff. Taking a page from Wal-Mart's game book, Fleming hopes to get better prices on everything from soup to saltines by buying nationally instead of regionally. In the process, the company is closing seven distribution centers and selling one of its 12 supermarket chains.
Fleming expects to save $20 million annually by combining the operating units and an additional $10 million a year from the job cuts. But the company is taking hefty charges -- $667 million in the fourth quarter alone -- related to its business overhaul.
And though investors see the restructuring as a move in the right direction, few expect the stock price to improve any time soon. "It's become a show-me stock," said Antonio DeSpirito, an analyst with Pzena Investment Management in New York.
Pzena Investment has held on to 800,000 shares that it has owned for about two years because it thinks the price has the potential to recover as Mr. Hansen's revamping takes hold. Nevertheless, Mr. DeSpirito said, "Everyone is skeptical."
Some of the company's troubles can be attributed to the swiftly changing nature of the business in which it operates. Along with other companies that supply independent grocers, Fleming has been hurt as its customers have struggled to compete with giant chains like Kroger and Safeway that enjoy huge purchasing power and big economies of scale. Meanwhile, nontraditional food retailers like Wal-Mart and Kmart have been adding grocery sections to hundreds of their stores, further squeezing the smaller grocers who buy from Fleming. As a result, independents have been selling out to the big chains or closing at an accelerating rate, constricting the pool of potential customers.
But Fleming has also suffered from some problems that are uniquely its own.
Fleming's cost structure had become top heavy, for example, at a time when retailers were looking for low-cost operators who could help them keep their own expenses down in the face of mounting competition. And Fleming was sued several times in recent years, accused of charging unfair prices to some grocers. It settled the suits without admitting wrongdoing, but agreed to sell a food distribution center to Furr's Supermarkets to settle one claim and paid nearly $20 million to settle another.
Mr. Hansen said the accusations of overcharging and inflating manufacturers' prices made in the suits "obviously hurt the corporate psyche." But Fleming has been able to maintain good relations with most of its customers, he said, and the company is trying to put the issues behind it and focus on the future.
 MR. HANSEN'S background includes much he can draw on to attack Fleming's problems. Before joining Fleming, he was president of Sam's Club, the warehouse-store division of Wal-Mart; he is also a former president and chief executive of the Petsmart chain and has extensive experience in management at food retailers like Federated Foods and Jewel.
His tenure at Sam's Club, he said, gave him an inside view of Wal-Mart, the supermarket industry's nemesis. Wal-Mart is more simply organized and less bureaucratic than other large corporations, he said, making it nimble in spite of its size.
"Understanding how they behave and how customers use their stores," he said, "strengthens and broadens the perspective of the company."

HEADLINE: Getting the Republicans Back on Track

 BODY:
While Senate Republicans spent much of the past week searching for an "exit strategy" from the trial of President Clinton, the public seemed to be holding Republican politicians responsible for the entire impeachment quagmire. When the battle on Capitol Hill is over, what will the party do next? Here are some suggestions from various quarters on how the Republicans might shake off the impeachment funk.
 
Russell K. Paul is the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party.
 As Republicans look at life after impeachment, we must keep four points in mind. 
 First, exploiting our adversaries' problems is not enough. We believed that once voters really understood Bill Clinton, they would dislike him as much as we do and reward us for our insight. Instead, voters became petrified that we were disturbing the karma of economic good times.
Second, we must reconnect to average people. Republicans too often try to appeal to the brain when voters are listening with their hearts.
Third, forget macroeconomics. Tell working mothers how tax cuts offer the financial freedom to work fewer hours and be home when the school bus arrives. Explain how fathers can earn more and still make it to Little League games.
Fourth, loosen up. Of course, politics is serious business. But it is rarely deadly serious.
For a party that believes most of government is irrelevant, we seem to approach governance as a life-or-death struggle. Thus, the Grand Old Party is quickly becoming the Party of Uptight White Guys.
Voters weigh many factors in deciding how to vote. If they like you, however, they tend to overlook the flaws characteristic to all humans. If they don't like you, they won't even forgive your good points.
Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter with a wry smile and a "there you go again." He defanged Walter Mondale with a wry promise not to use his opponent's relative youth and inexperience against him.
Ultimately, politics is about ideas. The electorate will keep us around if our ideas are better than those of our adversaries.
The last Republican Congress had one brief, shining moment -- the Senate hearings on the Internal Revenue Service. It was the one time we rallied public attention to our agenda. That's the kind of post-impeachment action that will make voters forget Monica Lewinsky forever.
 
Eugene J. McCarthy, the former Democratic Senator from Minnesota, is the author of "No-Fault Politics."
 During my 50 years in politics I've made it a practice not to try to advise the Republicans. And I have no idea whether impeachment will be a factor in the 2000 election.
There is really no point in anyone devising an exit strategy at this stage. Former Presidents Ford and Carter tried, and so did Bob Dole. All their proposals were rejected at the time. Senator Robert Byrd suggested the most elegant and obvious exit strategy, and it failed, too.
Why? When you build up partisan competition, based on loyalty to party, great issues and ideas inevitably take a back seat to squabbles over "morality" and personality.
This kind of partisanship -- the mischief of factionalism -- was exactly what the Founders feared. In 1780 John Adams wrote, "There is nothing I dread so much as a division of the Republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader and converting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution."
A senator may need to belong to a party; he ought not to be a party man. If senators cannot make independent judgments on matters of great importance, the chamber cannot function as intended. We saw this during the Vietnam War. It was far easier to get Democratic senators to oppose the war once it became Richard Nixon's war than when it was Lyndon Johnson's.
 
Martin Puris, chairman of the advertising agency Ammirati Puris Lintas, is the author of "Comeback: How Seven Straight Shooters Turned Around Troubled Companies."
If the Republicans were my clients, I'd give them the same advice I'd give any of my corporate clients who found themselves in a similar situation: set a clear direction for your company based on your strengths and on the opportunities that exist in the marketplace, bring in the right people to do the work, and provide the leadership to impel those people toward achieving the vision you've set.
This takes some gumption and lots of sober self-analysis. But fortunately for the Republicans, President Clinton has given them an opportunity to regain their voice.
In his State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton moved away from the popular, traditionally Republican themes that he had previously co-opted -- crime prevention, deficit reduction, welfare reform -- and back toward a big-government agenda. By doing this, he presented the Republicans with an opportunity to claim the philosophical high ground by once again becoming the party of smaller government and tax cuts. They should leap at this opening.
My final suggestion to Republicans would be that they tack up a sign on the wall of their party headquarters that says: "Keep it clear. Keep it clean. Keep it relevant. And forget the 'M' word."
 
Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers, is the author of "The Anatomy of Love."
 The Republicans' biggest problem is that they are exhibiting thinking that is characteristic of the male brain. Men tend to compartmentalize issues, focus their attention on specific details and think linearly. Women tend to assimilate more facts, arrange data within a wider matrix and think contextually.
National polls indicate that the majority of Americans are viewing the impeachment issue within a larger context -- the good of the nation. When these alpha male Republicans see the merit of listening to the American public, they may endorse a contextual thinker as their leader -- a woman or a man who can think like one.
 
Danielle Crittenden, the editor of The Women's Quarterly, is the author of "What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us."
 Too often when Republicans speak to women, they talk to them as if they were all the audience of the Lifetime Channel. They trot victims of rape and AIDS onto the podium at their national convention to retell their ordeals. They send Elizabeth Dole out strolling with a hand mike. They get new-Mom Susan Molinari to give the Republicans' keynote address and single-Mom Jennifer Dunn to deliver the rebuttal to the President's State of the Union address.
In short, they don't believe they can reach women unless they play only to emotion and not reason, and transform the political into the personal. As Representative Dunn put it: "I've been a single mother since my boys were little -- 6 and 8. I know how that knot in the pit of your stomach feels. I've been there."
Anti-suffragists thought women were creatures far too sensitive, too irrational, too gullible, too self-occupied to be trusted with the vote. Modern politicians seem to have adopted that view, too. They feel they must address, in the most intimate and condescending terms, our personal problems as women -- our love lives, our child-rearing woes, our fatigue, our pain.
What Republicans need today is the courage to be themselves and remember that none but the brave deserve the fair.
 
Frank Mankiewicz, a former top aide to Senators Robert F. Kennedy and George McGovern, is vice chairman of Hill and Knowlton.
Advice to Republicans? From this lifelong, often-suffering Democrat, it's easy.
First of all, put Dick Armey and Tom DeLay out front whenever you can. Second, stretch out the impeachment trial as long as you can. Bully your moderates into going along, just as you did so effectively in the House. Make Monica (and her mother) testify a few more times, threaten Betty Currie with jail -- and as a surprise witness, produce Susan McDougal in chains, led into the Senate by a grinning Kenneth Starr.
Americans love zealots, guys. Remember how eagerly we responded to Newt's call to "revolution"? Forget the soccer moms -- get a crusade going to require Americans to buy at least one gun per month.
Oh, and if we ever get back to real business, make sure the voters understand it's better to let Social Security funds dwindle while we cut capital gains taxes. Remember to crack down on immigrants. Especially Asians and Hispanics.
And leave the minimum wage alone -- those welfare cheats are now earning $5.15 an hour flipping burgers and cleaning toilets. Call it "the dignity of labor" and hire expensive lawyers to keep out the unions.
 
Floyd Flake, a Democrat, is a former House member from New York.
The Republicans have been a party without any broad, unifying leadership for nearly a decade -- since President George Bush led a domestic and international coalition into the Persian Gulf war. Now, Republicans need the caliber of personal strength and dignity that it takes to build consensus at home in times of peace.
That leadership cannot emerge from the Senate or House; too much energy and effort have been expended there on impeachment rather than on improving education and economic opportunity. If a new wave of Republicans are to succeed, they must speak to the real concerns of Americans and demonstrate that they understand the difference between language that defines and language that divides.
 
P. J. O'Rourke is the author, most recently, of "Eat the Rich."
The Republicans could act on principle, following the dictates of conscience and putting duty to the nation above personal and political considerations.
Nah.
They could get body piercings to project a more hip and with-it image, especially the House Judiciary Committee members. Watching them on television caused all Americans to experience horrible memories of being met at the door by the father of their prom date. But, knowing Republicans, they'd probably pierce their wallets.
A sex-change operation for every male Republican leader would be too expensive, even for a party with major corporate donors in the health care field.
The Republicans could wait for the inevitable financial bust, but they didn't get much out of that in 1929.
Or they could have sordid affairs, solicit tainted campaign donations and practice highbinding and jobbery of every sort. This works for Mr. Clinton, plus there's the advantage that the Republicans are doing it already.
But the best thing the Republicans could do is extend a hand of peace to the Democrats. They could let bygones be bygones, work together with their opponents and show the electorate that Republicans trust Democrats -- trust Democrats to have a George McGovern, a Fritz Mondale or a Michael Dukakis waiting in the wings. Or, indeed, an Al Gore.

The Deficit's Gone, but Not the National Debt

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Federal budget deficit is gone, transformed by a strong economy into a string of projected surpluses that should grow larger for years to come -- at least by the reckoning that passes for fiscal forecasting in Washington.
Eliminating the deficit is hardly the end of the Government's financial troubles, however, and it marks the beginning of a new debate over how fiscal policy should be used to shape the nation's future. 
 It's like a family that after spending more than it earns month after month suddenly finds itself bringing in more than it spends -- great news, to be sure, but a turnaround that still leaves the family with the debt it ran up during the hard times and the choice of whether to pay it off.
Washington was never in much danger of maxing out its credit cards. But the national debt was built up over decades of deficit spending -- the Federal Government has not run steady surpluses since the 1920's -- and it remains an economic millstone of considerable proportions. Only now do Congress and the White House have the luxury of debating what to do about it.
Seeking to complete the transformation of the Democratic Party's tax-and-spend reputation into one of economic virtue, President Clinton has already made debt reduction a centerpiece of his agenda this year, saying it is the best way to insure that the country remains prosperous and able to handle the strains the aging baby-boom generation will place on the social welfare system. The details of his plan are confusing, with some Republicans saying the President is advocating a sophisticated shell game, but Mr. Clinton is actively trying to recast an otherwise abstract goal in tangible terms.
"If we in the United States could actually be doing something to pay down our debt while saving Social Security and Medicare," Mr. Clinton told a meeting at the White House last week, "we would keep these interest rates down, and it would be an enormous hedge against whatever unforeseen future volatility occurs in the global economy."
All too aware that they are being painted by Democrats as willing to risk Social Security's future for a burst of immediate gratification, Republicans are nonetheless pressing ahead with their calls to use the surplus for big tax cuts, saying there is more than enough spare cash to clean up the nation's books, save Social Security and return some money to taxpayers.
Anyway, Republicans say, debt reduction will never happen because Democrats -- admittedly with some help from the other side of the aisle -- will spend the surplus before it materializes. Since the real choice then, in the Republican view, is between new spending and tax cuts, the best course economically and politically is tax cuts.
"Debt reduction ultimately gets trumped in a political process by Government spending," said John F. Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former budget official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. "Achieving a sustained policy of debt reduction is very difficult, to say the least."
There are several ways to measure the national debt, but the most meaningful is to look at the debt held by the public -- the individuals, Wall Street firms and banks from around the world that buy the bonds sold by the Treasury Department. There is currently $3.7 trillion in public debt outstanding, which is equal to 45 percent of the economy's total output.
IN those terms, the debt peaked at the end of World War II, when it hit 108 percent of the gross domestic product. Its recent high was in 1993, after a decade of growing deficits, when it hit 50 percent. Should all of the surpluses projected for the next decade be used for debt reduction, the debt would decline to below 10 percent by 2009, its lowest level since World War I.
In economic terms, the question of whether debt reduction should be a higher priority than tax cuts or spending increases is an easy call. Most economists agree that paying down the national debt is the surest way to spur more savings and investment, create more jobs, improve productivity and generally enable the economy to grow faster.
After all, every dollar the Government has to borrow to pay for fighter jets or new education programs is a dollar not available to a promising but cash-starved technology company or to a manufacturer eager to invest in new equipment that would enable it to compete more effectively in cutthroat global markets. Competition from Washington for capital also drives up interest rates for mortgages and car loans as well as for corporate borrowers.
And every dollar that Washington has to spend making interest payments is a dollar the Government does not have available for other uses -- say, shoring up the Social Security system.
"Reducing the Federal debt to the public at this stage is unquestionably the most important thing that I believe that we can do if meeting the future needs of the economy is the standard," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last week.
To some people there is also a moral dimension to the issue. Debt, in their view, is just plain wrong, an obligation that needs to be paid off as soon as possible, whether it is owed by a farmer, a company or the United States Treasury.
"In the abstract we think of it as fiscal sin," said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, quickly adding that "rather than repent we charge yet again."
But it is on the political level that the issue gets messiest.
While members of both parties pledge allegiance to austerity and the long-term benefits it promises, history suggests that the short-term drive to survive the next election leads to some degree of profligacy. Last year Republicans as well as Democrats hailed Mr. Clinton's call to save "every penny" of the developing surpluses for Social Security. By the end of a year in which they agreed on very few things, lawmakers from both parties agreed to a budget-busting highway and mass transit bill and to $20 billion in extra spending out of this year's surplus.
Using the surplus for tax cuts or popular programs is just too much of a temptation for politicians. However virtuous it might be to forswear spending money that could otherwise go to debt reduction, said Mr. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, "You can't go home to your district and have a ribbon cutting."
STILL, for both political and policy reasons, Mr. Clinton has wrapped himself in the mantle of debt reduction. It is a measure of his political dexterity that even as he sets out sweeping new spending initiatives in the budget he will send Congress tomorrow, he may well succeed, as he did last year, in using fiscal rectitude as a blocking maneuver against the Republican tax-cutting drive.
The partisan bitterness that has emerged over the impeachment also suggests there is little chance of any deal between the White House and Congress on Social Security, tax cuts and spending.
But in economic terms such an impasse might not prove to be such a bad thing. Gridlock amounts to a policy decision by default because running a surplus is synonymous with paying down debt; it automatically reduces the Government's borrowing needs. All of this, of course, assumes that the economy and the stock market remain strong enough that the surplus actually materializes.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Hard Right -- Voters All Over Take the Wheel From Conservatives;
A Matter of Trust For Europeans

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
IF the waning years of this decade have produced a dirty word in Europe, it is perhaps "conservative." The right-of-center ideology that played an important role in stripping European states of vast industrial holdings, advancing the market economy and facing down the former Soviet Union with medium-range missiles has fizzled.
Ten years ago, conservatives were in charge or on the rise in most places in Europe, but today there is hardly any country where that is true. In Germany, France, Britain and Italy, moreover, parties of the right are in disarray, casting around for a persuasive electoral message at a time when such traditional backbones of conservatism as "the nation," "the family," "the church" and "the Communist enemy" have changed or lost their meaning and the moderate left has occupied the political center. 
 Learning from Bill Clinton, center-left politicians like Prime Mininster Tony Blair in Britain and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in Germany have seized the political initiative with white-toothed smiles and cleverly spin-doctored images of modernity, economic efficiency and social compassion. In response, amid peace and moderate prosperity, the right has found itself clutching at straws.
"All these right-wing parties cried 'Victory' as the Berlin Wall came down, but they did not see that they had lost the force against which they defined themselves," said Pascal Perrineau, a French political scientist. "And they have been unable, since then, to come up with a message that does not seem regressive, nostalgic, outdated."
In Europe, the right has two essential incarnations: the free-market ideology once embodied by Margaret Thatcher in Britain and the more socially conscious conservatism of the German Christian Democrats, among others.
At the root of the problem for both, it seems, lie two victories that seemed to assure the right's future. One was over Communism and the division of Europe, the other over the excesses of state-run economies.
As a result of these triumphs, the specter of Marx and the magic of the market lost their potency as conservative rallying cries.
The effect has been devastating. In Italy, the Christian Democrats, long the main center-right party and bastion of American-backed efforts to block Communism, simply disintegrated. Elsewhere, the right abruptly found itself in a world dominated not by strategic blocs but by the economic forces of globalization. And Europeans, in large numbers, reacted to global free-market forces not with outright enthusiasm but with calls for safeguarding and even reinforcing their social security systems.
No matter that these systems are often too expensive to survive indefinitely in their present form. Politically, a message that pays has been one that says: Rely on us to protect you from cutthroat capitalism, displaced factories and global storms. In a Europe of high unemployment, the left has proved nimbler in purveying this slogan than the center-right.
"The fear of an unstoppable global economy dislocating societies has been hard for the right to exploit because it has generally stood for free markets and non-interference," said Jonathan Eyal, a British analyst, "And the new centrist left quickly occupied the broad election-winning ground: acceptance of the market tempered by social concerns."
Deep changes in the nature of European societies have also militated against the right. Appeals to the family and to tradition often seem outmoded, or in need of recasting, in countries where single-parent homes have become commonplace, divorce rampant, church-going more unusual and a multicultural environment the norm. European conservatives, like their American counterparts, have denounced such changes but the response from the European electorate has been muted.
The German weekly Die Zeit recently observed that "the middle-class enterpreneur of the 1950's who wanted his children to inherit his company regarded the linkage of business and family values as something quite natural." That attitude, it added, no longer prevailed for "the owner of a bunch of shares." And so, "the links between the market and morality, between ownership and middle-class values, which were embodied by the Christian Democrats, are strained and ready to burst."
So, too, are the links that long bound the right to patriotic visions of the European nation state. The fact is that the introduction of a common European currency, the euro, this year marked the biggest voluntary and peacetime surrender of sovereignty by a group of states in history. Center-right parties are still grappling with the enormity of this shift. For what should a conservative message be in a Europe where nations exist in name but rather less in substance?
An answer appears elusive. In France, no less than seven right-wing political groupings are putting forward candidates for European Parliament elections later this year. They include three pro-European movements, two anti-European centrist groups and two nationalistic platforms from the now-splintered extreme-right National Front. "It's mad," said Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist.
But the madness reflects real differences. Some Gaullists like European integration; others equate it with the end of "la France." That is a very basic divergence to accommodate within a single party.
On the extreme right, both Jean-Marie Le Pen and his challenger, Bruno Megret, call for the rebirth of "national values" and attack "the disappearance of European races through general miscegenation." But such messages, while they rousing 15 percent of French people, do not win elections. They help divide the right.
In Germany, where the 16-year era of Helmut Kohl ended last year, Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Party has been organizing a petition to contest the Schroder Government's plans to introduce new citizenship laws that would allow many of the country's seven million foreigners to become Germans. Behind the petition, a nostalgia for a certain idea of the German nation clearly lies, one where only German blood gives the right to nationality. Also evident is real hostility to the ideas of what the right calls the "multicultural left."
But, again, it is far from clear that this sort of initiative can win what Mr. Eyal called "the critical broad church of the center." For Germany is now a mixed society, like it or not.
So, what to do? Clearly, in Britain and Germany the thirst for a change after long periods of right-wing rule has played a big role in the popularity of center-left parties. But the success of the center-right Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, in Spain, after years of socialist rule suggests there is nothing irreversible about the right's decline.
David Willetts, a Conservative member of the British Parliament, said the key to success lay in underlining the themes of freedom and prosperity against the "more regulated economy and nannying government" put forward by Mr. Blair.
Mr. Lellouche, the Gaullist, said the right must renew its leadership and unite around the themes of toughness against crime, strong defenses, skepticism about immigration and economic deregulation.
IN Germany, conservatives have suggested all sorts of potential vote-winning themes: personal responsibility, ecological concern, the preservation of a classical education as an important value, resistance against modernization as a dogma, a radical economic reform favoring initiative over social protection. But for the moment, the Christian Democratic Party is plainly at sea.
Still, one powerful example of a successful conservative society exists: the Bavaria fashioned by Edmund Stoiber, the leader of the Christian Social Union, the Christian Democrats' sister party. There unemployment is 7 percent, compared to a national average of more than 10 percent, high-tech companies are thriving, prosperity is widespread and Mr. Stoiber never tires of extolling beer-swilling "Bavarian traditions."
Jan Ross, a German journalist, has called this society a fusion of "laptops and leather shorts." It may well be peculiarly Bavarian. But Horst Teltschik, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Kohl and is now on BMW's board, said the message could have a wide appeal.
"What Mr. Stoiber has done is convince people they are safe at home and fit for the world," he said. "He has turned Bavaria into a modern high-tech state, while keeping its values. People feel secure, prosperous and ready to look outward: that can win elections."

Trying to Beat the Clock

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Alice Hector, a Miami lawyer who lost primary custody of her children to her ex-husband because of her long hours, has quit her job as a partner at a high-powered law firm. Ms. Hector said she decided to open her own firm with three other lawyers from Miami's Steel, Hector & Davis because she wanted to be able to leave work early a couple of afternoons a week to be with her two young girls.
"This gives me more flexibility," Ms. Hector said of her new firm, Hector & Harke. "I think it will be exactly what I need." 
 In June, a Florida appeals court awarded primary custody of the two girls to their father, Robert Young. The appeals court said that Mr. Young, who had been unemployed for several years, had become the main provider of care for the children because of Ms. Hector's late hours. Ms. Hector has appealed that decision. MELODY PETERSEN

Even Hedge Funds Have a Heart

 BODY:
The people who run hedge funds -- those highflying but arcane investment vehicles that touched off a financial panic last year -- want you to know they care. In fact, a group holding a charity banquet on Feb. 9 at the Pierre Hotel at Fifth Avenue and 61st Street in Manhattan is called Hedge Funds Care.
"People in the hedge fund industry are feeling as though they have been prosperous and lucky in life, and are trying to do something good," said Rob Davis, managing director at Montgomery Prime Brokerage Services, a division of Nationsbanc Montgomery Services, who is organizing the benefit to aid victims of child abuse. He hopes to raise at least $400,000. 
 Hedge fund managers and the brokers, lawyers and accountants who serve them will pony up $12,000 a table to take part in the event, which will feature an auction of sports memorabilia. Luminaries who plan to attend include Charles Schaffran, who oversees the hedge funds at Alliance Capital, and Joel Press, a senior partner at Ernst & Young. So far, though, Mr. Davis says, he hasn't gotten around to calling the folks at Long-Term Capital Management, the Greenwich, Conn., fund that was taken over by a group of 14 banks and securities firms last year after its $4.8 billion of capital was nearly wiped out.

The January Barometer Points Upward

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
With all major stock market indicators climbing on Friday, one of Wall Street's favorite phenomena, the buoyant January effect, came through again.
 Add that to the theory that as January goes, so goes the year, and investors had reason to celebrate. The incredible January barometer has had only three errors in 48 years, Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation, told Reuters. He added that the market was almost guaranteed to finish the year with another gain after posting double-digit ad-vances in the last four years. 
 With demand for technology stocks driving the mar-ket, the Nasdaq composite index topped 2,500 for the first time, closing at 2,505.89, up 7.1 percent for the week. The staid Dow Jones industrial average rose a respectable 2.6 percent, closing at 9,358.83.
 Not that the sky looks completely sunny. Brazil's shaky economy still worried investors, who feared a spreading malaise. But while the currency, the real, declined, Brazil's stock market advanced last week, with the Bovespa index up nearly 1,000 points at 8,171.56.
 Markets in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Amsterdam, Madrid and Tokyo backed and filled last week, closing with modest gains. JAN M. ROSEN

HEADLINE: Wary U.S. Broods on a Peace Effort Minus King Hussein

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
With King Hussein of Jordan lying gravely ill from cancer in a hospital in Minnesota, senior Clinton Administration officials say they are alarmed at the prospect of pursuing a comprehensive peace in the Middle East without the Arab leader widely seen as most committed to the goal.
American officials had hoped that the King's decision to return home this month after six months of cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota was a sign that his health had improved, and that he might remain on the throne for at least a few more years. 
 But those hopes were dashed when the King's doctors announced that his lymphatic cancer had returned. The King will undergo a bone-marrow transplant beginning on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse quoted Jordan's Ambassador to the United States, Marwan Moasher, as saying today.
The frail, painfully gaunt 63-year-old monarch returned to the United States this week, but not before dismissing his brother as heir and naming instead his 36-year-old eldest son. The palace intrigue shocked Jordanians and many foreign leaders, who had come to take the country's political stability for granted.
"The importance of King Hussein to Jordan and to the region can hardly be overstated," Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said in an interview. "This is someone of enormous integrity and courage who believes deeply in broadening the peace process, and who has been prepared to take risks for that -- political and personal."
Another senior Administration official said: "King Hussein has led his country for almost half a century, most of that time as a good friend of the United States and a vital proponent of Middle East peace. And it's strange and frightening to think of the peace process without him."
King Hussein's illness has complicated the peace effort by unsettling Israel's political and military leaders as their negotiations with the Palestinians are gridlocked and as Israel prepares for national elections. Political candidates have already made mention of the King's illness in noting the dangers that face Israel from its Arab neighbors.
Despite Jordan's humiliating defeat in the 1967 war, when the Israelis captured eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank, King Hussein has been that rare thing for Israel in recent years: a reliable friend in the Arab world. Since offending Arab neighbors by signing a peace agreement with Israel in 1994, he has done more than any other Arab leader to shift it from pariah status.
President Clinton was desperate last October to avoid breakdown of a summit meeting in Maryland between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. So he called on King Hussein to leave his sickbed in Minnesota and join in the negotiations. In announcing an interim peace agreement three days later, President Clinton said the King was "at the heart of this success."
King Hussein, who came to power in 1952, when he was only 16, has brought Jordan prominence all out of proportion to its size and economic and military might. With a population of four million people, Jordan is an impoverished, landlocked, resource-poor nation surrounded by oil-rich neighbors -- some threatening, notably Iraq to the east.
Clinton Administration officials and scholars who have closely studied Jordan say they are convinced that Crown Prince Abdullah is committed to the policies of his father, especially King Hussein's devotion to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
"Abdullah and the other children have been raised by a father who has for his entire life been committed to peace," said Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations who knows the King and his family well. "I don't think Abdullah wanted power. I don't think he really expected it. But he is absolutely prepared for it."
Mr. Berger shared Ms. Kipper's appraisal of Prince Abdullah, who was educated in part at Georgetown University in Washington. "We've had a lot of contact with the Crown Prince over the years," Mr. Berger said, "and he is a very bright man, highly respected in the Jordanian military. I think that the Crown Prince is deeply committed to the peace process."
But it is undeniable that Prince Abdullah, who has spent his career in the military, has little background in politics or economics, and that Jordan's neighbors may quickly try to exploit his inexperience.
"It's hard to imagine that Assad and Saddam won't see him as a child," said a senior Administration official, referring to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and President Saddam of Hussein of Iraq, who have both been in power for nearly three decades."That does carry great danger, especially if Iraq tries to make trouble."
Iraq is thought to be a particular threat, given President Hussein's call this month for the overthrow of neighboring Arab governments that have supported economic sanctions against Iraq. An estimated 300,000 Iraqis live in Jordan, and many are loyal to the Iraqi leader.
American officials say they made a quick decision last week to offer as much public support as possible to Prince Abdullah to bolster his standing at home and in the region.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright hastily rearranged a Middle East tour to include a visit to Amman, the Jordanian capital, to meet the Prince and express confidence in the stability of a key American ally. "I wanted to stop here to make very clear that the U.S. stands with Jordan," she said.
Western diplomats who have served in Jordan say King Hussein's decision last week to overturn decades-old succession plans and name Prince Abdullah as heir was not so surprising, especially if his death is near.
While the King's brother and longtime heir apparent, Prince Hassan, is widely respected for his intelligence and commitment to the Middle East peace effort, he is also considered aloof. He has inspired little affection among the people and the military.
"Prince Abdullah does have the tie with the military, which is the bedrock of stability in Jordan," said Roscoe S. Suddarth, the American Ambassador to Jordan from 1987 to 1990. "I think all of his instincts will be very much to follow in his father's footsteps. On balance, I'd say that he's a good choice."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Hope Plan for Wide Tax Cut Will Unite Party

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
In placing income tax reductions at the heart of their agenda this year, Republican leaders are hoping to rally their fractious party around an issue they have long believed is economically sound as well as politically appealing.
Although the stars in many ways are lined up in the Republicans' favor -- the Federal Government's coffers are overflowing -- they face a difficult battle to enact their plan. 
 Already, some Republicans acknowledge that their real goal this year is to force a debate on a big tax cut, pass it even if President Clinton is sure to veto it and use the issue to define what their party stands for heading into the 2000 elections.
"We will lose if we don't have an agenda that includes bold examples of economic common sense," said Frank Luntz, a Republican poll taker who has long argued that taxes are the most powerful issue available to the party. "This is not only good politics but honest, good Republican principle."
The skirmishing over fiscal policy as the nation moves from an era of huge budget deficits to one of projected surpluses will intensify on Monday, when Mr. Clinton sends Congress his budget proposals for next year. The President has framed the debate in a way that suggests cutting taxes would imperil efforts to insure the viability of the Social Security and Medicare systems, a political maneuver that Republicans say is misleading but that nonetheless could be hard for them to counter.
Democrats also say that an across-the-board reduction in the tax rate would favor the rich over the middle class, a longstanding argument but one that continues to put Republicans on the defensive. Moreover, Democrats have their own agenda of narrowly drawn tax cuts intended to help specific groups like parents with children, an approach they hope will neutralize the political advantage Republicans have long held on the issue.
There are encouraging signs for the Democrats. A survey this month by the Pew Research Center asked which party had the best ideas on tax cuts. The Democrats were favored over Republicans, 45 percent to 32 percent, roughly the same breakdowns as on traditional Democratic issues like education, Social Security and patients' rights.
"The public overwhelmingly favors saving Social Security to tax cuts and prefers targeted tax cuts as a means of solving problems to across-the-board tax cuts," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. "The basic fact is that the Republicans have run out of compelling things to say to the American people."
Confident that tax-cutting remains a potent issue for them, Republicans are piecing together the final details of their initial legislative tax-cutting proposals. Republican aides said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, would introduce a plan soon under which income tax rates could be cut as much as 14 percent across the board over the next decade. But the cuts would be phased in slowly. For next year, the cut would probably be no more than 1 percent, building to as much as 4 percent in 2002 and to 14 percent in 2009.
The Domenici plan is based on estimates of future budget surpluses released on Friday by the Congressional Budget Office. Those estimates showed that the Government would have an overall surplus of nearly $2.7 trillion from this year through 2009. Most of the surplus is accounted for by excess payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for Social Security.
But starting in 2001, the Government will begin running a surplus even without relying on revenues from the Social Security payroll tax, money that Republicans say makes it possible to cut taxes without endangering Social Security. Under that accounting, the budget surplus over the next decade that does not come from Social Security taxes would be nearly $800 billion, and Mr. Domenici is considering using about $640 billion of that to reduce income tax rates.
Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota is working on a 10 percent across-the-board rate cut that could be phased in more quickly than Mr. Domenici envisions. Former Vice President Dan Quayle advocates a 30 percent across-the-board rate cut.
Enacting a 10 percent across-the-board reduction would reduce the current top rate of 39.6 percent to 35.6 percent, and the 28 percent rate to 25.2 percent.
Income tax rate reductions across the board are one of the few issues on which economic and social conservatives are united, Republicans said, and one of the best ways for the party to hammer home its message that the Government should be smaller and less intrusive.
"The across-the-board tax cut says Washington doesn't have all the answers," Mr. Grams said, "and it insures that your family's dollars are spent on family priorities, not on Washington's spending schemes."
The economic argument over income tax rate reductions centers on whether it is fair to low- and middle-income workers, and on whether tax cuts are the best way of bringing more economic growth.
A study this month by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research organization, found that 62 percent of the benefits of a 10 percent across-the-board income tax reduction would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. The bottom 60 percent would get less than 10 percent of the benefits of the cut.
"Rather than embracing the Administration's plan for saving Social Security now and strengthening Medicare," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, Republicans are intent on pushing through "a massive G.O.P. tax cut for the wealthy."
Republicans said they were resigned to similar Democratic attacks throughout the debate. But they said there was a strong case to be made that an across-the-board rate cut would be a good thing for the economy by stimulating more consumption and savings. And they said tax cuts would surely be fairer and more productive than allowing Democrats to spend the money.
"When, if not now, would we cut taxes?" said Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan. "If we can see trillions of dollars in surplus in the years ahead, when will we ever have a day in which there isn't some new program or old program, or some new idea that somebody comes up with, that somehow warrants keeping the money here?"
So far this year, Republicans have been united in rallying around an income tax cut. But their tax-cutting agenda fell victim last year to squabbling within the party's ranks, and some Republicans remain wary of Mr. Clinton's ability to maneuver them into a situation in which they do not manage to pass the kind of big tax cut they are discussing.
"There's only one risk for Republicans and it's a significant one," said Mr. Luntz, the poll taker. "That is to promise the public a tax cut and then not deliver. It's one thing for Bill Clinton to veto it. It's another to talk about it and then not pass it."

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks More Money To Reduce Gap in Wages

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Clinton today called for a $14 million initiative to close the gap between men's and women's wages, and new legislation to strengthen equal pay laws.
"When a woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just hurt her," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "It hurts her family. And that hurts America." 
 Last summer, the President's Council of Economic Advisers reported that women earned about 75 cents for every dollar a man earned -- an improvement from the 58 cents on the dollar that women earned when President John F. Kennedy signed the 1963 Equal Pay Act.
"We can be proud of this progress," Mr. Clinton said, "but 75 cents on the dollar is still only three-quarters of the way there, and Americans can't be satisfied until we're all the way there."
His $14 million proposal, part of the fiscal 2000 budget he will submit to Congress on Monday, would triple the number of enforcement workers at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, provide technical assistance to employers on how to comply with equal pay laws and create public service announcements alerting women to their rights.
The President also used his radio broadcast to call on the new 106th Congress to pass, as one of its first acts this year, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would allow women who have been discriminated against to sue their employers for unlimited compensatory and punitive damages, instead of to the limited damages and back-pay awards now available under Federal law.
The Republicans' address was delivered today by Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, who praised state measures that helped move people on welfare into schools and jobs.
Earlier this week, Mr. Clinton announced that the number of people on welfare had fallen to its lowest level in 30 years.
Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at the end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994.

HEADLINE: New York Hospitals Struggle With Flu Surge

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
New York City hospitals are struggling to manage a widespread flu epidemic that is stretching their emergency rooms and wards to overcapacity and forcing workers to ratchet up the overtime, doctors to cancel some elective surgeries and administrators to air out unused wards for patients who are flowing through the doors.
The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported only sporadic outbreaks of flu around most of the country, but it cites New York as one of a very few areas where the illness is extensive. "New York is definitely different from the rest of the nation," said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the centers. 
 Further, the strain of the virus most prevalent this season appears to be causing higher temperatures in patients and longer periods of coughing, vomiting and general misery than in years past. "This high fever is not typical of other flus," said Dr. Sigurd Ackerman, the president of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. "This one makes people feel sicker, quicker."
Those who are particularly suffering, many doctors said, are young children, whose bad flus quickly lead to ear infections and respiratory difficulties. Pediatricians around the city said in interviews that their offices had been overwhelmed this month, and emergency rooms were reporting a higher-than-normal number of children seeking treatment.
While city, state and Federal officials do not have data on the total number of flu cases this winter, hospital officials say that this January has been one of the worst months in memory.
"I haven't seen it this bad since 1989," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
As a result, most hospitals have been begging ambulance services to divert patients elsewhere and are resorting to desperate measures to house those who do come in.
"We have people double- and triple-parked in the E.R. on stretchers," said Dr. Elliot Friedman, the associate director of emergency medicine at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens, echoing accounts by other emergency room doctors in the city. "And there have been times when upwards of 40 people have been admitted but are waiting for someone to be discharged, so we can quickly clean a room and refill it. And every time you turn around, someone else is pulling another ambulance in while someone else is heaving into a bucket."
Although the flu does not automatically mean a trip to the emergency room, many of the city's uninsured seek all their health care through the E.R. Also, severe dehydration and other symptoms, especially among children and the elderly, sometimes create a need for emergency care.
Although no epidemic has been reported in the rest of the state, hospitals upstate have also had a tough January, aggravated by an ice storm that overwhelmed many emergency rooms with cases of broken bones at the same time that flu patients were arriving at the wards.
Hospital advocates are quick to point out that some of the overcrowding may be a result of centers' closing up beds in recent years to become economically efficient.
"The chickens have come home to roost," said Jeannie Cross, a spokeswoman for the Healthcare Association of New York State, a trade group representing hospitals in the northern part of the state. "Downsizing, taking beds out of service and so forth to adapt to competition are fine when the weather is good and there isn't a flu epidemic and ice storm."
At both hospitals run by Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, wards that were either long closed or under renovation were quickly reopened and staffed to deal with the influx of patients. A corner of one emergency room was turned into an intensive-care unit to serve five patients on respirators. Still others were sent to open beds on the oncology ward, and some patients awaiting elective surgeries were steered to the ambulatory units.
"We are operating above 100 percent capacity," said Dr. Brian Currie, the medical director of the acute-care division of both Montefiore hospitals. "We want patients to realize that the exasperating delays that seem like operational inconveniences are the same everywhere. We are trying really hard."
At Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side, the tales of woe are similar. "This is the most significant sustained volume I have seen in my 10 years of doing this," lamented Dr. Michael Marin, chief of emergency services there.
As a result, the hospital postponed renovation of a 14-bed unit and reopened it, filling its emergency rooms with more workers, in part to keep up with the heavy flow and in part to take the place of doctors and nurses who have come down with the illness themselves.
And at the city's public hospitals, officials said that flu cases had risen anywhere from 33 percent to 240 percent when compared with last year's, with Elmhurst Hospital Center suffering the most.
In theory, conditions should not be this bad. The most common bug medical workers are seeing is the Type A Sydney variety, which causes respiratory problems. That strain was contained in the flu shot, which gives immunity to 75 percent of those who take it, said Dr. Ilya Spigland, Montefiore's director of virology.
The "stomach flu," which is not a flu at all, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control, has also hit many people this year, landing them in the emergency rooms, too.
Virology experts seem to agree that it is more or less impossible to predict the route a virus will take, or to say why it is prevalent in one area over another. "I don't know what the reason is," Dr. Spigland said. "Perhaps it is because New York is a dense urban population with people exposing each other, and it is also very possible that the increase in respiratory infections may not be due to the flu."
But the misery it causes is never ambiguous. Yolanda Lopez found herself on Wednesday night in the emergency room waiting area of New York Methodist Hospital in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. Ms. Lopez, a 42-year-old maintenance worker, said that after two days of fevers and vomiting, she had decided to come by. After waiting more than six hours she still had not seen a doctor. Her 15-year-old daughter, Kathy, had been admitted to Methodist on Sunday and released Wednesday after her own bout with the flu.
"I never get sick," Ms. Lopez said. "I've been vomiting, running fever, I have a pain in my stomach. It's been terrible. My boss told me, 'Don't come back until you get better.' "
Hospitals are not the only ones under strain. Pediatricians around the city have said they cannot wait for this season to end. "We gave the shots, but they keep coming in," said Dr. Alessandra Zullo, of West 11th Street Pediatrics in Manhattan.
Dr. Robert Saken, a partner in the SoHo Pediatrics Group, said he had to hospitalize some children for dehydration. "It has been horrible," he said. "The kids are having really high fevers and coughing like crazy and then the parents get sick and it is stressful for everyone."

HEADLINE: Clinton Backs Environmental Power-Sharing

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The environmental proposals that the Clinton Administration is sending to Congress in its budget request for 2000 include new ways of delivering money to state and local governments to spend as they see fit, a sign that environmental power-sharing is taking a firmer hold than ever before.
The Administration is seeking to spend $34 billion on environmental programs in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, a 5 percent increase over the amount Congress approved for the current fiscal year. 
 Among other things, the White House is seeking expanded grants of conservation funds to states for purchasing ecologically sensitive lands; Federal payments to cities for controlling the air pollutants that cause global warming; tax credits to make it cheaper for local authorities to issue bonds for environmental purposes, and bigger Federal contributions to state revolving funds that pay for municipal water treatment.
Some of the money is aimed at specific states for particular purposes, like a program announced this week that would help California, Oregon and Washington protect the habitat of endangered salmon.
But if Congress agrees with these plans, the states and the cities would compete for most of the money and would largely control how it is spent.
Administration officials said that the pattern showed a heightened commitment to shifting more power over environmental programs away from Washington, meeting a goal long cherished by local officials and a policy frequently urged by Republicans in Congress. This approach also carries significant political advantages for the White House.
Buried in the budget are ideas that include a new financing tool called "better America bonds," which would use $700 million in Federal tax incentives to help generate $9.5 billion in bond authority over the next five years. States that borrowed this money at subsidized interest rates could choose to spend it to create parks, protect water quality and clean up the abandoned industrial sites known as "brownfields."
"This is a big turning point," said Carol M. Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. She said it grew from the agency's past efforts to encourage local governments to clean up brownfields.
"In the brownfields program, E.P.A. never wrote a single rule or regulation," Ms. Browner said. "E.P.A. never said it is this property and that property that qualify. And in the better America bonds program, E.P.A. will allot the tax incentives, but E.P.A. will never make the decisions that it is this green space or that green space that qualifies."
The state role in environmental programs is not completely new.
Over the years, as one Federal law after another set national environmental standards, the states have assumed much of the responsibility for carrying out the mandates under Federal supervision.
That trend has been accelerating. By 1998, the E.P.A. had delegated responsibility to individual states for managing 757 environmental programs, an increase of 323, or nearly 75 percent, from five years earlier.
The Federal Government provides only 20 percent of the money that the states spend on the environment, according to the Environmental Council of the States, which comprises the heads of state environmental agencies. But for a number of reasons, pragmatic and political, the Administration seems to be emphasizing the states' role in the new budget.
First, it might help ease the strains between states and Federal authorities over environmental priorities, chiefly how strictly to enforce national environmental laws. This has been a source of friction.
Second, it might help persuade Congress to increase overall environmental spending, an area of the budget in which the White House has fought bitterly year after year with appropriations committees controlled by Republicans.
Third, it might make some specific Administration initiatives more palatable to opponents in Congress. An example is the program to fight global warming by controlling the waste gases that scientists say threaten to disrupt the planet's climate.
Finally, expanding Federal spending in states, cities and counties from coast to coast is an obvious tool for Vice President Al Gore, the Administration's point man on matters environmental, to highlight his accomplishments as he runs for President.
Several state officials said they were pleased by the trend, especially the emphasis on the state and local role in a $1 billion land conservation initiative at the center of the Administration's environmental budget.
The initiative includes $150 million from the Federal land and water conservation fund for matching grants to states for land purchases; $50 million for planning to control urban sprawl; $80 million for acquiring land to protect endangered species; $50 million for conservation easements on privately owned forest land; $40 million for wooded urban areas; $50 million to help protect farmland from urban encroachment, and a few smaller initiatives.
David Struhs, who left his job this week as Massachusetts's environmental commissioner to take a similar post in the new administration of Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, said that he believed the Administration was "on the right track" for both substantive and political reasons.
"The one thing that the Clinton Administration does better than most is they make sure they have truth-tested these things in the public opinion polls before they roll them out," Mr. Struhs said.
And he said the governors are hearing the same messages, especially on conservation of lands.
"If you actually listen to and read the rhetoric of Al Gore on these issues and compare it to Gov. Paul Cellucci in Massachusetts and Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida, there are remarkable parallels in where they see environmental policy going," Mr. Struhs said.
Other political figures, though, were more skeptical.
"I am a little ambivalent when the Government creates what are sometimes irrational requirements for cities, then gives them a little money to help deal with them," said the Republican Mayor of Indianapolis, Stephen Goldsmith.
Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, the Republican chairman of a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that deals with environmental programs, said that he had always supported generous financing for the state's revolving funds, which pay for many clean air and water programs, but that he did not yet know enough about the Administration's new programs to endorse them.
"This Administration, like the other administrations before it, has had a habit of creating a whole bunch of boutique programs each year, and taking a few dollars for this and a few dollars for that," Mr. Bond said. "I have generally opposed creating more boutique programs until we can fund the ones that already exist."
Among the new programs is a "clean air partnership fund" that will provide $200 million to states and localities to reduce so-called greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from automobiles and coal-powered electric plants.
The money can be used to provide low-interest loans or matching grants, potentially increasing the amount of investment flowing from the relatively small Federal contribution.
Similarly, $100 million sought for 2000 in new assistance to state, local and tribal governments would be matched dollar for dollar by local governments willing to spend the money to protect salmon habitat by buying conservation easements, planting trees along river banks and taking similar steps.
"A year from now, a substantial part of the Northwest, including large urban areas near the Puget Sound, are going to be endangered salmon habitat," said George Frampton, the acting director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. "Regulation alone, listing the salmon as endangered, isn't going to get the salmon restored to health. It is going to take a partnership of the counties, the mayors, companies like Boeing and Microsoft, and the Federal Government to address this problem."

HEADLINE: Briton Issues An Ultimatum To Both Sides Over Kosovo

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain told Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian leaders today that they must show up in France next weekend to negotiate effective self-government for Serbia's battle-ravaged Kosovo province or face NATO bombing and other military action to force them to negotiate agreement.
Mr. Cook said President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia promised him a speedy response to the demands of the six-nation "contact group" on the Balkans. As usual, Mr. Milosevic did not appear in public, speaking instead to his domestic and foreign audiences through news media and other officials. 
 For the Serbian audience, the official Yugoslav news agency, Tanyug, quoted him as reiterating to Mr. Cook that Kosovo's problems should be solved in Serbia -- rather than at a conference abroad. Meanwhile, other Serbian officials in interviews today expressed a wary willingness to attend the talks in France.
Simultaneously, Serbian forces in Kosovo continued to hit the ethnic Albanian fighters hard, to seize as much ground as possible before negotiations begin, Western diplomats here said, while there was a grenade attack on a Serbian cafe in the Kosovo capital, Pristina, and another reported attack on a Serbian couple in a fiercely contested village.
Mr. Cook acted on behalf of the six nations of the Balkan contact group -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Italy. He said he emphasized to Mr. Milosevic the need to reach a settlement in February and the unity of the international demand for Kosovo's self-government in the Yugoslav Federation, which is made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr. Cook then flew on to Skopje, Macedonia, to meet ethnic Albanian leaders including Ibrahim Rugova, the nonviolent elected leader of the Albanians, and Adem Demaci, who has connections to the armed Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Mr. Cook also told them to go to France prepared to negotiate and reach an interim settlement that will let Kosovo run its own affairs, but not give it independence, with Kosovo's future status to be determined after three years.
Mr. Cook told reporters afterward that Mr. Rugova was willing to attend the talks, but that Mr. Demaci would reply in a few days, Agence France-Presse reported from Skopje. "I insisted that we would expect that to be a positive reply," Mr. Cook was quoted as saying.
Serbian officials close to Mr. Milosevic said he was likely to send a delegation to the talks. He would not go there himself, but instead probably send Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian President and a Milosevic loyalist, whom Mr. Cook also met today.
Mr. Milosevic is said by these officials to resent the pressure of the West to sacrifice Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo, which was the heart of the Serbs' medieval empire and is the cradle of Serbian nationalism, and to fear that he could be arrested on a secret indictment for war-crimes charges if he leaves Belgrade.
Mr. Milosevic is widely considered the main architect of the Bosnian Serbs' aggression during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia. But Western leaders have never mentioned any indictment, nor given any public indication that he would be called to account for alleged war crimes by facing the United Nations tribunal for war crimes in The Hague, the Netherlands.
The Serbian officials, insisting on anonymity, said Mr. Milosevic was likely to concede only when pressed very strongly by NATO and its bomb threats, so he can explain his concessions to his people without paying a significant political price.
The same officials noted that Kosovo is a political and financial drain for Belgrade, and if NATO is willing to take responsibility for restraining the rebels and keeping Kosovo from independence for three years, Mr. Milosevic may see that as an advantage. This would be especially true if he can also win a lifting of international economic sanctions against Belgrade.
On Friday, state television here showed Mr. Milosevic telling the visiting Russian Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, that Yugoslavia "advocates a peaceful solution to the problems in Kosovo through direct political dialogue with representatives of national communities in Kosovo and state institutions."
Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, in an interview today, said "there is no reason for us to say 'no' now." He noted, though, that the federal Government and Mr. Milosevic had not yet made a decision.
Mr. Draskovic, a recent addition to the Milosevic Government, said he favored a negotiated solution, but with these preconditions: that there be "no independent Kosovo, no 'greater Albania,' and no equal status for Kosovo as a third republic within Yugoslavia -- that is a secret name for an independent Kosovo."
Mr. Draskovic also insisted on equal rights for all citizens of Kosovo, including the minority Serbs, who make up only about 10 percent of the estimated population of two million but currently run all its affairs.
There should be no independent state institutions such as the police set up by the ethnic Albanians, Mr. Draskovic said.
But the ethnic Albanian leaders all seek independence, and the Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for it. The Albanians are finding it hard to unite under one negotiating position and one delegation.
Pleurat Sejdiu, a rebel spokesman based in London, reacted cautiously to the contact group's demands, saying: "We are not rejecting the Contact Group statement. We just can't say anything positive about it. This is not the time to talk. The fighting has to stop."
On Friday, 24 more Albanians, a few of them dressed in K.L.A. uniform, were killed by the Serbian police. International monitors said a number of them appeared to have been shot in the head at close range. The monitors' leader, the American diplomat William Walker, said in an interview today that an investigation into the deaths was in progress.
Also Friday night, six Serbs were badly wounded when a grenade exploded outside a Pristina cafe owned by Serbs. In Pristina, the Serb Media Center today said a Serb civilian was killed and his wife seriously wounded when assailants threw a grenade into their bedroom. The attack occurred in the contested northwestern Kosovo village of Rakos.

THE GRAND STRATEGY
OF PHILIP II
By Geoffrey Parker.
Illustrated. 446 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $35. 
 Philip II, contemporaries were fond of saying, ruled over the greatest empire that ever was. In fact, the Roman Empire at its height occupied far more inhabited space. But he certainly ruled over the most extensive empire, and -- with the conquest of the Philippines in 1565 -- the first truly global one. When he died in 1598 he was the most powerful monarch in the Western world. But he left behind a badly weakened conglomerate of states, divided religiously and culturally, economically unstable and, at least in Europe, in retreat. His successors, Philip III and Philip IV, would be able to do little as Spain steadily lost ground to its old rival France and the rising new commercial powers of England and the Netherlands. Like all those who sought to control what Edmund Burke called "extensive and detached empire," Philip faced a finally intractable problem of how to keep together regions that were distant from Spain and from one another and whose sense of attachment to their King could be tenuous at times. As the Roman historian Livy famously remarked, every empire had been built up one piece at a time, but it had to be held together as a whole. In the days before modern information technology and modern weaponry, however, holding it together as a whole had, as the Romans themselves discovered, generally proved to be impossible.
Geoffrey Parker has already written extensively about Philip. His new book is not so much a biography, although it covers much of Philip's life in painstaking detail, as a consideration of the question: Did Philip II have a "grand strategy" for holding his empire together, and if so what was it? Parker does not really provide an answer, although the book ends by assuming that he did, and that, although in general it was not exactly a failure, it could have been better. On his death, Philip had lost a part of what both he, like his father Charles V before him, regarded as the jewel in their crown: the Netherlands. True, he was able to hold on to most of what is now modern Belgium and Luxembourg, but only at crippling expense. The war against the Dutch, one of his advisers lamented, was a "voracious monster which gobbles up the troops and treasure of Spain."
The creation of a new state in Holland -- Protestant and republican -- was also a crushing ideological blow. He had added Portugal, and with Portugal all the Portuguese settlements overseas, and the Philippines, and consolidated his hold over large areas of Central and South America. However, it was clear that Portugal could not be maintained for long, while English and Dutch privateers preyed constantly on Portuguese and Spanish shipping in the East and West Indies. England -- against which in 1588 he had sent the greatest fleet ever assembled -- was a lot stronger at the end of his reign than at the beginning. The Protestant Reformation, the source of most of his difficulties, had divided Europe permanently in two and unleashed confessional wars that would not cease until well into the following century.
Philip's overextended domains presented many problems that were to afflict subsequent imperial rulers. Like his great rival, the Ottoman Sultan, and such later imperial rulers as Stalin and Hitler (all of whom Parker compares him with) Philip had constantly to shift attention from one front to another. In the north he had the Dutch rebels, England and the French Protestants to contend with, in the south and east the Turks, and potential dissidents everywhere. Yet, as he himself once wrote, "one cannot deal effectively with more than one thing at a time." His financial resources were greater than those of any other European ruler. Yet the costs of incessant warfare were so high that the monarchy was frequently bankrupt, and in March 1588 Philip was even driven to sell his wife's jewelry.
Philip's greatest problem, however, was himself. Called by those who admired him "the prudent King," at best an ambiguous compliment, he insisted on handling even the smallest detail of his vastly complex administration himself. When one minister apologized, saying, "I am sorry to fatigue your Majesty with such trifling matters," he replied, "They do not fatigue me, they delight me!" He was obsessed not only with matters of state, but details of etiquette, nuances of grammar, building plans and titles used at court. He worked excessive hours and generated more paper than any monarch before or since. As he grew older he complained increasingly of the strain. In February 1587 he took to his bed with arthritis, brought on, he believed, by overwork, and did not emerge until July. In the meantime Sir Francis Drake sacked the city of Cadiz.
Philip's personalization of power was accompanied by a belief that only he should be fully informed on every detail of any situation. He was deeply distrustful of even his most intimate associates, many of whom were close members of his own family, and inevitably he did everything with painstaking slowness. In a world in which news traveled slowly and uncertainly this could be disastrous. In his long central chapters on the Armada, Parker shows how delay and distrust were perhaps the key factors in one of Philip's most humiliating defeats. The English had the weather on their side. They had superior ships and better guns. But if it had not been for Philip's "prudence" they might still have been invaded in 1588.
Parker makes frequent comparisons between Philip's apparent strategies and those employed by modern commanders to show that despite the great differences separating the 16th from the 20th century, problems of international warfare remain largely similar in structure. This is a history that moves backward from the strategic concerns of today; that gives it an edge and an immediacy few other books on Philip have achieved. It also insists that human actions are the outcome not, as so many historians have insisted, of long-term economic or social forces, but of acts of will. Philip was as constrained as any ruler by economics (which he barely understood), by the social world into which he had been born, by climate and geography and, perhaps most of all, by his religious beliefs. But his actions, and the "grand strategy," not to mention the many lesser strategies, he pursued throughout his long reign were ultimately the outcome of his own decisions. To understand those we have to understand the man. Parker's highly detailed but also immensely readable book has come far closer to that than any previous account of the most enigmatic of Spanish kings.
