HEADLINE: Martin Marietta Net Down

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Martin Marietta Corporation said today that third-quarter net income fell 8 percent from a year earlier, when earnings were helped by one-time gains.
Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $100.1 million, or $2 a share, compared with $108.8 million, or $2.16 a share, in the 1990 quarter. Sales slipped 4 percent, to $1.44 billion from $1.49 billion. 
 Earnings in the 1990 quarter were helped by $12.6 million gain from a real estate sale and the resolution of a legal arbitration. Without those gains, 1991 third-quarter earnings would have been up 4.7 percent.
The electronics, information and missiles group reported higher earnings, while the astronautics group had a slight dip in sales and earnings, largely because of the phase-out of the Peacekeeper program.
A decline in sales and earnings in the company's materials group was attributed to the recession.
Martin Marietta shares closed at $50 apiece today, down 50 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
End of the Game For Motor City?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
TO the armies of auto company lawyers, victory in the trade war over mini-vans turns on definitions: Have Toyota and Mazda "dumped" the car-truck hybrids by selling them to Americans below the price charged Japanese consumers, as the plaintiffs allege? If the Japanese did sin by offering better deals in Toledo than Tokyo, did they "injure" Chrysler, Ford and General Motors in the process?
But to many analysts, Detroit's decision to seek protection in the anti-dumping laws says more about the companies' survival strategies than Japanese prices. A decade after the Big Three vowed to beat the Japanese on cost and quality, they are still losing market share. Apparently the goal now is to convince the Japanese to ease off. 
 The mini-van market seems an odd site for a trade skirmish. American makers sell roughly 9 out of every 10 mini-vans. And their two Japanese rivals have made no attempt to elbow their way into the heart of the market, aiming instead at the high end where Japanese vehicles are prized for cachet as well as quality.
The case is even more puzzling because it strains the already fuzzy economic logic behind dumping rules. Dumping is usually seen as unfair because foreigners are assumed to be selling cheaply abroad after recouping their overhead back home. But the primary market for Japanese mini-vans is America. Thus if the Japanese dump them here they have no hope of making a profit.
The Japanese flatly deny the dumping charge. And they insist that Detroit cannot have been injured by their modest sales in the one segment of the car market that is still showing healthy growth. But David Palmeter, an American lawyer who heads the International Bar Association's trade law subcommittee, argues that dumping suits are hard to beat because the law is stacked in favor of plaintiffs. For example, the Commerce Department uses an average of all sales to compute the defendant's home market price, while it uses the lowest available price in the American market for purposes of comparison.
In any event, a legal victory may not be necessary for Detroit to accomplish its objective. Robert Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institution, sees the suit as a warning to the Japanese to keep margins high or face the political consequences. And while Toyota denies it, the warning may already have been heeded. The big Japanese auto maker just raised the sticker on its already pricey Previa model by 10 percent -- double the average increase on its cars.
But a victory on mini-vans would hardly constitute a knockout blow. And by all accounts, Detroit will have a hard time defending its remaining turf.
Critics agree that American cars look better, drive better and are more reliable than standard Detroit iron of the mid-1980's. But better has not proved good enough to slow the Japanese. Nor is there evidence that Japanese auto makers are about to pause to sniff the cherry blossoms. Snazzy new models like the Mazda 929 are piling into the market for near-luxury sedans, challenging yet another profit center for Detroit.
Most ominous, argues Clifford Winston, Mr. Crandall's colleague at Brookings, Japan is riding a wave of brand loyalty. While owners of aging American cars are tempted to shop around, few owners of Japanese cars are inclined to defect. Thus all those little Civics and Corollas purchased in the 1980's guarantee a market for the Toyota Camry and other upsized Japanese challengers to Ford's cash cow, the Taurus.
Ford and General Motors resist the protectionist label. But Lee Iacocca of Chrysler is not so coy. Last week he announced that Detroit's salvation lies in a quota on Japanese models -- one that includes Japanese "transplant" production in America as well as imports.
A cartel-like arrangement would not be well received by Toyota, which has never been a team player. But it might not displease the Japanese Government bureaucracy, which rarely passes up an excuse to meddle in exporters' affairs. Nor would it be anathema to most Japanese car companies , which learned to enjoy the "voluntary" restraints that limited Japanese sales in the mid-1980's -- and allowed everyone to raise prices by thousands of dollars a vehicle.
The big question, then, is how far Washington will to go to keep Chrysler alive and the Big Two kicking. Two years ago, the Bush Administration would have laughed away the idea of muscling Japan to raise car prices. But then, two years ago Detroit did not expect to lose $6 billion in 1991, and George Bush did not expect to be running for re-election with 6.7 percent unemployment and economic growth on hold.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Coke vs. Pepsi As an Investment

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
COKE and Pepsi are often compared on taste and on the potency of their advertising, as people did recently when Pepsi introduced a new logo. But how do the companies compare as investments?
"They are two different animals," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco. Other experts also view the two companies as a study in contrasts. 
 The Coca-Cola Company is essentially a one-product company with a global focus, whereas Pepsico Inc. does business mostly in the United States, and soft drinks account for only about a third of its profits. Chips are Pepsi's biggest business, contributing 42 percent of profits, while restaurants account for the rest.
The companies battle for the soft-drink market primarily in the United States, a market that accounts for less than 20 percent of Coke's profits but about 30 percent of Pepsi's.
Buying Coke's stock is betting on the continued popularity of soft drinks in the international market, which is growing by about 10 percent a year, assuring Coke solid growth for years to come, analysts say.
"Coke is the best fundamental story I have ever followed," said George E. Thompson of Prudential Securities. "It's a true growth story."
In an average year, Coke's earnings grow by about 20 percent.
Coke's strength overseas "is more of a circumstance of history than anything else," Mr. Thompson said, pointing to a post-World War II pledge by a top Coke executive to provide free Cokes to G.I.'s stationed in Japan and Germany.
Thanks to that legacy, Coke today earns more money in Japan than in the United States. In all, 80 percent of its operating profits are from international markets.
Because of the immense potential of the international market and Coke's dominance -- the company says it controls nearly half the international soft-drink market -- analysts say Coke is likely to continue building its impressive record for shareholders. During the 1980's, the company's stock outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 by more than 3 to 1. Including dividend payments, Coke says, every $100 invested in Coke stock in 1980 was worth $1,231 in 1990.
Coke stock closed at $62.75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down 37.5 cents.
Mr. Goldman of Paine Webber expects Coke to continue growing by close to 20 percent a year. "We expect the stock price to grow at least with earnings," he said.
While Pepsico is having an off year, some analysts see an equally compelling investment.
Pepsi's plight illustrates the hurdles facing companies seeking the investment premiums awarded growth companies -- it is growing at a mere 9 percent rate during the recession. Pepsi stock closed yesterday at $27.125 a share, down 75 cents and off its 52-week high of $35.625.
"The stock has definitely lagged since early this year, and it's directly related to the lower trend in earnings," said Robert J. Cummins, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York.
Pepsi is hurting largely because of problems of its own making. Considered the first large consumer-products company to have identified consumers' interest in low prices, Pepsi kept prices low at its restaurant chains, which include Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken. The strategy gained market share, but now competitors have matched the cuts and profit margins are being hurt with no gain in new customers.
At the same time, the company faces heavy competition in the snack-food business and is cutting prices to maintain its dominant market share. The company recently eliminated 1,800 jobs, or 7 percent of the work force, at Frito-Lay Inc.
Mr. Cummins predicts that Pepsico's earnings will grow by 20 percent next year, and, as a result, the stock is one of his principal recommendations. "It's an unusually good buy at this price," he said, projecting that Pepsico would reach $36 to $40 a share in the next 12 months.
Mr. Thompson of Prudential favors Coke as a long-term investment, but he said that Pepsi had more potential to respond to an earnings rebound in the next 12 months.
Pepsico is also aggressively looking overseas. Frito-Lay is buying foreign snack companies, and Mr. Cummins said that Pepsico had an opportunity to establish Frito-Lay as a global snack-food brand matching Coke's record in the soft-drink business. "There is no other multinational company in that business," he said.
Pepsico is also trying to expand its restaurants and soft-drink business overseas, but is likely to stay out of Coke's way. Mr. Goldman of Paine Webber said, "You don't mess with an elephant in the jungle."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises in New York; Gold Prices Little Changed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was higher in New York and mixed overseas yesterday in trading that largely lacked direction.
Gold prices were little changed, with bullion rising 10 cents an ounce to close at $363.90 on the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $363.25, unchanged from late Monday. 
Analysts said the dollar traded in a narrow range and was unable to latch on to any trend.
The dollar did take some support from Bush Administration and Democratic proposals for a middle-income tax cut as a means of stimulating the economy. The proposals drove interest rates higher in the bond market, which is concerned that too much stimulus could drive up inflation, and in turn, interest rates.
But the prospect of higher interest rates is a positive sign for dollar traders. Like all currencies, the dollar is strengthened by higher rates, which increase foreign demand for American investments.
Many traders are awaiting the release tomorrow of figures on durable goods orders for September before making any significant moves. That is the only major economic indicator expected this week.
 
Yen Moves Lower
 There was more interest in foreign currencies yesterday than in the dollar itself. The dollar rose against the yen, which was hurt by expectations that interest rates will decline in Japan when a new Government takes office next month.
Japan's chief economic planner, Michio Ochi, quoted Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, as saying the trend for lower Japanese rates was "clear."
The dollar rose to 131.40 yen in New York, from 130.80 late Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.85 yen to close at 131.45 yen, and in London it was quoted at 131.10 yen.
The British pound gave way to the dollar, falling to $1.7085 in New York trading, from $1.7165 late Monday. In London, the pound slipped to $1.7145 from $1.7185.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.7000 German marks, up from 1.69333; 1.4850 Swiss francs, up from 1.4835; 5.7970 French francs, up from 5.7750; 1,270.75 Italian lire, up from 1,266.00, and 1.12635 Canadian dollars, up from 1.12625.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Fall

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The decline in yields on certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts continued unabated for another week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, the publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., that covers interest rates.
"While financial markets have long-term concerns about the prospect of inflation next year, savings yields, nevertheless, continue to show short-term declines," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "The numbers should fall even lower in the next few weeks." 
 Because of the steady fall in yields, Mr. Heady said there would be another cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate and in banks' prime rate this year. Both are key rates on which other rates are based.
The week's largest cut in yields on money market funds among New York area banks was made by the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, which lowered the yield by 26 basis points, to 4.33 percent. It also made the largest cut in three-month certificates of deposit, lowering the yield by 16 basis points, to 4.95 percent. For six-month certificates, the largest cut was made by National Westminster Bank, which dropped its yield by 15 basis points, to 4.92. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The Monitor's list shows 10 banks in the New York area with yields below 5 percent on six-month certificates.
At New York banks, the average yield on money market accounts has been cut to 4.66 percent, down 3 basis points, while the average yields on three-month and six-month certificates were down 4 points, to 4.84 percent and 4.93 percent, respectively.
At savings institutions in the New York area, yields were cut to 5.23, down 3 basis points, for money market accounts; to 5.30, down 2 basis points, for three-month certificates, and to 5.51, also down 2 basis points, for six-month certificates.
The Monitor said the average yields at 20 major banks outside the New York area had been cut by 5 basis points, to 4.87 percent, on money market accounts, and by 4 points, to 5.13 percent, for six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday interest rates rose, with the three-month bill auctioned at an average discount rate of 5.04 percent, up from 4.99 the previous week, and the six-month bill averaging 5.11 percent, compared with 5.03 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, October 23,1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

A Record Profit At McDonald's

 BODY:
Continued weak sales in the United States and in some foreign markets caused the McDonald's Corporation's revenues to drop 2 percent in the third quarter, although the company yesterday reported a record profit for the quarter.
Profits increased nearly 7 percent, to a record $258.7 million, compared with $242.2 million in the quarter a year earlier. Earnings per share increased 6 percent, to 71 cents, from 67 cents a year earlier. 
 Revenues fell nearly 2 percent, to $1.74 billion from $1.77 billion.
The company said the poor United States economy caused domestic revenues to drop. McDonald's did not disclose additional details, but it said the sale of some company-operated restaurants to franchisees also contributed to the lower revenues. Outside the United States, the troubled economies of Canada and Britain held revenue growth to just 1 percent in the quarter.
Jack M. Greenberg, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview that there were no signs that American sales would soon pick up. "We are still in a very difficult marketplace," he said, adding that the company was "awfully cautious" about the prospects for the next three months.
John J. Rohs, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York, said, "The difficulties domestically continued, and international results were far weaker than expected."
McDonald's stock fell $1 a share yesterday, to $35, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Bankers Trust Earnings Rise 8.8%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bankers Trust New York Corporation yesterday announced a greater-than-expected profit of $185 million in the third quarter, up 8.8 percent from a year ago, largely on the strength of increased revenues from its various trading activities.
The profit gain at Bankers Trust is a reminder that banks with specialties in trading are faring well, while those that rely more on lending have been troubled by a combination of weak loan demand and growing losses on delinquent and defaulted loans. 
 Among other large banking companies, the Mellon Bank Corporation said its third-quarter profits rose 6.1 percent. The Pittsburgh-based banking company would have reported a decline in earnings except for a profit from the sale of securities in its investment portfolio.
"Those banks with a lot of trading and risk-management expertise are doing well," said James Rosenberg, a banking analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. The business of what bankers call risk management -- creating and selling relatively new financial products, like swap contracts for interest rates, foreign exchange and commodities -- is a rapidly growing market with potential for continued growth, Mr. Rosenberg said.
"Companies such as Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan that have strong credit ratings and have made the investments in people who know the businesses are gaining market share at the expense of other banks," Mr. Rosenberg added. J. P. Morgan & Company last week said its third-quarter profits of $373 million were led by a doubling of trading revenues to $360 million.
Following are the details of the banks' results:
 
Bankers Trust
 At Bankers Trust, the third-quarter profit of $185 million equaled $2.17 a share, up from $170 million, or $1.98 a share, a year ago. It was one of the most profitable banks in the country during the quarter, with a return on equity of about 25 percent.
While Bankers Trust reduced its loans to $18 billion, from $20.8 billion a year ago, its revenues from trading increased 22.3 percent, to $323 million from $264 million. About $35 million of the increase was from trading in the market for loans to less-developed countries, where trading volume and prices have increased rapidly this year. Foreign exchange trading revenues fell sharply, to $40 million, from $118 million, but that decline was offset by a 93.8 percent gain in other trading revenues to $283 million from $146 million.
Bankers Trust also benefited from a slower growth rate in expenses, which grew by more than 19 percent annually during the five years ended with 1990. Expenses in the third quarter totaled $554 million, up only 3.9 percent from a year ago.
Bankers Trust stock rose after the earnings announcement, and ended the day at $63.625, up 37.5 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Mellon Bank
 The Mellon Bank announced third-quarter profits of $70 million, or $1.10 a share, up from $66 million, or $1.19 a share, a year ago. Earnings would have fallen except for a $38 million profit from the securities sale.
The bank said its earnings benefited from recent acquisitions and a widening of the spread between the rates it pays on deposits and the rates it collects on loans. But earnings were hurt by the need to set aside $80 million in a reserve for bad loans, up from $45 million a year ago.
The banking company said it wrote off as a loss $59 million of loans, up from $41 million a year ago, and that badly delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate on its books rose to $932 million from $907 million at midyear.
Mellon's stock rose 75 cents, to $35.375 a share, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Earnings Off At Three Oil Companies

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Several big oil companies reported lower earnings yesterday, as reduced prices for crude oil and natural gas and slack demand for chemical products pared profits.
Companies with operations mainly in the United States, where natural gas prices and gasoline demand declined more than in other nations, fared worse than companies with global operations. 
 Mobil said net income fell 3.7 percent in the third quarter, Texaco was off 24.9 percent and Phillips Petroleum 68.5 percent, while Ashland Oil rose 6.8 percent.
 
Surge at Occidental
 Occidental Petroleum, in the midst of a broad reorganization, said profits surged 58.3 percent on gains from the sales of several divisions.
Analysts said the rate of profit decline for top oil companies over all in the period ended Sept. 30 will be the steepest for any quarter since oil prices plunged from a peak near $40 a barrel in 1981.
"The industry fundamentals are lackluster," said George F. Friesen, senior oil analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital. "The third-quarter earnings are probably the bottom for the industry, but earnings comparisons will still be unfavorable for the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year."
Prices at most oil companies in the quarter averaged more than $4 a barrel below the levels a year ago, when prices surged in the months after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and remained high until the Persian Gulf war began in mid-January.
For example, Texaco said the average price for its sales of Middle Eastern crudes fell to $18.70 in the quarter, compared with an average of $24.60 in the comparable 1990 period.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Mobil
 Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company after the Exxon Corporation, said net income fell to $365 million, or 87 cents a share, from $379 million, or 89 cents a share, in the period last year. Revenues of the company, based in Fairfax, Va., fell 7.5 percent, to $15.03 billion from $16.25 billion.
Excluding special items that increased Mobil's profits sharply in the third quarter of 1990, the company posted a 47 percent increase in operating profits, to $395 million from $268 million. The biggest surge came from refining and marketing operations, which earned $173 million, compared with $5 million a year ago.
Allen E. Murray, chairman and chief executive, said lower crude and natural gas prices pared profits in the company's exploration and production operations in the United States.
But foreign operations reported no change in profits; lower crude prices and higher costs were offset by higher volumes of crude production, higher natural gas prices and wider profit margins in Nigeria.
The gains in refining and marketing reflected the unusually small profit from the quarter a year ago, when retail gasoline prices in the United States did not rise as rapidly as costs. For now, Mr. Murray said, refineries are operating at the highest rates in company history. "Excellent refinery performance continues to be a strong contributor to earnings," he said.
Mobil's share price gained 87.5 cents, to $72.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Texaco
 Net income for Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, fell to $286 million, or $1.01 a share, from $381 million, or $1.38 a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues fell 14.5 percent, to $9.36 billion from $10.95 billion.
"The economic slump in the United States, and several other major markets in turn has depressed the margins in chemicals as well as petroleum products," said James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive of Texaco, based in White Plains. "Market conditions have been particulary weak on the U.S. West Coast."
Profits in the international refining and marketing unit nearly doubled, to $118 million, from $61 million in the period a year ago, but results at most other divisions were lower.
Earnings from exploration and production in the United States fell to $129 million from $207 million, and in the foreign unit, profits fell to $89 million from $139 million. Profits in petrochemical manufacturing fell to $3 million from $12 million.
Spending on new plants and exploration was pared to $813 million, from $930 million in the period last year. Texaco's share price fell $1.125, to $64.875, on the Big Board.
 
Phillips
 Phillips's net income plunged to $56 million, or 21 cents a share, from $178 million, or 72 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1990. Revenues for the company, based in Bartlesville, Okla., fell 8.8 percent, to $3.1 billion from $3.4 billion.
The company said the decline was steeper if one-time profits from unusual transactions were removed. The special items included a $20 million gain from asset sales and a $19 million legal settlement on disputed Federal taxes.
"The slowdown in the U.S. economy continued to depress profits in our major chemicals product lines," said C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive.
Phillips Petroleum's share price fell 37.5 cents, to $26.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Occidental
 Occidental's net income rose to $171 million, or 56 cents a share, from $108 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter last year. Sales fell 14.8 percent, to $2.3 billion from $2.7 billion.
The Los Angeles-based company's report included several transactions in the quarter that were part of a wide-ranging reorganization begun early this year by Ray R. Irani, chairman and chief executive.
The company posted a gain of $534 million after taxes from the sale of oil-and-gas properties in the British North Sea. It lost $57 million in transferring its 51 percent stake in IBP Inc., the meat processor, to its shareholders.
Occidental's share price fell 75 cents, to $22.625, on the Big Board.
 
Ashland
 Ashland, the large oil refiner based in Ashland, Ky., said profits for its fourth quarter rose to $63 million, or $1.07 a share, from $59 million, or $1.06 a share, in the period last year. Sales rose slightly, to $2.76 billion from $2.69 billion.
Operating income fell in refining, gasoline retailing and construction, increased for Valvoline motor oil and nearly doubled in chemicals. John R. Hall, chairman and chief executive, said rising crude prices in recent weeks had pinched refinery profits.
For the 1991 fiscal year, the company said net income fell 20.3 percent, to $145 million, or $2.58 a share, from $182 million, or $3.27 a share. Sales rose 3.1 percent, to $9.9 billion, from $9.6 billion.
Ashland Oil's share price fell 62.5 cents, to $28.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Decline Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell slightly yesterday in active trading, but dealers said the recent rise in long-term interest rates had sparked some demand for bonds.
"At around 8.10 percent, there seems to be some sponsorship for these securities," one government-bond trader said. 
 Despite the nibbling, traders said they remained defensive. The talk of tax cuts is a concern, along with worries that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to ease monetary policy to help revive the economy in an election year.
"By backing up the way it has the past few days, the market is saying that the Fed will give in to political pressure and cut rates some more," the trader said. "At the moment, the Fed has lost some credibility, and it will have to earn it back."
 
Dwindling Recovery
 The talk of tax cuts arose because the strength of the recovery that most analysts assume began in April dwindled in the summer quarter. Over the last week, no new evidence has emerged to change that assessment.
Nevertheless, analysts said the market's shift in sentiment over the last week or so has effectively precluded any move by the Fed.
"The Fed can't afford to fight this environment," said Ram Bhagavatula, chief financial economist at Citicorp Global Finance. "Until the market rallies, I don't think they are going to move."
Aside from worrying that efforts to stimulate the economy may generate higher inflation, traders said a coming flood of new notes and bonds over the next few weeks had also been responsible for the backup in yields.
2-Year Sale Today
The stream of new issues begins today, when the Treasury is expected to sell $13.5 billion of new two-year notes. Tomorrow, $9 billion of new five-year securities will be auctioned.
And next week, the Government will announce the size of its quarterly refunding auctions, to be held the first week in November. Most analysts anticipate that the Treasury will sell a total of $38 billion worth of new 3-year and 10-year notes, and 30-year bonds.
Late yesterday, the two-year notes to be sold today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.01 percent. The five-year notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 6.98 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 10/32, down 9/ 32, to yield 8.09 percent, compared with 8.07 percent late Monday.
 
Fire Sale Rumors
 Rumors circulated through the market yesterday that much of the selling of bonds was being done by California insurance companies to pay for expected claims from the Oakland fire.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 13/32, down 10/32, to yield 7.66 percent. And the outstanding 6 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, down 2/32, to yield 6 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.04 percent, up two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.12 percent.
 
New Corporate Issues
 A number of new debt issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
Among the issuers was Commonwealth Edison, which offered $250 million worth of securities through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
Half the issue is made up of 15-year securities maturing Oct. 15, 2006. The 8 3/8 percent securities were priced at $99.28 to yield 8.46 percent, 80 basis points more than the yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $125 million worth of securities are 9 1/8 percent bonds maturing Oct. 15, 2021. They were priced at $99.71 to yield 9.153 percent, 1.08 percentage points more than the yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing. These securities are noncallable for five years.
Both parts of the issue are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Missouri Tax-Exempts
 A $157 million competitive offering by the State of Missouri highlighted new-issue activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
A bid from an investor group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2012. The securities were reoffered to investors with yields ranging from 4.25 percent in 1992 to 6.35 percent in 2012.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Despite the high quality of the issue, investment bankers with knowledge of the deal said that demand from investors was not terribly strong. Late yesterday, as much as $90 million of the securities remained unsold, the bankers said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Building a Lost-Cause Portfolio

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Samuel Zell, the brash Chicago investor who has made a fortune by turning around down-on-their-luck companies and properties, is dredging the bottom again.
Earlier this month, Zell-Chilmark Partners, a $1 billion venture led by Mr. Zell, won creditor approval to buy the debt of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., the Los Angeles-based department store chain. That means the Zell partnership will probably end up controlling the company, which owns the Emporium, Broadway and Weinstock's stores and which Mr. Zell says he wants to run. 
 In a separate move this month, the partnership -- looking to invest in turnaround situtations with money put up by pension funds, banks, universities and Mr. Zell himself -- submitted a bid for the Executive Life Insurance Company of California. The troubled Los Angeles-based insurer was seized by California regulators last April amid a run by policyholders. David Schulte, one of Mr. Zell's partners in the Executive Life bid, said the group liked Executive Life's insurance franchise as well as the deep discount on the company's junk-bond portfolio.
Meantime, Merrill Lynch & Company has raised more than half of a proposed $500 million fund which, using Mr. Zell's eye for good deals, would invest in troubled real estate. Just last week, the fund made its first purchase: a half-empty Connecticut office building.
Mr. Zell, a self-described "grave-dancer," has played scavenger for 25 years, buying everything from high-vacancy apartment buildings in the Midwest to cash-squeezed industrial companies and busted real estate partnerships.
With few exceptions, he has managed to reap huge profits when properties he has acquired have recovered. His transactions have made him, at 50 years old, one of America's wealthiest men, with a net worth recently estimated at more than $400 million by Forbes magazine. On any given day, he says, he doesn't know exactly how much real estate he owns but figures it is "easily 10 million square feet" -- the equivalent of more than four Empire State Buildings.
"I have been very good at seeing around the corner," Mr. Zell said in an interview last week. "My role and my job is to anticipate economic trends and to act accordingly. I am a voracious consumer of information, and I seem to have the ability to bring that information together and reach conclusions."
For example, in the Itel Corporation of Chicago, Mr. Zell in the mid-80's spotted a comeback opportunity in the depressed railroad-car business. So he bought control of Itel in early 1985, shortly after it emerged from bankruptcy.
Mr. Zell knew that the obsolesence rate of aging rail cars would eventually bring supply back into line with demand, and he figured that the price he was paying for Itel's cars equaled about half the cost of building new ones from scratch. Such a low cost base enabled Mr. Zell to undercut rivals' lease rates and keep his cars rolling. When lease rates eventually rose, his profits did, too.
While Itel has not continually realized net profits under Mr. Zell, who remains chairman and chief executive, the operating results of the various divisions have consistently been positive.
When Mr. Zell bought Itel, it had a sea-cargo container business that ranked fourth in the industry. Mr. Zell subsequently bought the No. 3 and No. 7 businesses when container lease rates were at rock bottom. He also helped make the entire operation more efficient. Five years later, in 1990, he sold the division to the General Electric Company for a $250 million profit, he said.
"It's not just that Sam excels at spotting undervalued assets," said Philip Handy, a longtime friend of Mr. Zell's and an Itel director. "He's able to see the big trends."
 
Some Rough Spots
 Not all of Mr. Zell's bets have been winners. He lost $13 million in 1984, after investing in the Raines Tool Company, a Houston-based oilfield services concern that was liquidated. And his investment in the Commodore Corporation, a builder of mobile homes, was also wiped out when that company filed for bankruptcy.
He has also left a trail of executive-suite casualties. More than one officer has been summarily dismissed after Mr. Zell has taken control of a company and gone to work cuttng expenses.
And while Mr. Zell clearly has a charitable side -- in 1988 he helped endow a secondary school in the name of his late father, Bernard, at Chicago's Anshe Emet synagogue -- friends and associates say they dread his occasional temper tantrums. "Zell is a helluva asset manager, but he a brusque sort of man and not very genteel," said Herbert Kunzel, Itel's retired chairman.
 
Seldom Seen in a Necktie
 Most days, Mr. Zell travels to his downtown-Chicago office on a Ducati motorcycle, dressed in running shoes, jeans or leather pants, and a sweatshirt or sweater.
Owing to the fact that he suffered from painful neck boils while in law school in the early 60's at the University of Michigan, Mr. Zell rarely wears ties. He typically deigns to wear a business suit only when meeting with investors who are considering backing him. And even then, friends say, Mr. Zell changes into executive attire only at the last minute, dashing into an airport restroom if he is on the road.
Mr. Zell is so fiercely competitive that he wears cleats when he plays touch football in a Lincoln Park league, although friends regularly rib him for being a butterfingered receiver. And every fall, to match wits against some of his partners and friends, Mr. Zell is host of a treasure hunt in which participants, including some of Chicago's business elite, decipher clues that lead them through the city by limousine until they eventually wind up a a huge bash paid for by Mr. Zell.
 
Prom Photos and Racier Fare
 The son of a Polish grain broker who fled for America the night before the Nazi blitzkrieg began in August 1939, Mr. Zell grew up in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. He got started in business by taking and selling photographs at his eighth-grade prom.
It was around this same time that young Sam Zell noticed a new magazine on Chicago newstands that he was sure would be of interest to his teen-age friends. He bought dozens of copies of Playboy, at at 50 cents apiece, marked them up to $1.50, and made a killing on the playground.
Mr. Zell's start in real estate came in the mid-60's, when, as a law student , he refurbished apartment buildings in Ann Arbor, Mich., in his spare time. In lieu of paying rent, he managed the apartment building he lived in, while also running other landlords' buildings. Unclogging toilets, unjamming locks -- thus began a property management business that he eventually sold to a fraternity brother, Robert Lurie, who remained Mr. Zell's partner in the Equity Financial and Management Company until Mr. Lurie's death last year from cancer.
After graduating from the University of Michigan, Mr. Zell and Mr. Lurie began buying troubled urban apartment buildings and offices several Midwestern states.
A regional construction boom in the late 60's had created a property glut, undercutting many building owners' ability to make their mortgage payments. Buying such properties at prices far below their replacement costs, Mr. Zell and Mr. Lurie cut rents to the bone and filled the buildings with tenants. When inflation soared in the the mid-1970's, the Zell-Lurie balance sheet swelled, too.
One example illustrates the pattern: Mr. Zell and Mr. Lurie bought Chicago's landmark Field building in in early 1978 for $52 million and sold it three years later for $94 million.
"His investment policy for real estate made all the sense in the world to me," said Robert Steiner, a money manager in Chicago who has invested with Mr. Zell for more than 20 years.
By the early 80's, Mr. Zell and Mr. Lurie, convinced that real estate values had peaked, turned their attention to buying companies. Their first stop was Great American Management Inc., a bankrupt real estate investment trust that the two men acquired for its substantial tax benefits, which could be used to shelter future profits.
"GAMI," as this publicly traded company is known, is now the holding company for dozens of Zell-controlled manufacturing companies, including a fertilizer concern for which Mr. Zell provided the venture capital.
Next came Itel, which also had substantial tax benefits from prior losses. Mr. Zell was able to use Itel, too, as an acquisition tool, purchasing such diverse businesses as a dredging company, a ship container business, a wire distribution concern and a 15 percent stake in the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. Although the debt taken on to acquire those businesses has generated rumors that Mr. Zell was suffering a cash squeeze, he denies that Itel is having such troubles. So far, he said, "investors have earned 20 percent compounded annually since I took control."
 
Stalking Carter Hawley
 The question now is whether Mr. Zell can be equally successful with Carter Hawley Hale. The analysis is familar: Replacement costs for the stores is far greater than what Zell-Chilmark, his investment partnership, is offering for them. Mr. Zell wants to run the stores with less debt, modernize them and bet on a turnaround in retailing. He will not divulge other details of his strategy.
"This is not a real estate play," said Mr. Schulte, Mr. Zell's main partner in the Carter Hawley bid.
Robert F. McCullough, a San Francisco-based money manager who holds a large stake in Carter Hawley and is opposing Mr. Zell's bid, contends that the retailer has an underlying net worth -- including the value of its land, buildings and favorable leases -- of $800 million. By Mr. McCullough's calculation, the $300 million Zell-Chilmark bid is a half-billion dollars too low.
If the buyout indeed goes through, Mr. McCullough said, "This is another fantastic deal for Sam Zell."

HEADLINE: Big Losses For Top 2 In Detroit

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation posted a $1.1 billion third-quarter loss today and the Ford Motor Company recorded a $574 million loss as the recession-ravaged United States auto industry skidded toward its worst year in history.
The Chrysler Corporation is not scheduled to announce third-quarter results until next week, but auto analysts say it, too, will post a sizable loss, which would push total industry losses for the first nine months of the year to about $5 billion. In 1980, its worst year ever, the American auto industry lost $4 billion. 
 Auto makers said the main reasons for the poor quarterly showing were lower sales of vehicles to dealers here and abroad, and the cost of rebates to customers. Revenue and profit in the auto industry are booked when a car is sold to a dealer. As for rebates, Ford said incentives cost it about $1,050 a vehicle, compared with $1,000 last year.
 
A Traditionally Weak Quarter
 Even in good years, the third quarter is traditionally the weakest, because of lost production from the annual model changeover.
Ford said again today that it expected to show a loss in the current quarter, although it declined to predict how much. Last year, as the recession was worsening in auto showrooms, the No. 2 auto maker had a $519 million loss in the fourth quarter, cutting its profit for the full year to $860.1 million.
Analysts expect G.M. to lose money in the fourth quarter, and they are divided whether Chrysler will break into the black by the end of the year.
Last year, General Motors had a fourth-quarter loss of $1.62 billion and a full-year loss of $1.99 billion. Chrysler earned $3.1 million in the final 1990 quarter and had a $68 million profit for the year, aided by an accounting change.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, Ford shares lost 37.5 cents to close at $28.625, and G.M. was down 37.5 cents, to $36.875, but Chrysler rose 37.5 cents, to $11.25.
 
Comparison With 1980
 Even with the higher losses, the auto makers said they were in better financial shape today than in the depth of the recession in 1980, when Chrysler was saved from bankruptcy by the Federal Government and many people were worried that Ford was in dire trouble.
"Things are difficult, I wouldn't want to discount that," said David C. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance. Still, he added, "we have a stronger balance sheet, better products and lower costs."
Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said, "If you could tell me that the industry was going to have another couple of years like this, I would be concerned." But he predicted the economic upturn would soon lift sales and motivate buyers to choose more expensive cars, which are more profitable for the industry. "The industry's earnings will recover nicely," he said.
 
A Lack of Confidence
 With plenty of new-car offerings, and the national economy in the early stages of a recovery, auto executives could not provide precise reasons why consumers have not been buying cars more aggressively. Robert C. Stempel, the chairman of General Motors, said surveys showed that consumers were optimistic about the national economy but less confident about their personal finances.
"We're in a recovery in a technical sense, but it's very slow," said Mr. McCammon. "We can only hope the consumer becomes more confident." He suggested that unemployment, lack of construction spending, tight credit and Government deficits all could be hurting automotive buying.
Mr. McCammon said one important reason for the Ford loss was an erosion in sales in its two-door sporty-car segment, which has been profitable in the past. He said sales of the Ford Probe, Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird had been disproportionately hurt by the recession.
Also, sales of Ford's full-sized pickup truck have slowed as buyers turn to compact versions, which are less profitable.
Ford's $574.4 million quarterly loss came on revenue of $21.12 billion, compared with a profit of $101.7 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $22.99 billion in the comparable period last year. For the nine months, Ford has lost $1.78 billion, on revenue of $66.3 billion, compared with a profit of $1.38 billion, or $2.99 a share, on revenue of $73.46 billion.
G.M. reported a loss of $1.06 billion on revenue of $28.94 billion, compared with last year's third-quarter loss of $1.98 billion on revenue of $30.77 billion. For the nine months, G.M. lost $2.22 billion on revenue of $89.45 billion, compared with a loss of $368.7 million on revenue of $94.83 billion last year.
 
Ford Sales Down 2%
 Ford's worldwide factory sales were down 2 percent, to 1,278,000 cars and trucks. American operations were weak, but Ford has had even more trouble abroad, especially in Britain, which is in the midst of a deep recession. Third-quarter losses from automotive operations in the United States were $197 million, while foreign losses were $554 million.
Ford's financial-services group, which includes Ford Motor Credit, the First Nationwide savings and loan operations, and the Associates Corporation, posted a profit of $177 million, compared with $141 million last year.
Ford's third-quarter share of the car market in the United States was 20 percent, down from the 21.1 percent share posted for all of last year.
Ford's share of the truck market dropped to 28.7 percent, from 29.3 percent.
 
G.M.'s Explanation
 G.M. said its loss was a result of weak demand for autos in the United States and production losses from extensive retooling for new models in Europe and this country.
Worldwide factory sales of cars and trucks for the quarter were 1,582,000, down 10.5 percent from the 1990 period. G.M. said the cost of its incentives, while sizable, was slightly lower than in the period last year.
Yesterday G.M.'s three non-automotive subsidiaries -- Electronic Data Services, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the GM-Hughes Electronics Corporation -- reported an aggregate net profit of $530 million for the quarter, down from $580 million in the 1990 period.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns of Phone Industry Lag

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Commerce Department warned today that American telephone companies were investing less to modernize their networks than their leading competitors in the industrial world. But its main recommendation was for the Government to stay out of the business.
The report comes after a season of breakdowns that have raised new concerns about the reliability of today's telephone networks and is likely to heat up a growing national debate about lifting restrictions on the seven regional Bell telephone companies. 
 The report was initiated by the Commerce Department and reflects a consensus of most departments in the Government, as well as the White House. Officials pressing for greater deregulation repeated the Administration's support for letting the Bell companies provide electronic information services and enter the cable television business. But experts representing large corporate communications customers and individual consumers argued for more regulation.
 
In Last Place
 Prepared by the department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the report estimated that America's local and long-distance telephone companies invested an average of $88 for each telephone line -- household and business -- for modernization in 1989, placing them last among compamies in the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries. The rate of American investment plummeted by an average of 8.1 percent a year between 1980 and 1989, the most recent year for which figures were available, according to the report.
Companies in what was formerly West Germany led the world by investing $238 for each line in l989 and increasing their annual investment an average of 5.1 percent in the decade.
The comparison provided vivid evidence of a lag in the installation of advanced new network technologies in the United States, though some experts said such comparisons painted an unduly pessimistic picture.
United States officials, though shying away from generalizations about the nation's communications network, said that by some measures it remains the best in the world. The report noted that the average American telephone line carries 3,516 local and long-distance calls a year, 75 percent more than in any other country and nearly three times as many as the average line in Japan.
Officials said said this heavy use was evidence that telephone companies had stimulated demand by providing good service at good prices.
"Competition and deregulation in this country have worked very, very well," said Thomas J. Sugrue, Deputy Assistant Commerce Secretary. "Yet the landscape is littered with a number of Government-imposed barriers."
These barriers, he said, had "created a series of little economic fiefdoms in the country." He added: "While everyone wants to get into someone else's turf, they don't want anyone else moving onto their turf. What we're saying is that what's good for the goose is good for the gander."
The report also said that by 1994 the United States will fall behind some other countries in rolling out a number of new technologies. The report predicted that Japan, western Germany and France would complete advanced transmission lines that can simultaneously carry both voice and data throughout their telephone networks. The United States is expected to install the technology, known as an integrated services digital network, on only 49.8 percent of all telephone lines by 1994.
The report also predicted that by that year only 57 percent of all American telephone exchanges will use an advanced call-routing technology, called Signaling System 7, that allows new services like Caller ID, voice-mail and selective call screening. All of France's exchanges will use the system, as will about 83 percent of the exchanges in Britain and 60 percent of those in Canada.
Experts representing consumers and large corporate customers argued that the report's indicators were misleading and that the United States continued to have the most advanced communications.
"We think the larger number of economists around the world say that U.S. infrastructure is far superior to that of other countries," said Page Montgomery, senior vice president of Economics and Technology Inc., a Boston consulting firm that has prepared reports for large corporations and the Consumer Federation of America. "There is no other country that has the same set of capabilities."
Brian Moir, head of the International Communications Association, which represents the nation's largest business users of telecommunications, added that the Government had successfully promoted competition. "Everybody's for competition," Mr. Moir said. "But competition today came despite the existence of monopolies. We have competition because of Government regulation."

HEADLINE: Japan Ending Sanctions Against South Africa

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Japan said today that it was lifting most of its trade sanctions against South Africa, paving the way for the country to resume its role as one of Pretoria's largest trading partners.
The move, which came after strong pressure from Japanese businesses that were reluctant to obey the trade embargo for the last five years, means that Japan's nuclear power industry can once again buy South African uranium and that Japanese companies can now build factories there. 
 The Government also said it was withdrawing its request that the Japanese public shun Kruggerands, the South African gold coins that were so popular during the height of Japan's financial boom in the 1980's that they were advertised in Tokyo taxi cabs. And Japanese Government officials said they would soon restore air travel between the countries.
 
Helping Black Majority
 The Government's chief spokesman, Misoji Sakamoto, said this morning that the reform process in South Africa was now "irreversible," and that improving conditions for the country's black majority required "restoring growth to South Africa's economy."
The Bush Administration lifted a number of sanctions against South Africa in July, and last week the Commonwealth Governments agreed to phase out restrictions.
South Africa's Foreign Minister, Roelof F. Botha, said in a statement issued in Pretoria today that his country welcomed Japan's move, according to the South African Embassy in Washington. Mr. Botha said that South Africa and its neighbors would benefit from expanded trade and that the Japanese move would help his country's internal negotiations.
South Africa's white minority Government has been discussing with black political leaders a possible new Constitution and multiracial political process.
 
Diplomatic Talks Weighed
 The chief spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry, Taizo Watanabe, said Tokyo was considering whether to begin discussions to restore diplomatic relations between the countries, which were never resumed after World War II. But he said no schedule had been set, and he declined to comment on news reports here that South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, might visit Tokyo in the near future.
Japanese officials said they were keeping a ban on equipment sales to the South African police and military in place, at least for the moment.
South African trade has repeatedly been a sore point for the Japanese Government, which was embarrassed to discover in 1987 that it had become the country's largest trading partner, with two-way trade of more than $4 billion.
After a considerable struggle between the Government and the business community here, amid international concern about the South African policy of apartheid, trade was restrained through sanctions and political pressure. Although the embargo had a number of loopholes while in place, allowing trade in many areas to continue, two-way trade has still fallen significantly since.
Last year, Japan exported $1.47 billion in goods to South Africa, primarily metal products, automobiles and textiles, and imported $1.8 billion in goods, chiefly metal ores.
In late 1988, Japan's utilities, under considerable political pressure, said they would stop importing South African uranium for their nuclear power plants. Until then, South Africa accounted for about 11 percent of Japan's uranium supply, a vital fuel for a country with no oil and no nuclear fuels of its own.
But it was never clear whether the ban fully took effect. Japan buys its processed nuclear fuel from other countries, including the United States, and it is widely thought that some South African uranium is mixed in.
 
No Formal Gold Ban
 The Japanese Government never formally banned the sale of South African gold, and much of it is still traded here. But it is unlikely it will prove as popular as it was a few years ago, when the Japanese economy was booming and some of the country's wealthiest individuals sought to put much of their winnings into gold.
With the investment restraints lifted, Japanese companies should be in a good position to quickly resume business. After a number of American companies departed in the mid-1980's, Japanese computer makers, consumer electronics concerns and car makers seized much of the market share before the Japanese Government cracked down.
For example, Japanese companies control more than half of South Africa's mainframe computer market, although their share in the United States and Europe is much smaller. Much the same is true in automobiles.
"We are in a much better position to go back in than the American firms are," a senior executive of a large Japanese car maker said today. "But we don't want to seem to be rushing in, for obvious reasons."

HEADLINE: Stocks Retreat Again; Dow Drops by 20.58

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices pulled back yesterday for the second straight day, with a weak bond market seen as the main culprit. New York Stock Exchange volume was heavy, even with a power failure giving traders an unexpected morning coffee break.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.58 points, to 3,039.80, on Big Board volume of 194.4 million shares, up from 154.2 million on Monday. Declining stocks outpaced gainers by 914 to 685. 
 Again, high among investor concerns were weak corporate earnings. The stocks of companies that posted good results rose, but gains were limited by a broader gloom generated by a weak bond market and worries about inflation, analysts said.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.19, to 387.83, while the Big Board composite slipped 1.01, to 213.87. On the American Stock Exchange, the composite was up slightly, by 0.06, to 381.84.
With smaller issues trading higher, the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter trading moved up 0.19, to 537.15, and the Russell 2000 index rose 0.03, to 183.
 
Effect of Program Trades
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said that afternoon program trades combined to pull the Dow down by about 25 points. The firm also noted that Philip Morris, down 2 3/8 to 69 3/8, accounted for 20 percent of the Dow's decline.
Philip J. Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, thought the biggest drag yesterday was the weak bond market. He noted that the weakness was concentrated in blue-chip issues and high-priced institutional favorites and that the broad market was only narrowly negative.
"The market's overall look is a consolidation, not a big decline. Mr. Roth said. "When you have a narrowly negative market and limited price volatility on the downside, it points toward consolidation."
Stocks had small gains in the morning amid some positive earnings reports. But as bond prices extended their losses, blue chips began moving into negative ground as selling increased.
The positive earnings yesterday included Quaker Oats and Bankers Trust. Quaker jumped 3 1/8, to 59 3/8, on stronger-than-expected profits, which analysts said represented a significant turnaround. Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs, repeated her "buy" recommendation.
Bankers Trust rose 3/8, to 63 5/8, after it, too, posted higher-than-expected earnings. The bank company also said it had signed an agreement to sell its Bankers Trust Company of California's San Francisco unit to First Bank System Inc.
In the retail sector, Ann Taylor fell 3 3/8, to 16 1/2, after lowering earnings estimates for the second time in the quarter.
Toys "R" Us, removed from the Bear, Stearns recommended list by Joseph Buckley, the firm's analyst, fell 3 1/4, to 29 3/4. The concern is for growing pressure on profit margins and expectations of stiff price competition with rival Child World Inc.
Shares of Electronic Arts, a maker of interactive entertainment software, rose 3, to 32 5/8, after the company posted higher earnings.
Rubbermaid Holding rose 1 1/4, to 59 1/2. The company split its stock 2 for 1, its fourth split in nine years, and announced a 13.3 percent increase in its dividend.
Morgan Stanley rose 1 3/8, to 55 7/8, on a 69 percent increase in third-quarter earnings.
Duracell International declined by 1/4, to 28 5/8, as the battery manufacturer priced a 12-million-share offering at 28 3/4 a share.
The formation of a technology partnership with Eastman Kodak sent Novell stock up 3/4, to 45 3/4.
General Motors fell 3/8, to 36 7/8, in reporting a $1.1 billion third-quarter loss. Ford was also down, 3/8 to 28 5/8, after reporting a $574 million loss.
Traders said Monday's decision by the Supreme Court to hear new oral arguments on whether cigarette makers are liable for smokers' illnesses pushed tobacco stocks down. Besides the drop in Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco was down 3/8, to 10 3/8.

3M's Profit Down 12%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD, Minn., Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, citing weak global economies, said today that its third-quarter earnings fell nearly 12 percent and that it expected a similar decline in the fourth quarter. The company earned $296 million, or $1.35 a share, compared with $336 million, or $1.52 a share, in the 1990 period. Sales rose 1 percent, to $3.38 billion, from $3.34 billion in the comparable 1990 period. Allen F. Jacobson, 3M's chairman and chief executive, said a decline in domestic economic activity and slow growth abroad had held back demand for many 3M product lines and resulted in continued pricing pressures, and added that there was no evidence of meaningful economic improvement. The company's stock fell 75 cents today, to $92.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wang Has $9.8 Million Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a quarterly loss today of $9.8 million, but the troubled computer maker said its revenues had started to stabilize.
The loss for the first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a net profit of $2.6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the comparable quarter last year. 
 Revenues were $460.7 million, down 18 percent from $563.8 million in 1990.
"The general economy and the state of our industry continue to be difficult," said Richard W. Miller, the chairman of Wang. "However, we are encouraged by these results."
The company noted that before interest and tax expenses, Wang posted a $4 million operating profit after three straight losing quarters.
The company said it was waiting to realize revenue from a new alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation. Frank Ryan, a Wang spokesman, said the company expected to see revenue from I.B.M. products in early 1992. Under the alliance, Wang will sell I.B.M. computers, some under the Wang label.
Wang has been plagued by losses for more than two years, and the company has sharply reduced its work force. Wang class B stock rose 25 cents in Amex trading today, to $3.

HEADLINE: Europeans in Accord to Create Vastly Expanded Trading Bloc

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Europeans took a decisive step today toward building a unified Europe, agreeing to create the world's largest trading bloc. It will embrace 380 million Western European consumers from the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean.
The 12-nation European Community, now the world's largest trading bloc, and the 7-member European Free Trade Association concluded two years of tough negotiations at a make-or-break overnight session in Luxembourg early today. After compromising on nettlesome details like fishing and trucking rights, they agreed to form a new common market, to be known as the European Economic Area. 
 That paved the way for several new countries to seek full membership in the European Community, which is rapidly moving toward social and political, as well as economic, integration.
 
'Important Trial Run'
 "Now we are heading full speed toward the community," Sweden's Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, said today. Of the seven members of the Free Trade Association, Sweden and Austria have already applied to join, and Finland is expected to do so soon, while Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are still undecided.
Jacques Delors, president of the community's executive commission, said today that the accord would serve as "an important trial run" for countries hoping to join the community and at the same time aiding the community's "spiderlike strategy to organize the architecture of a Greater Europe." The community members are France, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and Italy. 
The agreement would allow for the free flow of most goods, service, capital and people among its 19 member nations and should go into effect just as a single regional market is formed by the European Community on Jan. 1, 1993.
At the same time, it could mean tougher global competition for the United States and Japan, particularly in areas of trade that depend on negotiations between regional blocs, such as in agriculture, textiles and automobiles.
The agreement is now subject to approval by each of the 19 national parliaments, some of which are still expected to hold lengthy debates about the merits of the accord. Switzerland is also required by its constitution to approve the accord by referendum. But the private sectors in many of the nations of the free trade association are particularly eager for greater access to the community's markets.
European officials said that today's accord should also encourage community members to agree on the next economic and political stages of their own integration process when a year of difficult negotiations culminates in a summit meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on Dec. 9 and 10.
"It increases the chances that the heads of government of the community members will agree on substantial progress in deepening cooperation within the European Community," Germany's Chancellery Minister, Rudolf Seiters, said today.
Community members are hoping to work out a timetable to create a single regional currency and central bank, as well as to agree on mechanisms for reaching a common foreign and security policy to give the community a stronger political voice in world affairs.
If the Maastricht meeting achieves these goals, even after today's agreement goes into effect, the community's higher level of economic and political unity will continue to give it a separate identity within the European Economic Area. In essence, the Luxembourg agreement involves acceptance by the seven members of the Free Trade Association of community trading, financial and labor rules. It will also require them to adopt community laws on consumer protection, company law, environmental protection, competition and social policy.
In exchange, goods, workers, services and capital from the seven nations, which have a combined population of 40 million, will be given broad access to the community. Even now, with $220 billion in annual trade, the seven do 60 percent of their trade with community countries; 25 percent of community imports and exports are with the Free Trade Association.
The talks were deadlocked for several months over demands for special arrangements by members of both blocs. Finally, early today, compromises were found in the three key areas of dispute -- fishing rights, trucking rights and special payments for poorer community members.
The fishing dispute, which stemmed from the refusal of Iceland to open its fishing grounds to community members, was finally resolved when Norway allowed Spanish fishermen a larger quota of fish from Norwegian waters in exchange for gaining greater access for its own fishing products in the larger market.
Poor community members had been demanding a larger contribution from Free Trade Association countries to a special regional development fund. The seven finally agreed to provide $1.8 billion in low-interest credits and $600 million in grants.
The final dispute involved Austria's and Switzerland's environmental opposition to heavy truck traffic from community members. Under the compromise, Greece was offered a special quota, and the community agreed to reduce truck emissions by 60 percent over 12 years in Austria and to make greater use of railroads in Switzerland.
 
Farm Issues Postponed
 The two sides also decided to postpone integration in the highly sensitive area of farm products, principally because community members are still trying to revise their own Common Agricultural Policy so that the current round of world trade liberalization talks can resume.
But the agreement also includes features that suggest the parties intend to go beyond formation of a common market. They will establish a court modeled after the community's European Court of Justice to settle disputes and, in an important step toward political cooperation, they will form a joint council of ministers.
The move toward greater integration will be strengthened by Austria's and Sweden's negotiations to join the community. These talks are expected to start next year, with a view to completion by 1995. Negotiations with other applicants may take place at the same time.
"We hope today's agreement will make it easier for Norway and Finland to approach a decision on the question," Denmark's Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, said. Norway's main parties disagree over community membership, but Finland's Prime Minister, Esko Aho, has signaled that Helsinki will apply next spring.
Several of Eastern Europe's new democracies, notably Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, have also expressed hopes of eventual membership in the community, but they have been told this will only be possible when their economies are strong enough to compete with more developed nations.
But Frans Andriessen, the community's commissioner in charge of external affairs, said today that the European Economic Area should nonetheless help Eastern Europe because "we will be able to function even better and take our responsibility in the reforms taking place there."

HEADLINE: Leftist Party in Canada Wins Power in 2 Provincial Governments

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The left-leaning New Democratic Party has swept into power in two more Canadian provinces -- British Columbia and Saskatchewan -- creating a new source of economic tension for the Conservative-led national Government in Ottawa and altering the dynamics of efforts to keep the country united.
Saskatchewan's 1 million voters on Monday joined British Columbia's 3 million last Thursday in electing New Democratic Party premiers. Ontario, Canada's richest and most populous province with 9.6 million people, have been led by the New Democrats for the past 13 months. In addition, one of Canada's two territories, the Yukon, has had a New Democratic Party government since 1985. 
 The new elections mean that three of Canada's 10 provinces and 52 percent of the country's 26 million people are now under control of the New Democratic Party, which was born in the farm depression early this century and generally has been ranked as a third party after the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals.
 
No Swing to the Left
 While it has managed western provincial governments in the past, never has the New Democratic Party had as broad political support as today -- a sign, many politicians said, of disgruntlement with economic conditions and disenchantment with the traditional parties and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose standing in political popularity polls has reached new lows.
Yet the politicians cautioned against interpreting the vote as a massive swing to the left. "There is no direct correlation between how a party does nationally and provincially," said Dr. Angus Reid, a pollster. Noting the predominance of local issues, as in American gubernatorial campaigns, he added, "there tends to be almost an inverse correlation."
In British Columbia, the new premier is Michael Harcourt, 48 years old, a storefront lawyer from Vancouver. He was helped by scandals in the Social Credit party of philosophical conservatives who had ruled the province for all but three of the past 39 years.
In Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow, a 52-year-old former provincial attorney general in an earlier New Democratic government, was aided by the general discontent with the Conservatives, especially by farmers hit by low grain prices. His chief opponent was Premier Grant Devine, the Conservative incumbent who had won back-to-back elections in 1982 and 1986.

 In a bid to help Mr. Devine two weeks ago, Prime Minister Mulroney announced an $800 million farm bailout, nearly half of which was destined for Saskatchewan's grain belt.
A decline in the polls of Ontario's Premier Bob Rae, the first New Democratic leader ever in this province, was seen as further evidence that the country is not veering dramatically to the left.
Although the 43-year-old former labor lawyer has backtracked on a number of socialist proposals, such as nationalizing the Ontario automobile insurance, Mr. Rae has been in running battles with the business community for a year over other economic issues.
The New Democrats, seeking improved social and economic conditions for the disadvantaged, generally believe in a bigger role for government. But such policies run counter to the current trend in Ottawa, where leaders are trying to engage the private sector more, and where a large public sector is now seen creating risks for investment and savings and eventually the living standards of ordinary people.
In the unity debate, the National Democrats, in effect, now have veto power, since Ottawa's constitutional reform plan, unveiled last month, needs approval of seven provinces with at least 50 percent of the population.

HEADLINE: Democrats Look to the Senate Race In Pennsylvania for Lessons and Hope

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 21

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, Dick Thornburgh did not even know how to pronounce the name of his opponent in the Nov. 5 special election for United States senator. He learned, perhaps coincidentally, just after a poll showing that the Democratic candidate, Harris Wofford (pronounced WOFF-erd), had made substantial gains among voters.
Mr. Wofford's stunning emergence from anonymity is being watched by Democrats around the country seeking lessons to use against powerful Republicans next year. Mr. Wofford has gone on an angry populist offensive, saying that he has had it with Washington's corruption and failure to revive the economy, stem the flow of jobs overseas and enact a national health care policy. 
 The problems of the very poor are not at the top of his list. "It's time to take care of our own people, the middle class," Mr. Wofford says frequently.
He and his campaign staff constantly attack Mr. Thornburgh's performance in Washington, linking Mr. Thornburgh's tenure as Attorney General in President Bush's Cabinet to national embarrassments involving the savings and loan industry and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr. Thornburgh, 59 years old, is also a former two-term Governor of Pennsylvania.
 
An Aide's Faux Pas
 Mr. Thornburgh, who has spent over 20 years in front of microphones, is far and away the more polished candidate. But Mr. Wofford's questions leave a stain of anger or doubt even after Mr. Thornburgh refutes them with sheafs of statistics. Even Mr. Wofford's stream-of-consciousness style of speaking, peppered with bursts of excitement and anger, may enhance his message, political analysts here say.
The special election, the only Senate race in the nation this year, is being held to fill the seat left by Senator John Heinz, who died in a plane crash over a Philadelphia suburb in April. In May, Governor Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, appointed as interim Senator Mr. Wofford, who was then his Secretary of Industry and Labor. Mr. Wofford, 65, is a former special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and president of Bryn Mawr College, and has never run for elected office.
Mr. Thornburgh, who largely campaigns as though he were the incumbent running unopposed, is trading on his reputation as a popular Governor, from 1979 to 1987, and to a lesser degree his three years as Attorney General.
There have been stumbles. Making the kind of embarrassing statement that can brand a campaign, Michele Davis, Mr. Thornburgh's campaign manager, told The Associated Press on Sept. 20, "Dick Thornburgh is the salvation of this sorry-assed state." Mr. Thornburgh apologized but could not control the damage as the statement was repeated across the state in newspapers and talk shows.
"The remark was doubly unfortunate because it was in bad taste and it reminded people of the perception that Dick Thornburgh is given to some arrogance," said Dr. Michael L. Young, professor of politics and political affairs at Pennsylvania State University at Harrisburg.
Until this month, both candidates said their polls showed Mr. Thornburgh with a lead of 25 to 40 percentage points. Then on Oct. 1 The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and WTAE-TV released a poll showing that Mr. Thornburgh's lead had shrunk to 12 percentage points. Half of the 715 voters surveyed at random across the state said they would vote for Mr. Thornburgh, 38 percent said they would vote for Mr. Wofford and 12 percent were undecided. The survey, the latest independent one taken, had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Recognizing the Name
 "I never thought that could happen, but if Harris Wofford keeps picking up a couple points a week he could win," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center of Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University of Pennsylvania in Lancaster.
Perhaps not wanting to enhance Mr. Wofford's name recognition, Mr. Thornburgh has declined to debate Mr. Wofford. But on Friday the two participated in a hourlong televised discussion program, their second joint appearance this fall.
The most heated exchange came on the topic of President Bush's recent veto of the bill to extend unemployment benefits, which would have aided about 170,000 of Pennsylvania's 401,000 unemployed workers. Mr. Thornburgh said that he has supported the benefit extension in his role as a Senate candidate, but that he could not when a member of the Bush Administration.
"I transmitted to the President my dismay that he was not going to sign the bill and I urged him to do so," Mr. Thornburgh said. "I think we're going to get that bill, finally, when the posturing is all done."
Mr. Wofford, after fumbling for the right words for a while, exploded with questions: "Why didn't he approach this, push this, press this when he could have done some good, not just for Pennsylvania, but for the whole country? And why did he wait until it would do him some good as a candidate to say he would stand up to the President? Why haven't you stood up to the President in the last three years?"
Mr. Thornburgh said angrily: "Because I served in his Cabinet. The same as you served in Robert Casey's Cabinet and sat silently by while he imposed the largest tax increase in the history of this commonwealth."
In the television campaign, Mr. Thornburgh began with warm and fuzzy commercials. "Thank goodness for Dick Thornburgh," begins one, depicting Mr. Thornburgh as a governor who cut taxes and created 500,000 new jobs. The advertisements do not mention his temporary $2.5 billion tax increase or the 400,000 or so manufacturing jobs lost in his tenure.
In his spots, Mr. Wofford focuses on issues like jobs, health care and out-of-touch Washington politicians with lots of perks. But Mr. Wofford's growing popularity may be less a result of his advertising than of the natural buoyancy of any competent, adequately financed Democrat in a state with 2.8 million Democrats and 2.3 million Republicans.
 
Close Races the Norm
 "The state is so well-balanced on a partisan and ideological level that there are rarely blowouts, rarely landslides," said David Buffington, editor of the Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter. "It is perfectly normal for races to be close, but the perception is that Dick Thornburgh is slipping, and that could become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
To get out the vote for Mr. Thornburgh, who opposes nearly all abortions, the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation is sending letters to 295,000 households, said Denise Neary, the group's executive director. Mr. Wofford supports abortion rights but has angered some women's groups by supporting Pennsylvania laws that limit access.
William M. George, President of Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O., said affiliates were telephoning all 1.1 million union members and urging them to vote for Mr. Wofford.
Following Mr. Wofford's rise in the polls, Mr. Thornburgh unleashed a moderately negative advertisement 10 days ago that links Mr. Wofford, "a liberal college president who led the school to big deficits," with the now-unpopular Governor Casey and the $3.3 billion tax bill he signed earlier this year. Mr. Wofford replied that he had increased Bryn Mawr's endowment by 52 percent and that he was already in the United States Senate when the state tax increase was enacted by both Democrat and Republican legislators.
Mr. Wofford's counterattack draws more blood, say analysts. His commercial shows newspaper headlines, like "Thornburgh's Troubled Record," while a narrator condemns Mr. Thornburgh's performance as Attorney General, singling out his prosecution, or non-prosecution, of cases involving the savings and loan debacle, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Thornburgh aides respond by saying the Attorney General convicted 597 bankers in the savings and loans mess; indicted six bankers and the B.C.C.I. in his third month as Attorney General, and that he did own $30,000 worth of stock in oil companies that partly own the Alaskan pipeline, but that the Department of Justice decided against prosecuting the pipeline owners before he got involved in prosecuting Exxon.
From now on, the advertisements are expected to get really nasty. Mr. Thornburgh's media advisor is Greg Stevens, an associate of Roger Ailes, who developed the attack spots for George Bush's campaign in 1988; Mr. Wofford's advisor is James Carville, who managed Senator Frank R. Lautenberg's 1988 re-election campaign against Pete Dawkins, a race best remembered for its brutal advertising.
"Stay tuned," said Mr. Dickman, Mr. Thornburg's aide.

HEADLINE: House Panel Passes New Benefits Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee today approved a bill to extend unemployment benefits and raise additional taxes to pay for them.
The bill was designed to move away from the deficit financing of the measure that President Bush has cited in blocking two previous attempts to aid the long-term jobless. 
 Unexpectedly, the tax provisions survived an effort to delete them led by Representative Jim Moody, Democrat of Wisconsin. But the motion to strip them from the bill, which failed on a 17-to-17 vote, may be offered again on the House floor next week. House Democratic leaders were said to be undecided this afternoon on whether to allow such a vote when the bill comes up next Tuesday.
Since July, Democrats have seized on the long-term unemployed as a dramatic political issue, contending that Mr. Bush has shown disregard for them and thereby demonstrated more concern with problems abroad than with distress at home. Mr. Bush has contended that previous Democratic measures will "bust the budget."
Despite the financing provisions in today's bill, Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, said the Administration preferred a version supported in the Senate by Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. He said the Ways and Means bill would be vetoed. The $5.2 billion House bill would provide up to 13 additional weeks of benefits for people who have exhausted their regular benefits, which stop after 26 weeks in most states. It would cover those who exhausted their benefits at any time since March 1 and are still jobless, as well as those who exhaust their benefits through next July.
 
Plan to Raise Taxes
 The cost would be borne by three revenue measures over five years, though not in the current fiscal year. One would raise $1.7 billion by extending the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to take student loan debts out of tax refunds.
The other $3.5 billion would come from two increases in employers' unemployment insurance taxes. One would extend to the fiscal year 1996 a temporary surtax of two-tenths of 1 percent on the regular employers' unemployment tax, keeping it at eight-tenths of 1 percent instead of permitting it to drop back to six-tenths of 1 percent. The second provision, taking effect in 1993 and continuing through 1996, would impose those taxes on the first $7,700 of wages instead of the current $7,000. The delay is intended to avoid raising taxes in the recession.
 
Problem Facing Democrats
 After Mr. Bush's veto of the second version of the bill was upheld by the Senate last Wednesday, Democratic Congressional leaders have generally concluded that a bill that does not pay for itself cannot be enacted. But they have been uncertain about how to achieve that objective, especially without inviting Senate Republicans to try to lower the capital gains tax.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said today that he would also try to win approval of a new benefits bill. He said it would not follow the pattern of the last bill, which relied on the declaration of an emergency under last year's budget act to authorize greater deficit spending.
"I propose to pay for it," Mr. Bentsen said. But he would not say how.
The Dole bill, which the Administration prefers, would cost $3.3 billion, and provide benefits of up to 10 weeks in states hit hardest by the recession. It would be paid for by the student loan provision and by an auction of unused radio frequencies.
Like the Ways and Means bill, it would not bring in as many dollars in the current fiscal year as it would cause to be paid out. But under budget accounting procedures, the future taxes would be counted as revenue in this fiscal year. For technical reasons, some of the taxes in the Ways and Means bill would be counted that way and some would not.
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin seized on that difference in a letter in which she said Mr. Bush's senior advisers would recommend another veto if this bill were passed.
She contended that the increase in the deficit for the current fiscal year and certain accounting rules specified in the Ways and Means bill would undermine last year's budget act, and therefore "have a negative impact on financial markets that could threaten the economic recovery and lead to increased unemployment."
She also said the increase in the taxable wage base from $7,000 to $7,700 "would have an adverse effect on job creation." Democrats argue that with the increase's not taking effect until 1993 and amounting to only $5.60 in added taxes per worker, its effect would be insignificant.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, a leading supporter of the extended jobless benefits bills, offered a brusque political response, saying if Mr. Bush "vetoes a bill that's paid for, then he's not really interested in helping the unemployed."

HEADLINE: Havel Appeals for U.S. Investment And Markets in Talks With Bush

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia signed political and trade agreements in ceremonies here today, opening a six-day tour of the United States that is aimed as much at luring business investment as cementing diplomatic ties.
Mr. Havel told President Bush in an hourlong meeting at the White House that the economic crisis in the Soviet Union had also ravaged the Czechoslovak economy, and that his nation needed more American investment and access to American markets to become economically stable. 
 Mr. Bush expressed hope that trade and investment would increase, but Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Niles, who attended much of the meeting and later briefed reporters, made no mention of specific commitments to Czechoslovakia.
Later, at the State Department, Mr. Havel signed an agreement that gives American investors in Czechoslovakia some basic assurances, including guarantees that they can return their profits to the United States and that they can freely exchange currencies.
 
Needs New Customers
 The Administration has lowered trade barriers to some Czechoslovak products, particularly textiles and steel, but Mr. Havel said his country is suffering a "sales crisis" and needs new markets to replace its old customers, Mr. Niles said.
The Soviet Union once was Czechoslovakia's main export market, but sales have dropped by half from their old levels, a Bush Administration official said today. Other Eastern European nations that regularly bought Czechoslovak goods have curtailed purchases because of their own economic problems, or are buying more goods from the West.
Robert Hormats, an investment banker at the Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company who informally advises the Czechoslovak Government, said in an interview today that Mr. Havel's efforts to attract American investment had been hampered by ethnic frictions within the country and by the task of dismantling the old Communist economic structure.
"The economy in Czechoslovakia was entirely government-owned -- the most centrally controlled of any in Europe," Mr. Hormats said. Mr. Havel has one of the most ambitious plans in the region to re-create a market economy, Mr. Hormats said, but it has focused so far on creating small private businesses and has yet to sell off many of the state-owned industrial giants where foreign investment is most likely to play a major role.
 
Predicts Support for Federation
 Mr. Havel told Mr. Bush today that he expected a referendum early next year to support a continued national federation of Czechs and Slovaks. Slovaks compose about a third of the country's 15.6 million people, occupy half its land, and have been hardest hit by the current economic dififculties.
In other matters, Mr. Havel and Mr. Bush agreed to work on a broad cooperative security agreement among Western and Eastern European nations, as well as a looser and more informal arrangement between Czechosolovakia, Poland, Hungary and NATO.

HEADLINE: Israelis Deplore Advisory Panel Of Palestinians

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Israeli officials said today that they were "most unhappy" with a Palestinian team that will attend the Middle East peace conference next week, and they called on the United States to insist that the group's members have nothing to do with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The Israelis stopped well short of threatening to withdraw from the peace process unless their demand was met. Nonetheless, one senior official charged that the Palestinians "are trying to provoke us," and he cautioned that "at some point it could become too much." 
 For Israel, the issue is not the official Palestinian delegation, 14 men from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who were formally named today and who will go to the peace talks in Madrid in tandem with representatives from Jordan.
 
'People We Can Deal With'
 Israel has already got what it wants on that score, having made sure, as a price for going to Madrid, that all 14 have no overt P.L.O ties and live in the occupied territories, but not Jerusalem. "These are people we can deal with," said Yosef Ahimeir, a senior aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who like other officials here was well aware of the names long before they were made public.
What troubles the Israelis now is a second Palestinian team, a six-person advisory panel that will also be in Madrid and will serve as a conduit between the official delegation and the P.L.O. It is this group that presumably will be calling the shots, and one way or another all its members violate Israel's guidelines for the sort of Palestinians with whom it is prepared to negotiate. In particular, they speak openly for the P.L.O.
Questioned on the issue on a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Mr. Shamir played down the advisory group's role.
"We will not speak with these advisers," Mr. Shamir said. "Secondly, they will not be present in the room during the deliberations of the conference."
 
'Most Unhappy About It'
 But he warned that "if the representatives at the conference say that they speak on behalf of the P.L.O., we will not speak with them." Mr. Shamir did not say whether Israel would walk out in such an event.
Equally troubling to the Israelis are reports that the United States sent conference invitations to this group as well as to the regular delegation.
"We feel most unhappy about it, and it is still being discussed with the American Administration," a senior official said. He and others insisted that Washington apply the same Israeli litmus test to the advisory group -- and, for that matter, to all Palestinians at the conference, including bodyguards -- as it has to the official delegation.
 
Shamir May Head Delegation
 Israel has yet to make public the names of its own delegation, but there were signs today that it might be headed by Mr. Shamir, at least for the ceremonial opening. Advisers were urging the Prime Minister to go, and a decision was expected in a day or two.
There were also reports here that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt might also attend. That fueled speculation about a possible first encounter between the Israeli and Egyptian leaders, whose countries signed a peace treaty in 1979 that serves as a model for the impending talks.
With the conference only eight days away, an Israeli-Palestinian war of nerves seems to be under way, with each side trying to make sure it is not the first to blink. In one corner, the Palestinian leadership has been trumpeting the delegation's P.L.O. credentials at every turn, while in the other, the Israelis wave this off as posturing by a frustrated group that lacks official standing in Madrid.
Still, officials here acknowledge that they could be pushed too far, especially if the Palestinian delegates declare openly at the conference that they speak for the P.L.O., regarded by Israel as a terrorist organization that has not abandoned its goal of destroying Israel.
"We can leave the conference immediately," Mr. Ahimeir said. "The negative price will be that the conference will be stopped at that moment. We hope the Palestinians realize this possibility, and it is up to the Americans to make sure that this possibility does not happen."
In Paris today, the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, turned up the oratorical volume a few notches with a declaration that the Palestinian negotiators would indeed speak for his organization.
"No one can hide the sun with their fingers," he said. "Everyone knows that the Palestinians will represent the P.L.O. Every Palestinian is a member of the P.L.O., inside and outside the territories."
There is yet another side in the pre-conference jockeying: militant Palestinians opposed altogether to talking peace with Israel. One warned today that life would become "a nightmare" for Arabs from the occupied territories who take part in the conference.
Riyad al-Malki, a member of the anti-Arafat Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, did not advocate violence against delegates or advisers. But he said at a news conference in Jerusalem:
"We are going to pressure the people who are going to attend. We will turn their life into a nightmare."
 
Veiled Death Threats
 In Iran, the leader of a smaller faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, was reported to have issued veiled death threats against the Palestinian delegates, leading to complaints today from a P.L.O. spokesman in Tunis that such bellicose statements played into Israel's hands. Reuters quoted the radical leader, Ahmed Jabril, as warning that "a day will come when participants would no longer live safely in Palestine."
As expected, the Palestinian delegation will be led by Haidar Abdel-Shafi, a 72-year-old physician from Gaza City, who said this week that he and his fellow members were prepared, if necessary, to pronounce themselves P.L.O. members. But he has also tried to sound conciliatory, saying tonight that "we are going to this peace conference with open minds and hearts" and with a "seriousness about making peace."
The list of 14 names was officially made public not by Dr. Abdel-Shafi but by Faisal al-Husseini, a prominent East Jerusalem resident who has led Palestinian negotiations with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
Mr. Husseini will head the advisory team linking the delegation and the P.L.O. Its spokeswoman will be another veteran negotiator, Hanan Ashrawi, a university professor who lives in Ramallah but carries an East Jerusalem identity card.
Other members of the advisory teamare Sari Nusseibeh, also a university professor from East Jerusalem; Kamil Mansour, a writer living in Paris; Anis al-Qassem, a lawyer living in London, and Rashid al-Khalidi, a lecturer at Chicago State University.
 
The Official Delegates
 The official delegates, besides Dr. Abdel-Shafi, are:
Zakaria al-Agha, a physician from Gaza City; Ghassan al-Khatib, a university lecturer from Ramallah; Freh Abu Medein, a Gaza City lawyer; Elias Freij, Mayor of Bethlehem; Saeb Erakat, a university professor from Jericho; Sami Kilani, a college lecturer from the West Bank village of Yabad, and Abdel Rahman Hamad, a university dean from Beit Hanoun Village in Gaza.
Also, Mustafa Natsche, a chemical engineer from Hebron; Sameh Kanaan, employed by the Chamber of Commerce of Nablus; Nabil Jabari, a dentist from Hebron; Mamdouh Aker, a urologist from Nablus; Nabil Kassis, a physics professor from Ramallah, and Samir Abdullah, an economics professor from Ramallah.

HEADLINE: Seeing Stamford as a City, Not a Suburb

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 22

 BODY:
On the surface, the corporate office boom of the 1980's appears to have ended here with a crash.
New office buildings stand empty, their hollow interiors pierced by the afternoon sun. Hand-lettered forwarding addresses are taped to the windows of closed stores. Traffic lights that break down on weekends stay broken; the city has decided not to call in technicians on overtime. 
 But for Stamford, whose corporate headquarters came to symbolize both the power and sterility of development in the suburbs in the 1980's, what is important is not the signs of recession today but what these buildings represent as a foundation for the next decade. As Stamford elects its first new mayor in eight years this November, planners and development experts say it must promote itself not as a suburb but as a city in the suburbs, with the advantages that cities offer: shopping, restaurants, culture, mass transit.
 
National Implications
 The success or failure of this affluent, racially mixed city of 108,000 in making that transition, the experts say, has implications for other cities in Connecticut and across the country.
"The success of downtown Stamford represents a bringing together of American society at a manageable scale," said Richard Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association. "If we can't bring blacks and whites and people of all incomes together in a downtown like Stamford, I have serious doubts that we can do it in any other downtown in the United States."
Through the 1970's and 80's, much of Stamford's success in attracting companies leaving New York rested on its appeal as a suburb, an appeal that made Stamford the center of the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 headquarters in the country, behind New York and Chicago. But while Stamford gained notoriety for demolishing most of its downtown and replacing it with a boulevard of fortress-like corporate headquarters and a mall, even more newcomers moved into office parks out near the Merritt Parkway or on Long Island Sound.
The result, when recession arrived, was that a city's worth of office buildings had been put up without creating a downtown to go with them.
Mayor Thom Serrani, a Democrat who will not be running for re-election after four terms, is generally given good marks for managing Stamford conservatively through the 1980's so that it is weathering the recession, so far, with balanced budgets and an AAA credit rating.
One way Stamford failed, planners say, was in letting the boom years go by without acquiring a major college or university downtown, where it could meet the corporations' needs for continuing education and training and put more people on streets at night.
The city has long been talking with the University of Connecticut about relocating to downtown a small branch campus that is now on an isolated campus north of the Merritt Parkway. It still hopes to do that, but the state, flush with money only a few years ago, has its own financial problems that make the move less feasible now.
Planners say that Stamford also erred by not moving more aggressively to attract businesses as recession neared and competition with other areas of Connecticut and the country stiffened. The city was so much in the path of the migration from New York that Mr. Serrani never established an economic development office, even when urged to do so by a coalition of business, community and government leaders, the Stamford Partnership.
David E. Anderson, the Partnership's president, said Mr. Serrani "basically took on the responsibility himself," adding, "The problem is he didn't really have any mechanism for follow-up except his own time."
Mr. Serrani makes no apologies for keeping the development effort in his hands. Top executives, he said, are more impressed by mayors than by economic development officers.
Increasingly frustrated with his limited powers under Stamford's charter, Mr. Serrani spent much of the last two years battling with the city's elected boards as he cut services to balance the budget.
Financial stability is a "big drawing card," he said, when he talks with companies considering a move here. He cites Morgan Stanley, the New York financial house that has an option on land in Stamford while it also negotiates with New York City.
 
No Tax Abatements
 "I'm proud that an official from Morgan Stanley can sit here, look me in the eye and ask me about tax abatements, and I can look him square in the eye and say, 'We don't give tax abatements,' ' Mr. Serrani said.
He says his decision to lay off city employees -- and to let broken traffic lights blink on weekends -- demonstrate the city's willingness to deal with reality.
"The problem is that we're all used to having a good life and keeping the taxes low with the increase in the tax rolls every year," he said. "Now when that stops all of a sudden, people get a little schizophrenic."
The candidates for mayor, Sandra Goldstein, a Democrat who has been president of the Board of Representatives the last 10 years, and Stanley Esposito, a Republican member of the board, agree with planners that Stamford's destiny is to grow, along with New York, when the recession ends.
Both pledge to emphasize economic development and to take more advantage of one of Stamford's acquired resources, the talent of executives from companies like the Champion International Corporation, to recruit new businesses and develop ways to make downtown attractive for them.
"It's almost a given that everything we're doing points to the need to centralize major activities downtown, rather than scatter them along roadways," said Mr. Anderson of the Regional Plan Association. "And Stamford has achieved a downtown that can be a base for that."
 
Leaving Behind the Poor?
 But some caution that every step that this one-time industrial city takes toward an economy suited to the suburban middle-class is leaving behind those who live in the neighborhoods around downtown -- many of them poor members of minority groups.
John Brown, president of the Committee on Training and Employment, a social-service agency, faults officials for not trying to attract more factory jobs for residents, rather than new office jobs for commuters. "If the community is growing in a direction where it is a corporate beehive of activity, then it must be inclusive of all people," he said.

HEADLINE: Schooling In Health Criticized

 BODY:
Many doctors, nurses and other health-care practitioners believe that while they were in medical school they were not properly trained in balancing medical costs against adequate health care or in dealing with the increasing cultural diversity of their patients, according to a study released last week.
The health-care workers also rated as fair or poor their medical school training in dealing with public scrutiny of the health-care system, evaluating the appropriateness of costly new technology and insuring that all people have access to good health care. 
 "Medical education doesn't go nearly far enough," said Edward H. O'Neil, assistant dean at the Duke University Medical Center and the executive director of the Pew Health Professions Commission, a group involved in helping improve medical education.
A survey of 1,500 doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists and veterinarians conducted last spring by Louis Harris and Associates for the Pew Commission showed that the health professionals, especially doctors, believed their medical schools had given them better training in treating disease than in preventing it.
Over all, they said they were inadequately prepared in many of the skills, attitudes and values they will be expected to have in the changed health-care environment of the next decade when more emphasis will be placed on limiting costs and the availability of care.
By the time medical students now entering the universities enter the field, Mr. O'Neil said, they will need different skills than they are being taught today.
"On one hand, we have the best technology and clinical skills," he said. "But on the other hand health care is costing 12 percent of gross national product and there are 40 million Americans who don't have ready access to the system."

HEADLINE: Fantasy For the Price Of a Burger

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
LAST night, hundreds of invited guests descended on West 57th Street to salute the opening of Planet Hollywood, a sprawling restaurant and bar that is dedicated to the deep-down desire to be one with the silver screen, or at least to be somebody -- somebody famous, somebody else.
Forget the free-range chicken. Let the free-range fantasy roll. The walls of Planet Hollywood curve around the 350 seats, placing diners at the epicenter of an alternate reality. A 40-foot mural dominates one wall. Movie memorabilia -- the dress that Dorothy wore in "The Wizard of Oz," James Dean's motorcycle -- are displayed in museum cases. Oh, and the menu. There are Buffalo wings, pizza bread, blackened fish and burgers. Dinner runs about $15. 
 "This is definitely more than dinner," said Vard McManhon, a 28-year-old designer, who watched as the final touches were put on the restaurant's facade last week. "It's like going someplace you always wanted to go for the price of a burger," he said.
Hollywood isn't the only dream spot that diners want to visit. A block away, there are still lines at the Hard Rock Cafe (of which there are now 16 branches worldwide). Farther west, Le Bar Bat, an Indochinese version of Maxwell's Plum, has been packed since its opening last May. Downtown, Ed Debevic's, a 1950's diner, jumps like a nonstop sock hop.
The decade of food as art is giving way to restaurants as conceptual art. Theme-park restaurants that have long played to loyal audiences from Peoria to Orlando are suddenly the chat of le tout New York. A month before it opened, Planet Hollywood's private party room and screening room were heavily booked. The restaurant's telephone -- (212) 333-STAR -- was ringing like a frantic curtain call.
"The epicurean minions will despair," predicted Michael Stern, who with his wife, Jane, wrote "American Gourmet" (HarperCollins), a new compendium of what the book's jacket calls "swank 'company' food from the 50's and 60's." Mr. Stern said that restaurants where the whims of the chef are subordinated to a theme represent a populist defiance of food snobbism.
"For the last 10 years we had people yammering away about food as art and wagging fingers about diet, and the real, basic truth about food got lost," he said. "Food is supposed to be fun." Having recently returned from a three-day stay at Opryland, near Nashville, where he demonstrated the preparation of Pepsi-Cola cake with peanut butter frosting, Mr. Stern is convinced. "There are thousands of people ready to eat butter again," he said. "There are millions of people who want to have some fun."
John Mariani, whose restaurant history "America Eats Out" was published last month by William Morrow, said that Americans never stopped wanting to have fun. "There's always been a gimmick in American restaurants," he said. "Food was the come-on during the 80's, and now that is changing."
His book traces dining gimmicks, from stands shaped like hot dogs to restaurants with wine lists as thick as a dictionary. He found that the snob appeal of an imperious maitre d'hotel is just as much a marketing tool as the mammoth milk bottle that housed a Hood ice cream stand in Boston.
Joseph Baum, the president of the Joseph Baum & Michael Whiteman Company, a restaurant consulting concern in New York, said that although cooking is still important, restaurateurs "are constantly asking themselves: 'How can I be different?' 'How can I get people to come in?' "
Mr. Baum was one of the visionaries behind Restaurant Associates, who made a fine art of the theme-park restaurant. After World War II, when the economy was strong and American taste was becoming increasingly urbane, the group created La Fonda del Sol, a tony Latin restaurant; Zum-Zum, a slick wurst house, and the venerable Four Seasons.
Anything from "the personality of the chef" to "serving the perfect tomato" can become the theme of a restaurant, Mr. Baum said. "The test today is authenticity."
When he renovated the Rainbow Room in 1987, Mr. Baum called it "a restaurant entertainment," a term that describes his own early projects as well as today's theme-park restaurants.
In the late 1980's, restaurants like Chilies, a chain of Southwestern restaurants, and the Olive Garden, an Italian chain, were nationwide successes. They weren't "dripping in theme," said Randall Hiatt, the president of Fessel International, a Swiss consulting group that develops restaurants in hotels and amusement parks. Only in America, he said, can one find an Ed Debevic's, "a place that pushes the theme to the point of becoming the dominant reality."
Richard Melman takes this as a compliment. Mr. Melman, the founder of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, the Chicago restaurant group that developed Ed Debevic's and 30 other theme-park restaurants that range from Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba (Spanish) to Bub City (country-and-western), strives to make the theme the dominant reality. "With every restaurant, we are trying to create something that gives customers a break from everyday reality," he said.
Escapism is theme-park restaurants. "These are tough times," said Robert Earl, a managing partner in Planet Hollywood and a partner in the 16 Hard Rock Cafes. "People want to escape reality, and they can't afford to take vacations."
Today's theme-park restaurants may be a little egg-in-the-face to food reverence -- a flashing neon sign at Ed Debevic's directs diners to B-U-R-P. But the fantasy environments are also a reaction to the standardization and predictablity served up in both chain restaurants and self-consciously epicurean establishments alike.
"Americans want to be surprised again," said Mr. Stern, who noted that the early stirrings of "gourmet ism" stemmed from a similar yearning in the 1950's. "People were traveling, tasting strange things. It was adventure, not snobbism."
Trader Vic's, one the country's longest-running theme-park restaurants, opened in 1937, catering to the public yen for exotica with wacky cocktails. Today, the 22 Trader Vic's throughout the world are scheduled for renovation. "The theme was created 40 years ago, and it needs to be updated," said Adam Tihany, who is working on the redesign. "Americans have outgrown hula girls and plastic trees."
Still, Americans haven't outgrown wanting a South Seas vacation with their cocktails, he said. "Americans want a surprise."
Most evenings at Le Bar Bat, an impassive waiter stalks the balcony above the crowded bar, pausing to open his order book, which immediately and invariably bursts into flames. For a moment, the "not one hair or hemline out of place" crowd below has the opportunity to be surprised, to feel that surge of adrenaline, of wonder.
At the Hard Rock Cafe, young hearts beat faster in proximity to rock-and-roll artifacts and the seeming probability of spotting a living icon. "It's going to happen," said 12-year-old Micaela White of Greenwich, Conn. Hope springs eternal; on her three previous visits to the Hard Rock, she never saw a celebrity, "or a cute guy."
At Ed Debevic's, David Goldblatt, 48, who grew up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, was amazed to find a little piece of his past. "It reminded me of the Sweet Box on Bay Parkway," he said.
A few days before Planet Hollywood opened, Suzanne Holt, an administrative assistant at American Express, stood in front of the restaurant and smiled at her reflection in a the window. "I always wanted to see my face in Hollywood," she said. Other passers-by spoke of the high potential for celebrity sightings, of "fun" and "pure camp."
No one mentioned eating. And among the local cognoscenti, a collective sigh is already audible. The quality of cooking generally dips when the theatrics in a restaurant rise. Yet the spirit of discovery, however fleeting, however staged, has a way of reverberating throughout all restaurants.
"Ice cream cones, iced tea, gazpacho, crepes and Belgian waffles all came to America through different world's fairs," Mr. Mariani said. "Those are the ultimate theme-park restaurants. People are more open in those environments."
And that's the ultimate draw. People seem to drop their inhibitions when they enter a fantasy, said John Hench, a senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering. For more than 30 years, Mr. Hench has created theme restaurants for Disney. "The key is to create an environment for something to happen, something that encourages spontaneous action," he said.
Mr. Hench, who has designed everything from Wild West saloons to citadels of imported French chic, said: "As long as every detail is consistent, it frees the imagination. The adult can become the child, free to dream."
New Yorkers seem to tolerate such liberation only in small and tightly controlled doses. Night after night at Le Bar Bat, the waiter with the flaming order pad simply studies his hand-held fire. As if having noted nothing more than the need for coffee at Table 15, he sighs, closes the flaming book and saunters off.

HEADLINE: How Many Angels Danced at the Benefit?

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER

 BODY:
YOU could barely hear yourself think over the heavy-metal music, but thinking was not a primary concern at the Hell's Angels benefit last Friday night at the Marquee in Manhattan. Instead, the renowned biker club provided ample quantities of blissfully mindless activities like loud rock-and-roll, a strip show and beer drinking. The large warehouse space on West 21st Street was filled with power chords, high-kicking gartered legs, long hair and leather. Decorum could be checked at the door.
The reasons for the benefit go back to an incident six years ago at the Angels' clubhouse on East Third Street. "In 1985, the Federal Government seized our building under the forfeiture act," said Bob, the president of the New York City Hell's Angels charter as Steppenwolf's "Magic Carpet Ride" blared in the background. (Bob, like the other Angels, would give only his first name.) 
 "They said the house was used for dealing drugs," Bob continued. "This is not the case. We're still in litigation. We're trying to raise the money to pay the lawyers."
Inside, the decor was appropriately Spartan: behind the stage hung a black banner depicting the Hell's Angels insignia -- a skull in profile with a wing growing out of its brain -- and an American flag that seemed as big as the White House lawn on one wall.
Outside, most of the street had been blocked off to make space for the estimated 1,500 motorcycles that showed up, and an Angel directed traffic. "Take it nice and slow, all right?" he said to a couple in a Buick sedan who must have taken a wrong turn at the theater district.
Except for a handful of late-arriving model-types, there were no nonbikers present. Bikers and biker women had traveled from all over the region to show their support for the Angels. There were members of other motorcycle clubs: the Nomads, American Iron, the Lifers, Satan's Soldiers. Most sported leather or denim jackets, leather or denim vests and long frizzy hair. A good portion of them had wondrous pot bellies. Arms were green with age-old tattoos.
Women with bleached hair and black eyeliner gathered in packs or stood close by their men. One wore a lacy black camisole and denim short-shorts over gartered stockings and had a cross tattooed on her chest.
Throughout the evening, most of the Hell's Angels kept to themselves. They hung out in the V.I.P. area upstairs guarded by a biker who looked as big as a pickup truck. Still, the Angels who mingled did their best to make outsiders feel comfortable. The lawsuit is only one example of the Angels' uneasy standing in Manhattan. But Teddy, an Angel with long, graying hair and a knife holster at his hip, acknowledged the local legend that the East Third Street block, where the club house has been for 22 years, is one of the safest in Greenwich Village.
"We're hard-working people," he said. "We're people who go to work at 6 o'clock in the morning. People with children. The image of a Hell's Angel is totally Hollywood."
Donna, a drug counselor from Queens with a mountain of red hair, agreed. "They're just regular guys," she said as Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild" blared. Donna said she doesn't have a motorcycle, but "my old man does." The brawny fellow next to her smiled and introduced himself as Snake.
Eliciting further information about the inner workings of the Hell's Angels was a tricky enterprise. Tom, a tall biker with baby blue eyes and a skinny brown braid running down his back, agreed to answer some questions. As an Angel-in-training he had yet to earn his colors, which meant that his denim vest lacked the skull-and-wing insignia.
How long before he would get his colors? "You never know," he said. How long had he been hanging out with Hell's Angels? "I'd rather not say." How many members are there in the New York City charter? "Ask a member," he said, then added with a smile, "In other words, don't even ask."
Despite the menacing legend, on this outing all were on their best behavior. Bob summed up the Hell's Angels ethos with typical economy: "Brotherhood and the love of motorcycles," he said. "That's what it's about."

Examining the Dark Flower That Was Weimar Culture

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 20

 BODY:
The culture of the Weimar Republic, that brief flowering of artistic expression between two totalitarian German regimes, was analyzed and celebrated this weekend at the Actors Theater of Louisville. As the culmination of a two-month, citywide Classics in Context festival, several hundred academics and theater professionals delved into the origins of Weimar, the depth of the creativity and the aftereffects that are still being felt today in many countries, including a reunified Germany that is still troubled by divisiveness.
Though the festival covered a spectrum from "The Blue Angel" to the Bauhaus and included a Schoenberg concert and an exhibition of drawings by Josef Albers, the focus this weekend was on theater. In particular, the subject was Bertolt Brecht and Odon von Horvath, the two major playwrights of the era. 
 A revue of Brecht songs, performed by members of the Berliner Ensemble, and an Actors Theater production of Horvath's masterwork, "Tales From the Vienna Woods," were by far the highlights of an enlightening weekend.
John Willett, an author and a Brecht scholar, set the tone with his lecture, "Weimar and Germany: The 20's and Today," in which he vividly characterized the nature of the time and the diversity of the art, which, he said, was marked by "stress and passion." This was exemplified by George Grosz's statement, "I felt the ground shaking beneath my feet, and the shaking was visible in my work."
From 1918 to 1933, between the fall of the Kaiser and the rise of Hitler, there was a renaissance of art in Weimar, the city of Goethe and Schiller, and it spread to Berlin and other places. Just a sampling would include Kandinsky, Gropius, Breuer, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," the theater of Erwin Piscator and, of course, Brecht and Kurt Weill. Much of Weimar culture was later labeled degenerate by the Nazis. As Peter Gay points out in his book "Weimar Culture," "the brilliance of refugees from Hitler" was a measure of the success of Weimar. Among those refugees was Brecht. After World War II, his plays became the legacy of the Berliner Ensemble, the company he founded and headed.
In "Love and Revolution: A Brecht Cabaret," two actors from the Berliner Ensemble, Carmen-Maja Antoni and Hans-Peter Reinecke, recaptured the searing cynicism of songs that put civilization on trial, symbolically represented by the title of "Song of the Insufficiency of Human Endeavor" from "The Threepenny Opera." With a refreshing lack of didacticism, the performers let Brecht's lyrics -- and the music by Weill and others -- speak for themselves. The two sang songs of love denied and hope abandoned in a world in which self-interest had a primal authority.
Mr. Reineke approached his selections with an informality that was in admirable contrast to other Brechtian interpreters who accent the stridency of the message. The feisty Miss Antoni provided occasional English explanations as in her statement that Brecht was "singing in dark times about dark times." Accompanied by Karl-Heinz Nehring on the piano, they swept through more than 30 songs before arriving at the inevitable finale, "The Ballad of Mack the Knife." They honed a new edge on that knife, underlining the embitterment while retaining the lilting melody.
It was clear from the cabaret and from the more vigorous discussions that for all its aspirations, Weimar was very far from an ideal, artistically as well as politically. Even as artists searched for an earthly paradise, they were misunderstood, ignored or contradicted and, in some cases, corrupted, staying on in Germany and collaborating with the Nazis.
The survival of the democratic Weimar instinct is represented by Horvath, a Hungarian who found his artistic roots in Germany. In one of the most bizarre cultural juxtapositions, just after seeing Walt Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" he was struck dead by a falling tree during a storm in Paris. In his brief career he wrote 17 plays. It has been his fate to be rediscovered again and again. As Christopher Hampton pointed out in one colloquium, "Tales From the Vienna Woods" "makes it absolutely clear where the country is going" -- toward self-destruction.
Mr. Hampton's translation of "Vienna Woods" was first produced more than a dozen years ago in London at the National Theater with Kate Nelligan in the leading role of the defeated shopgirl Marianne. While not equalling that epic English version, Mladen Kisilov's intimate approach in Louisville also reached the core of the work, the paradox of a most unromantic story being played against a background of Viennese waltzes. The cast, led by Claire Beckman, V. Craig Heidenreich and Mary Beth Peil, conveyed the helplessness of people in a centerless society.
Mr. Kiselov added a haunting directorial touch as a silent coda to the play. With her life devastated and her baby carelessly left to die, Marianne (Ms. Beckman) faces the futility of her future and, by inference, that of her country. Slowly an overturned, empty baby carriage spins by on a turntable, signifying the suffering of children victimized by adults who should have been their watchful guardians. The image of the carriage becomes a Horvathian equivalent of the canteen wagon dragged back into action by Brecht's Mother Courage.
Even more than Brecht, Horvath was a harbinger of theater today. With his portrait of the meanness of everyday life, he anticipated the work of Franz Xaver Kroetz, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Peter Handke, who in a much quoted essay indicated his preference for Horvath, as being more responsive than Brecht to contemporary tides.
Linking Weimar theater with experimental German films, the Actors Theater screened Walter Ruttman's 1927 documentary, "Berlin: Symphony of a Great City," a mosaic of one day of urban life, cross-cutting factory workers, soldiers and shopkeepers with scenes of mechanization, all of it presented with irony and imagination. The film paralleled the photographs of August Sander exhibited at the J. B. Speed Museum. In the brochure for the exhibition, the photographer is praised for "seeing the familiar in an unfamiliar way," something that would also apply to Ruttman, Horvath and many other artists of the period.
Throughout the weekend there was a sense of a continuum, a living time line of the art and also of the problems that continue to divide a newly reunified people. In one panel, the Berliner Ensemble actors painted a bleak picture of the future of their company, besieged by pressing economic concerns and faced by a new five-man directorate.
Responding to Miss Antoni's curiously specific statistic that Brecht's plays are 74 percent of the Berliner repertory, one member of the audience wanted to know why more plays by other writers were not being done. While avoiding the obvious answer, that Brecht was a cornerstone of the German theater, the actress seemed to argue against the union of West and East Germany. But, she insisted: "We don't want to turn the wheel back. We want to advance it."
Weimar culture would seem to have been a less popular choice for a Classics in Context festival than those at the last two annual gatherings (dealing with the Moscow Art Theater and commedia dell'arte). But the performances and discussions confronted a responsive audience with a provocative sense of theater's role in contemporary history and history's role in contemporary theater.

Throw the Bums Out

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Hey, senators and representatives, you want to know what Americans think of you? Not very much, if you read the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. What that poll suggests is that the people, their incalculable lack of information and passivity notwithstanding, are going to throw a lot of you -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- back into the free-market economy where you will find slightly unfamiliar standards for kiting checks, paying restaurant bills and sexual harassment.
You, too, President Bush, may find the survey unsettling. It could be that the voters might like to anoint you as Secretary of State and choose someone else to be President. 
 Americans are beginning to feel that their lives are going down the tubes -- despite the U.S. still being the richest nation in the world, a global democratic role model and having won the cold war and the war against Iraq. While elections are an unpredictable year away, voters might be looking for someone to blame, even though they know you've been busy.
The good news from the poll is that 44% of the people think all candidates for public office are corrupt (34% say honest), and 57% believe most candidates are interested in prestige and power, not in helping the country. So, you elected officials can hope that voters will think your opponent will be as bad as you and stick with the devil they know.
On the other hand, voters may conclude that you legislators are so bad that almost no one could be worse. Of those polled, 29% approved the way Congress is handling its job and 57% disapproved. Only twice in the last 15 years has Congress been given a less flattering report card.
In my own informal poll taken this month in Peoria, Ill., Manchester and Concord, N.H., and New York City, the results were 99 disapprove and 1 approve. The one approval was a guy lurking in the subway waiting to mug someone who said, "I greatly admire and respect Senator Alan Simpson from the great state of Wyoming."
And when the people in the Times/ CBS Poll speak of their deep disaffection with Congress, they mean all of you. Sixty-eight percent favored limiting the number of years you can serve in office.
One footnote: Before the Judge Thomas hearings began, those polled were asked, "Whom do you trust more to make the right decisions about who should sit on the U.S. Supreme Court -- the President or the U.S. Senate?" Fifty-five percent said the Senate and 31% said the President. After the bumbled hearings, 55% still answered the Senate, and only 25% preferred Mr. Bush. So, Mr. President, it seems that some additional Americans came to suspect your motives more than Congress's.
Those polled still approve of the way you're doing your job, Mr. President, by a remarkable 67% to 24%. But you've got to analyze what that means. It parallels almost exactly your 69% to 22% approval rating on foreign affairs.
In every other category, you get low marks. On your handling of the economy, 33% approved and 57% disapproved. That's less than half your favorable ratio on foreign affairs.
And the poll respondents make abundantly clear that the economic situation matters far more to them than foreign policy. Asked to cite the most important problem facing the country, 23% said the economy, 16% unemployment and 5% the deficit. Only 1% said foreign policy. That's right, only 1%.
What pervades the poll results is a frightening pessimism about the future. Asked in 1986 if things were better or worse than five years ago, 44% felt better and 31% worse. Questioned again this month, only 19% said better, a drop of 25 percentage points, and 44% reckoned their lot had gotten worse, a jump of 13 points.
You, Mr. President, and all you members of Congress might just be facing a popular revolt in November 1992. It's easy to fool most of the people, distracted and bewildered as they are, most of the time. But after 5 or 10 years, enough people actually get the joke. In their unhappiness they just might resort to the ultimate in term limitation, namely the political philosopher Jeremy Bentham's principle of "dislocability." Which in the current vernacular translates as "throw the bums out."
Maybe the latest Times/CBS Poll shows that in Hollywood on the Potomac, you residents are building your own bonfire of political vanities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Blocks Solution to Vietnam Refugee Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Vietnamese Refugees, Reconsidered" (editorial, Oct. 8), you go to great pains to point out the obvious fact that no country can let in everyone who wants in, and that governments are constantly forced to make decisions on returning illegal immigrants to their homeland. The difficulty in this case lies in the fact the "homeland" happens to be Vietnam.
On this very distressing issue the United States wields a triple-edged sword: the United States will not accept "economic migrants," strongly condemns and opposes any move to return "economic migrants" to Vietnam, and at the same time obstructs Vietnam's attempts at improving its economy, which is the root cause of "economic migrants." 
 Although armed hostilities between the United States and Vietnam ended more than 18 years ago, the United States continues to wage war against Vietnam by maintaining an economic embargo on Vietnam. It has not been a war to protect our national security interest: it is a war of retribution. It has not been a war against the Government of Vietnam but against the people of Vietnam. Governments do not feel pain; people do. More than half of Vietnam's 67 million people were not even born when the last United States troops left Vietnam, yet we continue to punish them.
Vietnam is one of the poorest countries in the world. Over the last five years, Vietnam has been pursuing a policy of economic reform. However, today Vietnam's reforms are at risk.
Over the last several years, Vietnam has painstakingly followed the rigid structural readjustment program prescribed by the International Monetary Fund with such success that most members of that institution are ready to resume lending activities to Vietnam. The single voice that prevents this type of assistance and coerces other countries to follow its lead is the United States.
Six months ago (not "last year," as you stated), the United States presented Vietnam its plan for normalization. The United States plan conditions normalization on peace in Cambodia and on progress on the issue of servicemen missing in action.
There is every indication that the tragic war in Cambodia will formally end with the signing of a peace agreement in Paris within the next few weeks. Members of the United States M.I.A. team in Hanoi have been given permission to travel to any province or village in Vietnam in search of remains and to have access to Vietnam's military archives. (One can only imagine the Pentagon's response if the Vietnamese asked to look at our archives with the hopes of finding some information on their hundreds of thousands of servicemen missing in action.) What more do the Vietnamese need to do before the United States releases its stranglehold on their economy?
You support forced repatriation while absurdly stating that the prospect of normalization ought to be an incentive to Vietnam to treat its returnees decently. Of the more than 13,000 (not 6,000, as you say) Vietnamese asylum seekers who have returned since 1989, there is no evidence whatsoever that Vietnam has not been treating them humanely and with dignity. Indeed, international organizations that monitor the returnees have not reported any instances of returnees being treated as anything less than decently.
The most humane course of action open to the United States is clear: lift the embargo and allow the international financial institutions to assist Vietnam. Through increased economic opportunities and an end to Vietnam's economic isolation, the incentive to flee would be greatly diminished. By doing this the United States becomes part of the solution and ceases to be an obstacle to resolving this issue.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Yellow Pages Are Getting A Nudge

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
INTENSIFYING efforts to sell the Yellow Pages as an advertising medium, telephone directory publishers are committing themselves to an ambitious agenda that includes seeking more revenue from national advertisers and exploring electronic data delivery.
"Business development will be the keynote theme of everything this association does," J. Raymond Avedian, president and chief executive of the Yellow Pages Publishers Association, said in an interview during a recent visit to New York. 
 The association, based in Troy, Mich., is a trade group representing around 140 publishers that account for an estimated 95 percent of directory advertising revenue in the United States and Canada. The association's fourth annual convention, which begins today and continues through Saturday, is expected to attract a record 1,000 members to the Walt Disney World Dolphin Hotel in Orlando, Fla.
Mr. Avedian, who had held executive positions at the Radio Advertising Bureau, American Motors, Jeep and BBDO before joining the association in 1987, likened the Yellow Pages to the automotive industry.
Each has "its own culture," he said, "and that culture doesn't change with the rapidity an ordinary citizen might expect."
But change it must, according to a survey published in Link, the association's magazine. When advertising agency professionals were asked to name "the major media," only 2 percent mentioned the Yellow Pages.
Actually, with estimated ad revenue of $9.46 billion this year, Yellow Pages rank fourth behind newspapers, television and direct mail. And growth, at an estimated 5.9 percent for 1991, is far larger than the approximately 2 percent increase for newspapers, hurt by the recession, and 1.5 percent for competitively pressed network television.
A second reason why change is necessary is the recession, Mr. Avedian said, adding that the slowdown "has made our publishers very hungry."
And a third reason he offered is that although national advertising makes up the smallest share of Yellow Pages ad revenue -- 10 to 15 percent, on average -- "it's the part that has the greatest growth potential."
That has spurred a push to coax additional ad spending from national advertisers like retailers, fast-food chains and packaged-goods marketers. To help this along, the association is forming a committee, called the independent market development group, from the ranks of its members and ad agency executives.
"But by the same token," Mr. Avedian said, "the local side of the business is our bread and butter. That causes our publishers to make decisions that favor the local market, to the unhappiness of our national side."
Take ad formats. Just as in the case of newspaper advertising, he noted, national advertisers prefer standardization, which makes it easier to order ads in thousands of directories nationwide. But publishers prefer satisfying longtime local advertisers by offering the widest format variety.
"How do you bring order out of a mosaic of product specifications and copy restrictions?" Mr. Avedian asked. One way, he said, is to press members to reduce "our menu of product offerings" to 15 to 25 formats that "would be attractive to larger advertisers."
Mr. Avedian also voiced a keen interest in the new electronic technologies that could drastically alter the delivery of information to consumers.
"We're at the very elemental stages of a movement that has begun to expand our capabilities," he said, referring to services like electronic Yellow Pages delivered by computer and "talking" Yellow Pages by phone. The subject is being studied by an interactive technologies development committee, which will meet during the convention.
Here, too, Mr. Avedian is encouraging standardization. For instance, in a talking message that is sponsored by an advertiser, how long should the commercial portion be? And should it come before, during or after the data are delivered?
Mr. Avedian also hopes the association could soon open a media laboratory, where members might experiment with these new technologies.

HEADLINE: Americans Hail Europe's Trade Bloc Plans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 23

 BODY:
American executives, in a series of interviews today, applauded the agreement between the 12-nation European Community countries and the 7-nation European Free Trade Association to create a barrier-free market of 380 million people in Western Europe, saying it would reduce the cost of doing business in Europe and spur the Continent's economic growth.
For Becton Dickinson, the medical supplies company, the accord means that new products it introduces in Europe would have to satisfy one harmonized set of standards, rather than many sets. 
 For Morgan Guaranty Trust, the new pact means that having a license to do banking in one Western European country would enable it to open branches in all 19 countries.
And for Eastman Kodak, the agreement means that it would be able to use identical packaging in 19 European countries, and not have to meet different packaging standards for the two blocs.
"It will be very beneficial for the European marketplace and therefore very beneficial for those companies that are operating in Europe," said Colin Allan, director of European Community and government relations for the Digital Equipment Corporation. "I can see no negatives, and I can see a great deal of upside, a great deal of potential in many areas."
These executives said that Europe might become more of a magnet for foreign investment as a result of Tuesday's accord between the European Community and the European Free Trade Association, which comprises Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.
The treaty, which is subject to ratification by all 19 national parliaments, would create what is called a European Economic Area. One result of the agreement is that the benefits resulting from the European Community's plan to create a barrier-free single market by the end of 1992 -- less red tape at customs posts, for example -- will be expanded by removing trade barriers with seven more countries.
 
Competition for Outsiders
 But Paul Horne, chief European economist for Smith Barney, took a less rosy view of the accord, saying that it might not be quite the boon for business that many executives predict. He said that after January 1993, when the European Community's single market and the new European Economic Area are both supposed to come into being, "the situation will be much more competitive" for all companies doing business in Europe.
"I am expecting a period of consolidation and some deterioration in corporate earnings," Mr. Horne said. "There will be a lot of corporate cadavers around because of the tougher competitive climate." He said, for example, that the greater access that Switzerland's banking powerhouses gained in the European Community would make life tougher for the European operations of German, British and American banking giants.
But the majority view was one of optimism. "There is no reason but to be happy about this," said Horst Herke, vice president in charge of economic affairs for General Motors Europe. "The European single market will be extended now from 12 countries to 19, and that has added benefits, like those created by the single market."
The agreement, which calls for the free movement of goods, services, people and capital throughout Western Europe, will create the world's largest trading bloc. The European Community's common market, with more than 340 million people, is already the world's largest trading bloc, and the new entity will add more people.
European Community officials predict that the community's economic output will rise by 5 percent as a result of their plan to remove trade barriers and thus reduce the costs of doing business.
"It will provide for additional growth in Europe," Ursus Jaeggi, director of government affairs for Du Pont Europe said of the accord. "American firms will benefit from this growth just like European firms will."
Indeed, American executives, like European and Asian ones, say the new agreement will reduce shipping costs because truck drivers will have to wait less as they ship televisions or turnips from one European country to another. Trucks can still be stopped for safety or health reasons, but the amount of administrative red tape is to be reduced greatly.
 
Standardized Rules
 Under the agreement, the seven European Free Trade Association countries will adopt the community's rules on corporate law, mergers, antitrust matters, environment, education and consumer production.
General Motors officials rejoiced that the accord would reduce costs by harmonizing product standards, so that the same Opel sedan can be sold in Portugal as in Finland. Harmonizing product standards will mean savings in packaging, distribution, manufacturing and engineering the inital product design.
"It's important for us to have one set of technical standards, rather than dealing with 12 or 19 sets," said Steve Thomson, a senior international lawyer in Grenoble, France, for the European operations of Becton Dickenson.
Bernard Spinoit, vice chairman of the trade policy subcommittee for the European Community Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels, saw one possible drawback with the agreement. He said that American exporters "might face a bigger Fortress Europe should the barriers for such a fortress be set up."
But he hastened to add that the dangers of Fortress Europe, which he said were on the wane, would be diminished because most of the countries in the European Free Trade Assocation had traditionally supported free trade and would help tilt the European Community in that direction.
 
Benefits for Non-Europeans
 Indeed, Mr. Spinoit said non-European companies might benefit disproportionately from this accord because American companies, like Ford and I.B.M., and Japanese companies, like Sony, have long treated all of Western Europe as a single market. Thus, as trade barriers come down, these pan-European foreigners have a leg up over companies that have long relied on their domestic market and been protected by trade barriers within that market.
Mr. Spinoit, a lawyer in the Brussels office of Stuart & Stuart, a Washington-based law firm, said, "It has often been said the main beneficiaries of the European Community's single market would be United States and Japanese companies. Clearly this applies to an even bigger market."
Takao Negishi, European director of the Electronic Industry Association of Japan, agreed that Tuesday's pact would help Japanese companies. "Internal trade barriers will be reduced in this vast economic space and that will facilitate the distribution of merchandise," he said. "That should help Japanese and American companies that have made direct investments in Europe."

Tax-Free Yields Off; Taxable Funds Flat

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt money market funds moved down again in the week that ended yesterday, but yields on taxable funds were essentially unchanged, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues The Money Fund Report.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, reported that total assets of the tax-exempt funds declined by $108 million, to $89.6 billion, in the week. The average days to maturity of holdings in the tax-exempt portfolios rose by one day, to 61 days. 
 "I think that the tax-exempt funds' yields will fluctuate around current levels," Mr. Frank said yesterday. "It is clear that with discussion of the tax-cut issue alive again, we have entered a new period. But in the short run, we believe that short-term yields will continue downward in the case of the taxable funds."
 
7-Day Yields Down
 The seven-day compound average yield for tax-exempt funds dropped from 3.93 percent to 3.83 percent in the week, while the seven-day simple yield declined from 3.86 percent to 3.76 percent.
In the case of 30-day yields, the compound yield was 4.13 percent, down 15 basis points, or hundredths of a point, from 4.28 percent, while the 30-day simple yield was 4.05 percent, down 14 basis points from 4.19 percent.
Among tax-exempt funds investing in individual state securities in the area, the top New York fund once again was the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.40 percent, down from 4.75 percent in the previous week.
In Connecticut, the leader was the Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield of 4.14 percent, down from 4.22 a week earlier.
Calvert Tax Free Reserves led the way in New Jersey once again, with a yield of 4.41 percent, down from 4.5 percent.
The highest-yielding tax-exempt fund among those with assets greater than $100 million continued to be Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.92 percent, compared with 5 percent a week earlier.
 
Taxable Assets Rise
 Assets of taxable funds, Mr. Frank said, rose by $1 billion in the week, to $462.3 billion.
"All and more of the increase came from institutional investors," Mr. Frank said, explaining that they accounted for $1.8 billion of the inflow, while individual investors withdrew $800 million from the taxable funds. Average maturities of portfolio holdings were unchanged, at 63 days.
"I believe that the smaller investors are continuing their search for higher yields elsewhere, such as in short-term bond funds," Mr. Frank said.
The seven-day average simple yield for the taxable funds was unchanged at 5.02 percent, and the seven-day compound yield was up a basis point, to 5.15 percent.
The average compound 30-day yield was 5.21 percent, down 4 basis points, and the 30-day simple yield was also down 4 basis points, to 5.08 percent.
The top-yielding fund among the taxables was once again Riverside Capital Money Market Fund of Columbus, Ohio, with a seven-day compound yield of 6.36 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 4.94 percent, from 4.98 a week earlier, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Mirror Net Falls 2%; Knight-Ridder Drops 22.7%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said yesterday that third-quarter earnings fell 2 percent and would have declined more except for a gain on the sale of a cable system. Knight-Ridder Inc. also reported an earnings decline, 22.7 percent.
The reports were the latest in series of depressed earnings from the media industry, where advertising demand has sagged with the economy. 
 Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Times Mirror
 The Los Angeles-based company said profits in the quarter ended Sept. 29 fell to $41 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $41.9 million, or 33 cents a share, in the comparable quarter of 1990.
Excluding a gain of 2 cents a share on the July sale of the cable system, third-quarter earnings would have been 30 cents a share, down 9.1 percent, Times Mirror said.
Third-quarter revenues rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to $897.2 million, from $895 million a year earlier.
Times Mirror's newspapers include The Los Angeles Times, Newsday, New York Newsday and The Baltimore Sun papers. It has interests in broadcast and cable television, books, magazines and other publishing.
Total advertising revenues during the third quarter declined 7.6 percent, to $418.3 million. But the company's total newspaper circulation increased by three-tenths of 1 percent daily and 5.3 percent on Sunday during the latest six-month period.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Times Mirror shares gained 50 cents each, closing at $28.625.
 
Knight-Ridder
 The Miami-based newspaper and information-services company earned $28.3 million, or 54 cents a share, in the July-September quarter compared with $36.6 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5.5 percent, to $539.2 million, from $570.5 million a year earlier.
Operating income in the newspaper division fell 32.8 percent, to $54.9 million, on a 7.2 percent decline in revenue to $458 million.
The company's newspapers include The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Results were reduced by a $3.5 million charge for a restructuring at The Herald.
Operating income from business-information services rose 37.7 percent, to $5.4 million, on a 5.7 percent increase in revenue to $81.3 million.
The company's shares slipped 62.5 cents, to $47.50, on the Big Board.

$70.3 Million Deficit Posted By Compaq

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Compaq Computer Corporation, besieged by price-cutting rivals and under pressure from lagging sales, said yesterday that it would slash its work force by 1,400, or 12 percent, and reported its first quarterly loss ever, $70.3 million for the third quarter. Separately, the Control Data Corporation said it lost $7.5 million in the quarter,
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
Compaq
 Compaq's loss contrasted to a profit of $123.6 million, or $1.38 a share, in the corresponding period last year. Revenues in the third quarter fell 17.8 percent, to $709.4 million from $863 million. 
 The Houston-based company earned $17 million from operations in the quarter, but took a special charge of $135 million to cover layoff-related costs.
Compaq's share price gained $1.25, to $34.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement came early yesterday morning before trading opened.
Analysts said the cutbacks by Compaq were widely expected, and some said they were overdue. Apple Computer, International Business Machines and many other personal computer makers announced layoffs earlier in the year.
Compaq, which had been a strong performer since it shipped its first personal computers in January, 1983, has faced tough price competition this year from smaller companies, like Dell Computer, Gateway Computer and Northgate Computer. It has scrambled in the last five months to slash prices in an effort to blunt their gains.
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief operating officer, said in an interview that job cuts among the company's 11,800 employees would come from all operating divisions.
The company plans to begin notifying employees who will lose their jobs within the next two weeks, and that all of them will have left the company by the end of November, said Debra Globe, a spokeswoman. "Now that people are aware of the situation, we don't want to leave them hanging," she said.
All employees included in the layoffs will receive a minimum of two months' pay. The severance terms are to include two weeks' pay for every year of employment, as well as counseling on seeking new jobs.
Mr. Pfeiffer said Compaq had to realign costs so that it could sustain gross profit margins of about 35 percent of sales, down from more than an enviable 40 percent of sales in recent years.
Joseph (Rod) Canion, Compaq's president, said last July that the company hoped to avoid layoffs by improving manufacturing techniques, broadening its distribution methods beyond dealer chains like Computerland and other steps. But Mr. Pfeiffer said the sales outlook had darkened since then.
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said the job cutbacks at Compaq should be interpreted as a sign that the personal computer market will have little, if any, growth for the next few years.
 
Control Data
 Control Data cited a weak economy and slumping demand for computers in reporting its $7.5 million loss. A delay in shipments to the Soviet Union for computers designed to improve safety in the nuclear industry contributed to the deficit, the company said.
The current quarter is expected to be profitable, with the shipments completed to the Soviet Union, the company added.
Control Data, based in Bloomington, Minn., earned $8.5 million, or 20 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue fell 20.5 percent, to $344.9 million from $434.1 million.

HEADLINE: RJR Nabisco Reports Neet Of $123 Million in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Once beleagured by a crushing load of debt, the RJR Nabisco Holding Corporation is now on the upswing. The food and cigarette company's third-quarter net income rose to $123 million, compared with a loss of $86 million for the corresponding period last year.
The gain was attributed in large part to the company's continuing efforts to reduce its huge debt, said Jason Wright, a spokesman for RJR Nabisco. In its most recent debt-reduction move at the beginning of this month, the company disclosed a plan for large offerings of common and preferred stock that would help the company retire some of the debt. 
 Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company bought the company in 1989 in a deal worth $25 billion. Mr. Wright said RJR Nabisco has since reduced its debt from a high of about $29 billion in 1989 to $16.7 billion this year.
As a result, interest payments dropped during the third quarter to $500 million, compared with $770 million for the corresponding period a year ago. For the first nine months of 1991, interest payments were $1.6 billion, down from $2.3 billion in 1990.
Ronald Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney, said the company had made huge strides in reducing its debt. "It's very encouraging," he said. "The situation should continue to improve during the next several months."
The company was also helped by sales in the company's food and tobacco businesses that were healthy despite the recession, Mr. Morrow said. Sales for the quarter rose 6.5 percent, to $3.76 billion, compared with $3.53 billion in 1990. Income per share rose to 7 cents, compared with a loss last year.
RJR Nabisco's worldwide tobacco business, the maker of Camel and Salem cigarettes among other brands, had sales of $2.17 billion, up 3 percent from 1990's sales of $2.11 billion. The rise was primarily attributed to growth in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, where sales rose 13 percent.
One problem the tobacco business faces is a dip in domestic sales, some analysts said. RJR's sales in the United States fell 1 percent over last year. "They are going to have to spend aggressively to turn the domestic business around," Mr. Morrow said.
The company's food business also performed well. At the Nabisco Foods Group, which includes Blue Bonnet margarine and Planters nuts. sales rose 13 percent, to $1.6 billion, in the quarter, compared with $1.4 billion for the previous year.
Mr. Wright said the food group's sales have been fueled by the continual introduction of new products this year, like Mini Oreo cookies, Mr. Phipps pretzel chips and Life Savers (holes) candies.
The company's shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $10.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Languish as Uncertainty Deters Buyers

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 23

 BODY:
With worries about the economy and job security apparently weighing heavily on car buyers, vehicle sales were sharply lower in recent days from last year's level. Several dealers said showroom traffic had fallen 20 to 30 percent.
But while analysts said the poor sales suggested that the recovery was having trouble maintaining momentum, they said the latest figures did not signal that the economy was about to dip back into recession. 
 Price increases on 1992 cars appear to be dampening some excitement that buyers may feel about new models, dealers said. Sizable rebates are also no longer motivating buyers, who are more surprised when models do not carry incentives, they added.
 
A 16.1% Decline
 Auto makers reported today that sales of cars and light trucks built in the United States declined 16.1 percent in mid-October from the period a year earlier.
"Sales remain weaker than expected," said William H. Steele, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco. "It does not bode well for the recovery."
The annual selling rate of domestic cars, based on seasonal factors, was 6.2 million in mid-October, down slightly from a 6.4 million rate in the third quarter and sharply off the 7.2 million rate in mid-October 1990.
Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said he expected the annual rate for all of October to be roughly 6.2 million.
"This recovery is two steps forward, one step back, and it looks like October is a step back," he said.
Mr. Heinbach added that auto sales for the fourth quarter may be hurt by production cuts in November and December. Ward's Automotive Reports stated earlier this week that suppliers expect that Ford, General Motors and Chrysler would cut production by 4 percent, or 100,000 cars and trucks, for the fourth quarter over all. The report suggests that car makers are receiving weak orders from dealers, Mr. Heinbach said, "and that's not inspiring."
Dealers confirmed Mr. Heinbach's suspicion. "People have money but they're afraid to spend it," said Joel Avery, sales manager of Rockingham Toyota-Dodge-Nissan in Salem, N.H.
As for rebates, "It's not really an issue anymore," said Jerry Holsman, sales manager of Riley Chevrolet-Geo in Jefferson City, Mo. "But I'm sure it would be if we didn't have them."
Sales were up approximately 10 percent in recent weeks over the period a year earlier at Longo Toyota in El Monte, Calif., according to Patrick J. Verrona, general sales manager. But Mr. Verrona said the dealership's salespeople were working harder to strike deals. Customers are taking about two weeks to make their final decisions to buy, compared with just a few days a year ago, he said.
The manufacturers that produce vehicles in the United States sold 136,881 cars between Oct. 11 and 20, and 73,357 light trucks, a category that includes mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles as well as pickup trucks.
 
16.7% Drop for Big 3
 The Big Three companies posted a collective sales decline of 16.7 percent in car sales during mid-October, while Japanese companies that build cars in the United States reported an overall drop of 11.8 percent. These Japanese "transplant" manufacturers raised their share of the American car market to 15.9 percent in mid-October, from 15.2 percent a year earlier. The Big Three saw their market share decline to 84.1 percent, from 84.8 percent a year earlier.
Of the Big Three, the General Motors Corporation's car sales dropped 13.1 percent, to 62,234, and light-truck sales dropped 21.2 percent, to 28,486.
The Ford Motor Company reported a drop of 22.6 percent in car sales, to 35,349, and light-truck sales fell 20.7 percent, to 24,459.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped 16.5 percent, to 17,500, based on estimates by Ward's; the maker's truck sales dropped 1.6 percent, to 16,300.
The Honda Motor Company sold 8,998 American-built cars, a drop of 15.9 percent, and the Toyota Motor Corporation reported a sales drop of 21.5 percent in the period, to 6,429 cars.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Worldwide While Gold Prices Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled higher on world currency markets yesterday in trading driven largely by technical factors.
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $362.30 an ounce, down $1.60 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $362, off $1.25. 
 With no fresh news to move the markets, the dollar was driven higher in technical trading. Dealers said that once the currency broke through 1.7100 German marks, there was a spinoff effect that lifted the dollar against other key currencies. In New York, the dollar settled at 1.7113 German marks, up from 1.7000 on Tuesday.
 
'Relatively Tight Ranges'
 "Nothing was happening very fast," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank. "There was good volume, but the dollar held to relatively tight ranges."
Analysts noted a basic shift in market psychology concerning interest rates. Traders are beginning to consider the possibility that the Federal Reserve may not loosen credit to stimulate the economy; the Fed has been expected to lower rates in the wake of a string of sluggish economic reports.
Lower interest rates are generally bearish for the dollar because they erode the value of dollar-denominated securities.
"People are looking at fiscal policy instead of monetary policy as the tool that will extricate the economy from the recession, and that means no more lower rates," said Randolph Donney, an analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Mr. Donney also said that lawmakers' efforts to fashion a tax-cut package, which could result in higher consumer spending and in turn spur the economy, "bodes well for the dollar," even though the results of any legislative changes would not be felt in real terms for some time.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.75 yen, unchanged from Tuesday. Later in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 131.30 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 131.65 yen, up from 131.40 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7056, from $1.7145 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.6985 to buy a pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.7085.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Revamping for Ogilvy & Mather

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide announced a restructuring yesterday in which the subsidiary of the financially troubled WPP Group P.L.C. will scale back the services it directly offers to clients in order to concentrate on advertising and direct marketing.
Under the restructuring, said Graham Phillips, chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather, its public relations and sales promotion units will become free-standing companies within London-based WPP. Jonathan Rinehart, chairman and chief executive of the Ogilvy Public Relations Group in New York, and Keith Bantick, chairman and chief executive of Promotional Campaigns Inc. in London, will report to WPP rather than to Mr. Phillips. 
 The restructuring is not meant to cut costs, an Ogilvy spokeswoman, Nora Slattery, said, but rather will "get senior people freed up to work for clients" in Ogilvy's primary operations.
That would make sense, said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York. "When business is like this, you've got to focus on business," he added, citing the need for Ogilvy to strengthen its hold on its advertising accounts like the American Express Company's green card.
Nevertheless, the move "is a sign of the increasing pressure that WPP is feeling," said James Dougherty, vice president of research for County NatWest U.S.A. in New York. Despite a $1 billion refinancing in April, WPP continues to face financial pressures exacerbated by the recession and the high price of its 1989 acquisition of Ogilvy.
As part of the restructuring, Jerome W. Pickholz, 59 years old, chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Direct, becomes a new vice chairman of Ogilvy, and Reimer Thedens, 42, chairman of Ogilvy Direkt in Germany, becomes a new vice chairman of Ogilvy Europe.
Also, Ogilvy's Asian-Pacific operations will be combined into a single region under Rod Wright, regional head of Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Move Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates fell slightly in moderately active trading yesterday, helped by a set of reports reaffirming the notion that economic activity remains stagnant and a successful auction of new two-year notes.
The reports included auto sales, which remained weak; the sense from regional Federal Reserve Banks that economic conditions across the country were "weak or growing slowly" in September and early October, and a poll of the nation's home builders, which showed that customer traffic has receded to levels not seen since January. 
 "To have the lowest mortgage rates in 14 years and still have very few people looking at houses is very disturbing," said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Homebuilders, the group that polls homebuilders each month.
Still, the market's response was measured. Traders said concern about action by Congress and the Administration to cut taxes remains an overriding issue.
"The real side of the economy is not showing any signs of growth in final demand, and yet the bond market is basically just holding its own," said Joseph Liro, senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
"With all these new issues to be auctioned, the tax cut thing came at just the wrong time," one government bond trader said. "Once the market can refocus on economic fundamentals, it should do better."
 
$13.5 Billion Note Sale
 The first batch of new Treasury issues were auctioned yesterday, and market participants said the sale of $13.5 billion of two-year notes went well.
The new notes were sold at an average yield of 6.01 percent, down from the average rate of 6.14 percent at the last two-year note sale on Sept. 24. It was the lowest rate since an auction on April 19, 1977, when the rate was 5.87 percent.
In marked contrast to the last two-year auction, New York-based primary dealers bought well over 90 percent of the securities sold yesterday.
In what was seen as a possible reaction to the Salomon Brothers scandal, customers at the auction in September bypassed Wall Street houses.
Today the Treasury is expected to sell $9 billion of new five-year notes.
Those securities were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 6.97 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 19/32, up 1/4, to yield 8.07 percent, compared with 8.09 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 13/32, unchanged from late Tuesday, to yield 7.66 percent. And the outstanding 6 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, up 1/32, to yield 5.98 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills eased slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.02 percent in late trading, down one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell the same amount, to a late offered rate of 5.08 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, two companies priced a total of $800 million worth of new debt securities.
The General Motors Acceptance Corporation offered $400 million of 7.50 percent four-year notes through an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation.
The securities were priced at $99.952, to yield 7.512 percent, 90 basis points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
The notes, which mature Oct. 15, 1995, are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Morgan Stanley Group offered $400 million of five-year and 10-year notes through its principal subsidiary, Morgan Stanley & Co.
The $200 million worth of 8 percent five-year notes were priced at 99.915, to yield 8.02 percent, 1.05 percentage points over the prevailing when-issued yield on the new five-year Treasury notes to be sold today.
The remaining $200 million of 8 7/8 percent 10-year securities were priced at par, or $100, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Both portions of the issue are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poors.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority priced a $300 million offering of serial and term bonds.
Yields on the serial bonds range from 4.70 percent on securities maturing in 1992 to a maximum yield of 6.80 percent on bonds maturing in 2005.
A 6.50 percent term bond maturing in 2019 was priced to yield 7.05 percent.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as lead manager for the negotiated sale. The securities are rated A by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were little changed in fairly active trading.
Prices continued to weaken in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Traders said most widely quoted securities dipped by about 1/8 of a point.
"Buyers aren't showing a lot of interest, and there is a heavy supply of new issues coming next week," one municipal bond trader said.

HEADLINE: Deficit in Bank Insurance Fund Is Triple the Previous Projection

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Federal regulators released new estimates today that more than triple the deficit projected for next year in the fund that protects bank deposits.
The new estimates of a $9.6 billion deficit compare with the $3 billion previously predicted and reflect the view of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that an increasing number of large banks are likely to fail in 1992 because of the weak economy. 
 The estimates raise serious questions about whether the industry will be able to repay the $30 billion taxpayer loan that the Administration has proposed to protect depositors. They also strongly suggest that $30 billion may not be enough.
The estimates put further pressure on the deposit corporation to raise once again the premiums that financial institutions pay the fund and to pass the costs on to customers in the form of increased fees and rates. But agency officials said today that no increase would occur before June at the earliest.
Representatives of the banking industry said the new figures were not surprising, given the state of the economy. "Clearly, with the recovery as slow and weak as it is, the new estimates are understandable," said Robert H. Dugger, chief economist of the American Bankers Association.
Legislation has been introduced in the House and Senate that would provide the taxpayer loan, and a bill could reach the floor of the House as early as next week. The chairmen of two House committees, who have been at odds over how to overhaul the banking system, said today that they had reached an agreement.
"Many of us have long felt that the estimates have been too optimistic, and this just corroborates that view," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, a member of the House Banking Committee. "Even these estimates will probably be too optimistic."
In a letter to Congress, the acting chairman of the deposit insurance corporation, Andrew C. Hove, warned today that "if the banking industry deteriorates further, $30 billion will probably not be sufficient." But he declined to provide a figure, saying any estimate would "be speculative at best."
 
Larger Line of Credit
 The fund is now worth $2.6 billion, and it has a $5 billion line of credit with the Treasury. The Administration has proposed increasing its credit line to $30 billion and providing an additional $45 billion in loans to be used as working capital. Officials say the loans would be repaid through the sale of assets from failed banks.
According to the estimates the F.D.I.C. sent to Congress today, the insurance fund is likely to need to borrow at least $9.6 billion next year and $8.7 billion in 1993, for a total of $18.3 billion.
These projections are based on an assumption that the economy will continue to sputter along at its current rate, or do slightly better. If the economy slides into a deeper recession, the F.D.I.C. predicted, the insurance fund may need to borrow $14.1 billion next year and $14.8 billion in 1993, for a total of $28.9 billion. That would leave the insurance fund with a cushion of only $1.1 billion going into 1994, to protect about $2.3 trillion worth of deposits.
"It should be recognized that under a more pessimistic set of assumptions, a $30 billion cap on loss borrowings could ultimately prove insufficient," Mr. Hove said in his letter. Mr. Hove has been acting as chairman until the arrival of William Taylor, who was confirmed Tuesday night as the new chairman by a voice vote of the Senate. He replaces L. William Seidman.
As he left last week, Mr. Seidman said $30 billion might be insufficient if the economy did not grow, but he did not provide significant details. He is expected to be asked about the latest estimates in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow.
Mr. Taylor is expected to arrive in his new office on Friday.
 
Economy Is Cited
 Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the deposit corporation, attributed the new projections to the weak economy.
"The economy, including most local commercial real estate markets, has not shown signs of a strong recovery," he said, pointing particularly to weakening bank earnings in California and New England.
The latest figures show that at least 200 banks with $86 billion in assets are likely to fail in 1992. But the figures show that if the economy declines, 239 banks holding $116 billion could fail. This year, in contrast, the regulators expect 137 banks holding assets if $73 billion will be seized.
Mr. Whitney said the board of the deposit corporation concluded yesterday that "while it is apparent that there may be a need to increase bank premiums, staff analysis is not complete," and will not be done by Nov. 1. That is the date by which a premium increase would have to be announced to take effect in January. As a result, he said, "bankers can be assured it will not be until June" that the F.D.I.C. will be able to raise premiums. Banks now pay 23 cents for every $100 in deposits.
The Treasury Department, which has consistently maintained that $30 billion would be enough to handle the problem and that it could be repaid by the banking industry, said today that it would not seek more money because it continued to believe its request would be sufficient to handle the fund's deficit.

HEADLINE: Chevron Earnings Dropped 22.3% in the Third Quarter

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest oil company, said yesterday that its net income declined 22.3 percent in the third quarter, extending the pattern of lower profits in the period for big oil companies.
Net income was $313 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with $403 million, or $1.14, in the comparable period last year. Revenues for the San Francisco-based company declined 5.1 percent, to $10.01billion, from $10.55 billion. 
 Like most international oil companies, Chevron said its operations were weakest in the United States. Low natural gas prices, gasoline price wars on the West Coast, sluggish demand for chemicals and a sluggish domestic economy were all factors in the profit decline, said Kenneth T. Derr, the company's chairman and chief executive.
Chevron's refining unit lost $10 million from operations in the United States, partly from the gasoline price wars, a 5 percent drop in sales and because lower operating rates at its refineries forced the company to buy gasoline from other refiners.
The same unit lost $53 million in the third quarter last year, when crude costs soared after Iraq invaded Kuwait and jawboning by the Administration kept marketers from raising retail prices enough to match the higher crude costs. Chevron spent $53 million in both quarters on pollution-control programs at its refineries and Chevron-brand service stations.
Earnings in the company's exploration unit declined sharply in the United States, to $29 million, from $201 million in the period a year ago, when crude prices soared. The company sold crude at an average price of $16.95 per barrel in the quarter, down from $22.20 in the comparable period a year ago.
But profits from foreign exploration rose to $327 million, from $285 million. Natural gas prices were higher outside the United States.
Chevron's share price fell yesterday $1, to $75.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Fed Finds Recovery Has Stalled

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
In a survey that tends to confirm that the recovery has lost momentum, the Federal Reserve reported today that retail sales have been virtually flat in recent weeks and that factory output, while still improving, is doing so at a slower pace.
Over all, according to the Fed's compilation of anecdotal evidence from its 12 regional banks, the nation's economy was "weak or growing slowly" in September and early October, with merchants "cautious" about the holiday season ahead. 
 Such language presents a somewhat less optimistic picture than the one in the report the Fed issued five weeks ago, in which it said "the economic recovery continues to be uneven across the country."
 
Sluggishness in Cars
 Underscoring the sluggishness, Detroit announced another dismal sales period today. Sales of cars and light trucks fell 16.1 percent in mid-October. [Page D6.]
The Fed survey, formally called "Current Economic Conditions" but usually referred to as the "beige book" after the color of its cover, is intended to aid Fed policy makers in advance of meetings of the Open Market Committee.
The market panel, consisting of Fed governors and regional presidents, meets eight times a year to set monetary policy, with the next session scheduled for Nov. 5.
 
Little Gain in Retail
 "In most districts, there has been little improvement in retail sales, and a few reported some slowing," stated the latest survey, which was based on information collected through Oct. 10 and prepared this time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. "Manufacturing output is still improving," it added, "although at a slower pace in some areas."
The Fed's respondents -- mainly companies, stores and banks but also port officials, farmers and business groups -- repeatedly asserted that consumers were holding off buying big-ticket items, including cars, because of uncertainty over jobs and incomes. They also cited an inclination by consumers to buy at discounters rather than department stores, and they noted heavy activity in refinancing mortgages at lower rates.
By region, where the variations were perhaps less pronounced than usual, much of the relative strength was in the Chicago and Cleveland districts, which take in most of the Midwest, while the San Francisco district -- California and most of the Northwest -- seemed the weakest. Consistent with previously reported statistical data, the manufacturing areas did better than others.
In the New York district -- New York State and New Jersey -- developments "remained mixed" in recent weeks, the survey stated, with department-store sales sluggish despite greater promotional activity. The survey also cited "subdued interest" among potential buyers of new homes.
On the plus side, however, the vacancy rate for midtown -- but not downtown -- Manhattan office space declined. And in the western part of the district, twice as many Buffalo-area companies as in the last survey reported an increase in new orders.
The San Francisco district reported "deteriorating" factory activity in California and the Pacific Northwest, "sluggish" retail sales and "plummeted" rents for Los Angeles offices, where the vacancy rate could reach 30 percent next year.
Somewhat ominously, 17 percent of the district's business leaders said they expect the next 12 months to be characterized by recession, up from 7 percent five weeks ago and breaking a string of improved expectations that began in January.
 
Concern in New England
 Elsewhere, most respondents in the Boston district, which includes all of New England, said there was as yet "no clear uptrend" in manufacturing, with most expecting none until next year and several suspecting that the recent trend has, in fact, turned down.
On the other hand, some steel mills in the Cleveland district reported they were operating in the range of 85 percent of their capacity and that they had bulging order books for flat-rolled steel products, which lengthened the delivery dates of those products to late in the year and early 1992.
In the Richmond district, economic activity was described as "generally weak" in the period, with retail activity slowing further. But exports rose in September at the district's main ports: Baltimore; Charleston, S.C., and Hampton Roads, Va.
In the Atlanta district, which runs from Tennessee south to include Florida and Lousianna, retailers were described as "pessimistic" about holiday sales, but in the Minneapolis district -- the northern states from the Great Lakes to Montana -- sales were "fairly strong" with the aid of a September surge for trucks. And the Minneapolis-St. Paul area expects to garner $6 million in direct spending for each baseball playoff and World Series game held there.
The Dallas district, mostly Texas, is "growing very slowly," with car sales "anemic," the survey also showed. Activity is strongest along the Mexican border, where retail sales are benefitting from a strong peso.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Journal;
Who's Acting Tough Now? Why, Saddam Hussein.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 23

 BODY:
After pinning several pounds of medals and hanging multiple sashes and honorary swords from the "mother of battles" on his top lieutenants and political cronies on Monday night, President Saddam Hussein told a nationwide television audience that Iraq was like the woman who chose to be killed rather than submit to rape.
Iraq's honor, Mr. Hussein said, is more important than surrendering to the dictates of the allied coalition, which has forced Iraq to submit to one ultimatum after another since Iraqi forces were driven from Kuwait last winter. 
 The 90-minute program of bravado and political bonding between Mr. Hussein and the Baath Party apparatchiks who continue to stand beside him because there are few other choices for them was part of a forceful new campaign by Mr. Hussein to pull the country together for a long-term survival strategy against a United Nations trade embargo and political pressure from the United States and its allies.
Over the last two months the Iraqi leader has swept aside the interim Government he put in place last March under a Baath Party stalwart, Saadun Hamadi. And he has dropped the conciliatory tone with which Iraq sought in the first months after the war to re-establish economic if not diplomatic ties with its neighbors in the Middle East and with major European trading partners.
Talk of democratic change has been dropped from official vocabularies.
In other words, the old Saddam Hussein is back, in the view of many Iraqi officials and foreign diplomats here.
"Before the war, Saddam was deeply convinced that the other side would never start and he was dancing on a high wire," an Eastern European diplomat said. "And now, with his tough new talk, he is repeating the same bluff: believing the world will never permit the Iraqi people to suffer so much and thinking that with an open border to Jordan, he can manage to do many things."
There are several elements in Mr. Hussein's new survival strategy, Iraqis and diplomats said in interviews.
Iraq is trying to accelerate its compliance with the United Nations cease-fire resolution to remove the pretext for continued international trade sanctions. Iraq's decision to admit this week that it was working on nuclear weapons is evidence of this strategy. Iraq still faces months of occupation by United Nations inspection teams, but Mr. Hussein is clearly looking forward to the day when this humiliating intrusion ends.
Further, Iraqi officials are working to maintain subsistance nutrition and key subsidies to the country's 18 million people to prevent food riots or a military insurrection that could threaten his grip on power in Baghdad. Mr. Hussein is printing money, raising salaries of key military and Government personnel and lowering gasoline prices.
Mr. Hussein appears to have given up for the moment on reconciling with Arab leaders who joined the allied coalition, but he has renewed an active campaign to court Arab opposition parties, intellectuals and other sources of Arab nationalist political influence to plead his case that Western nations are trampling on Arab pride and dignity in Iraq.
With this strategy, Mr. Hussein is betting that he can feed his economically devastated nation well into next year, or at least long enough to get out from under United Nations sanctions, which have separated the Iraqi leader from Iraq's enormous wealth of crude oil.
This will certainly not bring an end to Mr. Hussein's problems, but re-establishing Iraq's place in the international oil market will start a powerful dynamo in the economy.
 
The Effects of Rumors
 The critical factor for Mr. Hussein is maintaining domestic tranquillity. The precarious nature of his position became publicly evident this week when rumors flew through the city that United Nations trucks had barricaded the highway from Jordan, on which most food shipments enter Iraq. The rumor held that President Bush, in response to Mr. Hussein's fiery claim of Oct. 12 that Iraq could withstand a 20-year seige, had decided to test the Iraqi leader's mettle.
The rumor set off panic buying in Baghdad, sending food prices, already 10 times higher than a year ago, soaring another 30 to 50 percent.
The rumor was said to have been started by food traders angry that the Goverment was trying to impose tough new currency regulations that threatened to cut into their profit . Whether they were to blame or not, the currency restrictions were relaxed somewhat on Tuesday.
 
Providing Food and Shelter
 To combat the growing sense that United Nations relief agencies are doing as much as Mr. Hussein to provide food and shelter to Iraqis, the Government has invited a top United Nations official, Saddrudin Aga Khan, to come to Baghdad to begin negotiations on removing United Nations administrative offices from Iraq.
United Nations food shipments to the country could continue, the official said, but the food would have to be trucked in from Jordan or Turkey.
"We want to establish an understanding that this presence should not go on forever," a Foreign Ministry official said.
For now, the message being conveyed to the Iraqi people, and to President Bush and others who are working for Mr. Hussein's removal, was summed up on Monday night on Iraqi television by Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of Mr. Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council:
"Saddam Hussein is Iraq, and Iraq is Saddam Hussein."

HEADLINE: Florio Urges Democrats To Fight Back

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
With even his top advisers warning that the Republicans could seize control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature for the first time in 20 years, Gov. Jim Florio says Democrats should "get off their knees" and come out fighting for the elections on Nov. 5.
In his first major political address of the legislative campaign, Mr. Florio told Democrats at a fund-raising dinner on Tuesday night in Mercer County, "Democrats are javelin throwers, not javelin catchers," and urged them to take the offensive. 
 Aides say the Governor, although stung by the way some Democrats are keeping their distance from him in their campaigns, is more concerned that they are abandoning the party's principles to keep their seats and making serious long-term political mistakes for short-term gains.
 
$2.8 Billion Tax Increase
 The Democrats clearly are in trouble.
"Sure, it could happen," said an aide who conceded that the Republicans could gain control of the Legislature. The Democrats control the Senate, 23 to 17, and the Assembly, 43 to 37, margins built in large part on Mr. Florio's race in 1989, when he defeated Jim Courter by a 3-to-2 margin. But the Governor's popularity has plummeted since then because of the $2.8 billion tax increase that he and the Democrats pushed through the Legislature after a campaign in which Mr. Florio said repeatedly that he did not think an increase would be necessary.
A political analyst, Cliff Zukin, associate professor at the Eagleton Institute, said a host of "tidal forces" were working against the Democrats. The problems include an extremely unpopular governor, the traditional midterm loss of legislative seats by the party in power, redistricting that favors Republicans, a stagnant economy and decisions by far more incumbent Democrats than Republicans not to seek re-election.
"These are tidal forces," said Mr. Zukin, a former director of the respected Eagleton Poll, which the institute conducts. "Individual candidates can swim against the tide, but all the tidal factors point to the Republicans coming out much advantaged." Although Mr. Zukin declined to predict flatly a Republican Legislature next year, he said, "I would certainly say that is the expectation."
Besides factors like the economy and the unpopularity of Mr. Florio, who receives a favorable rating from fewer than 1 in 4 voters in many polls, Mr. Zukin cites a fact of political life: the party that controls the governor's mansion loses Assembly seats in midterm elections, even when the Governor is popular. And the loss is usually half the seats that the party picked up in the previous gubernatorial election. Thus, in 1985, when Thomas H. Kean won re-election by a 40-point margin, the Republicans picked up 14 seats in the Assembly. But in 1987, even with Mr. Kean enjoying a 70 percent approval rating, the Republicans lost eight seats.
 
Didn't 'Raise Taxes by Himself'

 That pattern, he said, has held virtually without variance since 1973. The Republican strategy is clear. Run against Jim Florio and run against taxes. "Our strategy is quite simply to point out that Jim Florio did not raise taxes by himself," the executive director of the Republican State Committee, Jeffrey Michaels, said. "He had the help of the Democratic Legislature."
Some Democrats are complaining the tactic is a bit overdone.
In the 13th Legislative District in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, for example, Kathy Olsen and Bob Murray, Assembly candidates, complain about a Republican brochure linking them to the tax increase.
"Who helped Florio raise our taxes?" the brochure asks. "Democrats Robert Murray and Kathleen Olsen, that's who," it answers. "They stood by and did nothing as Florio and their Democratic colleagues in Trenton gave use the biggest tax increase in state history."
Mr. Murray and Ms. Olsen concede that they indeed did nothing when the taxes were approved. Neither was in the Legislature.
"It is the height of deception to imply that Bob Murray or I had anything to do with the Florio tax program," Ms. Olsen said. "When the Florio taxes passed, I was nothing more than a schoolteacher and a citizen activist. Bob Murray was nothing more than a retired teacher."
Both, she said, oppose the taxes. They are running against Assemblywoman Joann D. Smith of Aberdeen, who voted against the increases, and former Assemblyman Joseph Azzolina.
Republican campaign literature, some emanating from state headquarters, shows pictures of Mr. Florio with legislative candidates.
State Senator James T. Phillips, Democrat of Old Bridge, who is filling out an unexpired term and was not in the Legislature when the taxes were approved last year, has made a point of carrying around a cardboard cutout of Mr. Florio and shoving it away to dramatize his desire to "push Florio aside" as an issue.
 
'They Should Counterattack'
 He was dismayed to find the device backfired when Republicans produced Republican literature with Mr. Florio, the cutout, not the real thing, and asking in big type: "Jim Phillips and Jim Florio. Which is the real tax-and-spend Democrat?"
Although aides to Mr. Florio say privately that he is concerned about the negative effects, he is more concerned that the Democrats appear to be on the run. "He understands how the game of politics is played," said one top aide who insisted on anonymity. "But what he honestly feels is that Democrats should stand up for what they believe in. He really thinks they should counterattack."
Mr. Florio made that clear on Tuesday. "Democrats have got to stop being a punching bag," he said. "I've always believed it's better to be a javelin thrower than a javelin catcher. It's time for some Democrats around this state to get off their knees and start to stand up for the principles and the policies we represent."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Economic Ills Cast Shadow Over Bush Re-election Plans

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Concerned for months about President Bush's image on domestic policy, the White House is sharpening its focus on the economic issues that have suddenly complicated a re-election effort that seemed like a sure thing just a few months ago.
As early as August, at Mr. Bush's first major 1992 campaign strategy session, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, warned that interest rates had to come down by year's end to improve the economy by election time, officials said today. 
 Interest rates have fallen slightly since that session, and the White House acknowledges that the recession is not ending as fast as the President had hoped. That could leave Mr. Bush running in the shadow of his own economic record, a victim of successes in foreign policy that have helped salve Americans' fears for their military security but left economics as virtually the only item on the nation's electoral agenda.
 
Possible Threat From Cuomo
 Indeed, some Republican strategists view renewed talk that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York might run for President as a sign that the economy is bad enough to entice stronger Democratic candidates into the race. A longtime adviser to Mr. Bush said that of all possible Democratic contenders, it is Mr. Cuomo and his sharp oratorical skills that most worry the President.
Another Republican strategist, Charles Black, said he had long believed that the economy, rather than any individual Democrat, was a threat to the President's re-election. "If we are still in the same kind of economy that we have today a year from now," he said, "a lot of folks are at least going to take a look at the Democrats."
With Democrats in Congress starting to offer measures to cut taxes and improve the economy, there are abundant signs of a White House coming to grips with this troubling scenario for an incumbent President: a stagnant economy, a disillusioned electorate that thinks he spends too much time on foreign policy and no handy solutions in sight.
Mr. Bush's advisers are hurrying efforts to produce a legislative package to stimulate the economy. Until now, Mr. Bush has clung to his insistence that only a cut in the capital gains tax rate is acceptable, but White House officials are now considering other measures as well, including the possibility of embracing one of the more conservative Democratic proposals. There are at least a dozen proposals from members of both parties and the White House will not say which, if any, it finds acceptable.
Presidential advisers are also scheduling more events like the ones Mr. Bush has held in recent months to demonstrate his concerns about domestic issues. Just today, the White House issued a new set of proposals for overhauling the American legal system and tried to reach a compromise on a new civil rights bill.
It also disclosed that Mr. Bush, who loves above all else to fly abroad to meet with foreign dignitaries, was considering cutting short one of the three overseas trips scheduled for the next month, a two-week Far East excursion.
Mr. Bush has received the highest ratings in opinion polls of any President since such records have been kept. But he is not just trying to get re-elected. He also is hoping to get more Republicans elected to the Democratic-controlled Congress, and political strategists say economic problems are starting to erode what Republicans hope will be wide margins in states that could help other candidates.
George Christian, a Democratic strategist who was an aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson, said: "In Texas a couple of months ago, all you heard was talk of a Bush landslide and that Republicans were going to win some other offices from it; the Democrats don't have a real sword for the battle. But that talk is beginning to fade and the coattails suddenly seem shorter."
In Texas and other parts of the country, Mr. Bush is facing a dangerous combination: large numbers of electoral votes and a bad economy.
"In the East, especially New England, there's no indication that things have improved," said Marcia Howard, deputy director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. "There's some hope that maybe they've hit bottom, but that's pretty low."
Lorelei Kinder, executive director of the California Republican Party, said she was confident the economy would improve. But she said: "When you sit in Washington you can see the end is there. When you're out in Carmichael, Calif., you can't."
 
Worries About U.S. Economy
 The most recent New York Times/ CBS News poll, conducted Oct. 15-18 among 1,280 Americans, including 991 registered voters, showed that the least support for Mr. Bush's handling of the economy was in places where there was the greatest concern about it.
In the Northeast, 45 percent of those surveyed said the economy was getting worse, as against 40 percent of Midwesterners, 37 percent of Southerners and 39 percent of those in the West. Sixty-six percent of Northeasterners said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, compared with 57 percent nationwide.
Sixty-four percent of Northeasterners said Mr. Bush was spending too much time on foreign policy, and 81 percent of registered voters there said domestic issues would matter more than foreign policy in 1992. Eighty-one percent of Midwesterners, 78 percent of Southerners and 76 percent of Westerners said the same. The nationwide telephone survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Democrats are moving quickly to portray their economic proposals as favoring the middle class and Mr. Bush's as favoring the wealthy. Today, Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, urged revision of last year's budget agreement to allow a quick $30 billion tax cut for the middle class to "jump start the economy."
But Democrats are divided. Mr. Sasser's House counterpart, Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, said that "there is no jump start" and that any tax cuts should be offset by spending cuts or other taxe increases.
Spencer Abraham, co-chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, said that with this indecision, Republicans "can argue that in foreign affairs, the President's policies, have been given a chance to work."

HEADLINE: In a Florida Haven for Guatemalans, Seven Deaths Bring New Mourning

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANTOWN, Fla., Oct. 22

 BODY:
Along the main street of this farm town just east of Lake Okeechobee, it is not unusual to see small, brown-skinned women dressed in huipiles, colorful woven blouses that are a trademark of Mayan culture, chatting easily among themselves in Kanjobal, Quiche, Acatec and other Indian languages.
Just a few weeks ago, marimba bands and dancers convened to celebrate the feast of San Miguel, patron saint of a village in the Guatemalan mountains that was once home to several hundred families who have settled here. 
 But today Indiantown is in mourning over the deaths of seven farmworkers from a Guatemalan village in Huehuetenango province who drowned just south of here last week after their car plunged into a canal. The deaths have shattered the sense of security of the estimated 5,000 Guatemalan Indians who have flocked to this area over the last decade, making it probably the largest single concentration of Guatemalan Mayan peoples in the United States, ethnologists and community leaders say.
 
Long List of Tribulations
 For the proud but reserved descendants of the Maya, Indiantown has become a haven, known to villagers in even the most remote corner of the Sierra Madre of Guatemala as a place where the Mayan way of life can be enjoyed without fear. As friends and neighbors prepared the seven men's bodies today for a funeral Mass and shipment back to from their home village in Huehuetenango (pronounced way-way-teh-NAHN-go), there was a sense that this is yet another in a long list of tribulations to be endured and overcome.
"We have lived through tragedy after tragedy," said Antonio Silvestre, a teacher and parent counselor at the Hope Rural School, where Guatemalan students are the largest nationality. "The indigenous peoples of Guatemala have always been exploited, marginalized and killed, so something like this merely enhances a feeling of solidarity in suffering."
The presence of several thousand Guatemalan Indians in this rural section of Florida is itself the result of encroachments on Mayan ancestral lands by Spanish-speakers, which over the last half-century has forced many of the Indian peoples of the Guatemalan highlands to become migrants. They travel annually to coastal areas of their own country and to southern Mexico to harvest coffee, cacao, sugar and cotton, working long hours for low pay.
That habit of migration for work is what drew the first of these people to Florida about a decade ago, Mr. Silvestre said. Once they arrived and quickly found work harvesting sugar, oranges and cucumbers, they discovered the quiet rural setting to be congenial and passed on the word to relatives back home as well as to the many Guatemalans in Los Angeles.
"Most people in Guatemala live in small towns in the mountains, not big cities," said Dominga Xunkax Gaspar, a 27-year-old Mayan woman who works for Holy Cross Church's community outreach program. "This is a place where families can stay united, where the atmosphere, and even some of the trees are similar to what we knew."
This sleepy town of some 5,000 residents is said to have derived its name from the Indian burial mounds that impressed the first white settlers when they arrived less than a century ago. But the Mayans believe it was "a good omen we happened to find a place with this name," said Andres Cruz."
The vast majority of the Guatemalan Indians are living here legally, having qualified for that status under the 1986 immigration bill that permitted foreign immigrants who arrived illegally to qualify for resident status. Many newcomers are arriving under family reunification provisions of the immigration laws.
Many of the early arrivals here were fleeing fierce political repression at the hands of the military forces that ruled Guatemala for more than 30 years. Mr. Silvestre, for example, was forced to leave his job as an agronomist a decade ago when he developed "certain problems with colonels and generals," as he delicately phrased it.
"A lot of my best students and my friends, indigenous people like me who had become lawyers or doctors identified with the most poor, were killed," he said. "It was the kind of situation in which a death threat or warning was a luxury, because it at least gave you time to hide or flee."
Father Frank O'Loughlin, who was parish priest here when the Guatemalan influx began and now handles migrant services for the Diocese of Palm Beach, said several children arrived mute or crosseyed, which psychologists attributed to the trauma of having seen relatives and fellow villagers killed. In the classroom, he said, they first drew pictures of massacres or of helicopters spraying bullets and bombs at farmers in their fields, but gradually came to feel a sense of security.
"I can still remember my grandma telling us that the soldiers were coming and that we would have to hide if we didn't want to be killed," said Carlos Lopez, who is now a 19-year-old senior at South Fork High School. "I was kind of scared when I first got here, because of the new language and all, but my dad definitely did the right thing by getting us out of there."
With the passage of time, young people like Mr. Lopez have become comfortable with American ways. So comfortable, in fact, that some of their elders, much like other immigrant groups, worry that the youngsters are losing touch with their Mayan roots.
"The world of the children is neither 100 percent Guatemalan nor 100 percent American, but a mixture of tastes and styles," Ms. Xunkax acknowledged.
Mateo Andres, a 21-year-old farmworker and neighbor of the seven men who drowned, said he hoped that his 9-month-old son would grow up to be "100 percent American" and marry an American woman. He added that he saw no real point in passing on Mayan languages or customs.
Many older people have also succumbed to the conveniences of American life. Midwives, many of whom are illiterate and speak neither Spanish nor English, cannot get licenses and have been supplanted by doctors; curanderos, or medicine men, have suffered a similar loss of prestige and authority for the same reason.
The tradition of a weekly market, where news and gossip are exchanged and fruits, meat and vegetables bought, has given way to shopping in supermarkets. Mayan religious rites, which have coexisted with Catholicism since the time of Columbus, are said to be weakening, as newly arrived immigrants look to the Roman Catholic Church and its affiliated agencies for guidance in matters both religious and secular.
Few of the Mayans think seriously of returning to Guatemala. The political situation there continues to be unstable, jobs are scarce, and there are greater opportunities here, where many families now own cars and refrigerators and some have even bought their own homes.
"Here, I can make as much as $5.25 an hour," said Diego Felipe, a 43-year-old farmworker who has been in the United States 11 years and has saved enough money to bring his wife and children to Indiantown in January. "In Guatemala, I would be earning $2 a day if I could find work."

HEADLINE: 3 Latin Presidents Press Castro for Faster Change

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COZUMEL, Mexico, Oct. 23

 BODY:
In a meeting that underscored their differences with the United States over how to promote democratic change in Cuba, three Latin American Presidents today urged President Fidel Castro to quicken the pace of reform in his country offered the prospect of closer relations in return.
In public, Mr. Castro showed limited interest, insisting in tough, familiar language that Communism had not failed in Cuba. 
 But Latin officials said he was more conciliatory in private, effectively pledging that the modest reforms announced at a Cuban Communist Party congress last week were part of a process that would continue.
"He said, 'I know the magnitude of my problems and I know I have to carry out reforms,' " said a senior Mexican official who participated in Mr. Castro's sessions with the Presidents of Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia. However, the official said that Mr. Castro added: "Don't ask me to make them and I don't want to talk about them so as not to confuse my people."
 
Reaction of 3 Leaders
 If Mr. Castro persuaded the three Presidents -- Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Cesar Gaviria Trujillo of Colombia -- it was not obvious.
While they pledged to help end Cuba's isolation in Latin America and offered to mediate in its conflict with the United States, they said pointedly that economic subsidies to Cuba were out of the question. Mr. Salinas and Mr. Perez emphasized that they had no intention of helping Cuba replace the cut-rate oil that the Soviet Union has said it will stop supplying to the island.
Even so, the encounter seemed likely to maintain the gap between the United States and three of its closest and most important hemispheric allies over how to loosen Mr. Castro's hold on power. Those differences have become clearer over the past two months as Cuba's deepening economic crisis and the withdrawal of Soviet support have raised expectations of change.
Bush Administration officials, while sharing the goal of greater democracy, have insisted that Mr. Castro's hand will have to be forced.
In Washington and abroad, United States officials have argued for continued if not heavier economic and diplomatic pressure on Cuba, opposing its readmission to the Organization of American States and suggesting efforts to patch the leaky American economic embargo of the island. They have also pressed the three Latin nations not to come to Mr. Castro's economic rescue.
"We aren't saying that Castro has to be violently overthrown," one American official said last week. "But it seems to us that easing the economic situation isn't going to help get him out, either."
The three Presidents' initiative on Cuba reflects a growing assertiveness in regional foreign policy at a time when their countries' economic and political affinity with the United States is stronger than it has been in years.
Latin officials have noted that the three nations have similar motives to intervene. All three have at times used a conciliatory approach to Cuba to counter leftist criticism at home. But more importantly, Mexico and Venezuela especially are in the midst of a profound economic restructuring that hinges on foreign investment. And as Mr. Salinas noted today, "What happens in Cuba will have repercussions in all of the other countries."
In contrast to the sharp tone that characterized their opposition to Reagan Administration policies in Central America, Mexico, Columbia and Venezuela have for the most part gone quietly about their efforts on Cuba. Mr. Perez, for instance, was reported to have invited Mr. Castro to Caracas for secret talks in July, and twice sent the Venezuelan Foreign Minister to meet with officials in Cuba.
Today, Mr. Perez was particularly sharp in his criticism of the American blockade, painting it as archaic and counterproductive. "It has been there for 30 years," he said. "That says it all."
In a joint communique, the three Presidents said they were determined to "contribute to the creation of a climate of understanding and cooperation in the region and offered the Government of Cuba and the countries with which it may have differences its good offices to initiate a rapproachment."

HEADLINE: Connecticut State Police Lay Off 79 of 974 Officers

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The state police force, which supervises everything from highway traffic enforcement to small-town patrol duty, saw its ranks thinned by layoffs today as 79 officers traded their guns and badges for unemployment vouchers.
The layoffs of more than 8 percent of the statewide patrol force, which were all based on seniority, leave the agency's ability to do its basic jobs intact but severely strained, a spokesman, Adam F. Berluti, said. 
 Mr. Berluti said the 79 troopers, all of whom had been assigned to highway patrol units, were being replaced by transfers of senior officers. Those transfers will in turn gut many of the elite investigative units and reduce the number of officers assigned to work some of the state's medium- sized communities.
Radar squads devoted solely to catching speeders are also being disbanded, although patrol troopers will still be watching for violators along with their other duties. At least three towns that had four full-time troopers will see the patrols cut by 75 percent.
"You can't have no police force," said Robert B. Percoski, the top elected official in Somers, which is to begin newspaper advertisements on Thursday to hire three officers to fill the gap.
 
Long-Term Implications
 The police layoffs, while dramatic, are only a small part of the 3,700 layoffs ordered over the last month by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in a dispute over wage and benefit concessions linked to the state's new income tax. And while negotiators for the unions and the administration continued talks today and expressed optimism about a settlement, the layoffs seemed likely to have long-term implications, no matter how quickly troopers are called back to work.
Several laid-off troopers, including the last two to turn in their guns and shields at the state police complex in Meriden, said they intended to seek more stable work with Federal law-enforcement agencies and would not wait around for the leaders to reach an agreement.
"It's either going to be real quick or real long," said John A. Aiello, a 27-year-old trooper who had been on the force for almost two years. "I think it's going to be long."
Other changes in how Connecticut patrols its highways are also likely to be permanent. The Public Safety Department had already ordered the police to stop using all hand-held radar units because of possible links to cancer, and those devices will not be reintroduced regardless of the outcome of labor talks that might restore the squad that catches speeders.
 
Health Concerns
 A police union spokesman, David McCluskey, said his members were reluctant to use radar now, even when the devices are mounted outside the car. "Over time, not having the traffic squads will result in people driving faster on the roads," Mr. McCluskey said.
Mr. Berluti said the decisions to eliminate the hand-held radar units and to disband the radar squads were not related. Cutting back on use of the hand-held units was done purely out of health concerns until further studies can be completed about the microwave energy used by the devices. Disbanding the squads was purely a manpower issue, he said.
The layoffs, which brought the total state police force down to 895 officers, made it all but impossible to do anything but provide basic patrolling and a minimal presence in towns, Mr. Berluti said.
In Somers, a community of 8,000 people on the Massachusetts border, those manpower arguments do not hold much water because local law-enforcement concerns are so high, according to Mr. Percoski, the town's First Selectman.
Somers is the site of Connecticut's only maximum-security prison, with two other prisons -- including a super-maximum-security jail -- in planning or construction, and Mr. Percoski said that whatever the cost of hiring temporary officers, it would simply have to be borne. Somers, along with the 52 other small towns in the resident trooper program, already pays part of the cost.
The police union, along with other state bargaining units, has faced off against the Weicker administration in refusing to give back pay raises that took effect on July 1 while the state was operating temporarily without a budget.

HEADLINE: For Cleaner Air, Scrap Dirty Cars, U.S. Is Told

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The way to cut down pollution from the nation's 123 million cars, and to make them use less gasoline, is not to make the new ones run cleaner, some economists say, but to stop the old ones from running at all.
When the Senate takes up the National Energy Strategy, probably next week, most of the debate will center on how far a 1995 Ford Taurus or a 1996 Plymouth Sundance should go on a gallon of gas, or whether they should run on natural gas or methanol to reduce pollution. But the problem, according to more and more economists, may lie in the 1966 Ford Galaxie and the 1965 Plymouth Barracuda. 
 Some regulators are beginning to see their point.
Yesterday a Massachusetts consulting firm proposed that instead of pressing for new fuels or raising the mileage standard to 35 or 40 miles per gallon from the current 27.5, the Government should buy 9 million vehicles dating from 1967 to 1978 -- anything with a big gas tank or a cloud of blue smoke behind it -- and send them to an early grave. If the bumper sticker says Impeach Richard Nixon or Impeach Earl Warren, presumably the car would qualify.
"It is somewhat off the beaten track," acknowledged Bernard G. Campbell, director of the consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. But he said that for the next 10 to 20 years, it is by far the cheapest and fastest way to cut pollution and oil imports.
More and more, economists are taking control of the pollution debate, with ideas like trading among industries of rights to emit pollutants.
And the notion of buying up old cars may emerge as a tool in the fight for clean air, if not as an alternative to better cars or cleaner gasoline.
Under a plan drawn up by the consulting firm, owners would offer the cars for a "bounty" of $700 each, the money to be raised by a 2-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, although it could also come from other places, including payments from auto makers that failed to meet Federal fuel economy standards.
The firm predicted that the trade-in would increase the sales of new cars and thus raise employment and gross national product, cut pollution and save billions of gallons of gasoline, all for less cost than requiring new cars to achieve higher fuel economy or cleaner performance.
Although the major beneficiaries would appear to be the auto companies, the study was commissioned by three oil companies: Arco, Chevron and Texaco, all of which would have to reformulate gasoline to cut pollution.
Another oil company, Unocal, tried a "scrappage" program as an experiment a year ago, sending to the crusher 8,400 cars, some of which, Unocal said, were 67 times dirtier than new cars.
"I think the Unocal program makes a lot of sense," said Michael Bradley, the executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an eight-state organization that has already arranged a change in the formulation of fuel. He said scrappage could used as a way for auto companies to "buy" extra pollution emission rights if their cars failed to perform as required.
 
Skepticism Remains
 But others are skeptical. "What do these people do when you give them $700 for their car?" asked William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. "Typically they go out and buy an old car, and that's marginal, too."
Cars built with carburetors and without catalytic converters emit more than 25 grams of hydrocarbons and 100 grams of carbon monoxide per mile; new ones emit 90 percent less, and generally get twice as many miles from a gallon of gas. As of July 1, 1990, 37.8 million cars, or 30.7 percent of the fleet on the road, were from 1980 or earlier, meaning that they did not have catalytic converters, according to R. L. Polk, another consulting firm.
All those cars will eventually wear out anyway, so that the benefits of scrapping them prematurely is short-term, advocates acknowledge. Mr. Bradley said that scrappage should not be a substitute for demanding better cars now from automakers. Otherwise, he said, "won't we be in the same bind 15 years from now?"

HEADLINE: Mary Painter Garin, 71, Innovator In Economic and Statistical Work

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.
The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells. 
 Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,
A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate.
 
Calculated Past G.N.P.
 After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.
In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.
In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.
Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.
 
Work in Restaurants
 When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.
The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.
She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.
She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.

Art and Power, or, the Fist That Grips the Brush

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 18

 BODY:
One of the most hotly debated issues in the boom-market art world of the 1980's and now in the politically contentious art world of the 90's has been power: who has it, how did they get it, and what are they doing with it. Every week, it seems, there are panels on power and whatever -- you can almost fill in the blank: power and the artist, the collector, the museum, the critic. Power, in fact, has become prominent not just as an issue swirling around art, but as one of its central subjects.
Now comes a provocative, tightly organized exhibition at the Indianapolis Museum of Art titled "Power: Its Myths and Mores in American Art, 1961-1991." The title itself exudes considerable authority, especially when you see it spelled out in metallic red on the institutional gray of the catalogue's cover. 
 This survey, the museum's first thematic treatment of recent American art, has been organized by Holliday T. Day, who is, not incidentally, the museum's first curator of contemporary art.
The forms of power tackled by the 28 artists here are many and various, including political, economic, military and social power, as well as the power of advertising and of the art object itself as a symbol of wealth and prestige. Fortunately, plain old visual power is included, too. One of Ms. Day's achievements is that she has managed to embed her theme in the surfaces, forms and images of the art on view, rather than leaving it dangling overhead like a vague literary umbrella.
The show starts with crisp Pop Art paintings and Minimalist works (both paintings and sculptures) by important 60's artists like Donald Judd, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, who appropriated the power of industrial materials and media imagery into their work. It ends with works by Krzysztof Wodiczko and Lorna Simpson, whose efforts examine the problems of homelessness and racism. Even without the recent Senate confirmation hearings, Ms. Simpson's big untitled photographic work -- which features a reclining black woman in a hospital gown bracketed by the ambiguous affirmatives "You're Fine" and "You're Hired" -- evokes the specter of sexual harassment.
In between, the exhibition touches on the psychologically charged efforts of post-Minimalists like Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci, Robert Morris and Richard Serra, whose installation works have an interactive component that frequently throws the viewer back on "inner" powers. And it devotes most of its space to 80's artists for whom power has been a central issue, among them, Robert Longo, Cindy Sherman, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, Peter Halley, Richard Prince and Ashley Bickerton.
In markedly different ways, which nonetheless draw on the strategies of Pop and Minimalism, this younger generation is famous for questioning certain power relations in American society while also being extremely successful within the art world's own power structure.
For the most part these achievements are well known, but in tracing the way power has changed its form, meaning and direction in the hands of successive generations of American artists, Ms. Day ties these generations together in a new way.
In addition, the show is marked by a lively self-consciousness that attempts to reveal its own authority to its audience. The installation is accompanied by catchy, almost parodistic chapter headings ("The Fast Track and the Power Lunch" for the 1980's section), plentiful explanatory labels and a catalogue whose essays argue energetically among themselves. One essay, by the anthropologist George Marcus, even ranks according to importance the various private collectors who have lent artworks to the show.
In fact, Ms. Day has been inspired by anthropology to approach American art with the attitude that it reflects "cultural myths, social structures and rituals" as surely as the art and artifacts of any non-Western so-called primitive culture.
At every turn in this somewhat crowded exhibition, the viewer is invited both to enjoy and question, to experience the artworks at face value, and then peel back the different possible meanings like the layers of an onion. And at every turn, the artists' efforts are seen as challenging some of the forces and myths at work in American culture, while unconsciously reflecting or incorporating others.
For example, it is suggested that while Mr. Judd's sleek metal sculptures debunk the value of the handmade art object in their use of factory fabrication, they also celebrate the power of American industry and technology.
Similarly, one gets the sense that the rituals of consumerism are being both unmasked and elevated in Mr. Bickerton's "Tormented Self-Portrait (Susie at Arles) No. 2," a high-tech black metal relief that pokes more than a little fun at Minimalism while sporting over two dozen brand names that reduce the artist to the sum of the products he consumes. Cindy Sherman's big photographs featuring the artist in myriad disguises may be send-ups of various Old Master paintings, and yet part of their appeal lies in their evocations of older art.
The show's focus on power doesn't tell the whole story of the art on view. Ms. Day conveniently ignores the Romanticism and even the odd religiosity inherent in the purity of Minimalist sculpture, which has been likened to Shaker furniture as well as steel skyscrapers. More significantly, the exhibition is hampered by that most American myth, the myth of progress, as if each generation of artists, by being more critical than its predecessor, is somehow moving onward and upward toward total consciousness.
And of course one thing that clearly empowers almost all the 80's art in this exhibition is the way it can be linked back to the halcyon days of Pop and Minimalism and the 1960's, still one of the most mythical decades in the history of American art.
Nonetheless, this exhibition represents an unusually successful marriage of art and theory, of visual pleasure and intellectual skepticism. In the process, it creates a vivid portrait of late-century American society and of the different ways artists have mined it for both source material and targets.
"Power: Its Myths and Mores in American Art, 1961-1991," is at the Indianapolis Museum of Art through Nov. 3. It will travel to the Akron Art Museum, Akron, Ohio (Jan. 18 to March 21) and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond (May 11-July 12).

HEADLINE: ALBANY FISCAL GAP IS NOW ESTIMATED AT A HALF-BILLION

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Despite adopting some of the sharpest spending cuts in state history when it put together a budget last spring, New York State is now facing a financial deficit of between $500 million and $800 million, Cuomo administration officials said today.
The state budget division's estimate of the gap in the $29 billion budget will not be completed until next week. But the officials said the extraordinary bleakness of the state's fiscal picture was a result of higher spending on welfare and Medicaid and of a continued falloff in projected tax revenues -- trends that are themselves stark reflections of the state's weak economy. 
 Budget experts in the Legislature said they had no specific deficit estimates of their own yet but generally agreed with the magnitude of the problem outlined by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's office.
 
Echo of Last Year
 The assessment, at the midpoint of the state's fiscal year, comes three months before New York City, which operates on a different fiscal calendar, is to go through a similar exercise. But the state's bad news bodes ill for the city because it is generally affected by the same trends.
The news is also an unwelcome repetition of last year's debacle, when a series of progressively gloomier revenue estimates forced a painful $900 million midyear budget revision. When they completed this year's budget, Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers vowed that they had cut so deep that no midyear revisions would be necessary this time. And, recalling last year, the Governor is now saying a special session of the Legislature may become necessary.
No matter how big this year's gap is, there is nothing close to a consensus here on how to eliminate it, although many lawmakers have said they want to avoid a disaster like last winter's, when they were forced to cut popular programs like aid to schools and local government. The cuts in the middle of the budget year caused havoc for New York City and other communities struggling with their own budgets.
State Senate Republicans blamed most of the deficit on Medicaid spending, which has risen by 18 percent in the last year, and they vowed an all-out assault on the program -- including limiting some services or the number of doctor's visits -- to balance the budget.
Whatever explanations for the state gap are offered, it comes as a huge embarrassment to the Legislature, whose leaders insisted last spring that the state would be able to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more than was in the $29 billion budget that it ultimately negotiated with Mr. Cuomo. The Governor forced them to drop some of the spending through a series of vetoes.
While lawmakers also pledged there would be no "bounced checks" in that spending plan, they may now be forced to make cuts that take back some of the money they promised to local governments when they approved the budget in the spring.
For Mr. Cuomo, official disclosure of the deficit will also be annoying, particularly because it comes amid his ruminations about whether to run for President as a vivid reminder that the state he governs remains in fiscal turmoil. Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly said he would be reluctant to campaign for the White House if he felt his state needed his presence to help solve its fiscal woes.
On the other hand, given the Governor's near-limitless capacity to cast crisis as opportunity, he may simply turn the bad news into a new and urgent rationale for a Presidential run. Because he frequently says New York's problems are similar to those in states from Connecticut to California, and that their cause is Federal neglect, he could argue that going to the White House would be the most appropriate course for him to take.
While New York City adopts its budget later in the year than the state does and thus has yet to make any firm estimates about its own budget projections, it received a bleak assessment of its outlook today in the form of reports from both the State and City Comptrollers.
Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller, said the city's economy had contracted by 7 percent and lost 207,000 jobs in the last two years, while its welfare caseload had soared by 17 percent to its highest level since 1977.
 
Possible Special Session
 If the national economic downturn continues, Mr. Regan warned, "the consequences for the local economy could prove disastrous and could prolong the local recession for several more years."
The Governor's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, cautioned today that budget officials were still reviewing the state's finances and that there was no firm estimate of what the gap would be. But administration officials confirmed that they believed it would be $500 million to $800 million.
Mr. Cuomo himself has repeatedly warned that there was looming trouble in the budget but has not been specific about its magnitude. "I can't give you a number," he told reporters tonight after speaking at a Liberal Party dinner in Manhattan. He has also not publicly suggested how he would close it. But he did raise the possibility that, as he did last year, he would call the Legislature back into special session to deal with the problem.
"I would lean toward acting as fast as we can act, and if you need the Legislature for that, that means we would lean toward having the Legislature back as soon as we could," he said.
For the first six months of the year, the number of Medicaid recipients was 1.4 million people, an increase of 8.9 percent over the same period last year. And the number of welfare recipients was up by 9.9 percent, to about 1.3 million, according to the State Department of Social Services.

HEADLINE: The Lowdown on Curtains From Lady Velcro Herself

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
SOME people analyze the mood of a culture through politics. Some use economics. But Lady Caroline Wrey, otherwise known as Lady Velcro, the Barbara Woodhouse of windows, has a foolproof barometer. Curtains.
World War II spelled "the death knell" for curtains. But the 1980's turned out to be a "very, very energetic" time for them, with windows smothered in pagoda reef pelmets, trumpets and goblets.
Ah, the swags and tails of history. 
 "There was a lot of money you see," said Lady Velcro, pleating her eyebrows the way she might pleat a pelmet. "When you're deeply insecure and unhappy, you don't have the courage to try something new."
She was explaining this world view last week -- using an eight-foot-high mock-up of a window instead of a globe -- to a riveted, all-female audience assembled at an Upper East Side fashion house in Manhattan to hear her, notebooks in hand.
Never mind the proceedings of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The subject at hand, outlined in great detail in her new book for Overlook Press, "The Complete Book of Curtains and Drapes" (in England, "The Complete Book of Curtains and Pelmets," but more on that later), concerned such pivotal questions as whether to puddle or not to puddle, whether to line or not to line, and whether to speak one's mind to those hopelessly thick, predominantly male architects who insist on designing windows with no room for curtains.
"They are the most amazingly irritating people, actually," said Lady Velcro, whose answer was yes.
Above all, the 34-year-old author, who runs a business in London specializing in window treatments and gives lectures and five-day hands-on courses on the subject, is obsessed with pelmets, which are known in this country as valances. They may be pencil-pleated, French-pleated, goblet-pleated, smock-headed, box-pleated or diamond-buttoned, in a single continuous curve or of arched serpent-tail construction.
"I see the window as a face and the pelmet as its hat," she is fond of saying. "If the hat is too small for the face, it will remind one of a great fat face with a beret that is far too small perched on the top."
"These are perfectly all-right windows," she said by way of explanation, gazing past the walnut-shaped silver pill boxes and ostrich-egg candlesticks in the lecture room. "Perfectly all right. But they aren't thrilling."
For thrilling, readers are advised to consult Lady Caroline's Seven-Prong Plan, the accumulated wisdom of her 10 years of curtain-making. The plan, which she calls fail-safe, advocates an awareness of oft-forgot details like outdoor obstructions and the direction the window faces. ("For goodness' sake," she told her audience, "write it down!" They did.)
Those who ignore even one prong do so at their peril. "You will risk creating an unsettling effect," she warns, her words as crisp as a purse snapping shut. The plan, she said, is "a process, like the seven cycles of a washing machine."
Those who follow the plan, she writes, will be rewarded by (1) peaceful simplicity; (2) comfortable abundance; (3) discreet subtlety; (4) immense luxury, and (5) bold drama.
To Lady Caroline, diamonds are not a girl's best friend, but table clamps, Velcro and a staple gun are.
Those who suffer from math phobia will also want a pocket calculator to deal with Lady Velcro's controversial theory on pelmet proportion: for every 12 inches of curtain drop, allow two inches for pelmet drop.
"You don't have to be brilliant at math," she contends, to execute a lead-weighted, interlined, interlocked, French-pleated curtain, or even a simple bed valance, known in this country as a dust ruffle.
As befits a "bossy curtain-maker," as she sometimes calls herself, she is a woman of definite opinions:
"A bare window is dull. I do not like looking at a black hole at night."
On poles: "I'm not wild about them."
On long curtains: "Length is elegance. But too long becomes a mess. I have a naughty Tibetan spaniel that loves to lie on those great wads of silk that hit the floor. Such a bore."
She cannot abide a naked window, with the possible exception of a pointed Gothic one. "No," she said. "Never. The average window is not, to me, a very exciting object. I want to be decorative. This is the excuse."
Decorative configurations are seemingly infinite, from static heads with Maltese crosses to "caterpillars with ears" (a ruched tie-back with a frill along the sides, which she exhibited at her lecture the way a high school science teacher might a regenerated planarian).
At least a dozen different specimens were on display in the slides Lady Caroline showed of the London apartment of an Australian tycoon's mistress. One pair of windows was festooned with six-inch handmade pleats, goblet pleats, a serpent pelmet, a big chintz bow, double inset frills, piping, edging and shirred muslin Austrian blinds.
"He went bust," she reported.
To Lady Caroline, decorated windows are a touchstone of English civilization: "We want to shut out the cold. It's the most wonderful detail of the room. I've never gone beyond it."
Lady Caroline, the daughter of the 15th Earl of Lindsay, grew up in London, spending holidays at Castle Kilconquhar in Fyfe, Scotland, "which was all turrets." Like many of her female contemporaries, she learned to sew. "We're a very D.I.Y. country," she said, giving the shorthand for do-it-yourself. "As children, we never watched television. We never ate sweets. We had a fantastic mother who taught us how to use our leisure time effectively."
Effectively indeed. Her 35-year-old-brother, Viscount Garnock, has just written an equally detailed book called "Trellis: The Creative Way to Transform Your Garden." You might call him Lord Trellis.
Her journey into the delicate art of curtain-making began after she was married in 1981. (Windows, she believes, are the prerogative of the mistress of the house.) Upon her marriage, she found herself with both a mews house in Kensington and a 16th-century farmhouse in Devon.
She began as a first-grade teacher, but soon after her marriage she decided it would be more fun to start a curtain business. In England, she said, people do not usually hire decorators; rather, they inherit furnishings and paintings and "then bring someone in to do the curtains." She added, "We're great squirrels."
Soon she had "sleepless nights and ghastly clients"; now she has learned to keep the most "finickety" at bay. "I know who's going to be difficult," she said. "The ones who say 'I don't like the way that crease is there.' I double the estimate."
The best way to learn, she contends, is by undoing a worn-out but "fantastically made" pair of curtains. By unraveling the curtain-maker's secrets, "you can see how it all goes together," she said.
Although Lady Caroline can make a rather complicated pair of curtains in six hours, it will take the inexperienced curtain-maker far longer. "If you want something in life, you make time for it," she said.
This truism extends to curtains.
Lady Caroline believes curtains can fit in anywhere, even in Malibu, where she would go with "plain poles with some calico thrown over them, as in Provence or Tuscany."
"You could think about this forever," she sighed, as her lecture came to a close.
The enlightened will think of the window not just as an object of wood and glass, but as a blank canvas for human artistry.
"A hideous window," she said, "is an excuse to do the very best you can."
 
TO TALK CURTAIN
 CURTAIN-MAKING comes with an arcane language all its own.
BALLOON SHADE A curtain that is gathered horizontally across the heading and, as it is pulled up, is also gathered vertically. The British call it an Austrian shade.
CURTAINS "Correct" term for what hangs on windows.
DRAPES A vulgarism for curtains. According to the designer Mark Hampton, Nancy Mitford wrote that a drapery is something used in a photographer's studio; in upper-class language ("U" rather than "non-U," as Miss Mitford put it), the word "drape" is never used.
DUST RUFFLE A wide ruffle encircling the bottom of a bed to the floor. The British call it a bed valance.
VALANCE A short drapery or frame used as a decorative heading of fabric across the top of the window to conceal the tops of curtains. The British call it a pelmet.
ROLLER BLIND British term for window shade.
 
OTHER EXPERTS, OTHER THOUGHTS
Stylistically, curtains parallel the details of 18th-century clothes. Today, there is a general drift to more restraint than in the 1970's and 1980's when, as the decorator Albert Hadley put it, chintz curtains "were like a ball gown too done up." Here is what some decorators and architects are thinking.
 
What the Decorators Say

 
 "Architectural details in North America are often zilch, so curtains become a point of distraction. As we get more into neoclassical decoration, I'm using a lot of tapes and ropes. I don't like curtains fanned out on the floor. I puddle two to four inches, except in very grand rooms. If you want curtains to hang properly, you have to line them." -- MARIO BUATTA
 "I'm not terribly keen on overdoing. We use French curtains a lot, which are semitransparent and cover the lower half of the window. A lot of fabric drooping doesn't make sense. It's an affectation." -- ALBERT HADLEY
 "The definite trend in the past 4 or 5 years has been to simplify. We're making fewer and fewer lined and double-interlined curtains. We're using simple, elegant unlined fabrics. We're using binding with different bias-cut stripes that change directions as they go down. It's subtle, like detailing on an expensive suit. As for puddling, the nine-inch days are gone. Our curtains just break on the floor." -- KEITH IRVINE
 "No one can tell me that those ruffled chintz curtains are passe. They're here forever.
"I see a lot of 1820's Federal Revival influence, classical French curtains with small rings and finials, and the use of simple bronze rods. I wish we could have those pure white starchy gauzes like you see in those Schinkel rooms, but in New York City, that's out.
"I also like crunchy taffetas on bare floors dragging on the floor.
"I don't understand what they do in those West Coast modern houses. I think they must sleep with eye masks." -- MARK HAMPTON

 
What the Architects Say
 "I've always hated 'em. Curtains are there to cover up, to conceal. Levolor blinds are O.K.; they have a diaphanous quality, but are also hard and rigid. They're of architecture, not decor. Curtains are decor, which relates to decorum and propriety. They're a finishing touch. But architecture doesn't need to be finished. That's my problem with curtains." -- STANLEY TIGERMAN
 "Curtains are O.K. in Los Angeles because people go to work so early it's dark when they get up anyway. In houses for clients in the film business we sometimes use blackout curtains so they can review the dailies. Sometimes we even put them in sleeping areas." -- BRIAN MURPHY
 "In many of our buildings, the windows just don't lend themselves to curtains, because they're freewheeling and very eccentric. We once designed wavy curtain rods for an apartment in New York.
"I like classic Venetian blinds, two inches wide and made of wood. They remind me of Miami in the 1930's and 1940's, which is why a lot of people don't like them, including my mother. I like the striped shadows they cast and their clackety-clack sound." -- LAURINDA SPEAR

A Night's Sleep in a Wall

 BODY:

Murphy Bed Company
65 Mall Drive, Commack, N.Y. 11725; (516) 543-0234.
"It's not the usual pullout couch," said Clark Murphy, president of the Murphy Bed Company. Mr. Murphy, of course, was discussing the Murphy bed, the steel-frame pull-down wall-mounted bed invented in 1900 by his grandfather, William L. Murphy, and still manufactured, in an updated version, by the family company. 
 For years, Murphy beds were the butt of countless jokes in silent films by Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. But the modern Murphy bed is a sedate piece of furniture that can be installed in a closet or a custom-built cabinet with folding doors.
It has come back into fashion, more or less, thanks to its space-saving qualities. It is now found in studio apartments, fire stations, ocean liners and retirement communities.
The company sells simple wood-laminate cabinets for its beds but specializes in folding steel frames. Murphy's latest steel frame, devised in 1964, has a spring-operated mechanism that bolts to the floor. The mattress foundation, used in lieu of a box spring, consists of steel ribbon strips or a foam-covered wood frame. Beds are available for every mattress size.
The company installs beds in the New York City area and can provide the names of distributors elsewhere. Steel frames and foundations cost $500 to $825 for the Styleline, a bed for every-night use, and $380 to $440 for the Econo-Recess, a guest bed. Mattresses and cabinets are extra.

The Building Block
314 11th Avenue (near 30th Street), New York, N.Y. 10001; (212) 714-9333.
Noah Block, an owner of Building Block cabinetmakers, calls the Sico wall bed the Mercedes of wall beds.
"And it's at Mercedes prices," he added.
The Sico, made in Minneapolis, pulls down directly from the wall. When it is up, the underside, available in a variety of colors and woods, is flush with the wall. No doors are needed to cover it.
Anchored to the floor, the Sico is outfitted with a compressed spring device. It uses a conventional box spring and mattress, sold separately. A bed frame in any size and a simple surrounding cabinets cost about $3,000, including delivery, installation and taxes.

Most people who want a wall bed are in a tight spot, both for space and money, says Robert Meyers, owner of the Murphy Bed Center of New York. So Mr. Meyers, whose showroom is nearly two years old, specializes in what he calls package deals.
Steel frames, made by Comfort Wall Beds of Tampa, Fla., can be bought alone for $435 to $535. But Mr. Meyers also sells accompanying cabinets. Through the end of the year, a folding-door cabinet, a frame and mattress for a double bed starts at $950.

HEADLINE: Battle of Insurers vs. Therapists

SERIES: Psychiatry for Profit: Private Hospitals Under Fire -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
The 26-year-old woman's moods swung violently. She went from joy to anger to sadness to despair, and was treated four times at a hospital emergency room after slitting her wrists. She was finally admitted to Sheppard Pratt, a psychiatric hospital in Baltimore. But after two weeks, her insurance company questioned her need for hospitalization. Panicked, she threw herself down a flight of stairs.
The insurance reviewer, upon hearing this, remarked, "Clearly the treatment isn't working," according to Dr. Steven S. Sharfstein, the hospital director. Against her doctor's wishes, the reviewer ruled that the hospital would have to discharge her immediately, Dr. Sharfstein said. 
 The case illustrates what psychotherapists say is one of the most profound changes in 100 years of mental-health treatment and care. A system has been put in place that has, in effect, interposed a third party into the previously sacrosanct, confidential relationship between doctor or therapist and mental health patient.
The insurance companies and American employers insist that the new system is essential to control costs. American expenditures on health care in general and psychiatric care in particular are skyrocketing, and mental-health care represents the sharpest rise in such costs for insurers.
As a result, insurers have in recent years helped to form a whole new service industry called managed care to monitor health treatments. Managed care is now expanding rapidly into psychotherapy and, where it deems appropriate, is blocking, altering, shortening or effectively ending treatments.
Therapists are up in arms over what they regard as serious and often dangerous interference that puts severe limits on their ability to conduct their practices. It is not unfair to say that therapists and insurers are engaged in all but open warfare.
Not that these two opposing forces always end up in disagreement. In the case of the 26-year-old woman, her hospital fought the insurance company and it agreed to reverse its decision. "We sent angry letters, and the family got a lawyer," Dr. Sharfstein said. In the end, the woman was hospitalized for five months, was stabilized emotionally and released.
Managed care in one form or another is being applied to almost all hospitals and clinics that provide psychiatric care whether they are public or private, for-profit or nonprofit. But much of the impetus for managed care began with the rapid growth in the 1980's of for-profit private psychatric hospitals along with growing charges of overuse of hospitalization and misdiagnoses.
Psychotherapists say the pendulum has now swung much too far, that more people who really need psychiatric care are being told that they will not be reimbursed for their doctors' bills. These insurers have "become more aggressive and restrictive about paying for psychotherapy than ever," said John Docherty, a psychiatrist at Brookside Hospital in Nashua, N.H. "It's escalated enormously."
Doctors also contend that managed care, with its new employees and extensive bureaucracy, has itself added substantially to health-care costs. The managed-care companies say that to the contrary, they have helped control costs, though health economists say no good overall studies have been done.
 
Hot Line for Doctors
 The American Psychiatric Association has installed a hot line for its members, an "800" number on which it is receiving 150 to 200 calls a month. Most calls are from therapists complaining that patients who genuinely need hospitalization for serious illnesses are being denied it. They complain, too, about what they say is the lack of sufficient knowledge or experience among some managed-care monitors.
"There's a great deal of anger and frustration among psychiatrists," said Ruth Yoshpe, a health economist whose office runs the hot line.
The managed-care companies contend that professionals in the psychiatric-care community are the most resistant to change and the least flexible in seeking new ways to reduce costs of all members of the health-care community. These companies say they are not trying to usurp doctors' roles but say they are simply trying to prevent abuses or unneeded expense.
Nancy Cannon, an official of Private Healthcare Systems of Lexington, Mass., a managed-care company for 17 insurance companies, called the nation's psychotherapists the "most recalcitrant professional group, the most reluctant to participate in change-making."
In general medicine, when alternatives to surgery are proposed, for example, physicans begin to explore or make changes, but mental-health care doctors "tend to mystify the treatment experience when it is not always so mysterious," she said. Medication with outpatient care alone is sometimes cheaper and more effective than hospitalization.
The aim of the managed-care companies, about 400 of which have been created in the last five years, is to conduct a case-by-case consideration to try to match a patient's medical needs to the most effective but least expensive treatment.
Even opponents of managed care say that when it is done well, it can serve patients better than the old system, through improved and informed review of the options. But, they add, the focus is too often placed simply on saving money, accomplished too often through capricious and arbitrary denial of benefits.
Dr. Paul Fink, former president of the American Psychiatric Association, said there was no question that abuses had occurred in the mental-health field that have driven up costs and in some cases been harmful to patients.
 
Some Good and Some Bad
 "Trying to get control over the ethical behavior of hospitals and doctors in hospitals is a tough task," he said. "The people who suffer are the patients. And the people who have caused the suffering had better clean up their acts."
He said managed care, however, has done both "some good and some bad, depriving people who need care of care where extended stays would be helpful, adhering to rules instead of paying attention to legitimate needs of patients."
Whatever its strengths or drawbacks, the economics alone suggest that the new system is here to stay. The amount of money spent per person on health care in the United States is the highest in the world, and from 1987 to 1988, the last year for which statistics are available, employers' overall health costs rose 18.6 percent, while those for mental health rose 27 percent, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
The fact that some form of cost containment and careful management of psychiatric care is needed is also underscored by economic pressures applied by a reduction in mental-health benefit plans themselves. As fee payments have risen, employers have been steadily cutting back their benefit packages.
In 1982, 43 percent of employers' health plans had more restrictive coverage for mental-health problems than other ailments; by 1988 the figure was 71 percent, a Department of Labor study shows. The plans typically limited the duration of psychiatric hospital stays to 20 or 60 days, versus a minimum of 120 -- and often no limit at all -- for other illnesses.
Office visits to a therapist have been restricted even more drastically, the report found. In 1982, therapy visits were already subject to limits in 84 percent of plans. By 1988, that was true of 95 percent.
Because the sharpest rise in costs has been so high, "employers are asking for their mental-health benefits to be managed, where they do not ask the same for other medical problems," said Tom Joyce, a spokesman for the Prudential Insurance Company of America. In some cases, the companies are insisting that their representatives interview patients directly about their psychiatric care.
"They'll make a direct suggestion to a patient," Dr. Yoshpe said. 'Your doctor's not good enough. You should see one on our approved list, or we'll cut off your payments."
Dr. Yoshpe contended that "sometimes the companies have people reviewing cases who are not physicians, telling psychiatrists, 'Why don't you just give some medication, without psychotherapy?' or, 'Our guidelines say four therapy sessions are enough,' when the doctor thinks the patient needs 20."
In general, the managed-care companies deny that their reviewers are not adequately trained, though they acknowledge that they often are not medically trained.
At any rate, the tighter fiscal policies have threatened the very existence of some forms of therapy. The most endangered species is the longterm, open-ended core of psychoanalysis that was the norm for decades after Freud developed the field.
There are some still willing and able to scrape together fees for four-times-a-week sessions that can last four or five years and cost $100,000 or more. But most cannot, and there are virtuallly no health plans that will help with the cost.
There are physicians in mental health who think this is as it should be. "Psychoanalysis is great, but your employer shouldn't have to pay for it," said Dr. Bernard Rappaport, medical director of American Biodyne, a managed-care company in San Francisco.
"The old model was that you went into long-term therapy, and more or less got fixed once and for all," Dr. Rappaport said. "The new one is that you get a brief therapy that helps you get over what you're struggling with at the moment. And when down the road something else is troubling you, you come back for another short treatment."
 
When It's Done Well
 Even critics say that when managed care is done well, both patients and those who pay their bills can emerge winners. Dr. Sharfstein of Sheppard Pratt in Baltimore tells of a man who, at 38, had medical insurance but had been in hospitals or homeless because of schizophrenia.
"He'd been tried on every medication," the doctor said, "but none worked until we included him in the clinical trial of a new drug, clozapine. His symptoms cleared for the first time."
The man's problems were not over, but they were much improved.
"What he needed was a sheltered living situation," the doctor said, adding that his hospital had such a patient residence that cost $115 a day. The man's insurance covered hospitalization at $400 a day -- but not the sheltered residency at $115.
Dr. Sharfstein talked to the managed-care monitor, and the company allowed an exception to its rules and provided six months in the residence.
"For the first time, he's not in the hospital, and not homeless on the streets," Dr. Sharfstein said. "It makes me hopeful that managed care can work."

HEADLINE: 4 PARTIES IN CAMBODIAN WAR SIGN U.N.-BACKED PEACE PACT; KHMER ROUGE SHARES RULE

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 23

 BODY:
With mutual distrust still lingering between longtime enemies, Cambodia's warring factions signed a peace treaty today aimed at ending a nightmare of war, mass murder, foreign occupation, starvation and exile that has devastated the Southeast Asian country over the last 21 years.
Under the agreement -- brokered by the United States, the Soviet Union and China -- a cease-fire in the round of civil war that began in 1978 went into immediate effect. It is to be followed by the demobilization of rival armies, repatriation of 350,000 refugees and elections by mid-1993. 
 But while the agreement today may offer Cambodia the hope of a respite from its pain, it also resurrected the specter of a return to power of the Communist Khmer Rouge movement. The Khmer Rouge was -- and is -- headed by the infamous Pol Pot, and under his leadership it was responsible for more than one million deaths in a total population of seven million from the time it seized power in April 1975 until it was ousted at the end of 1978 by Vietnamese troops.
 
Khmer Rouge Strongest Faction
 The Khmer Rouge remains easily the strongest of three Cambodian rebel factions, with an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 armed followers. And it now has two representatives on a new Supreme National Council and will be able to participate in the elections.
The two other rebel factions are the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, a conservative group headed by Son Sann, and a faction led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former head of state, who is to head the Supreme National Council during the transition to democratic elections.
The three rebel groups, ideologically disparate, have made an uneasy alliance to fight the Vietnamese-installed Government in Phnom Penh, now headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen.
The United Nations has been given the central role in insuring that the accord is respected. It is to send thousands of troops and civilians to help run Cambodia and share power with the 12-member Supreme National Council, which has been formed by the warring factions as a transitional administration until a democratic government is in place.
At the signing ceremony here today, a sense of perspective was provided by the French President, Francois Mitterrand, who said: "A dark page of history has been turned. Cambodians want peace, which means that any spirit of revenge would now be as dangerous as forgetting the lessons of history."
 
'Magnitude of the Suffering'
 The agreement was also hailed by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. "What makes the case of Cambodia so extraordinary -- and its claim for international support so compelling," Mr. Baker said, "is the magnitude of the suffering its people have endured."
Western diplomats said peace in Cambodia was made possible mainly by changes taking place outside the country -- both new cooperation between Washington and Moscow to settle regional conflicts and moves by China and Vietnam to encourage their Cambodian political clients to negotiate in good faith.
In return for Hanoi's support of the Cambodian peace, the United States announced plans today to seek a gradual normalization of its relations with Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 and installed its client government in Phnom Penh.
Mr. Baker also said that the Administration intended to move toward such ties with Cambodia and with Laos, where Washington now stations not an ambassador but only a charge d'affaires in Vientiane, the capital.
He said that the United States would now lift its trade embargo with Cambodia and support aid projects through a new liaison office to be opened in Phnom Penh.
Washington, along with other Western governments, decided not to establish full diplomatic relations with the Supreme National Council but rather to await election of a democratic government. In the interim, American officials said the liaison office would try to insure that American humanitarian aid does not help the Khmer Rouge.
Representatives of the 18 other nations that signed today's accord warned of the need to insure that Cambodia's nightmarish history is not repeated. But none was more scathing than Mr. Baker in condemning the Khmer Rouge for violence against its own people "that has few parallels in history."
Noting that both the United States and Cambodia have signed the United Nations-sponsored Genocide Convention, he added that "we will support efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the mass murders of the 1970's if the new Cambodian Government chooses to pursue this path."
Britain's delegate, Lord Caithness, also said it would be "incomprehensible and unacceptable" if Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge leaders identified with the period of massacres were to try to return to power. "That must not be allowed to happen," he said.
The Khmer Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan, was nonetheless one of four Cambodian leaders to sign the peace agreement. The others were Prime Minister Hun Sen; Son Sann, leader of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and Prince Sihanouk.
 
Sihanouk Urges Support of Pact
 Prince Sihanouk, who was the only Cambodian to address today's gathering at the Kleber Conference Center here, said he considered the agreement a charter to "put an end to the suffering and misery of my people," and he called for "loyal and scrupulous implementation" of its terms by all parties.
Prince Sihanouk governed the nation through much of the 1940's, 50's and 60's, and was deposed in 1970 by officers led by Lieut. Gen. Lon Nol. The previous year, General Lon Nol had cut back Prince Sihanouk's power and become Prime Minister. Prince Sihanouk's ouster was also played out at a time of intense American bombing in Indochina and ground incursions into Cambodia.
Today's agreement consists of three separate documents -- one covering "a comprehensive political settlement"; a second guaranteeing Cambodia's sovereignty, independence and neutrality, and a third committing the signers to aid the country's reconstruction.
The peace accord is written to govern the factions that have fought each other since the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
 
U.S. Began Legacy of Death
 But Cambodia's legacy of suffering dates back to the American incursions of 1970, described at the time as an effort to attack Viet Cong sanctuaries and supply routes. It had the effect of drawing the small country into the larger Indochina war.
American bombing in Cambodia continued until 1973, but Washington was unable to prevent the toppling of the Lon Nol Government by the Khmer Rouge in 1975.
Years later in 1989 -- after both the Khmer Rouge terror was over and all factions seemed to be aware that the civil war was tearing apart what remained of Cambodia -- a first Cambodian peace conference was conducted in Paris, but it failed.
Then, beginning in 1990, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France -- joined the negotiations. This eventually set the stage for an accord by committing the world organization to play a major role in the transition to democracy.
 
China and Vietnam Joined
 Moves toward an agreement accelerated this summer when China and Vietnam, both eager to end their international isolation and apparently ready to put aside their traditional enmity, began leaning on the Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh respectively to show flexibility.
After today's ceremony, however, the focus turns back to Cambodia itself. Prince Sihanouk has announced that he will return to Phnom Penh on Nov. 14, and Prime Minister Hun Sen has said he will accompany him. Khmer Rouge representatives, including Mr. Khieu Samphan, are also soon to arrive in the Cambodian capital.
Similarly, the first, 268-member contingent of United Nations military and civilian personnel is expected in Phnom Penh before the end of this month with the mandate of observing the cease-fire and recommending the size of what will become known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.
Western diplomats have estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers and civilian administrators will eventually be needed. They also believe that the cost of the 21-month operation will be $1 billion to $2 billion, requiring the United Nations to establish a special fund.
The United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, described the peacekeeping mission in Cambodia as "probably the most important and most complex in the history of the United Nations." It is also the largest-scale by far. The Secretary General will shortly name a special representative who will exercise enormous authority under the terms of the accord.
The immediate task of the United Nations force is to regroup the rival armies in special "cantonment" areas, where they are to surrender their weapons and help locate millions of land mines. The factions are also committed to demobilizing at least 70 percent of their forces before the voter registration period is completed.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is to oversee the voluntary repatriation of 350,000 refugees in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border, although the Khmer Rouge has already been accused of violating the spirit of the accord by trying to force some refugees to move into areas under its control.
During preparations for elections for a 120-member assembly, involving adoption of an electoral code and voter registration, the United Nations force will also be authorized to run Cambodia's foreign affairs, national defense, finance, public security and information in order to guarantee a fair vote.
 
Elections Within 18 Months
 After the elections, expected to be held within 18 months, a constituent assembly has been given a further three months to draft a new constitution, to be approved by a two-thirds vote. It will then transform itself into a legislative assembly and elect a democratic government.
In theory, the role of the United Nations ends at this point but, because of the grim record of Cambodian violence, both the United Nations and other signers of the agreement pledged today to continue monitoring human rights in Cambodia after the end of the transitional period.

Chronology: "Years of Torment, Steps Toward Peace"
 
Early History: At the height of its reach and power between the 9th and 13th centuries, the predecessor of modern Cambodia, the empire of Angkor, was a strong and culturally advanced civilization. At various times, it controlle territory from the Burmese border to the Mekong Delta, and south to the South Chia Sea. But by the second quarter of teh 15th century, the empire was declining and was attacked on either side by Thailand and Vietnam.
 
1863: Again under pressure from his neighbors, Cambodia requests French protection to stave off national extinction, and the French transform Cambodia into a protectorate. By the end of the 19th century, Cambodia is incorporated with Laos and a divided Vietnam into an Indochinese union under French rule.
 
1941: The French install Prince Norodom Sihanouk, then 18 years old, as King of Cambodia.
 
World War II: Japanese forces enter Cambodia in 1941. Japan permits Vichy France to continue administering the country until late in the war, when it dissolves the French colonial administration. In response, King Sihanouk declares independence in March 1945. An anti-colonial government is formerd, but allied occupation forces depose it in October.
 
1946: After the war, France grants increased autonomy to Cambodia, but nationalists, led by King Sihanouk, demand full independence.
 
1953 -- November: France grants independece to Cambodia. At the Geneva Conference of 1954, Cambodia, like Vietnam and Laos, is declared a neutral state.
 
1955 -- March: King Sihanouk abdicates the throne in order to play an active role in day-to-day politics. He sets up a national front.
 
1963 -- November: Prince Sihanouk severs economic and military reations with the United States, citing the increasing American activity in Vietnam, and he accuses the American forces of carrying out border incursions into Cambodia.
 
Late 1960's: Important groups grow restive under Sihanouk's rule. Military officers resent his policy of permitting North Vietnamese armed activity in the border area, business people oppose his refusal to accept American economic aid, and urban intellectuals criticize his political dominance.
 
1970 -- March: While Prince Sihanouk is abroad, civilian and military officals overthrow his Government and turn over power to Prime Minister Lon Nol, an American-backed general involved in a limited move to eclipse Prince Sihanouk the previous year. In October, the monarchy is abolished.
 
1975 -- April: Communist guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge seize the capital, Phnom Penh, after a string of victories in provincial cities, and oust Lon Nol's Government. Under the titular leadership of Khieu Samphan and leng Sary, and the underground control of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge impose a brutal reorganization of society in which more than a million people die. City dwellers are forced into harsh labor in the countryside, members of educated or merchant classes are put to death, and a reign of terror coupled with an extreme form of agrarian Marxism previals. Prince Sihanouk, the virtual prisoner of the Khmer Rouge, is declared the titular head of state.
 
1976: Prince Sihanouk resigns and goes to Beijing. Pol Pot emerges from the Khmer Rouge's underground leadership to become Prime Minister, taking full charge.
 
1978 -- December: After a year of incursions into Cambodian territory the Vietnamese Army mounts a full invasion of the country. It consolidates its powwer and in January 1979 installs a new Government led by Heng Samrin.
 
1982 -- June: Under pressure from China, the United States and other countries, the three Cambodian guerrilla factions form a coalition government in exile with Prince Sihanouk as president, Khieu Samphan as vice president and Son Sann of the conservative Khmer People's Liberation Front as prime minister. Washington recognizes the rebel coalition.
 
1985 -- September: The Khmer Rouge announces the retirement of Pol Pot as military leader, but Western governments say he is still the real leader.
 
1987 -- May: Prince Sihanouk steps down for a year as head of the coalition agter attacks on his men by the Khmer Rouge, and he pursues his own peace initiative.
 
December: Hun Sen, now Prime Minister in Phnom Penh, and Prince Sihanouk hold talks in France. This and four other rounds in the next 18 months proves inconclusive.
 
1988 -- February: Under Chinese pressure, Prince Sihanouk returns to lead the rebel coalition.
 
1989 -- April: Vietnam announces that all its troops will leave Cambodia by the end of September, even if no settlement is reached.
 
August: Peace talks in Paris involving 18 nations and the waring Cambodian factions collapse.
 
September: Vietnam says all its troops have now been withdrawn from Cambodia, although guerrilla groups charge, and Vietnamese officials later confirm, that some remain.
 
1990 -- January: The five permanent members of United Nations Security Council draft a peace plan calling for a U.N.-supervised administration to run the country while elections are organized.
 
February: Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk meet in Bangkok and agree in principle to the United Nations role.
 
July: The Security Council members issue a plea to the factions to set up a Supreme National Council that would prepare the way for elections. Washington reversing a nearly decade long diplomatic position, announces that it is withdrawing recognition of the rebels and is ready to renew a dialogue with Vietnam to help the peace effort.
 
August: The Security Council members announce the main elements of a settlement. The agreement provides for an interim administration combining elements from the United Nations and all four Cambodian factions to run the country until United Nations-supervised elections can be held. Factional armies would be disarmed and kept apart by U.N. troops.
 
September: The four factions meet in Jakarta and agree to accept the United Nations plan, and they select a Supreme National Council.
 
The 12-member council meets in Bangkok but breaks up when the faction fail to agree on the chairmanship, the size of the United Nations delegation, a cease-fire and other important issues.
 
November: The Security Council's permanent members agree on the final draft of the peace settlement. The plan calls for the use of thousands of United Nations administrators and peacekeepers during the transition period to elections.
 
1991 -- May: A temporary cease-fire among the factions begins, but the Government in Phnom Penh and the rebels accuse each other of violations.
 
June: The Supreme National Council agrees to an indefinite cease-fire. It also agrees to stop receiving foreign arms.
 
August: Meeting in Thailand, the Supreme National Council agrees to disband 70 percent of the military forces in Cambodia and put the rest under United Nations supervision.
 
September: In talks in New York, the Cambodians clear a major hurdle to a peace pact by agreeing to a compromise system for election. The compromise calls for a system of proportional representation that would allow each faction places in Parliament based on its share of the popular vote.
 
Oct. 23: Leaders in Cambodia's warring factions and the foreign ministers of 18 nations sign a peace treaty ending decades of civil war. (pg. A16)

HEADLINE: Orders for Durables Off 3.2% As Military Demand Drops

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Factory orders for durable goods plunged in September for the second consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported today, in what analysts cited as a fresh sign of a weakening economy.
"If you wanted to sift the tea leaves in the most optimistic way, there's not much to make you feel good," said Joel Prakken, an economist with Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis forecasting service. 
 The Commerce Department said September orders for durable goods -- usually expensive items expected to last more than three years -- fell 3.2 percent from August, paced by the steepest decline in military orders in more than seven years.
 
Downward Revision
 Orders also sank a revised 4.1 percent in August from July, even worse than the previously estimated 3.9 percent drop. Orders had risen 11.7 percent in July.
"September orders for durables reveal a recovery that is still on the skids and shows few signs of strength," said John M. Albertine, an economist who heads a Washington forecasting company.
"This gloomy-looking figure, in conjunction with other statistics such as higher unemployment claims, indicate the sustainability of the expansion is in question," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that a survey by its regional banks pictured an economy that was "weak or growing slowly" in September and early October, with manufacturing "still improving although at a slower pace in some areas."
 
Signs of Faltering
 "So far, industrial production really has been the main source of economic strength," Mr. Sohn said. "But this durable goods report indicates that production may not go up, and may falter."
The Fed survey also found that the Boston and St. Louis regions showed a "growing weakness in defense industries" -- a finding reflected in the durable goods report.
The often-volatile military orders plummeted 48.9 percent in September, the steepest drop since a 51 percent decline in April 1984. Orders totaled $5.5 billion, the lowest level since falling to $5 billion in November 1990.
Some analysts said the reduction in military spending associated with the end of the cold war would continue to plague the manufacturing sector. "It's part of a trend," Mr. Sohn said. Excluding the military category, orders rose 1.1 percent.
 
Drop in Transportation
 The transportation sector, which also varies widely from month to month, sank 13.9 percent, to $29.6 billion, on top of a 9.1 percent tumble in August. Excluding that sector, orders rose nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The report said decreases in aircraft, shipbuilding and tanks offset an increase in motor vehicles.
But the automobile industry reported steep declines in sales during the first 20 days of October, the beginning of the new model year. Many analysts expect auto sales to remain weak and thus curtail new orders.
Unfilled orders, another barometer of economic health, decreased eight-tenths of 1 percent, the first decline in three months. Falling backlogs often mean slack demand and subsequent declines in output.
 
Higher Shipments
 Shipments of durable goods increased seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $125.3 billion, the sixth consecutive increase, although the level remained below the $127.7 billion posted a year earlier.
Still, the report said orders for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft rose 8.2 percent, to $26.9 billion -- the biggest gain since a 9.6 percent advance in January 1989. This gauge of business plans for expansion and modernization had fallen 2.1 percent a month earlier.

Investors in UJB Suggest a Merger

 BODY:
An investor group led by Neil J. Weisman, which has recently acquired 9.9 percent of the UJB Financial Corporation, a Princeton, N.J., bank holding company company that owns the various United Jersey banks, has asked the board to consider merging with another banking concern. Mr. Weisman, who is president of the Chilmark Capital Corporation, said other banks were interested in acquiring UJB, the third-largest banking company in New Jersey, with about $13 billion in assets. 
 Problems with bad loans and a weak economy have hurt UJB's profits the last two years, though it has avoided the major losses that hit other banks in the region. Barrie MacKay, a spokesman for UJB, said, "The decision about any merger or acquisition will be made by the board." Shares of UJB stock closed yesterday at $14.875 each, up 62.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls After New Data On Economy, and Gold Is Off

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday after a new round of statistics showing poor performance in the United States economy.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed down 20 cents at $362.10 an ounce. A late bid at New York Republic National Bank showed gold down 50 cents, to $361.50. 
 Several currency analysts expressed surprise that the dollar did not fall further after the latest economic reports.
Orders for manufactured goods dropped 3.2 percent in September, the second consecutive monthly decline, the Commerce Department said. Meanwhile, the number of unemployed Americans filing for benefits rose by 29,000, to 452,000, for the week ended Oct. 12.
David Jaques, senior corporate trader for Barclays Bank P.L.C., said the reports prompted many traders to speculate that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates again to stimulate economic growth. Lower United States interest rates would make the dollar less valuable to investors.
Speculation about the Fed easing rates had quieted down last week after reports showed a rise in inflation.
In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 131.33 Japanese yen, from 131.45 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 131.05 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar fell to 131.15 yen, from 131.65 in the previous session.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7125, from $1.7056 late Wednesday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7105, more expensive than $1.6985 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7000 German marks, down from 1.7113; 1.4880 Swiss francs, down from 1.4970; 5.7990 French francs, down from 5.8365; 1,270.50 Italian lire, down from 1,279.00, and 1.12625 Canadian dollars, down from 1.12775.

2 Advocacy Groups Set For TV Duel

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IN households across America on Tuesday, the duel over the remote control for the television set could take on added intensity when two groups compete in urging viewers to turn off, or turn on, their sets. Their diametrically opposed advice, though largely symbolic, underscores the continuing struggle by special-interest groups to redirect the content of television programming in ways more to their liking.
On one side is Turn Off Your TV Day, organized by Concerned Viewers for Quality Television in Wilmington, Del., a group allied with conservative groups like the American Family Association and Morality in Media. 
 On the other side is Turn On Your TV Day, organized by the New York chapter of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a group seeking to end negative portrayals of homosexuals in the media.
These advocacy groups hope that millions of Americans will alter their viewing habits and express their opinions by writing and phoning not only local stations and national networks, but also the advertisers whose commercials pay for programming. Yet, even if the ratings do not change by a tenth of a point, the organizers say, Tuesday will serve to remind advertisers that they are under constant scrutiny.
The gay-rights group decided to promote a counter effort, said Ellen Carton, its executive director, because it believes Concerned Viewers wants "to put fear into advertisers" on gay-themed programming.
The president of Concerned Viewers, Vicki Riley, called that "the farthest thing from the truth." She added: "Just as I wouldn't want to see two men making love, or two women, I don't want to see a man and a woman."
"Two groups go at it like this, and the advertisers get caught in the middle," said Thomas DeCabia, senior vice president of the Paul Schulman Company in New York, a national media buying service.
Executives at buying services and advertising agencies said yesterday that so far, no clients had requested changes in their plans for Tuesday.
Such changes are unnecessary, said Michael Drexler, executive vice president and worldwide media director of Bozell Inc. in New York, because "advertisers are already sensitive to program content." Most provide agencies and buying services with detailed guidelines for purchasing air time.
Peter Chrisanthopoulos, the president and chief executive of the Network Television Association in New York, which represents ABC, CBS and NBC, predicted that viewership levels would be no different from any other fall Tuesday. Americans, he said, reject "coercive tactics."
The turn-off adherents "should have picked a Saturday night," said Andrew Donchin, director of national broadcast for Media Buying Services International Inc. in New York. "Nobody is watching then, anyway."
Ms. Riley termed her effort "a message the American people can send about holding the line on decency, on traditional values." Among the kinds of content she is aiming at, she listed "sexual innuendo; gratuitous sex, even in commercials," and violence.
In explaining Glaad's effort, Ms. Carton said: "Advertisers are not the most courageous people. They might withdraw their support so as not to have to deal with controversy."
That possibility is more likely "in this economy," said Ed Ronk, director of marketing services for Media Buying Services, "when advertisers have enough things affecting sales to not want a controversy, too."
In a larger sense, Ms. Carton said, her group considers the turn-off day to symbolize "censorship -- trying to dictate what is on the air."
Ms. Riley, in reply, said that while "everybody has likes and dislikes, our concern is the explicitness" of program content.
Mr. Drexler of Bozell expressed his disapproval of any pressure group that attempts "to dictate in any way" program content by trying "to hammer advertisers to withdraw funds for certain shows."
Thanks to remote control, "it's easier than ever to avoid what you don't want to watch," he continued, adding, "You don't even have to walk up to the set; hit the button."

P.& G. Net Is Off 3.4%; Sales Rise

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Procter & Gamble Company said yesterday that profits fell 3.4 percent for the quarter, although sales increased by 8.4 percent.
Profits for the big Cincinnati packaged-goods concern were $536 million, or $1.52 a share, down from $555 million, or $1.57 a share, a year ago. 
 Sales climbed to $7.21 billion from $6.65 billion.
The company said that strong growth in the sales of its products was more than offset by lower profits in its wood pulp business.
 
Competition and Price Cutting
 The company is in the pulp business to supply paper for its paper towels, toilet paper and other paper products. The company also told analysts yesterday that profits were off because of heavy competition and price cutting for paper products. "Retail prices for paper products were down," said Diane Mustain, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago.
The company also said earnings were hurt by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and added costs related to the purchase of the Max Factor cosmetics business in July.
The company said the sales gain resulted from record volume growth in the United States and in some international markets. Ms. Mustain said that the volume pickup appeared to result from the company's price cutting and "a lot of discounting" in the United States.
 
Plans to Invest $400 Million
 Edwin L. Artzt, the company's chairman, said, "Had it not been for pulp prices, foreign exchange rates and added Max Factor costs, our first-quarter earnings would have been up in line with volume growth, and that includes the increased investment in product initiatives and global expansion."
The company said that it planned to invest $400 million in new products and international expansion this year, despite continued economic softness in the United States, Canada and some parts of Europe. It said it had chosen not to delay the investments, despite a short-term impact on earnings.
The results were in line with analysts' revised expectations. Estimates were cut after Mr. Artzt recently disclosed the planned high level of new product investment.
P.& G.'s share price fell 62.5 cents yesterday, to $80, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Increase in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
New signs of economic weakness helped push up prices of Treasury notes and bonds yesterday, sending interest rates lower.
Traders said that statements by Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, also contributed to the price rises. 
 Mr. Rostenkowski, whose committee initiates changes in tax policy in the House, told reporters yesterday that he was reluctant to forge a tax-cut bill this year, and would prefer to wait to see what the Bush Administration proposed before considering any changes.
"The statement from Rosty helped," one government bond trader said. "Most people know that the process that leads to tax cuts takes time, but they needed reminding. After his statement, people realized the only thing the Government can pursue right now to stimulate the economy is for the Fed to keep easing monetary policy."
The economic reports showed that orders for durable goods fell for the second consecutive month in September, an indication that manufacturing output may be slowing. And the Labor Department said that initial unemployment claims rose to the highest level in six months for the week ended Oct. 12.
"It strikes me that the economy is so weak that something needs to be done," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "And any sort of fiscal policy change is months and months away."
 
Five-Year-Note Auction
 The reports helped establish a good tone for credit market participants bidding at yesterday's auction of $9 billion worth of new five-year notes. The securities were sold at an average yield of 6.92 percent, down from an average yield of 7.05 percent at the last five-year auction on Sept. 25.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 1/8, up 19/32, to yield 8.02 percent, compared with 8.07 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 5/8, up 7/32, to yield 7.63 percent. And the new 6 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.93 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were pushed down partly by the thought that the Fed may be close to easing monetary policy again soon.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.97 percent, down seven basis points, or seven one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by six basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.03 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by seven basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.03 percent.
New issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market remained heavy.
Among the companies offering new issues was the Ford Credit Corporation, which priced $958 million worth of securities backed by auto loan receipts through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 6.50 percent securities, which mature Nov. 15, 1996, have an expected average life of 1.8 years. They were priced at $99.843 to yield 6.73 percent, 74 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's new 6 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
ANR Pipeline Inc. offered $300 million of 30-year securities through an underwriting group led by Lehman Brothers.
The 9 5/8 percent bonds were priced at $99.434, to yield 9.683 percent, 1.65 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues improved by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely-quoted issues rose by about 1/4 point.
A notable exception to that move was New York City. Negative assessments from various state and city officials about the economic climate in the city helped push down prices of some long-term city bonds by about 3/8 point, traders said, pushing yields up to around 7.75 percent on securities maturing in 2012 and 2022.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended week ended Oct. 14. M-1, the narrowest measure, fell by $3 billion. The $3.2 billion increase in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was larger than most analysts had anticipated, but had little market effect.

HEADLINE: Brazil Ignores Protests And Begins to Privatize

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct. 24

 BODY:
As riot police and left-wing protesters traded rocks and tear gas canisters outside Rio de Janeiro's stock exchange today, investors inside inaugurated Brazil's privatization campaign, bidding $1.1 billion for controlling shares in a state steel company.
In a rare victory for the beleaguered government of Fernando Collor de Mello, the bids represented an 11 percent premium over the minimum asking price of $1 billion for the company, Usiminas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais. 
 "The state is starting to get out of activities that don't belong to it," Mr. Collor said today in Brasilia. When this free-market advocate was inaugurated President in March of 1990, he vowed to privatize one state company a month.
 
Growing Social Tension
 But scenes of violence televised from streets around the stock exchange underlined the growing social tension in this nation, Latin America's largest.
As 600 military policemen sought to protect investors, protesters waving red flags rained stones on the officers' plastic shields. The afternoon of running street battles brought light injuries to 8 policemen, 5 journalists and 25 demonstrators. On Wednesday morning, a small bomb exploded outside the stock exchange, without causing damage or injuries.
Earlier this week, Brazilian television showed pictures of a factory assembly line smashed by laid-off workers in Sao Paulo, and of landless peasants attacking police with pruning hooks in the southern state of Santa Catarina. Fueling the desperation, food prices have jumped 27 percent this month in the middle of a deep recession.
"The privatization of Usiminas is an extremely positive step, but it is coming in the midst of a situation that could hardly be worse," Alden Brewster, a trader in Brazilian debt securities, said from New York today. "Inflation is out of control, and there are tremendous problems with reserves."
Historically, high monthly inflation rates in Brazil have provoked the replacement of the Economy Minister. If the current minister, Marcilio Marques Moreira, is replaced, negotiations over Brazil's $48 billion commercial bank debt would be set back for months.
Although polls give general support to privatization, the sale of Usiminas has rallied Brazilian nationalists.
From Rio, Leonel Brizola, the state governor, vowed Wednesday that if elected President in 1994, he would again nationalize Usiminas. "The foreign group that gets their hands on Usiminas should know that they will have to face some Brazilians down the road," he warned.
Opposition to the sale has come from figures as diverse as Itamar Franco, Brazil's Vice President, and Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva, the Workers' Party candidate, who was narrowly defeated by Mr. Collor in the 1989 election.
 
Foreign Bids for 6 Percent
 Today, contrary to nationalist fears, foreign buyers bid successfully for only 6 percent of the 839 billion shares. The two largest buyers were in Brazil's state sector. The state minerals company, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, and Previ, the pension fund of Brazil's state bank, Banco do Brasil, each bought 15 percent.
During the two-and-a-half-hour auction, the price for 1,000 shares rose to 843 cruzeiros from 739 cruzeiros. Since the United States dollar rose to a black-market exchange rate of 710 cruzeiros today, 1,000 shares cost about $1.19 at the end of stock trading.
During an earlier attempt to auction off the steel company, virtually anyone wearing a coat and tie in the vicinity of the exchange fell victim to the protesters' eggs and kicks. Today, many investors slipped in and out of the exchange dressed in sports shirts and slacks.

HEADLINE: American Express Net Plunges 91%

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The American Express Company, reeling from recession-induced problems in its charge- and credit-card businesses, said yesterday that its earnings for the third quarter plunged by nearly 91 percent, to $31 million, or 5 cents a share. The company added that the problems were likely to continue into the fourth quarter, when earnings might drop by as much as 45 percent.
The quarterly earnings performance, worse than the company had predicted only three weeks earlier, reflects the disproportionately large effect of the recession on American Express's white-collar customers.
 
World Travel Off
 It also reflects a drop in lucrative international air travel because of the Persian Gulf war, as well as American Express's own mistakes in dealing with the widening consumer debt crisis, especially in the company's ambitious Optima credit-card program. The company is investigating why the operation faltered, reporting better results than were warranted. 
 American Express's primary subsidiary, Travel Related Services, reported a loss of $88 million, or substantially more than the company's estimate on Oct. 2 of a loss of $50 million to $75 million.
"We just made a bad estimate," said Lawrence A. Armour, an American Express spokesman.
The third-quarter earnings drop includes one-time charges of $265 million that had been previously announced. The company has $155 million in new reserves for bad-credit losses and $110 million in restructuring charges, principally for closing certain offices in New York and on Long Island. The company plans to offer severance and early retirement packages to 1,700 employees, or 3 percent of its work force.
The company also said the poor performance would continue into the fourth quarter, when consumer spending historically rises because of holiday gift giving. American Express, based in New York, said it expected its earnings for that quarter to be around $75 million, or 16 cents a share, to $125 million, or 26 cents a share.
In the fourth quarter of last year, the company posted a net income of $138 million, or 28 cents a share.
American Express reported the earnings at 6 P.M. yesterday, well after the primary stock exchanges closed. Its shares fell 50 cents each on the New York Stock Exchange, to $20.625.
American Express's decline is most vividly expressed in three numbers. The company's return on equity, a widely followed measure of financial strength and one that has historically been robust for the company, was halved from the 28.5 cents of profit for every dollar of net worth in the 1990 third quarter, to 14.2 cents for every dollar in this year's period.
In addition, volume per charge card dropped from $770 in the 1990 period to $760 in this year's quarter. And traveler's check sales, a good indicator of travel volume, dropped by 10 percent, to $7.8 billion.
American Express's revenues in the third quarter rose by about 7 percent, to $6.48 billion, largely on the strength of good performances at IDS Financial Services, the company's financial-planning unit, and the Information Services Corporation, which processes credit-card transactions, bills for hospitals and cable-television companies and provides telemarketing services.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Damage Control On Banking Bill

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE nation's largest banks joined the Treasury Department in damage control yesterday, clearly caught off guard by the agreement reached Wednesday by two long-feuding House chairmen on comprehensive banking legislation.
For months, the Treasury and the banks have called for sweeping legislation to broaden bank powers -- legislation far different from what was hammered out by the two Democrats. 
 So anxious about the deal was the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, that he telephoned Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, in his office Wednesday night, even before Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, chairman of the Banking Committee, and John Dingell of Michigan, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, had finished their briefing on the compromise.
Mr. Brady said in a statement yesterday that he was not happy with what he heard. "It turns back the clock, restricts competition, and protects special interests," he said. "It will weaken the banking system and impede the economic recovery."
Representatives of many of the nation's most powerful banks -- Citicorp, Morgan, Chemical, NCNB and Bank of America -- along with officials of the largest bank lobbying groups, met yesterday with the House leadership to complain about the form of the compromise, which would revise more than 60 years of banking laws.
The legislation approved by Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Dingell drops the Administration's proposal to permit industrial enterprises like General Motors to own banks. In 1993, it would repeal the Glass-Steagall Act restrictions that have limited mergers between investment banks and commercial banks, but it would still retain the high firewalls that securities firms wanted and that the Treasury and the large banks opposed. It imposes tighter restrictions on banks' ability to enter the insurance business than the Administration has sought. And it would eliminate the costly restrictions to bank expansion across state lines.
For months, the warfare between Mr. Dingell and Mr. Gonzalez had presented the biggest obstacle to broad banking legislation.
"They've been sparring and dueling and frothing on matters of not real substance," said Thomas (Lud) Ashley, an informal adviser to President Bush on banking issues and head of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, which represents many of the largest banks. "But as these events have shown, on matters of substance, these two gladiators are heading in the same direction," Mr. Ashley said. "Neither one wants any real bank reform." He predicted a White House veto if the measure is ultimately adopted by Congress.
The two chairmen defended the agreement yesterday. Mr. Gonzalez said it "reflects the views of the majority of Democrats," a proposition that could be put to the test as early as next week, when the measure may reach the House floor.
To make matters worse for the Administration, it has inadvertently set up a situation that encourages Congress to act quickly on the banking legislation. Mr. Brady's own Treasury officials had privately told the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to delay an increase in the premiums banks pay to finance the deteriorating deposit insurance fund. The current rate is 23 cents for each $100 in deposits. Their opposition was motivated by the belief that any increase would aggravate what is perceived at the Treasury as the No. 1 economic problem -- tight credit -- by raising bank expenses.
That decision now puts additional pressure on Congress to churn out the banking legislation because the bill also provides a proposed taxpayer loan of billions of dollars to keep the bank insurance fund afloat.
Treasury officials are privately talking about possibly moving to scuttle the entire measure and just push for a narrow bill that does little more than provide new money for the insurance fund.
"I don't think anybody is in control of this thing," said Edward Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. "At this point, we are bracing ourselves for a chaotic floor fight."
Mr. Yingling said his organization had already begun to mobilize a grass-roots effort to defeat the agreement when it reaches the House floor.
But like so many issues in the complex banking package, the industry is far from united. The happiest bank representative in town was Kenneth Guenther, executive director of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents many of the nation's smaller banks.
Mr. Guenther, who has long criticized the Administration's proposal as a sop to the big banks, hailed the agreement as "very pro-community banking."
"A comprehensive bill has left the station," Mr. Guenther said. "Sorry, Lud Ashley. Sorry, Citibank."

HEADLINE: 5-Month High for Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The number of first-time applications for unemployment insurance benefits climbed 6.8 percent, to 452,000, in the second week of October, the highest level since May, the Labor Department reported today.
While weekly claims figures tend to be erratic -- and for that reason are often viewed skeptically by analysts -- today's report represented the fifth consecutive advance for claims when they are averaged over the latest four weeks. That, analysts say, is strong evidence of a faltering economy. 
 "There's evidence that the jobs situation is getting worse again," commented Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities in New York. "There are some real signs of deterioration."
 
Other Weaknesses
 Weakness also showed up today in the Government's report on orders for durable manufactured goods over the last two months. The Commerce Department said that orders fell 3.2 percent in September and that August's decline was 4.1 percent instead of the 3.9 percent estimated originally. Last month's drop was larger than expected but was concentrated in military goods, reflecting political trends and possible end-of-fiscal-year procurement gyrations. [Page D6.]
Today's figures on initial jobless claims came under particular scrutiny from economists since they covered the week during which the Government conducted its monthly labor market survey, prompting some analysts to predict an uptick in the nation's unemployment rate when it is published Nov. 1. In September, unemployment edged down one-tenth of a point, to 6.7 percent.
Democrats have seized on weak job and other economic data lately to press their case for extending benefits for idled workers whose benefits have run out. The House remained in session all night Wednesday debating the matter, with members waxing eloquent on cable television into the early morning in support of extended benefits.
Fearing they might lose political ground on the issue, Republicans pointed out that they, too, support extended benefits but do not want to increase Federal spending to pay for them. But the White House announced Wednesday that President Bush would probably veto a third attempt by Democrats to extend benefits.
Initial claims for jobless benefits, which gauge the ranks of the newly unemployed and are thus a predictive indicator of the economy, climbed to a peak four-week average of 511,500 in late March and then subsided to a low of 403,000 in late July. Since then, however, the average has risen for 11 of the latest 12 weeks, including the last five. It stood at 435,000 in the latest period.
"The data are saying that labor-market conditions have resumed weakening," said Carl J. Palash, senior economist at the New York consulting firm of McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei.
Mr. Palash was wary, however, of assuming that a rise in initial claims during the week of the monthly survey -- which is always performed during the week containing the 12th of the month -- meant that the unemployment rate for September would rise. He said a study he conducted as an economist at the Federal Reserve showed no correlation, with only a 50-50 chance that the pre-survey claims figure would even point in the right direction.
He also noted what seems to be a tendency of initial claims, which are adjusted for seasonal variation, to rise at the beginning of a new quarter. This could reflect some workers' waiting to file for maximum benefits based on their latest full quarter of earnings.
 
Military and Auto Layoffs
 The rise for the week ended Oct. 12 was 29,000, paced by "military and auto layoffs in the Texas and Michigan region," according to Kathleen Stephansen, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Claims for the preceding week remained unchanged, at 423,000.
Without seasonal adjustment, claims were 389,100 in the week, up 22,000 from the preceding week, with the year-earlier level at 356,200, the department's report showed.
In all, 3,431,000 people on a seasonally adjusted basis were collecting jobless benefits under state programs during the week of Oct. 5, 89,000 higher than in the week ended Sept. 28 when the level, now revised, was 3,342,000. The insured unemployment rate rose to 3.2 percent, from 3.1 percent the week before.
The states with the highest insured unemployment rate for the week ended Oct. 5 were Alaska, at 4.5 percent; Rhode Island, at 4.1 percent; California and Massachusetts at 3.5 percent, and New Jersey and Oregon at 3.4.
The five states with the biggest increases in initial claims for the Oct. 12 week were Texas, with 6,300; Michigan, with 3,500, followed by Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Washington. The biggest declines were in Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida and Arkansas.

HEADLINE: Exxon's Earnings Rise 3.7% On Surge in Global Refining

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Citing sharply higher profits in global refining that overcame sluggish domestic demand for its products, the Exxon Corporation today reported a 3.7 percent gain in its third-quarter profits.
Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or 88 cents a share, from $1.08 billion, or 85 cents a share, in last year's third quarter. But revenue fell 5.2 percent, to $27.5 billion from $29.0 billion. 
 Exxon, the nation's biggest oil company, is one of only a few large oil companies to report a profit increase for the quarter. Texaco, Chevron, Amoco and Phillips Petroleum all reported sharp declines this week. Mobil reported a slight decrease because of special charges, but its profits from operations were higher.
 
Growing Foreign Operations
 All those companies, as well as Exxon, were hurt by crude prices that were more than $4 a barrel below the average for the 1990 quarter and by the lowest natural gas prices in the United States in several years. But Exxon, like Mobil, was better protected because of the growing foreign makeup of its operations.
Exxon, based near Dallas in Irving, Tex., sells 60 percent of its natural gas output from fields outside the United States. Most foreign countries regulate natural gas prices and did not permit them to fall as steeply as those in the United States, so Exxon's profit margins were not cut so severely as those of mainly domestic producers.
"Exxon had a good quarter, considering the soft economic conditions in many markets," said Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman and chief executive.
The third-quarter earnings were helped in part by the absence of the operating troubles at refineries and losses in foreign chemical sales that the company experienced a year ago, said Michael Mayer, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, in San Francisco.
 
Lower Energy Prices
 Over all, profits in worldwide exploration and production fell by 19.1 percent, to $752 million, because crude oil and natural gas prices were lower than in the 1990 quarter.
But net income surged in refining and marketing to $410 million from $246 million, because refineries had lower operating costs and wider profit margins. Crude oil and natural gas liquids are the most common raw materials for refineries. Foreign refining operations, where earnings rose to $312 million from $94 million a year earlier, provided all of the increase in this sector's overall profit.
Exxon's shares fell 37.5 cents, to $60.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: U.S. RAISES HOPES ON 'BOAT PEOPLE'

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The announcement by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on Wednesday that the United States was ready to seek normal relations with the Hanoi Government has raised hopes among diplomats and officials of international refugee agencies that a turning point is at hand in the unceasing flow of "boat people" from Vietnam.
They believe that the ending of Vietnam's virtual international isolation could alter a mood of hopelessness and encourage Vietnamese to see their future at home. 
 Officials at the headquarters here of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as representatives of humanitarian organizations, have long held a view that by boycotting Vietnam, the United States has strongly contributed to the economic deprivation that has prompted many Vietnamese to flee.
Successive American Administrations have ascribed their hard line to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and the continued uncertainty over the Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War. Some international officials have detected an emotional resistance to come to terms with the Communist Government that humiliated the United States in the war.
 
Hong Kong Is the Goal
 Indonesia shelters 20,000 Vietnamese, Malaysia and Thailand 12,000 each, and the Philippines 7,400. But the present focus of the "boat people" problem is Hong Kong, which since last year has become virtually the sole goal of those fleeing Vietnam. About 64,000 Vietnamese are housed in detention camps there.
Britain and Vietnam are involved in protracted negotiations over the return of about 20,000 of the refugees who have been ruled to be economic refugees without legitimate fear of persecution at home, and therefore not entitled under international law to refugee status.
In an unusual congruence of views, the United States and Vietnam oppose any forcible return. A forcible repatriation in 1989 brought an international outcry led by the United States. Since then, only those who volunteered have been sent back. They number 14,000.
The Bush Administration has asserted that Vietnam's human-rights record raises doubt that Hanoi will respect its international pledge not to punish those who fled. But aides of the High Commissioner asserted that their visits had made them confident that there is no ground for fear.
"We get incredible cooperation," an official said. "They do anything we want."
 
A Liberalized Atmosphere
 The official, who accompanied a group of representatives of refugee-aid organizations from the United States and other Western nations to Vietnam in May, said they had found a greatly liberalized atmosphere in which ordinary Vietnamese were no longer afraid to criticize their Government to foreigners.
"Those among the team who had visited Vietnam previously remarked how they were surprised and impressed with the considerable progress the country was making toward becoming a more open society," the delegates said in their report.
The High Commissioner's aides said that almost none of the Vietnamese who are fleeing now would qualify for immigration to the United States. They said that only 4 or 5 percent originate from the former South Vietnam and had been connected with the American-backed Saigon government or had relatives in the West.
American and international officials said southern Vietnamese were now leaving largely legally, under a system called the Orderly Departure Program. An American official said American immigration aides interviewed 10,000 applicants a month in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, and a High Commissioner's aide said legal immigration to the United States would reach about 100,000 this year.

HEADLINE: 2 Bills Seek Affordable Health Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The powerful chairmen of two Congressional committees introduced bills today to guarantee that private health insurance would be readily available to all people who work for small businesses with fewer than 51 employees.
In offering the companion bills, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, signaled the Democrats' intention to seize the election-year initiative on one narrow aspect of the health-care issue without waiting for a consensus in support of comprehensive changes. 
 Members of both parties said the health insurance legislation had an excellent chance of passage in the next 12 months.
Most people who work for big companies have health insurance bought by or through their employers. But small businesses often have difficulty obtaining coverage. Insurers usually charge them higher premiums because the costs are less predictable: claims for a small group may rise suddenly if one employee has a serious health problem. So Congress is addressing the insurance needs of small businesses separately from the needs of the nation as a whole.
 
Disagreement on Tax Cut
 Even as Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, and Mr. Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, announced agreement on health insurance for small businesses, it was clear that they disagreed on another potent political issue that is likely to figure prominently in next year's election campaigns: a tax cut to stimulate the economy. A recession began in the middle of last year, and the economy remains sluggish.
Mr. Bentsen said, "This economy is dead in the water." But at a joint news conference, Mr. Rostenkowski said today that he doubted that the economy would benefit from Mr. Bentsen's proposal to help middle-income families by cutting taxes $72 billion over the next five years.
Mr. Rostenkowski said he was firmly committed to the fiscal discipline of last year's budget agreement, and he added, "Most of the more respected economists are suggesting that to do anything in the tax code with respect to the economy is very dangerous."
Asked if he intended to move tax legislation to the floor of the House, Mr. Rostenkowski, said that the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, "has not yet directly told me that he wants a bill this year."
 
Symbolic All-Night Session
 In symbolic solidarity with millions of unemployed workers, House Democrats held an all-night session to discuss the need for extending unemployment insurance benefits.
The session ran from 9 P.M. Wednesday to 9:40 A.M. today. The Bush Administration has not clearly stated its position on the health insurance bills introduced today. It rarely supports greater Federal regulation of any industry, but it has acknowledged the existence of the problems that the bills are trying to solve.
Under the proposals, the Federal Government would become deeply involved in regulating private health insurance, which for decades has been regulated mainly by the states. The bills do not require small businesses to buy health insurance. But they say insurers offering coverage to small businesses may not refuse to cover employees because of their medical history, claims experience or health problems.
 
Rates for Small Businesses
 Both bills would reduce the variation in insurance premiums for small employers, requiring insurers to set rates within about 20 percent to 25 percent of the average for a community. Congressional aides said the Senate bill allowed more leeway for insurers to adjust rates to reflect differences in the age and sex of their customers.
Under the Senate and House bills, insurers would be subject to a special Federal excise tax if they failed to comply with Federal standards for health insurance.
The bills would also increase the tax deduction for health-insurance costs of self-employed individuals. Under current law, self-employed people are allowed to take a deduction from gross income for up to 25 percent of amounts paid for insurance for themselves, spouses and dependents. Under the bills introduced today, such people could deduct the entire cost.
Insurers like Blue Cross and Blue Shield say the inevitable result of Federal limits on variation in premiums would be to increase the cost of insurance for healthy, low-risk groups.
Mary Nell Lehnhard, vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said both bills "move too fast" to reduce the variation in insurance rates for small businesses. "If you reduce rates for high-risk people, rates for healthy people go up," she said.
Linda S. Jenckes, vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents more than 300 commercial insurers, said her group would prefer to see states adopt the type of standards proposed by the two bills. "We hope the introduction of these bills will encourage states to act next year to negate the need for Federal legislation," she said.
While the House and Senate bills are similar, Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal includes more stringent measures to control health-care costs. Under his proposal, private insurers could pay doctors and hospitals at the rates set for Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Medicare often pays less than private health insurance.
"We're trying to end the national scandal where more than 15 percent of our citizens, 34 million Americans, are uninsured," Mr. Rostenkowski said.

HEADLINE: How the Budget Gap Is Estimated

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Estimating New York State's budget deficit is an exercise that is partly technical, partly speculative and, certainly, partly political.
The Cuomo administration, which has already projected that the deficit would range from $500 million to $800 million, is expected to come up with a more precise figure next week. 
 Much of that estimate will be based on numbers already in hand. For instance, personal income-tax collections, the largest source of state funds, are about $130 million less than what was projected when lawmakers passed a budget last spring. And Medicaid enrollment has jumped almost 10 percent, 3 percent more than expected.
But there is also conjecture at work, because part of the estimate is derived from projections about how tax revenues, the economy and spending on entitlement programs like Medicaid will grow or shrink between now and April 1, when the state fiscal year ends.
No one can say what the trends will be in the next six months, although one reason there is a deficit in the first place is that weaknesses in the economy turned out to be worse than the bleak assumptions built into the original budget projections.
And this is why the deficit-estimating game is political as well: Although state budget officials say the process is objective, they control the economic assumptions built into the estimate, so they have some latitude in setting the number. And whatever estimate Gov. Mario M. Cuomo comes up with next week, some lawmakers here will surely deride it as overly pessimistic and others will say it is too optimistic.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Political Memo A Cuomo Bid Or a Hamlet On Hudson?

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 24

 BODY:
If Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is running for President, his public agonizing in the last two weeks makes perfect political sense. If he is not running, his recent actions are hard to understand and could prove a political embarrassment, cementing his position in political mythology as a Hamlet on the Hudson.
With any other politician, that theorem might suggest strongly that Mr. Cuomo plans to join the race. But Mr. Cuomo is not any other politician. 
 Some of those closest to Mr. Cuomo, including many who believe he will not run in 1992, maintain that the Governor's unconventional political style has made him easily misunderstood. Despite what may appear a grand political game, they say, Mr. Cuomo is engaged in the most fundamental self-examination of his political life.
His decision requires him to analyze the depth of his ambition, his commitment to his state and its voters, and his own capacity to hold the most important office in the land. While other candidates have conducted that debate in their living rooms and offices, Mr. Cuomo has done it largely in public because it is his nature to do so, his aides and advisers said.
"We are conditioned to seeing people who only speak when there's a motive," said Gary G. Fryer, Mr. Cuomo's former press secretary. "He has never been like that. He has frequently got in trouble in the past because he thinks out loud."
But Mr. Cuomo has been known in the past to speak with a motive from time to time. And if he is running, the strategy of the last two weeks has been executed with great dexterity.
His public discourse on the Presidency has insured him a place at the center of the country's most intriguing political story, a story that he has advanced just enough each day to win headlines from Los Angeles to Boston.
By not disclosing his decision, he has generated national interest with the question of whether he will run, feeding the perception that the Democrats badly need his services and sparing himself the scrutiny afforded to announced candidates.
As a noncandidate, he has been able to mount harsh attacks on the Bush Administration -- indeed, every public appearance has become an opportunity for such attacks -- with little risk of return fire.
A sampling from the last two days alone includes his remark at a public health forum on Wednesday that, "For the last 10 years, we've said all you need a Federal Government for is for an army or to cut taxes on rich people."
That night, he told listeners at a Liberal Party dinner in Manhattan, that "things have never been as obviously wrong in America as they are now." At a law-enforcement forum in Albany today, he said the Bush Administration had sent the message that "the war we fought in Iraq is more important than the war we fought in the 103d Precinct."
After complaining bitterly last month that the press was ignoring such pronouncements because he was not a candidate, his critiques of Federal policy on the economy, drugs, and health care are once again the stuff of newspaper articles and television sound bites.
But those closest to Mr. Cuomo continue to say they will be surprised if he joins the race, and the Governor conceded today that the state's worsening fiscal situation would weigh against a national campaign. Cuomo administration officials are projecting a midyear budget gap of between $500 million and $800 million, and the Governor has raised the possibility that the Legislature may have address the problem in a special session.
"It's certainly an important factor and something to consider," he said today at a news conference. "Obviously, I would think if you have difficulty with the budget it's an argument for dealing with the budget."
So while Mr. Cuomo seems to be relishing his chance to pummel the Republicans, his dire warnings about the state budget seem designed to provide a rationale for why he cannot run. Curiously, Mr. Cuomo issued his first public warnings about a budget gap on Oct. 11, the same day he first told supporters in a private meeting that he would think about running for President.
Meyer S. Frucher, a New York City real-estate executive and longtime Cuomo adviser, has implored Mr. Cuomo to run but believes the Governor will not do so because Mr. Cuomo feels he cannot abandon his obligation to the state. Mr. Frucher said he also believes the Governor fears that New York would be victimized by Republican political attacks that could further damage the state's fragile economy.
 
Serious Consideration
 But Mr. Frucher said the pressure on Mr. Cuomo to run has been intense, and that the Governor's public decision-making process was necessary to convince Cuomo enthusiasts that the Governor has given the issue serious consideration.
"You have no idea how angry people are at the thought that he is not running," Mr. Frucher said. "To the people wanting him to run, saying no without an explanation or without the feeling that he gave it real deliberation would be unacceptable."
If Mr. Cuomo does not run, political analysts believe that his national reputation may be irreparably damaged by his second unconsummated flirtation with the Presidency in four years.
"There simply would have been no point to it, and he's done it in such a public way," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. "It simply wasn't necessary, and it's getting close to becoming a joke with the 'Hamlet on the Hudson' stuff."
Mr. Cuomo's defenders disagree. "If he decides not to run, it would be irrelevant," said Mr. Fryer. "It would be a one-day story: Cuomo isn't running and here's who's racing at Aqueduct. Who would care?"

HEADLINE: New Fight In Albany Over Budget

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and top lawmakers are not sure yet how big the budget deficit announced yesterday is, but today they appeared to be heading for a collision over the question of how to get rid of it.
Governor Cuomo said today that he favored a broad approach to finding the savings, or the revenue, to close the $500 million to $800 million gap. He gave no details, saying he would not do so until he knew the deficit's exact size. 
 The Senate Republicans say the problem is almost entirely a result of spending on the state's Medicaid and welfare programs. The spending has, in fact, significantly outpaced the projections built into the budget that both parties had insisted last spring was balanced.
But yesterday Mr. Cuomo and his Democratic colleagues had specific complaints of their own.
Mr. Cuomo derided the Republicans for portraying "poor, sick people" as the only culprits in the budget turmoil. And Assembly Speaker Mel Miller dismissed the Republican vow to focus almost solely on social-service programs as a target for spending cuts. He said such programs made up less than a fifth of the budget and simply could not yield all the savings needed to pare the deficit.
 
Uncertainty Over Medicaid
 So for all the trauma of last year's mid-year budget cuts, when all sorts of local-aid programs were reduced and state workers were forced to defer a week's worth of pay until retirement, the fight over this year's budget gap could be even more vehement, lawmakers in both parties say.
The looming battle also creates new uncertainty for the much longer-range proposal Mr. Cuomo outlined last month to have the state eventually assume all local Medicaid costs, a move that the Governor said would provide significant budget relief for New York City and other struggling municipalities.
The majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, Ralph J. Marino, suggested today that his chamber would not even consider the proposal unless it were accompanied by major cost-containment initiatives, like new limits on medical services or doctor's visits.
"Without dealing with the problem here, which is out-of-control growth in spending on the program, the state simply can't afford it," Mr. Marino said of the Governor's proposal.
The Governor has repeatedly countered that he is at least as committed as the Senate is to reining in the Medicaid program. Nevertheless, Mr. Marino's ability to withhold support for the state Medicaid takeover -- which some Republicans complain could be of greater benefit to New York City than the suburban or upstate areas they represent -- may give him an unusual degree of influence in how the present gap is closed.
On top of all this is the basic question of why the budget has fallen out of balance at all, given the solemn statements in the spring by the Governor and the legislative leaders that their spending plan would not fall in the red.
The Governor has wasted little time in attacking the Legislature for the problem, noting that the amount of spending they added back into the budget last spring after he vetoed parts of it appeared to be roughly equivalent to the size of the current gap.
"I did plead with them," Mr. Cuomo said the other day at a news conference. "But I lost again because they said no, you've got to spend." The extra money was mainly for local-assistance programs like school aid.
That argument will probably not hold up, however, because aside from putting his name to the final budget accord last spring, Mr. Cuomo also took credit for getting the Legislature to pay for that additional spending. So it might be a stretch of logic for him now to blame the spending for the deficit.
Similarly, Republicans like Mr. Marino say the problems with excessive Medicaid spending were Mr. Cuomo's fault because the program, which his agencies oversee, had not achieved the cost savings projected when the budget was passed. But not only did the State Senate concur with the savings projections, it actually originated several of them.
Some independent observers think, in this case anyway, that the Governor and the legislative leaders have no need to blame themselves or each other. "I don't think you can do much too much faulting here," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission. "What is driving the deficit, essentially, is that we are learning just how badly the economy is performing, and it's worse than almost anybody ever thought it would be."

HEADLINE: Gene Roddenberry, 'Star Trek' Creator, Dies at 70

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Gene Roddenberry, the Hollywood writer and producer who created the 1960's science-fiction television series "Star Trek," which inspired six feature films, a sequel series in the 1980's and legions of space-age devotees known as Trekkies, died yesterday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center in California. He was 70 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
Mr. Roddenberry had been ill for about six weeks and died of a blood clot, said John Wentworth, a spokesman for Paramount Pictures. But Wendy Gullies, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the cause of death was listed as cardiopulmonary arrest. 
 A tall, soft-spoken man with a silver mane and a dazzling imagination, Mr. Roddenberry was a much-decorated B-17 pilot in the Pacific in World War II, a pilot for Pan American World Airways, a speechwriter for the Los Angeles police chief, a writer for episodes of "Dragnet" and "Naked City," and head writer of the 1950's television series "Have Gun, Will Travel."
But with "Star Trek," which made its in 1966 and ran until 1969 on NBC, Mr. Roddenberry took a generation of viewers along on a journey into "space, the final frontier," aboard the Starship Enterprise, to "explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
 
The Galaxies Beyond
 It was an idea that, in various permutations, consumed more than a third of Mr. Roddenberry's life and made believers out of the most skeptical critics. It gave American popular culture such futuristic hardware as "phaser guns" and "transporter beams," and a living-room window on worlds and aliens far beyond the reality of a bright new space age.
It introduced a cast of characters whose names became familiar to millions: the dashing commander, Captain Kirk (played by William Shatner); the omnisciently logical, pointy-eared Vulcan First Mate, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy); Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley); Scotty, the chief engineer (James Doohan); Mr. Sulu (George Takei), and Lieut. Uhura (Nichelle Nicols).
And it spawned a worldwide fascination that led to Trekkie conventions, products ranging from books and T-shirts to lunch boxes and toys, reruns of its 79 original episodes in 48 countries for more than a decade, a half-dozen feature films starting in 1979, and a sequel series, "Star Trek: The Next Generation," which was launched in 1987 and is still running, with audiences of more than 12 million households and numerous awards to its credit.
 
Entertainment With a Message
 "Few ideas in the annals of motion picture and television history have inspired more passion and allegiance on the part of the audience than has 'Star Trek,' " said Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of Paramount Pictures, which made both the "Star Trek" series for television and all the feature films.
For Mr. Roddenberry, the Star Trek phenomenon was more than entertainment, as he explained in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in May.
"It has become a crusade of mine to demonstrate that TV need not be violent to be exciting," he said. "I wanted to send a message to the television industry that excitement is not made of car chases. We stress humanity, and this is done at considerable cost. We can't have a lot of dramtics that other shows get away with -- promiscuity, greed, jealousy. None of those have a place in 'Star Trek.' "
 
From a B-17 to Starships
 Eugene Wesley Roddenberry was born in El Paso, Tex., on Aug. 19, 1921, the son of an Army cavalryman who later went into law enforcement in Los Angeles, where the boy grew up. He attended Los Angeles City College, the University of Miami and Columbia University, studying pre-law, then aeronautical engineering. He qualified for a pilot's license and flew a B-17 Flying Fortress in World War II on 89 missions, including Guadalcanal and Bougainville. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal, among other decorations. While in the South Pacific, he began to write stories and poetry for magazines and newspapers.
After the war, he joined Pan Am as a pilot, flying for four more years. From 1949 to 1953, he was a sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department, working as a department spokesman and a speechwriter for Chief William H. Parker. He also began writing for television, and from 1953 to 1962 he wrote scripts for "The U.S. Steel Hour," "Goodyear Theater," "The Kaiser Aluminum Hour," "Four Star Theater," "Dragnet," "The Jane Wyman Theater" and "Naked City."
He won his first Emmy Award for "Have Gun, Will Travel," a western that, according to some film and television critics, was a precursor of "Star Trek" in that its wit, characterizations and themes were only incidentally set in a particular time and place.
The original "Star Trek," Mr. Roddenberry told an interviewer a few years ago, was technically primitive, but it aimed high for adventure and in the way it portrayed people and their relationships.
"We had to explain computers," Mr. Roddenberry said. "And our effects were primitive. Our stars were a black cloth with holes in it and light behind. The episodes cost $186,000. They're $1.3 million for 'The Next Generation.' I wanted to cast a woman as second in command. NBC said no way."
Mr. Roddenberry, who said he always thought of himself as a storyteller, wrote not only the original shows, but also what he called a bible for later writers to follow. It detailed characters, the ship and its technology, the 23d century and the fantasy of deep space, in which they all traveled.
Some writers told him it was the hardest show in television to write for because they had to know so much about history, economics, moral values and the personalities of the running characters. There was formula in it, but the shows were hardly the standard television fare of car chases and grim faces.
Mr. Roddenberry was producer of the first "Star Trek" film and executive consultant on the next three. He was the executive producer of the sequel series.
Survivors include his wife, the former Majel Leigh Hudec; a son, Eugene, known as Rod; two daughters, Darleen Incopero and Dawn Compton; a brother, Robert; a sister, Doris, and his mother, Carolyn Glen Roddenberry.

Singing The Praises of Cabaret

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
"AN endangered art form that asks us to strip away our urban defenses for an hour and admit a little vulnerability."
That is how the writer James Gavin distills the essence of the cabaret experience in the final chapter of "Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret" (Grove Weidenfeld), his richly atmospheric history of Manhattan nightclub life over the last half-century. 
 The shoring up of this economically fragile but artistically flourishing art form will be the main order of business next week at Town Hall, where the Second Cabaret Convention is presenting seven concerts at bargain prices. Starting on Sunday with a gala opening concert tied to Town Hall's 70th anniversary, and concluding on Nov. 2 with a grand finale, the convention will bring more than 100 cabaret performers onto the hall's stage. Tickets for each concert are $10.
The participants range from cabaret legends like the singer and comic actress Dorothy Loudon and the pianist Stan Freeman to up-and-coming performers like Molly Scates and Phillip Officer. The youthful cast of "Forever Plaid," the hit musical-comedy revue about a squeaky-clean male harmony group from the 1950's, is appearing, as are performers from outside New York City, including Amanda McBroom from Los Angeles, the composer of "The Rose," and San Francisco's most popular cabaret singer, Weslia Whitfield. For anyone interested in exploring a world in which classic popular music and refined sensibility come together, there is no better opportunity.
Except for Sunday's concert, at which Jeff Harnar, Bruce Hubbard, Ms. Loudon, Helen Schneider and B. J. Ward are to perform short sets, each show will feature about a dozen performers doing two or three numbers each. Tuesday's concert is a tribute to Raymond Jones, a co-director of the Mabel Mercer Foundation who was an important figure in San Francisco cabaret. "Bistro Night" on Wednesday adds comedy and revue material (including excerpts from "Forever Plaid") into the mix. Thursday's program is a showcase for cabaret songwriters. Friday's concert focuses on singing pianists, among them Blossom Dearie, Barbara Carroll and Ronny Whyte.
The driving force behind the Second Cabaret Convention is Donald F. Smith, a publicity agent, promoter, party-giver and close friend of Mabel Mercer, the quintessential cabaret artist. Shortly after her death in 1984, he established the Mabel Mercer Foundation to perpetuate the genre and to keep alive the memory of the singer who epitomized it.
"Less than six months after Mabel's death, I began to get calls from people who wanted to write pieces about it being the end of an era," he recalled recently. "Often they were not well informed about Mabel. I kept worrying about what would happen in a couple of years to the reputation of a woman who had had a 66-year run in the clubs and who had affected so many major artists, but who never had hit records and had made very little impact on television.
"I got some chums together. We went to see a lawyer and set up a foundation that had two aims. One was to make sure that Mabel Mercer was remembered accurately over the years and that the size of her contribution would not be forgotten. The other was to try to give an ongoing visibility to the whole field of cabaret."
This convention's predecessor, in 1989, included four concerts at Town Hall and panel discussions. It attracted an audience of 6,000, and in its wake, Mr. Smith said, he received 900 letters about the problems facing the cabaret industry. High on the list were the unavailability of classic popular American music on radio and television and the prohibitive costs of going to nightclubs.
This year the foundation is presenting "cabaret classic awards" to Ms. Loudon, Steve Ross, Barbara Cook, Tony Bennett, Anne Francine and Julius Monk. Starting next fall, it will also present six Thursday-evening showcase concerts at Weill Recital Hall featuring up-and-coming cabaret performers, who will also be given honorariums. Each week, Mr. Smith said, the foundation receives 20 to 50 video and audio cassettes and at least three dozen press kits from aspiring performers around the country.
Depending on how it is viewed, the state of cabaret could be described as everything from precarious to flush. In recent years, two national stars, Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Feinstein, have ascended from New York cabarets. So have several Off Broadway shows, including "Forever Plaid," "Nunsense," "Closer Than Ever," "Beehive" and "Daugherty and Field Off Broadway." The list of cabaret stars who do consistently good business in major clubs like the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, the Ballroom, Michael's Pub, Rainbow and Stars, and the Cafe Carlyle includes not only veterans like Bobby Short, Miss Cook, Julie Wilson and Mel Torme, but also younger performers like Karen Akers, Andrea Marcovicci, Dixie Carter, Helen Schneider, Maureen McGovern, Jeff Harnar, Susannah McCorkle and John Pizzarelli.
 
Networks and Albums
 Mr. Smith has been instrumental in starting two successful new series in Manhattan, and he is working to establish the beginnings of a national network. A series of Sunday-evening concerts upstairs at the Russian Tea Room has been wildly successful since it began a year and a half ago. The three-year-old Cabaret Comes to Carnegie series, which has presented 24 performers since its inception, is to resume in the spring at Weill Recital Hall with appearances by Miss Wilson, Adelaide Hall, Hildegarde, and Daugherty and Field. A flourishing farm system for up-and-coming performers in Manhattan includes the Skylight Room at Danny's Sea Palace, Don't Tell Mama and, most notably, Eighty-Eight's, the Greenwich Village club that has showcased Mr. Harnar and the very promising Billy Stritch, who has been booked into Rainbow and Stars this winter.
Last year, DRG Records, an independent company based in New York, inaugurated a series of cabaret albums beginning with records by Ms. Marcovicci, Sylvia Syms and Margaret Whiting. The latest releases are two live albums, recorded at the Carlyle and featuring Miss Carroll and Miss Carter.
The series has sold surprisingly well, said Hugh Fordin, the owner of DRG and the producer of the series.
"I would have been satisfied if the records did well in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago," he said. "But we've been selling in places like St. Louis, Kansas City and in the South." The 16 titles in the series have sold an average of 10,000 copies each, he said.
But if there has been a small upsurge in the last decade, the cabaret world is certainly not booming as it did in the 1940's and 50's, before the age of television, when New York was filled with boites where singers could be heard for just the price of a drink.
 
Fond Memories
 "It was a completely different scene," recalled Mr. Freeman, who is appearing at Michael's Pub in "At Wit's End," a one-man show about Oscar Levant. The show is the first stage appearance in 15 years by the pianist and wit, who used to be a regular headliner at the Blue Angel. He now lives in Los Angeles, where he has worked as a television writer for many years.
"Going to a nightclub was just something one did because there was no television to watch," he recalled. "I have very fond memories of it. It wasn't just going to a club. Especially for a performer, there was a kind of amity to it that made the whole evening fun. You would sit around until 4 or 5 in the morning gabbing and drinking and listening. Now you get up and pay the bill and go."
Ms. Loudon, who is performing at Sunday's gala, has made cameo concert appearances in recent years, but she hasn't played a regular nightclub engagement since 1962. With a standing invitation to play Michael's Pub, she said, she is seriously considering re-entering cabaret.
"I had many happy years in those little dumps and saloons and remember it as a very sweet time," she recalled. "But it was very hard work. If you can work those little rooms, you can do anything at all."
The singer recalled the moment she was forced to realize that she was a comic personality. "I had always wanted to be a serious singer," she said. "And I remember auditioning for Julius Monk and singing 'My Man' very intensely. He screamed with laughter all the way through. And at the end of it, he said, 'Have you ever considered comedy?' I really hadn't."
 
Building a Future
 If today's younger cabaret performers don't have the same secure network of clubs and hotels that Mr. Freeman and Ms. Loudon once enjoyed, there is still a cohesive sense of community that can provide spiritual, if not financial, encouragement.
Miss Scates, who was discovered by Mr. Smith performing at Eighty-Eight's, moved to New York from Florida 12 years ago. She makes her living producing special events and doing public relations for the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan. Trained in both theater and voice, she began working in small clubs about 10 years ago. She is putting together an act that deals with her Southern background and interweaves the writings of Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, along with music that runs from Stephen Sondheim to Hank Williams. She sharpened her concept, she said, by attending the O'Neill Cabaret Symposium last summer at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn.
"I met a lot of terrific people in the industry who gave me a lot of encouragement," she said recently. "They helped me think in terms of marketing. I stopped telling myself it was a vanity showcase and began looking at it as a mini-theater piece that could be sold if it was entertaining enough."
Mr. Officer, who was also discovered at Eighty-Eight's performing a show of Richard Rodgers songs, does word-processing for a law firm. But he has built up enough of a following that he makes a little money from performing. And he has earned the approval of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Foundation, which has discussed with him the possibility of making a record of his show.
"It's tough at the beginning to build an audience on your own," he said. "But with the turn cabaret seems to have taken, there are a lot more opportunities for us. There seems to be a surge in the number of rooms available, and I'm surprised at the number of people who want to see cabaret. It's becoming a really legitimate form of performing."
The author of "Intimate Nights," who is an inveterate clubgoer, agreed that there has been an upswing of interest in cabaret.
"Interest in the field has grown tremendously," Mr. Gavin said. "There are a lot more performers trying to break into the business. If they don't leap right into television and the movies, how else can they learn to stand before an audience and get some feedback as to how good they are? But I don't know what this amounts to in terms of audiences. A lot of the rooms are fighting for their lives. Just to go into a club that has a $10 cover charge is likely to be a $25 evening. That's a lot of money to pay to sit and listen to someone for an hour when you can stay at home and watch a $2.50 video.
"If I'm not optimistic about the future, I'm hopeful," he added. "Most of the people who are doing it are certainly not doing it for the money. They're doing it for love."

Frugal? A Cheap Shot, Maintains Nederlander

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Robert Nederlander, the managing general partner of the Yankees, yesterday denied recent reports that the team planned to become more frugal and maintained that the club would pursue free agents this winter.
Several published reports have said that the Yankees would pass up potentially expensive free agents like Bobby Bonilla and that the team was heading toward an economic downswing. Nederlander sounded agitated that the Yankees, perhaps the richest team in baseball, were being cast as cheap and denied any economic changes had occurred within the organization. 
 "If it makes sense for the club to enter the free-agent market, we will do so," Nederlander said in a short telephone interview. "The Yankees have been involved before and we will do it again. I don't know where these rumors come from. I don't like responding to rumors."
Though Nederlander is forbidden under baseball rules from commenting on specific players until they are free agents, General Manager Gene Michael has said the major needs for the Yankees next season are at least one starting pitcher, another power hitter and a third baseman. All should be available in the free-agent market in pitchers Frank Viola and Tom Candiotti, sluggers Bonilla and Danny Tartabull and third baseman Steve Buechele.
When Nederlander was presented with a scenario of a certain type of player who could help the club being on the market and asked how the Yankees would act, he reacted enthusiastically about making a bid.
"If we feel a player will help the club, there is no reason to believe we will not take a chance," Nederlander said. "If it makes us a better club, we will be seriously involved."
Nederlander also attempted to defuse growing doubt about the power held by Michael, who disappointed the Yankees' limited partners by proposing former major league managers Hal Lanier and Doug Rader for the manager's job on the Yankees. Both were viewed by the partners as retread candidates.
When Nederlander was asked if Michael's power had eroded, the man who took over for George Steinbrenner said he did not understand the question. He was then asked if Michael had specifically lost some of his hiring power.
"Gene Michael is the general manager in charge of baseball operations and he will continue in that position and continue to have the power one ordinarily has in that position," said Nederlander. "Leonard Kleinman and I are not the baseball experts."
Even so, Nederlander and Kleinman, the chief executive officer, were the ones who delivered the message to Michael last weekend to reconsider Buck Showalter -- who had been fired from his job as the Yankees' third base coach on Oct. 7 -- as a managerial candidate. It was a message Nederlander refused to address yesterday.
"I don't want to talk about what I said to Gene Michael," he said.
Nederlander also declined to comment when asked if Showalter was the lone candidate left to replace Stump Merrill, as a club official indicated Wednesday.

DDB Needham Laying Off 35

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
In another sign that the advertising industry recession continues unabated, DDB Needham Worldwide, New York, has dismissed an additional 35 employees.
In a memo from Peter Falcone, president of the agency's New York office, the layoffs were attributed to further erosion in client spending levels. The cutbacks, which follow the dismissal of 22 people earlier this year, are being made from the ranks of corporate employees as well as from New York office staff. Total employment in New York now stands at 672. 
 Among other agencies that have cut staffing levels this year are Ayer Inc.; Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver, and Ogilvy & Mather.

HEADLINE: For Haiti: The Essential First Step

 BODY:
The crisis in Haiti will not be over until the legitimate President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is restored to office. Despite resistance to his return by much of Haiti's narrow political elite, and disturbing allegations about his style of rule, the entire hemisphere has a stake in his return.
What's at stake is not Mr. Aristide's personal franchise but constitutional legitimacy, a principle not yet secure in nations like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay or Paraguay. All have recently liberated themselves from long periods of military rule. But all suffer from economic and social problems that make them vulnerable to military pressure. 
 For a decade, the U.S. has threatened to make life untenable for any Latin American nation's military that moved against a democratic government. Haiti is a test of Washington's resolve.
Mr. Aristide first won renown as a radical Catholic priest. But as President he cultivated good relations with the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund. His approach to domestic politics, however, was provocative. He had deadly enemies to contend with. Holdovers in the military, the police and the judiciary were determined to block reforms that threatened their privileges. The new President felt he had a popular mandate for reform, even if it meant bulldozing the opposition.
Democrats, including many of his electoral allies, were excluded from power. Parliament was ignored and intimidated by pro-Aristide mobs. Business and military leaders willing to accept his radical changes were spurned. Lynch mobs were tolerated.
These abuses explain the Sept. 30 military coup but cannot justify it. With no mandate beyond brute force and naked greed, the army massacred innocent civilians. It heaped more abuse on the constitutional order in a few days than the Aristide Government had in seven and a half months.
The other nations of the hemisphere have the right to insist that President Aristide publicly commit himself to Haiti's popularly approved Constitution once he is returned to office. The Organization of American States could then establish a monitoring presence to guarantee constitutional order against infractions from any side.
That won't be enough for President Aristide's bitterest enemies. But it should be enough for democrats. The best way to assure that the day of the dictator is truly over in the Americas is to bring Mr. Aristide back.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Cuomo and U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
One of these days a Democratic Presidential candidate may wake up, rub his eyes and shake his head and decide it is time to challenge President Bush on foreign policy.
This country, so deeply involved in the world, somehow leaves foreign policy to diplomats except in time of crisis. Foreign policy is life and death and too important to leave to diplomats or any other single group of Americans. 
 At least during Presidential campaigns the voters should hear a clear-minded running debate on American objectives abroad, what they are and should be. But in the campaign under way no such thing is in sight.
Maybe the Democrats now in the field are just not smart enough to know what has gone wrong with the Bush foreign policy. Maybe they and their party think Americans are too stupid to care about such things as stopping weapons of mass death from being peddled around the world, or building up Middle East dictators again.
Maybe they are too scared of Mr. Bush's reputation as a foreign policy hotshot, which compared to some of them he may be. Maybe it is all the maybes.
The Democratic candidate most likely to wake up would be Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York. It startles me that I think so, because his foreign policy record is not vast and where it cropped up most noticeably I was immediately allergic -- his opposition to fighting Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Cuomo did not seem as great a sinner after Mr. Bush left Saddam Hussein alive and in power and Iraqi rebels dead or in flight. But if Mr. Cuomo had been President the U.S. would be facing a nuclear-armed Iraq by now. So Americans on both sides of the Persian Gulf line can point fingers at each other.
Anyway, among Democrats Mr. Cuomo alone has shown that he has what's needed to grasp what is wrong with the Bush foreign policy -- a taste and talent for intellectual, ethical and moral challenge and combat. It is precisely in the fields of intellect, ethics and morality that the policy has gone wrong.
In the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush built his entire policy around Mikhail Gorbachev's fantasies that he could reform the Communist system and party enough to stay in power and that the central authority and K.G.B. could put down national and ethnic movements trying to break out of the Soviet political prison.
The Soviet Union collapsed -- which any number of dissidents could have told the U.S. had Washington paid them a smidgeon of the attention it lavished on Mr. Gorbachev alone.
The Bush nuclear arms proposals could not have been made nearly as soon had Soviet central power remained under the chiefs of the party, the army and the K.G.B. The threat to the U.S. from the Soviet Union was always in a centralized dictatorship with enormous military strength, not in its dissolution. Now the tendency in the U.S. bureaucracy is to keep together as much central Soviet authority as possible -- fantasy time again.
In China, Mr. Bush supports what is now the world's most grinding repression, which imprisons millions of Chinese to sell the sweat of their labor at home and on the world market, and which is also becoming the world's most active salesman of mass destruction.
In the Mideast, the Bush Administration has decided that Israeli settlements on the West Bank are the greatest threat to peace. This must be a real surprise to Arab countries that for a half-century have waged military, economic, terrorist and propaganda warfare against Israel and still do.
The thread that runs through all these examples is drearily familiar in American foreign policy -- a taste for foreign dictatorships. They seem so much easier to deal with than messy democracies.
The problem, of course, is that dictatorships wind up going to war against their neighbors where the messy democracies find other ways of settling their problems.
That is a traditionally deep fault line in American policy and officialdom. It is waiting there for Mr. Cuomo to see, explore and persuade Americans to leap over.
Speaking of awakening, quoting from an Alice Walker poem last Friday, I left out the name in a line that should have read: "Good night, Willie Lee, I'll see you / in the morning."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Politics of Resentment

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
When a former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi has a good chance to be elected governor of an American state, it is time to think about what is going wrong in the politics of this country.
David Duke came a close second in the Louisiana gubernatorial primary, finishing just two percentage points behind former Gov. Edwin Edwards. Because it happened in Louisiana, there was a certain tendency to put it down as another example of that state's eccentricity. But it is not a joke. 
 The Duke phenomenon is extremely serious, and its implications are not confined to Louisiana. The votes for him were a cry of political resentment, a cry that I think was aroused by economic pain manipulated by the factor of race.
Millions of Americans -- many millions -- are suffering from a prolonged and devastating economic recession. Real wages have fallen for three straight years. Unemployment has hit not only wage-earners but many middle-class people. And there is no convincing sign of a meaningful recovery.
The physical conditions of life are becoming more and more unpleasant for Americans. Highways are crowded and crumbling, cities unable to cope with the homeless, schools and myriad other problems. Even medical care is priced out of the reach of many ordinary people.
Sixty percent of those reached in a New York Times/CBS Poll released this week said things had got "pretty seriously off on the wrong track" in this country. They said the most important problem was the economy. Yet President Bush offers no program for economic recovery or reconstruction. He says, essentially, that nothing can be done.
In the circumstances, a historian would expect political repercussions -- would have expected them, indeed, before now. And here they are, in the vote for David Duke. It is the vote of people who have lost faith in established political leaders.
President Bush's spokesmen tried to distance themselves from Mr. Duke. He was not a real Republican, they said.
But Mr. Duke has remodeled himself in the image of the contemporary Republican Party. Not so long ago, in the 1980's, he celebrated Adolf Hitler's birthday and told an interviewer that the Nazi death camps had been built not to kill Jews but to kill lice that infested Jews. But he has muted that kind of talk, as he has remade his face by plastic surgery.
Nowadays Mr. Duke talks to his political audiences about affirmative action, "quotas," welfare abuse, crime. The same rhetoric has been used by President Bush and his people. It can be -- it often is -- a genteel code to evoke anti-black feelings.
A few days after the Louisiana primary, White House spokesmen rejected a compromise Senate civil rights bill on the ground that it would encourage racial "quotas." It is a charge that practically no one else supports. But by all signs Mr. Bush wants not a bill but an issue: the issue of race.
One lesson of the Duke phenomenon is that when national leaders use race for short-term political gain, as President Bush has repeatedly done, the country is likely to pay a price. Senator John Danforth, Republican of Missouri, who led the fight for Clarence Thomas's confirmation and is trying to get a civil rights bill passed, has given his own party exactly that warning.
On the racial question, there is not much to be done now except to hope that George Bush's better instincts will somehow overcome political temptation. But there is a way for our system to deal with rising public resentment over the economy. That is for the opposition, the Democrats, to offer an alternative.
An alternative means, first, a policy. The broad outlines are in view, put forward by a number of Democrats already in the race for 1992: Rebuild our physical infrastructure, care for our cities, have a rational system of health care and so on.
But in this country change requires a candidate. Franklin Roosevelt offered not a program but hope, in his voice and his person. As the times look more like 1932, Democrats have their eyes on another Governor of New York. Perhaps David Duke and the politics of resentment will be enough to make Mario Cuomo face the challenge.

HEADLINE: Foreign Buyers Pushing Up Condo Prices

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
While the values of most apartments have stabilized or are still falling in New York City, those pied-a-terre along Manhattan's most elegant streets continue to climb, with well-heeled foreign investors setting new price records for high-end condominiums, real-estate studies show.
Most of the buyers, many of whom are seeking that fourth home or refuge from tumultuous times in their own countries, continue to pour cash into a sliver of New York's vast residential real-estate market -- expensive condos. They are bidding up prices along the city's "Gold Coast" avenues while the values of cooperative apartments are stabilizing or still declining. 
 For example, an investor from Hong Kong, possibly jittery over what may happen when Britain turns that city over to the Chinese Government, has been negotiating to buy 47 condominiums -- or 6 floors -- in Trump Palace, at 200 East 69th Street at Third Avenue.
One buyer paid $2 million in September for a four-and-a-half-room condominium at Trump Tower that sold for $1.62 million just five years ago, while another buyer paid $2.57 million for a four-and-a-half-room condo at 30 East 85th Street.
 
A West Side Condo
 Such prices are not confined to the East Side of Manhattan. A buyer spent $1.8 million for a four-room condominium at the Park Belvedere, on West 79th Street at Columbus Avenue.
In most cases, the studies said, the apartments bought and sold between January and June were smaller than those bought and sold in the same period last year. As a result, buyers paid more for less, with the East 85th Street condominium, for example, selling for $1,531.82 a square foot.
Because the apartments being bought are in a category all their own, the prices paid had no effect on those being paid for cooperative apartments or even the rest of the condominium market, which is relatively small in New York City.
In fact, most of the foreign buyers concentrated their purchases in the condominium market, in part as a way to avoid baring their finances and personal lives to co-op boards and also because state law prohibits corporate ownership of co-ops. About half of the foreign buyers buy their apartments through some kind of corporation.
Alan Rogers, a managing director of Douglas Elliman, one of New York's top real-estate brokerage concerns, said that it was important to remember that condominiums were only a small part of the New York apartment market and that even in that slice, American buyers still predominate. It is in the top 10 to 15 percent, he said, where foreign money has stabilized condo prices or forced them up.
"In the spring there was a spate of Italians buying and they were looking for substantial discounts," Mr. Rogers said. "But there were also a lot of Spaniards and they bought as much as the Italians. We have also seen the South Americans come back, and they are always at the top end."
The average two-bedroom condominium in Manhattan sold for about $330 a square foot in August, according to Yale Robbins Inc., a condominium research concern.
 
Quality and Quantity
 Barbara Corcoran, who heads the Corcoran Group, a well-known residential broker, said buyers of the most expensive apartments tended not to be sensitive to prices. "People cut back in their own ways," Ms. Corcoran said. "These people are not that quick to cut back in terms of quality, although they may cut back in quantity. Many of them would be comparing the apartments to a similar product in Paris or London because it's a third or fourth home."
Over all, condominium prices were down 4.6 percent in Manhattan for the second quarter of 1991, according to a study by Susan Wachter, a professor at the Real Estate Center at the Wharton School.
That study, which was done for Heller Equities Inc. and was based on the 728 condominium sales in Manhattan in April, May and June, showed that the average price for condos on the Upper West Side rose 11.2 percent in that period from the preceding three months. In the Lexington Avenue to York Avenue district, bounded by 50th Street and 86th Street, prices fell 13.3 percent in the second quarter, the study said.
The study said most of the increase on the Upper West Side occurred because condos bought years ago were recently sold at current market prices.
 
The Trump Factor
 In the world of the super-rich, the one name that dominated this year was Trump. Of the 10 most expensive condominiums bought in New York from January to June, seven were in buildings built by Donald J. Trump, with most of those in Trump Palace, his latest luxury tower.
Jack Heller, the head of Heller Equities, which is building luxury apartments at 86th Street and Fifth Avenue, said there was an increase in the number of top-end condo sales over the summer, with prices rising roughly 5 percent during that period.
Native New Yorkers may be dumbfounded to hear that foreigners will pay $2.5 million for four rooms, but it is a matter of perspective. On average, a square foot on Fifth Avenue in the 60's through the 80's costs half as much as comparable areas in Paris and about a third of the $2,143 a square foot for apartments in Tokyo's Azabu section.
The very rich may be paying more on a square-foot basis, but in some instances they are economizing by buying fewer rooms. So the final purchase prices of the 10 biggest deals were slightly lower than the 10 biggest in the first half of last year. The single most expensive condo sold in the first six months of this year, based on purchase price, was a seven-room penthouse in the Trump Palace that went for $3.51 million.
The provenance of those willing to pay such prices for apartments has also shifted to reflect the troublesome political and economic climates abroad. The influx is now from Hong Kong, instead of Japan.
"Flight capital has fueled this city's condominium market for the last 10 years and it's just a question of the nationality," Ms. Corcoran said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Friday with an article about foreign investments in New York City condominiums referred incorrectly to a $2.57 million purchase at 30 East 85th Street. It was for two apartments, totaling nine rooms, not a single apartment of four and a half. The article also referred incorrectly to a prohibition on the sale of co-op apartments to corporations. It was a Federal restriction, no longer in effect, not a state law.

Dollar Ends Little Changed; Gold Is Down in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday amid mixed signals about the direction of interest rates. Gold prices fell in New York after rising overseas.
Comments by President Bush "reinforced an attitude that perhaps the Federal Reserve is going to ease policy again" and that helped push the dollar lower, said Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation. 
 The President said: "The economy has been sluggish. It hasn't been near as good as I would like to see it or certainly the American people would like to see it."
Traders have been expecting the Fed to nudge interest rates downward, which would depress the dollar by decreasing foreign demand for American investments.
Susan Phillips, Mr. Bush's nominee to the Fed, told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that the economic signals were mixed and that additional easing might be needed.
Yet Mr. Bush said there was a limit to how far interest rates could fall. He again argued in favor of a cut in the capital gains tax to stimulate business investment and create new jobs.
More negative economic news came from the National Association of Realtors, which said existing home sales fell 4.3 percent last month. Declines were recorded in all regions of the country.
Analysts said the dollar was mired in a narrow trading range.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York, rising to 131.45 yen, from 131.15 late Thursday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar edged up to 131.36 yen, from 131.33 yen Thursday, and later, in London, it rose to 131.40 yen.
The yen has also been hurt because Japanese interest rates are expected to decline when the country's new Government takes office next month.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7135 in New York from $1.7105. In London, sterling fell to $1.7115, from $1.7125 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7000 German marks, unchanged; 1.4870 Swiss francs, down from 1.4880; 5.8000 French francs, up from 5.7990; 1,270.75 Italian lire, up from 1,270.50, and 1.12625 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.7050 German marks, up from 1.6975; 1.4890 Swiss francs, up from 1.4865; 5.8045 French francs, up from 5.7900; 1.9165 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9135; 1,271.50 Italian lire, up from 1,267.50, and 1.1255 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1250.
Gold dropped $1.20 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $360.90 a troy ounce.

Price of Oil Drops Again; Week Shows Big Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices fell yesterday, wrapping up a week that broke the ack of an extended rally.
Light crude oil for delivery in December settled at $23.12 a barrel, down 37 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, oil for next-month delivery fell $1.02 a barrel. 
 Crude-oil prices have now given up almost half the ground they gained in their recent rally.
Home heating oil for delivery in November settled at 68.43 cents a gallon, down 0.85 cent for the day and 1.38 cents for the week. Unleaded gasoline for delivery in November settled at 64.72 cents a gallon, down 0.54 cent for the day and 1.01 cents for the week.
"It seems that this is the most downward activity we've seen in this market for a long time," said Peter Beutel, an oil futures analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
One reason for the drop, he saaid, was that warm weather in the Northeastern United States was restraining demand. Also, demand for gasoil, the European equivalent of home heating oil, had slackened after weeks of buying fed by fears that supplies from the Soviet Union would be disrupted.
Traders also got news that the Kuwaitis hope to extinguish all their burning wells during November, suggesting that the market could soon be seeing more Kuwaiti oil than it had been anticipating. Most of Kuwait's wells were set ablaze by Iraqi troops as they retreated last winter.
Amid all that, oil managed to show a gain only once during the week, rising 21 cents a barrel in Thursday's session.
Prices of natural gas were mostly higher, with contracts for delivery in December settling at $2.081 for 1,000 cubic feet, up 1.2 cents. For the week, natural gas for next-month delivery was up 5.6 cents, but that rise was largely explained by technical trading factors related to the expiration of futures contracts for November delivery.
In London, North Sea Brent blend crude oil for delivery in December settled at $21.79 a barrel, down 31 cents for the day and 80 cents for the week, at the International Petroleum Exchange.

HEADLINE: Avon Posts A Deficit In Quarter

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
After taking a $75 million charge for discontinued operations, Avon Products Inc. yesterday reported a $27.3 million loss for the third quarter, in contrast to a $44.6 million profit in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Earnings per share for the cosmetics manufacturer were 59 cents in the period a year earlier. 
 Sales increased 4.1 percent, to $865.2 million, from $830.8 million in the third quarter of 1990.
The charge was taken to write down notes and other securities that Avon received when it sold some health-care and other businesses in 1987 and 1988, Avon said. The company said the value of the securities had decreased.
"The company expects 1991 income from continuing operations will be good," said James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive. "We continue to benefit from a global portfolio that hedges the risk of recessions in individual markets or regions."
In a conference call to stock analysts, Mr. Preston said Avon was still dealing with uneven results overseas and competitive pricing pressures.
Promotional pricing ate into profits in the third quarter, but Mr. Preston said new efforts to control costs should offset pressure on the company's margins for the rest of the year.
Sales in Avon's international division grew 5 percent in the third quarter, while the United States division reported a 6 percent increase in sales.
The company attributed sharply declining sales and pretax profits at Giorgio Beverly Hills, its prestige fragrance subsidiary, to "dismal United States retail sales for luxury goods."
"Consumers are buying very conservatively and trading down to lower margin items," Mr. Preston said in his comments about the Giorgio division's performance. "Retailers, too, are cautious and are keeping their inventories to a minimum, sometimes a less-than-adequate minimum, which is probably costing them and us sales."
Avon also reported that it had reduced its debt load 8.4 percent, to $552.6 million, on Sept. 30, down from $603.3 million at the end of last year's third quarter, and that it would continue to emphasize debt reduction.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines 11.40 More, to 3,004.92

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Blue-chip stock prices declined steadily throughout a rocky afternoon session yesterday, but they recovered slightly in late trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down more than 25 points within an hour of the close, rebounded a bit to finish at 3,004.92, down 11.40 for the day and 72.23 for the week. 
 Analysts said investors continued to be chilled by disappointing corporate earnings reports and a lack of encouraging news on the economy. In particular, the proposals floated this week to stimulate the economy through tax cuts had dashed investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve Board would soon lower interest rates, analysts said.
 
'Perfect Excuse' to Take Profits
 "The uncertainty over when the Fed will ease interest rates was a perfect excuse for those who had profits to take them," said John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president and director of research at Advest Inc., a brokerage based in Hartford.
A moderate 167.3 million shares changed hands on the Big Board yesterday, compared with 179 million on Thursday. Losers outpaced gainers by 920 to 682.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 0.87, to 384.20. The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.50, to 211.82. And the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.30, to 376.43.
Smaller issues were also lower, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 3.62, to 525.13.
The Dow, which had begun the day with a quick bump upward, seesawed throughout the morning before declining during the afternoon. Program traders contributed significantly to that drop, with a rash of sell programs pressing the Dow down 18 points between 2 and 3 P.M., according to Birinyi Associates, which monitors computer trading.
With 5.1 million shares changing hands, American Express -- down 1 3/8, to 19 1/4 -- was the most active stock on the Big Board. Several analysts lowered their fourth-quarter estimates for the company yesterday, following its announcement Thursday that its third-quarter earnings plunged by nearly 91 percent, to $31 million, or 5 cents a share. The company said it anticipated its difficulties would persist in the fourth quarter.
Glaxo Holdings, up 2, to 51 1/4, was one of the biggest winners on the Big Board. As had been speculated earlier in the day, a Food and Drug Administration panel voted yesterday afternoon to recommend approving Imigran, the British company's new, highly touted migraine drug, for sale in the United States.
Compaq Computer fell 2 3/4, to 30 1/4, on what traders described as the shocking news that the company's board had ousted Joseph (Rod) Canion, its president and co-founder. The announcement capped a volatile week for the company, which on Wednesday announced the first quarterly loss in its nine-year history, as well as the first layoffs.
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief operating officer, was named yesterday to succeed Mr. Canion. A heavy 2.6 million shares of the stock changed hands, making it one of the most aggressively traded issues on the Big Board.
The biggest dollar loss on the Big Board belonged to Delta Air Lines, which dipped 4 1/8, to 61. Geoffrey Dann, an airline analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said Delta officials told him and several other analysts in a conference call Thursday that its acquisition of most of the assets of Pan American World Airways would be dilutive in the near-term.

HEADLINE: Treasury Auctions Opened Up

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
In its latest response to the scandal at Salomon Brothers Inc., the Government announced today that the auctions that raise money to finance the nation's debt would be open to all brokers rather than just Wall Street's largest banks and investment houses.
The decision is intended to encourage greater participation in the auctions and weaken the role of the 39 primary dealers who have long been given special treatment for acting as middlemen between the Government and the secondary market of institutions and customers that buy and sell Treasury instruments. 
 Most analysts and market participants said the changes would have their most significant impact once traders were able to execute bids electronically, rather than using the current method in which runners drop slips of paper with bids at the Federal Reserve. A new computer system is being developed, and the Treasury Department urged today that it be expanded "to help increase the liquidity and depth of the market."
 
A Matter of Perception
 "There's been a perception that some insiders have enjoyed a competitive advantage," said Jerome H. Powell, an Assistant Treasury Secretary, in an interview today. "This is an attempt to level the playing field for the full range of participants."
The first test of whether the new rules will make a difference will come on Nov. 5, with the auction for three-year notes.
Under the changes, any registered broker will be able to bid competitively in the auctions on behalf of themselves or their customers. The bidders will not have to meet the existing requirement of posting a deposit in advance of the auctions, but they must sign a special agreement approved by a Federal Reserve Bank that authorizes charging the bidders' account at the Fed when the securities are issued.
Individuals have long been able to buy Treasury instruments directly from the Federal Reserve, but only at the average price and yield of all submitted bids and with a maximum of $1 million. Today's changes primarily open the market for the competitive bids. But in a concession to smaller banks, pension funds, municipalities and other institutional investors, the $1 million limit on noncompetitive bids was raised to $5 million.
The close relationship between the primary dealers and the Treasury Department had come under intense Congressional criticism in the wake of disclosures in August that Salomon Brothers, the most powerful dealer, had submitted phony bids and sought to corner the market.
In light of the scandal and calls for even more significant changes in the auction, reaction on Wall Street was generally either resigned or positive, and in many instances tempered by a curiosity about how it would work.
"The objective of increasing competition has got to be a good one," said Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association, a trade group of banks and dealers, including the primary dealers, that trade government debt and other securities. "Whether it will work depends upon the details, which we have not seen, and how it will operate in practice."
 
A Critical Primary Dealer
 William Pike, head of government debt trading at Manufacturers Hanover Securities, one of the primary dealers, told the Bloomberg News Service that the changes "will not make any material difference."
Other analysts said today's steps were an important incremental step that might make a significant difference over the longer term, but were not likely to mean much in the near future because of the costs of hiring runners and setting up a system to participate in the auctions.
"This fits into the broader movement of eliminating the primary dealer system and gradually eroding their franchise," said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates. He said the new rules, combined with an automated system for bidding that would disclose prices and other information, would go much further toward ending the domination of the market by the primary dealers.
Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads a House subcommittee on securities regulation, said today that he would introduce legislation to give the Securities and Exchange Commission more authority to police the government securities market, "although Treasury is to be applauded for seeking to take some remedial steps in the auction process."
The Government Securities Act of 1986, the main law governing the market, expired at the beginning of this month and has not been extended, leaving in doubt the Treasury's authority to issue regulations. Today's action was done under the Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which authorizes the Treasury to set the auction rules.

HEADLINE: Court Says Holders' States May Bar Charge-Card Fees

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
In a victory for holders of bank credit cards, a Federal court in Boston has ruled that banks issuing cards may not charge fees to customers in states that prohibit such fees, even if the fees are allowed under the laws of the state where the bank is based.
States vary widely in the amount of fees they allow card issuers to charge for late payments, annual renewals and bounced checks. Bankers worry that the court ruling, if not overturned, will require them to adjust their prices for each state, or perhaps charge higher interest rates to compensate for fees they would no longer be allowed to collect. 
 In 1978 the Supreme Court ruled that the interest rate banks charge on credit cards could be based on the maximum allowed in the bank's home state, even if that rate exceeded limits set in other states.
 
Delaware vs. Massachusetts

The ruling this week by Judge William G. Young of the United States District Court was issued in response to a suit filed in November 1989 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts against the Greenwood Trust Company, a Delaware-based affiliate of Sears, Roebuck & Company. Greenwood issues Sears's Discover card, a credit card similar to Visa and Mastercard. It was charging Massachusetts residents a $10 monthly fee for late payments, as allowed by Delaware. Massachusetts law does not permit late charges.
The Massachusetts Attorney General, Scott Harshbarger, said the ruling would have "major positive consumer protection implications for people throughout the country."
Beth Metzler, a spokeswoman for Greenwood Trust, said an appeal of the decision was planned. While the ruling applies only to Massachusetts, it could be cited as precedent anywhere in the country. Discover has issued 39.1 million cards, which have outstanding balances totaling more than $12.1 billion.
Greenwood Trust argued that fees, along with the interest rate on unpaid balances, are part of the overall price of a card, and that the meaning of earlier court rulings was that the overall price was controlled by a bank's home state, not the state where its customers live.
"The Supreme Court has clearly recognized the relationship between interest rates and fees," said John L. Culhane Jr., a lawyer at Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, a Philadelphia law firm that represented the Consumer Bankers Association. He noted that in a case involving the Marquette National Bank of Minnesota, the Supreme Court said that Minnesota law allowed annual fees "to compensate for the reduced interest" allowed by state law at the time.
No Comment From Citibank
Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman for Citibank, which has issued more credit cards than any other bank, said the bank was watching the case closely but would not comment on it. Citibank has one schedule of charges and fees for credit card customers across the country, regardless of state laws.
Citibank issues its cards from South Dakota, a state that, like Delaware, has attracted many bank credit card operations because of laws allowing them to charge a variety of fees and an interest rate that now stands at 19.8 percent for most large banks.

HEADLINE: Odessa Journal;
They Laugh Now, but Then Didn't They Always?

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ODESSA, U.S.S.R.

 BODY:
In all the rush to claim "sovereignty," nobody has really spelled out what that means in the Soviet context. But whatever it is, the people of Odessa, in the Ukraine, are certain they have it.
They have the Black Sea, its beaches and ports glittering down below the grand Primorsky Boulevard. They have a worldly history as the third major city of the Russian Empire. They have their elegant sycamore-lined avenues, their rich literature, an abundance of local food and drink and a sharp tongue that even 70 years of homogenizing Soviet dreariness failed to dull. 
 "Is it possible for the Communist Party apparat to go underground?" asks the satirical weekly Akh, Odessa. "It's possible, but only in such an underground that has smoked salmon, caviar, Posolsky vodka, American cigarettes and other materials of the 28th Party Congress."
 
Funeral and Parrot Jokes
 Or did you hear the one about two old Odessites watching the funeral of a third?
"What did he die of, cancer?"
"No."
"Or perhaps it was a heart attack?"
"No, no. He just caught cold and died."
"Oh, thank God. I thought it was something serious."
Whatever the conversation, somebody will invariably recall an anecdote. This, after all, is the city where Jewish humor flourished in those prewar times when Jews were half the population.
"Hello, K.G.B.? This is Rabinovich. Have you found my parrot? Well, if you do, I just want you to know I categorically disagree with him."
Odessa produced the premier satirists of the early Soviet era, Ilf and Petrov, and the premier satirist of perestroika, Mikhail Zhvanetsky. At City Hall, instead of souvenir pins, Mayor Valentin K. Simonenko hands out Odessan funny money ("One Yeltsin") and an Odessan passport.
Former construction boss, former Communist and ardent Odessite, Mr. Simonenko is convinced that with its port, its tradition and its very psychology, Odessa is eminently ready to prosper under a market economy, if only it is left to its own devices.
"Odessites are genetically international," he boomed, maneuvering a Winston from one corner of his mouth to the other and ticking off the Russians, Jews, Greeks, Bulgars, Turks, Bessarabians, Ukrainians and many others who shaped the singular Odessan type.
The worldliness came with the foundations. Founded almost 200 years ago by Catherine the Great on the site of a former Turkish fort, the city was named after the ancient Greek colony of Odessos and had as its most influential founding father the Duc de Richelieu, future Prime Minister of France. Odessites still address women as "madame."
In the Soviet scheme of things, however, Odessa was assigned to the Ukraine. Under Communist rule that did not really mean much, because real authority was always in Moscow. But now that the Ukraine has declared its independence and is aggressively affirming its nationhood, many Odessites -- the vast majority of whom speak Russian -- wonder whether they're in the right republic.
The question is inherent in a campaign to restore a statue of Catherine the Great -- which was replaced by the Bolsheviks first with a bust of Karl Marx, which subsequently blew over in a gale, and then with a memorial to the battleship Potemkin, an icon of the 1905 Revolution. The fledgling International Business Club of Odessa has published ads asking anyone who knows where the statue of our "god grandmother" is.
The statue would confirm the Russian heritage of the city, and the Ukrainian authorities have shown little enthusiasm for it.
The problem is not limited to Odessa. The Crimean peninsula and some other regions now in the Ukraine should arguably be in Russia, and many other republic borders across the Soviet Union could be questioned.
But the very suggestion by Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, immediately after the unsuccessful hard-line coup in August, that Russia may want to reconsider some of its borders raised such a furor that republic leaders subsequently agreed to leave their borders as they are.
That has not fully put the issue to rest. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, for one, proposed in a letter to Trud recently that every oblast, or county, in the Ukraine should be allowed to decide for itself in a referendum on Dec. 1 what republic it wants to be in.
Mayor Simonenko insists that he is not looking to get Odessa out of the Ukraine. His campaign, rather, is to create a "free economic zone" around a free port in the city, where conditions would be created for foreign investment and private business.
The Mayor has argued that the Ukraine would be a major beneficiary of the rapid economic development of the port. But he acknowledges that the plan has run up against some resistance in Kiev.
"Among some it rouses political suspiciousness, among others jealousy, among others indecision," he said.
The latter has been particularly noticeable in the Ukraine in anticipation of presidential elections on Dec. 1. With the republic sharply divided on virtually every issue, every candidate -- including Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Parliament President -- has ardently worked to bolster his image as a true Ukrainian.
Mr. Simonenko avoided overt criticism of the new Ukraine, but left little doubt of his feelings about Odessa. "What do I have in common with Lvov? With Kharkov? With Kiev? This," he declared, sticking his thumb through his fist in a Russian gesture of disdain.
In any case, whatever comes of his campaign, Odessa is not likely to be defined by being in the Ukraine any more than it was Russian under the czars or Soviet under the Bolsheviks.
Two women haggle at the legendary Privoz market over some fish.
"Your fish, they don't look fresh."
"Fresh? Why they're not even dead; they're only asleep."
"Then why do they stink?"
"And can you vouch for how you smell when you sleep?"

HEADLINE: The Middle East Talks;
Spain Is a Willing Host to Mideast Talks

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Delighted to be at the center of world attention, Spain seems more than happy to exchange the inconveniences of extensive security measures and huge traffic jams for the honor of serving as host of next week's long-awaited Middle East peace conference.
While Spain's direct role will be limited to a speech by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez welcoming delegates to the conference hall in the 18th-century Royal Palace on Wednesday, the Government will be responsible for handling organizational aspects of the meeting and, above all, insuring the safety of those attending it. 
 As part of a security plan called Operation Pax, 12,000 police and paramilitary Civil Guards are being mobilized to protect sites including the palace, Barajas airport, embassies, hotels, airline offices, a press center and key roads. About 7,000 people, including journalists, are coming to Madrid for the meeting.
The most obvious security threat is posed by Basque separatist guerrillas who in recent days have exploded four bombs here and killed two civil guards in San Sebastian. The police have also stepped up their monitoring of Arab residents suspected of links to radical Islamic groups.
 
Coordinating Security
 A Government spokeswoman, Rosa Conde, said the Spanish authorities were working closely with security agencies from the United States and Soviet Union, which are responsible for security inside the palace itself.
The palace, situated on the western edge of the city and flanked on three sides by gardens, normally serves as a tourist attraction that features a collection of old clocks and tapestries. The conference itself will be held in the Hall of Columns, which is distinguished by a high-domed ceiling.
On Tuesday, a meeting is scheduled between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who will be staying in their countries' ambassadorial residences. In the evening, they will be guests of King Juan Carlos at a private dinner including Prime Minister Gonzalez.
The selection of Madrid as the venue for the talks last week came as a surprise, since Lausanne, Switzerland, had been mentioned as the most likely site. Government officials here conceded that the Spanish capital might not have been everyone's first choice. "But nobody vetoed us," one senior Foreign Ministry official said. "That's the secret."
 
Good Relations on All Sides
 Although it remains unclear why Madrid was chosen, all sides involved in the talks have relatively close ties with Spain, which has excellent relations with Washington. In the Persian Gulf war, one-third of all American air traffic heading for the gulf passed through Spanish bases, while American B-52 bombers flew about 300 missions from a base at Moron de la Frontera in the south. Mr. Gonzalez was also an early supporter of President Gorbachev's efforts to bring political and economic change to the Soviet Union. More recently, Spain has urged its partners in the 12-nation European Community to step up emergency aid for Moscow.
No less important, despite joining the anti-Iraq alliance in the gulf war, Spain has maintained good ties with all the Arab parties -- Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians -- that are taking part in the peace conference. And Madrid has rebuilt bruised relations with its North African Arab neighbors.
Further, the Palestine Liberation Organization was allowed to station a representative in Madrid in 1977 and has had a more formal mission here since 1986, with four officials who enjoy diplomatic status. Spanish newspapers have reported that the P.L.O. pressed for the peace talks to be held here.
 
Israeli Envoy Is Popular
 While it was not until January 1986 that Spain established full diplomatic relations with Israel, relations between the two countries are good, with the Israeli Ambassador, Shlomo Ben-Ami, considered one of the most popular and effective of foreign diplomats assigned here.
"This highlights the degree to which our foreign policy is accepted and, specifically, our policy toward the Near East," Spain's Foreign Minister, Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez said after the choice of Madrid was announced. "I won't hide the fact that I am delighted."
Some Spanish commentators have suggested that the decision also reflects Spain's historical links to Arabs and Jews. But in reality what the two groups have in common is that both were expelled from Spain in 1492, the Arabs when the fall of their last stronghold, Granada, ended their 700-year presence on the Iberian Peninsula, and the Jews when the Spanish Crown gave them the choice of leaving or converting to Christianity.
With the Spanish Government now welcoming the return of some Sephardic Jews from North Africa, the Jewish community in Spain has risen to about 15,000. The Arab population in Spain, though, is growing much faster because of a wave of illegal immigrants from Morocco and is now estimated at 150,000 to 200,000.

HEADLINE: Bush News Conference On Civil Rights Accord

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's news conference by President Bush as transcribed by Reuters.
 
 
 
OPENING STATEMENT
 After extraordinary debate and negotiation, we have reached an agreement with Senate Republican and Democratic leaders on a civil rights bill that will be a source of pride for all Americans. It does not resort to quotas, and it strengthens the cause of equality in the work place. Both the Administration and the Congress can present this legislation to the people of America as a new standard against discrimination and for equal opportunity. 
 This agreement was reached last night in marathon negotiations, shepherded by Senator John [C.]Danforth of Missouri, nurtured by Senator [Bob]Dole and other leaders of both parties.
It was a proud accomplishment for the Congress and the Administration. And now we can go forward together in progress on civil rights in this country.
I remember standing out there in the Rose Garden with Attorney General [Dick] Thornburgh more than a year and a half ago to make an unshakable commitment to the nation's civil rights leaders that I wanted a non-quota civil rights bill that I could sign. And assuming there are no changes in the bill as agreed to last night, we now have such a bill. And my promise will be kept, and I will enthusiastically sign this bill.
Another subject, on the Middle East peace conference, I want to note the historic nature of this meeting. The Middle East has been characterized by dangerous and tragic conflict for decades. The peoples of this region still have enormous differences.
But I want to commend the statesmanship of the leaders of all those parties attending the peace conference. Sitting down together is the beginning of understanding. And we cannot know the outcome of course. It will take patience and determination. The United States cannot make peace in the Middle East, only the parties themselves can do that. But we can and will be committed and an active partner in the search for peace.
Secretary Baker [Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d] has been patient, he's been steadfast. He's tirelessly disciplined in working with the Soviet Union and all the parties in the region to make this conference and the promise of peace a reality. We owe him a major debt of thanks. I also go to Madrid to meet with President Gorbachev, and I know that President Gorbachev joins me in wanting to put the hopes and aspirations of all the world behind these new opportunities for peace.
 
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President . . . millions are out of work and it seems almost daily statistics are pouring in [inaudible]. Aren't signs clear that some kind of action is needed, and what would you tell the Americans you will do?
A. I don't want to buy into the predicate about another recession. I don't feel that way. The economy has been sluggish. It hasn't been near as good as I would like to see it, or certainly the American people would like to see it.
What would I like to do about it? I'd like to see the Congress take the action that I've proposed way back starting in '89 and have continued to propose on growth. We need some stimulation to economic growth. And I think everybody is now familiar with the fact that I think capital gains cut would stimulate growth, and create jobs, and create opportunity. And we get assailed as this is a tax break for the rich.
I'd like to propose to Congress: let's try it, and I'll take all the blame on the political side, and then give me only half the credit on what good that would do for the economy. We've also had a program that includes enhanced R. and D. We've got banking reform legislation that would clearly be stimulative in terms of loaning. It's hung up in the capital.
We've put forward a program related to IRA's. We got a transportation bill that is job-intensive. We put forward for the most heavily adversely affected areas enterprise zones. Now there's a good six-point growth package for you, and the Congress has refused to do one single thing about it. And I don't think there is one person out across this country that is in doubt that we are for these things.
Q. May I give you an outline, a scenario of may have happened on the civil rights bill in the last couple of days and you tell me what's wrong with it? Wednesday afternoon you had some Republican senators over here and you and Boyden Gray [C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel] passed out a piece of paper stating some objections to Senator Danforth's bill. These Republican senators went back to the Hill, some conservatives who normally would want to side with you, and they found out that the White House had misrepresented Senator Danforth's bill. They went ballistic and said you could no longer hold the line with 34 votes against veto if the civil rights bill is sustained, and at that point you decided you had to compromise and you basically caved.
A. It's wrong. It's just wrong, that's all. Next question. I said it's wrong. We didn't cave. We worked out, in the spirit of compromise, a negotiated settlement where I can say to the American people, this is not a quota bill. There was give and take on a lot of issues and you're just putting a political spin on it that is 100 percent wrong.
 
 
Cap on Damages
 Q. The civil rights bill that you do have caps damages in sex discrimination cases but not in cases of racial discrimination. Understanding that this is the first time any monetary damages have been allowed for sex discrimination cases, nonetheless how do you justify that to women who may see it as an indication that sexual discrimination cases just aren't taken as seriously as racial discrimination?
A. I just would try to dispel that notion and say look, the main thing is to get a civil rights bill that hits against sex harassment and hits against discrimination in the workplace. So that's the way I'd answer it. And this is the first. This is an historic first. Let me refer you to the lawyers.
Q. Mr. President, when you signed the budget agreement with Congress, the economy was not known to be in a recession. The Soviet Union had not collapsed, therefore you had not ordered a cutback in the nation's nuclear arsenal and estimates hadn't come out that the U.S. could live with a much smaller defense force.
Why not revisit the budget agreement in light of all this, and in light of the fact that the budget deficit is going to be higher than the agreement called for anyway?
A. I will not revisit it because I want -- it's the only cap we have on outrageous Congressional spending. It's the only way you control the excesses of spending. It is the only guarantee that the taxpayer has that his interests to some degree will be protected. And if you revisit it in the sense of removing these constraints, the spending gates would open. We've already seen it on some legislation. The unemployment benefits is a good recent example. Don't worry about budget deficits, don't worry about those people that are paying the taxes, just throw on some more spending.
 
The Thomas Hearing
 Q. Can I just ask: Did you think she [Prof. Anita F. Hill] was treated fairly?
A. I think -- I don't want to accuse . . . [Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware] of not running a fair hearing. . . . I've said in the very beginning I thought that he did a good job on that, and so please don't try to draw me into what was fair or not. Some people were disappointed in the results. They might not think it was fair. I was pleased with the results because I think the American people's confidence in this judge . . . has been proved to be correct.
Q. Some people sort of think that the message from the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearing, that the message to women is don't bother to come forward on sexual harassment because you won't be believed. Sir, do you believe that is the message, or would you tell the American women that they should come forward?
A. I say they should come forward, but let's do it in a climate so that people are not destroyed in the process, and that's why I'm saying let's do it behind closed doors, or let's have procedures that you don't leak information that Anita Hill gave, that she asked be confidential, and then somebody goes out and insidiously leaks it, and she's drawn into a public debacle that she didn't want in the first place.
Yes, I'm concerned about that, and her feelings and everything else related to it, and I've made proposals that I think would help, including the way we handle F.B.I. reports.
So when people can't come forward for fear of their character being damaged and being dragged through the mud, of course I worry about it, and that's why I styled some proposals yesterday that I think will help address the problem.
And why can't we facilitate the process by guaranteeing as best we can against insidious leaks that damage people the minute the door opens?
And so I've made some proposals on that and yes, I'm concerned. But I don't want to end on a downer note here. I want to end by saying I can't tell you how pleased I am about this civil rights vote.
I have taken, you know, some people have said well, the President may not really want a civil rights bill, he wants an issue of some sort. My political opponents charging that over and over again.
And the fact now that we have a good, strong, reasonable civil rights bill, I think it's good for the American people. I think it transcends party politics. And I salute Bob Dole and Jack Danforth on our side and others on the Democratic side who've been willing to work in a constructive fashion -- ups and downs in the negotiating process, charge and countercharge. But today we have a good civil rights bill and I'd like to ask the Senate to promptly pass it without change and I'd like to ask the House to accede to it, and let's do something that's good and upright in the field of civil rights for the American people.

HEADLINE: Running or Not, Cuomo Steps Up Sallies at Bush

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo may not be a candidate for President, but he has a stump speech. In recent weeks, the Governor has honed a blistering critique of the Bush Administration's domestic policy by weaving fragments of old speeches and new thoughts into an unforgiving attack.
By focusing attention on his state's growing budget problems, Mr. Cuomo has convinced many of his closest aides and advisers that he will choose not to run in 1992. But by delivering speeches that blame the state's problems on the Federal Government, the Governor has also kept alive a local rationale for running: that he can do more for New York from Washington than from Albany. 
 The heart of Mr. Cuomo's message is that the recession is not the product of "cyclical economic gods," but of 10 years of misdirected Federal leadership. Rather than waiting for the economy to right itself, Mr. Cuomo urges stimulating long-term growth.
With the exception of his plan for a net investment tax credit, which would encourage investment in machinery and other production tools, Mr. Cuomo has offered few specifics. After telling a meeting of radio and television news directors in Manhattan yesterday that Congress should make cuts in both defense and entitlement programs, he declined to suggest a single entitlement program that should be pared.
 
'The Greed, the Stupidity'
 But the Governor was unrelenting in explaining the problems Republicans have created.
"It's not just some temporary cycle," he said in a speech yesterday at the meeting of the Radio-Television News Directors Association at the New York Hilton. "It is a dramatic response to the greed, the stupidity, the shortsightedness, the super-consumption attitude of the 80's."
He issued a five-page statement in Albany that made many of the same points.
Mr. Cuomo continued to insist yesterday that his message was more important than its messenger, and that any willing Democratic candidate could deliver it convincingly. He declined again to announce whether he would be a candidate.
 
'Stan, You're a Terrific Guy'
 The Governor stressed repeatedly that his primary problem concerns whether he can abandon the state to run for national office, leaving Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine to cope with a large midyear budget gap.
"Do you announce, 'Okay, now that I've told you how bad things are, I want you to know I'm leaving for New Hampshire?' " he asked. " 'But have a good time. And Stan, you're a terrific guy. Are you in shape Stan? Are you ready? See you. I'm going to Iowa and New Hampshire to tell people to save the country.' "
He later said he could imagine the fun that Roger Ailes, the Republican political consultant, would have with the Governor's abandoning the state.
Mr. Cuomo ridiculed the Republican notion, which began with the Reagan Administration and has continued in the Bush years, that supply-side economics is the answer.
"It was the easy answer to everything," he said yesterday. "It was narcotic: What a great world this is. We'll be the strongest people in the world. We won't have to pay for it. And our budget will balance.
"We got conned because we were tired," he said, "we were tired of ineffectuality. We were hungry, we were stupid, we were short sighted. And here we are. They were wrong by $3 trillion."
Mr. Cuomo's message is that of the angry outsider, and it is likely to generate a Republican response that he is a doom-and-gloom Democrat. But the Governor says that he has been speaking the truth, and that the durability of the recession is leading Americans to wake up to his warnings. Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his message may be a hard sell politically.
"If you go to the American people and just con them, you might be able to win -- a Democrat might be able to win -- because President Bush is not going to get more popular," he said yesterday. "The truth is going to be very tough. Maybe you can't win with it. I don't know, because I'm not a candidate."

HEADLINE: NATO, Victim of Success, Searches for New Strategy

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The NATO alliance won the cold war, but it is not yet clear how it will survive the victory.
The corridors of the sprawling headquarters building here are bustling with urgency these days, with 4,000 military officers and diplomats all trying to put the finishing touches on a sweeping new strategy in time for a meeting of the alliance's 16 leaders in Rome on Nov. 7 and 8. 
 What will not be on the agenda, but is on practically everybody's lips in private conversation here, is a crucial question: How much longer will the United States continue to be the key to European security?
 
The U.S. Is Needed
 The answer the summit meeting will provide seems clear. The United States is needed, they will say, as long as there is uncertainty or instability in the former enemy camp -- the old Warsaw Pact, and the Soviet Union as it had been from Stalin's days until the era of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Indeed, the new strategy will de-emphasize the forward deployments, quick reaction times and "last resort" nuclear option the alliance needed to counter that now-vanished imminent threat, relying instead on longer warning times to transport arms and soldiers back in the unlikely event they are ever needed.
Though the leaders of the alliance are less certain about how to deal with the myriad other smaller nuisances that could confront them from the Balkans or outside of Europe, at the summit meeting they will reach out to their old adversaries. They will not offer the full membership and security guarantees sought by Czechoslovakia, for instance, but they will extend promises of cooperation and consultation on a whole range of security issues nonetheless.
But over the longer term, assuming that the eastern part of Europe stays on its present course, the bigger question is whether Western Europe will continue to feel the need for an American presence that it felt in the cold war.
The United States has reduced the number of troops in Europe from 320,000 at the end of the 1980's to 260,000 now and could continue down to 150,000, according to Gen. John R. Galvin, the American commander of NATO. And last month President Bush announced unilateral decisions to remove almost all American nuclear weapons from Europe, to encourage the Soviet Union to keep reducing its arsenal.
The alliance as a whole will soon have only about half the number of troops it had in standing armies only a few years ago, because the threat that mobilized them is gone.
 
'Risk Is in Uncertainty'
 "The classical threat has disappeared," Manfred Worner, NATO's Secretary General, said in an interview. "The risk is in uncertainty -- about the future political structure of the Soviet Union, the bad economic situation, and all its consequences, in a country which still has more than three million people under arms and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons."
"The Soviet Union, or even just Russia, is such an enormous land mass that it needs a geopolitical counterweight," he said. "I don't think that Europe alone can provide it."
But some Europeans, led by France, think that lessening their dependence on the Americans is either a good thing, or else an unavoidable necessity whether they like it or not. Others, like the British and the Germans, though less now than before unification, fear that weakening ties to the Americans could lead to catastrophe. But even some of them are beginning to worry that the Americans themselves do not really want to stay forever.
Lingering doubts about the reassurances that American officials try to give about United States staying power are among the factors shaping the debate not only about the future of NATO, but also about the nature of European unity.
 
European Meeting Set
 Decisions about European monetary union and the future of political and military cooperation among the present 12 members of the European Community are expected to be made at a European summit meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, six weeks from now, and one of the most difficult is how to shape the future defense of Europe, with or separately from the United States.
"With all the problems you have in the United States at home, how much will any American President after George Bush care about emphasizing the security role of the United States in Europe?" asked a diplomat from a NATO country that sees its interests as closely bound to the United States. But his was only one variation of the question. Governments in every country in Europe are asking themselves the same thing, their diplomats say.
Mr. Worner, a former West German Defense Minister, also expressed the concern, and alluded to some of its possible effects.
"The United States and Canada really contribute in a very substantial way to the stable political development of Europe," he said. "NATO enabled the process of European unification to go ahead at that speed. There is a substantial risk that if you took the U.S. away and broke our alliance, the nations of Western Europe could fall back into competing alliances and counteralliances."
 
New Force Proposed
 This has not happened yet, but some British and American officials thought it had almost begun to happen on Oct. 14, when President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany surprised most of their European Community partners by proposing a new European defense force, with an existing French-German brigade as the core.
The new force, their proposal said, could include soldiers of other countries that belong to the nine-nation Western European Union, a vestige of NATO's early days that was also at the heart of an earlier British-Italian proposal to strengthen NATO's European "pillar."
The difference between the two proposals was basically that in the French-German plan, the emphasis was on linking the Western European Union with European political union, and in the British-Italian plan, it was on strengthening the Western European Union's links with NATO.
German officials, somewhat embarrassed by all the fuss, now concede that the proposal to build a 35,000-member European force out of the existing two-nation brigade in southwest Germany was added as a footnote, apparently at Mr. Mitterrand's suggestion, to the rest of their paper on European defense. They insisted, and American officials agreed, that they had consulted extensively with the United States and Britain on everything else.
 
Shortcomings Noted
 Mr. Kohl was eager to give European union a lift before the December meeting in the Netherlands, an official close to him said. NATO's inability to agree on sending forces to the Persian Gulf in the war last winter, and Europe's military impotence in dealing with the civil war in Yugoslavia, showed everybody that something needed to be done. "This is not an attempt to replace a part of the Atlantic alliance's security guarantee with a European defense policy," he said.
Foreign ministers of the Western European Union are to meet in Bonn on Tuesday to try to marry the various proposals for European defense and come up with an approach that will be acceptable to everybody, including the United States, which has been calling for greater European defense contributions for decades. But diplomats from some member countries say the best thing to do would be to put the whole debate off for a few years.
Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain belong to the organization, which has a headquarters and small staff in London but may soon move to Brussels.
Some skeptical American and British diplomats said there were fears that Mr. Mitterrand's hidden goal in pushing the new European force was quietly to push the United States out of European defense. French forces have not been integrated in the NATO command for nearly 20 years, and European strategic independence from the United States has been a cherished French goal for years. It was inconceivable, Mr. Mitterrand told a French radio audience on Tuesday, that the United States would always stand ready in the front lines of European defense.
NATO officials say the summit meeting in Rome next month will approve a new statement of alliance strategy that makes that commitment credible -- a new charter that clearly states why the alliance is still necessary, and explicitly addresses the changes in the East.
"We are moving clearly in the direction of institutional consultation and more concrete cooperation," Mr. Worner said, and regular meetings with the representatives the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have accredited to NATO are expected to be part of that.
"The next step is that we agree on more concrete projects -- perhaps the conversion of defense industries, verification, even studies of migration problems," Mr. Worner said.
There seems to be little support for the idea of extending NATO's security guarantees to Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Diplomats from several NATO countries said the idea that attack against one member of the alliance would be regarded as an attack against all was difficult to apply to new geographical areas unless the basic charter of the alliance is changed.
And though it will continue to engage the Soviet Union and its increasingly independent republics in dialogue, NATO will not invite President Gorbachev to come to the summit meeting in Rome, though it would welcome him to the headquarters here before or later, several officials say.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Decides Against Proposed Fare Increases on Most Commuter Lines

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
There will be no fare increases next year on the Long Island Rail Road and most of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided yesterday.
The decision will not affect a possible fare increase for New York City subways and buses. The present $1.15 fare could rise to $1.25 and perhaps even to $1.50, M.T.A. officials have said. A decision is expected in December. 
 The M.T.A. also gave final approval to a $65 million renovation at the north end of Grand Central Terminal that would create four new entrances along Park Avenue between 45th and 48th Streets. They are intended to reduce crowding at the terminal.
Both suburban lines had been preparing for fare increases averaging about 8 percent, and had scheduled hearings on the proposals for next month. But M.T.A. officials said on Monday that they had found new ways to close projected deficits for the railroads next year, making a fare increase unnecessary.
 
Concern Over Ridership Losses
 The M.T.A. board approved the plan unanimously yesterday. The board's chairman, Peter E. Stangl, said that with the lines' ridership declining because of the recession, he did not think it wise to raise fares and cause additional riders to stop using the railroads.
"At least this will hold our ridership, as best we can," Mr. Stangl said after the board meeting.
Connecticut commuters who use Metro-North's New Haven line still face an increase. The Connecticut Department of Transportation sets that fare, and it is planning an increase on Jan. 1. Connecticut officials have not yet determined the size of the increase, said Bill Keish, a spokesman for the State Transportation Department.
The Grand Central project was part of the M.T.A.'s five-year capital plan that expires at the end of the year. It had to be redesigned and scaled back when an additional $8 million in private financing did not materialize, Metro-North officials said. Construction is expected to begin in the fall of 1993.
Currently, passengers leaving Metro-North trains must walk south on the station platforms to the terminal's main concourse. About 40 percent of the passengers then head for offices north of Grand Central, usually by walking through the Pan Am Building, Metro-North officials said.
The new entrances would allow commuters to avoid such back-tracking, saving them as much as 10 minutes in walking time, railroad officials said. It would also eliminate bottlenecks in the flow of commuters in and out of the terminal and would reduce overcrowding on the narrow platforms, they said.
 
Future Deficits Still Looming
 Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road face a combined deficit for 1992 of $36 million. But Mr. Stangl and other M.T.A. officials decided that a fare increase could be prevented by two actions: saving about $17 million by refinancing bonds and obtaining another $19 million from unspecified administrative cuts.
The Transit Authority, which operates the city's subways and buses, confronts such a large projected 1992 deficit -- about $460 million -- that similar cost-reduction efforts could not prevent a fare increase, M.T.A. officials said.
They also said that the suburban commuter lines would benefit in 1992 from a one-time state commuter tax surplus of $90 million. The suburban railroads will face substantial projected deficits in 1993, in part because they will not get the $90 million surplus a second time and also because they will not have the revenues from the 8 percent fare increase that had been proposed for 1992.
By state law, the commuter surplus cannot be shared with the Transit Authority.
Several M.T.A. board members said yesterday that while they favored holding the line on the suburban fares, they also wanted the M.T.A. and the State Legislature to reconsider the distribution of subsidies from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which are now basically shared by the city and suburban mass-transit agencies.

More Commuter Exits
 
Construction on new entrances to the platforms in Grand Central Terminal will begin in 1993 and take three years to complete.
 
Passengers must now walk south along the platforms to reach the main concourse.
 
Under the new plan, two platforms will be converted into north-south walkways connected by cross passages. The walkways will lead to four new exits:
 
1. At the Westvaco Building on the northeast corner of 48th Street and Park Avenue.
 
2. At the Manufacturers Hannover building on the north side of 47th Street between Park and Madison avenues.
 
3., 4. In the Helmsley Building at 46th Street and Park Avenue.

HEADLINE: Oakland Struggles to Restore Hills, and Faith

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 25

 BODY:
For the second time in two years, the resilient citizens of Oakland are cleaning up their ruined neighborhoods, burying their dead and comparing themselves to latter-day Jobs.
The deadly one-two punch of earthquake and firestorm has driven home the lesson that rich and poor alike can be bowed by nature, since the 1989 quake devastated the city's poorest area and this week's roaring blaze devoured the lush hillsides where Oakland's wealthiest and most powerful lived. 
 Looking for a bright side to the calamity, city officials here noted that recovery would be easier this time because the vast majority of fire victims have insurance, bank accounts and the skill to deal with cumbersome bureaucracies.
Unlike the thousands of people who were forced by the quake from welfare hotels and dilapidated downtown buildings, the 5,000 people dispossessed by this fire do not need cots in Red Cross shelters, sandwiches from the Salvation Army or grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Federal emergency office has yet to untangle the red tape and pay all the claims on damages suffered in the Bay Area's last disaster.
But the well-to-do fire victims do need help from the city: To have building permits issued quickly and without undue fuss, to control soil erosion and thus prevent mudslides and to restore roads and utilities in neighborhoods where nothing remains but white ash and blackened rubble.
If these residents are frustrated in their efforts to rebuild, local leaders note with trepidation, many may quit Oakland for other communities nearby, leaving this beleaguered city without the assets, leadership, energy and philanthropy of its racially integrated middle and upper classes.
"This is a watershed for the future of Oakland," said Don Perata, an Alameda County supervisor, whose district includes lower class precincts in the flatlands and professional enclaves in the hills. "If we lose this strata of the population, we will become, and I say this advisedly, another Newark, N.J. There will be no one left with the wherewithal to bridge the widening gulf between those who have and those who don't. And the great sociological experiment that is called Oakland will be over."
A more optimistic spin is put on the situation by Edward J. Blakely, the chairman of the city planning department at the University of California at Berkeley and one of many blacks who lives in a neighborhood in the Oakland hills that survived the fire.
Mr. Blakely said that many hill-dwellers who are not usually dependent on services like public assistance, transportation and health will suddenly have a personal stake in local government and that their involvement will make "the city run better for everyone."
As Mr. Perata and Mr. Blakely considered the future, search teams, fire officials and engineers continued searching for bodies, counting ruined houses and shoring up 1,800 acres of bare hillside against the rain that fell tonight, raising the threat of mudslides. At last count 24 people were known dead and 13 missing, and officials said more than 3,000 houses and apartments were destroyed.
 
A Misunderstood City
 This disaster has drawn attention to a part of Oakland that few outsiders were aware of: a band of gracious residential neighborhoods high in the hills that were home to professionals, civic leaders, academics and artists.
More often this misunderstood city of 372,000 is viewed merely as San Francisco's ugly stepsister and a caldron of poverty and violence. That image is so rooted in the national imagination that television coverage of the fire on Sunday described it as occurring in the hills "above" Oakland, as if these fine homes with their valuable art collections and libraries of first editions could not be part of a city that is best known for crack and crime.
But what makes Oakland special for the people who live here is just that diversity, a much-overused word these days, but a reality in a city that sociologists have characterized as America's most integrated, not only in its neighborhoods but also in its halls of power.
The divisions here are economic, not racial. The poor, most of them black, are concentrated in the housing projects and tumbledown Victorian houses in the flatlands, near the collapsed highway that claimed 42 lives in the earthquake. The middle-class and the rich have settled on the hillsides, where professional people, white and black alike, live peaceably side by side, enjoying wide vistas of San Francisco Bay and flowers that bloom year-round. Many hill-dwellers are children of the flatlands, and their move up is a true expression of the American dream.
 
Lovely Streets, Now Gone
 It is these lovely hillside neighborhoods that no longer exist, turned into charred craters by a raging inferno that, at 2,000 degrees, was nearly as hot as a crematory. Gone are the homes of a state senator, a county supervisor, a city councilwoman and a municipal court judge. Gone are the homes of star baseball players, best-selling novelists and television newscasters. Gone are the homes of corporate executives, doctors, lawyers and professors.
But there was virtually no gloating in the hardscrabble flatlands when these homes of privilege burned. A few people on the mean streets of West Oakland, near the fallen freeway, were heard to comment that nature, at least, was fair. A few others noted wryly that Chez Panisse, the bastion of California cuisine, sent sandwiches to evacuation centers in this disaster, while the quake victims here got Salvation Army grub.
But far more common were extraordinary acts of kindness and expressions of concern. Oakland's poor were among the first to volunteer to help fight the fires and work in evacuation centers. At Jubilee West, a community development organization in West Oakland, thrift-shop clothing donated by a well-to-do parish in the hills will be donated back to the original owners.
"We're sorry, sorry as can be," said Ralph S. Williams Sr., a retired truck driver and a community leader in West Oakland. "They're rich, they're powerful and yet they're helpless, just like us."
After the earthquake, the kindness flowed downhill not up, much of it in the form of donations to relief efforts. And in ordinary times, as well, the people of the hills have looked for ways to help their less fortunate neighbors, by serving on the boards of charitable foundations and community development organizations, by doing pro bono legal work and volunteering in medical clinics, by contributing ideas and supplies to a struggling school system.
"Many of the people up there are as committed to the poor of Oakland and their children as any flatland activist," Mr. Perata said.
It is this sort of synergy that Mr. Perata and others fear will be lost in the wake of the great fire if too many hill residents move rather than rebuild, either because of bureaucratic hassles, fear of remaining in such a fragile landscape or convenience.
That may be happening already among those who lost their homes and have found places to rent while they figure out what to do next.
Peter Persoff, for instance, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, has moved his family into a rented house in Lafayette, a suburb on the eastern slope of the charred hills. And Warren Widener, a member of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, is renting just a few miles north of his ruined Oakland home, but on the other side of the Berkeley border.
The ability to grab a rental house, however overpriced, is one of the clearest advantages that the rich have over the poor. Many of the dispossessed here have enough money in the bank or a credit rating that is good enough to allow them to move and to replace their lost belongings, even before an insurance claim is settled.
 
Many Have Options
 Others have already received advances from their insurance companies to cover costs. Mr. Widener, for instance, saw his insurance agent for the first time yesterday and was handed a check for $25,000 on the spot.
Virtually nobody who was burned out here needed to sleep in the Red Cross centers that opened on Sunday night and closed a few days later for lack of need. Many people are staying with friends who have rambling houses with room to spare. Others are in hotels, where one man noted that he and hundreds of others had "evacuated by using credit cards."
Another advantage is the ability to find the right agencies, pull the right strings and get their needs met. Victoria Larson, a graphics designer, like so many of the fire victims, showed no self-pity as she set about rebuilding a life for herself, her husband, a landscape architect, and their 2-year-old daughter.
"We don't deserve that much sympathy," she said. "We have so many resources. I guess it's lucky for everybody that it happened to us."

HEADLINE: Bush Selects An Opponent

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
President Bush's seemingly contradictory actions of the last 48 hours -- first assailing Congress as "a privileged class of rulers" answerable to no one, then closing a deal with Congress on a new civil rights bill -- were aimed at dampening the volatile political consequences of racial divisiveness and de-emphasizing the stalled economy.
On race, the President clearly hopes he has found a path through the mine field by putting himself in a position to assert with some credibility that he is not the implacable foe of civil rights progress that some have accused him of being, while at the same time leaving himself room to assure white middle-class voters that he has protected them from the quotas they hate. 
 On the economy, he has begun to lay the groundwork for a 1992 Presidential campaign in which he apparently intends to argue that a self-indulgent, undisciplined Congress, not his own economic stewardship, is the nation's big problem.
Mr. Bush denied at his news conference this morning that he had caved in and changed his position on civil rights, but several Republican senators said he had decided to accept, with only relatively minor changes, a deal that had been available to him for weeks. He had dismissed every attempted compromise as "a quota bill"; today he hailed what he called "a non-quota bill."
In fact, the issues had been so thoroughly beclouded that the distinction between quotas and non-quotas had become almost entirely subjective.
Although the White House is convinced that the President was the winner in the fight over the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, in the sense that most voters favored his confirmation and thought that Congress handled it badly, Republican political strategists have been worried about how women would vote next year.
Already unpopular with some women's groups because of his oppostion to abortion, Mr. Bush risked narrowing his potential support further among the influential minority of women angry about Republican attacks on Prof. Anita F. Hill, who accused Judge Thomas of sexual harassment. 
There were also problems in the President's party, starting with Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, who led the fight to confirm Judge Thomas but is also deeply committed to civil rights legislation. And there is a group of more pragmatic Republicans, eager to increase the trickle of blacks supporting their party, who have been worried in recent days about the success of State Representative David Duke of Louisiana, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who is seeking the governorship as a Republican, though the national party disavows him.
George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader in the Senate, used the Duke candidacy to score partisan points today, calling it "the inevitable consequence of the racial politics of the Reagan and Bush administrations."
Both sides said they got what they wanted in the civil rights bill, but Mr. Bush, with his bigger megaphone, could proclaim the achievement of "a new standard against discrimination" that would be set without giving way to affirmative action, and no one was in a position to effectively gainsay him. That is the great advantage of the Presidency: Senator Mitchell and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, may have gained most of the legal language they sought, but Mr. Bush gained the country's attention, at least for now.
By accepting a bill intended to help both women and blacks who are victims of discrimination, Mr. Bush escaped from a civil rights struggle he might not have been able to win. He had threatened to veto a bill not terribly different from the one he now promises to sign, but he found himself in some danger, according to the count of Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, of losing several of the 34 Senate votes he would have needed to sustain a veto.
It will be more difficult to still unrest over the economy, which is widely considered by Democrats and Republicans alike to be the issue most capable of derailing a Bush re-election.
The President said at his news conference that he was unwilling to reopen the budget agreement he negotiated last year with the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill because doing so would produce "a windfall of new spending." But he was careful not to rule out some sort of compromise with the Democrats on economic stimulus for the economy, because he does not want to be labeled "the recession President" or "the unemployment President" by his foes.
 
An Anti-Washington Mood
 So where does the attack on Congress fit in? While he talks about a civil rights bill that "transcends party politics" and gropes for ways in which he can outflank the Democrats on the economy, Mr. Bush apparently believes that he can simultaneously make political hay out of a growing anti-Washington mood in the country. His aides say the country's ire focuses on Capitol Hill.
Playing on the disclosures that members of Congress have had insufficient-funds checks covered and left their restaurant bills unpaid, things that ordinary citizens cannot do, the President called on Congress to end the exemptions it has granted itself in laws covering diverse subjects like privacy, safety standards and wages.
There will be more of the same next year. John H. Mr. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview that Mr. Bush "will make it clear in the campaign that the problem in Washington is the Democratic Congressional leadership," taking a leaf from Harry S. Truman's textbook on how to run against Capitol Hill.
Evidently Mr. Bush hopes to funnel the frustration of voters who feel ill-served by Washington into votes against senators and representatives who cannot get the job done rather than votes against a President on whose watch a recession has developed and lingered.
If the economic indicators continue to look sour, that will be no small task, even for Mr. Bush, who retains his overall popularity, according to the polls, despite most voters' lack of confidence in his economic management.

HEADLINE: Just What Are You Worth? Figure It Out

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Where do I stand financially and where am I going? Those are good questions to ask as any year nears an end, particularly when the national economy is slow. A good way to find out is to draw up a statement of personal net worth.
An individual can do what all corporations do: list what is owned on one side of a sheet of paper and what is owed on the other. Net worth is what is left after subtracting liabilities from assets. 
 "I don't think people can properly plan unless they have some idea of what they're worth," said Herbert M. Paul, a New York lawyer and certified public accountant. "A net worth statement pulls it all together."
This is a situation where literal accuracy doesn't count. Reasonable approximations will present a "still picture" of your finances on a specific date. The end of a month or year is generally preferable.
"Just do the best you can and don't worry if you're off 10 or 15 percent," said David S. Rhine, a partner of BDO Seidman, a certified public accounting firm, in New York. "In getting 5 percent more accuracy, it may triple your preparation time. There's no perfect score, and there's no passing grade."
 
Pencil or Computer Will Do
 Net worth statements come in different sizes and shapes. You can use either a sheet of paper or a computer software program. The American Bankers Association has a form that banks give loan applicants. The Internal Revenue Service has a form to be completed with estate tax returns.
What are the elements of a net worth statement? On the asset side, cash and cash equivalents usually come first. Cash is not only what is in your pocket or purse, but also in bank accounts and certificates of deposit. Cash equivalents are investments of such high safety and convertibility -- like Treasury bills and money market funds -- that they are considered the same as cash.
Next on the asset side are investments: stocks, bonds, mutual funds and investment real estate like commercial buildings and undeveloped land.
The current market value of your home or homes -- whether a house, a cooperative or condominium apartment or a vacation cottage -- should also be included. List the full value, regardless of any mortgage or home equity loan.
Personal possessions are difficult to assess, but they should not be ignored. Valuables are often insured and therefore have an easily established worth. However, the depreciated value of furniture, furnishings and clothing should be estimated as conservatively as possible, because they probably could not be sold easily or quickly.
Finally, there are your remaining, or "other," assets. This is the place to list things like the cash value of your life insurance, loans to family or friends and your vested interest in a pension plan.
 
And Now for the Downside
 As for liabilities, the largest item for most people is the mortgage on a home. Other mortgages on personal and investment real estate are also listed in this section.
Another liability is installment loans on major purchases, like cars, appliances and contractors' services. Multiply your monthly payment by the number of payments remaining on the debt.
Accounts payable come next. These include amounts owed to credit card companies, stores, utilities, doctors and the like. And then there is the category of miscellaneous debts, which includes Federal, state and local taxes still due, loans outstanding on insurance policies and pledges to charities.
"If you have something left over after subtracting liabilities from assets, that's your net worth," said Randy Neumann, a financial planner in Paramus, N.J. "And you can use that figure to project your needs."
And if your arithmetic leaves you with nothing left over, it might be time to take drastic action before disaster strikes.

Franklin Roosevelt said Dec. 7, 1941, was "a date which will live in infamy," but he could not have imagined all the reasons. As many Americans prepare to observe the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, other Americans note a rise in acts of anti-Asian bias and fear the observance will bring more. They have reason to be concerned.
In January 1990, a scuffle in a Korean-American grocery in Brooklyn resulted in a long and ugly boycott of all the Korean-owned stores in the neighborhood. Pickets handed out leaflets to discourage shopping "with people who do not look like us."
In Orange County, California, in June three Japanese women were assaulted in a bar because they were speaking Japanese. The attack reflected a sharp rise in anti-Asian incidents in southern California. 
 In July, 100 young Asian men in Revere, Mass., were rounded up by police and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Why? Because of tension over the killing of a non-Asian, apparently by Asian youths.
There are many explanations for such bigotry. Japan's economic successes have engendered resentments that peak when, for example, Japanese interests buy movie companies or a piece of Rockefeller Center. Asians are the fastest-growing minority group in the U.S. and many people of surly sentiments do not distinguish between Asians and Asian-Americans.
But whatever the case, explanations are not reasons. Accepting cultural differences takes patient understanding even in ordinary times. The imminent anniversary creates a special need for public officials and citizens alike to remember Pearl Harbor -- and also what it was that America fought for.

In Our Backyard

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Whenever anyone comes up with a plan to house the homeless, the response is predictable: NIMBY! NIMBY! NIMBY! NIMBY! That's short for Not In My Backyard. It's become America's ruling acronym.
And so when Mayor David Dinkins announced a plan to put smaller shelters for single adults throughout New York City, high-pitched cries of "NIMBY!" rang out from Staten Island to Queens. The speaker of the City Council even likened homeless people to a contagious disease. He backtracked from his ill-chosen words, but the sentiment behind them was epidemic among politicians and the people they represent. No one actually mentioned putting homeless people on a barge and letting them float out to sea, but that kind of feeling was in the air. Either that, or making them all go to Manhattan and then closing the borders. 
 No wonder. If empty shelves became a symbol for the failure of Communism in the Soviet Union, people living in cardboard boxes are the most visible sign that America is on the skids. They are living, breathing symbols of an economy that, no matter what the Astigmatism President says, is a mess.
Soon there may be 1,000 men sleeping each night on cots in the armory in Washington Heights. There are sections for the mentally ill and those with TB. The predators range throughout, the people who steal from and torture the weak, the elderly, the handicapped.
Picture 1,000 men in a single room on cots, the dormitory from hell: the mutterers, the shouters, the sick all hacking away. Dickens could write it. We can't imagine it. They live it. And when they do not want to go there, when they prefer a suite on the A train, we call them crazy.
Someday some leader will admit that it is just the opposite, that only a lunatic would want to spend the night in the city's biggest shelters. The Mayor took a step in that direction by announcing that he was attempting to replace them with smaller facilities. That is half of a good idea. Smaller is better, but shelters are by definition substandard. Permanent housing is the answer, on the same sites now slated for shelters: why waste time or money on the interim step? The first answer to the problem of homelessness has always been housing, not cots. Soon the Washington Heights armory will celebrate its 10th anniversary as a shelter. I'm using the word celebrate loosely.
The Mayor would have to expend plenty of political capital to pull off a significant response to this problem. But if he is fated, as most people believe, to be a one-term Mayor, due to the deplorable state of everything from the Brooklyn Bridge to Harlem Hospital, he might as well go out in a blaze of glory. He could act like something we rarely see anymore: a Democrat. He could make sweeping changes in social policy not because they are politic, but because they are morally right.
And he could also teach people that NIMBY is a meaningless acronym. There is nary a neighborhood that doesn't have someone sleeping beneath the elevated tracks or in a corner of the playground. In fact, the obsession with our own backyard is the best way to sell housing for the homeless. See the little lady with the shopping cart? See the man urinating in the gutter? (I'm baffled by those who argue that this proves insanity; I wonder what they would do without bathrooms?) Those people you see every day: we are going to build those people a place to live.
Ellen Baxter, who has created five buildings to permanently house the homeless in Washington Heights, has coexisted pleasantly with her community because of this approach. Almost half her tenants came from the neighborhood, and with a room of their own many of them begin to heal. (And this happens fast; Ms. Baxter's latest project, an 82-unit rehab, was begun in February and will be finished in the next few weeks.) It is that happiest of initiatives, a project that benefits all while doing the right thing.
It has gone out of fashion, doing the right thing. And it used to be simpler. When Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty more than a quarter-century ago, it had the flavor of foreign aid, a mission to a land we knew only from photographs, in the gullies of the Appalachians and the tenements of Harlem. Today that war is more difficult and less photogenic. Above all, it no longer has the safety of distance. It is right in our own backyard.

HEADLINE: Gene Roddenberry, 'Star Trek' Creator, Dies at 70

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Gene Roddenberry, the Hollywood writer and producer who created the 1960's science-fiction television series "Star Trek," which inspired six feature films, a sequel series in the 1980's and legions of space-age devotees known as Trekkies, died yesterday at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center in California. He was 70 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
Mr. Roddenberry had been ill for about six weeks and died of a blood clot, said John Wentworth, a spokesman for Paramount Pictures. But Wendy Gullies, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the cause of death was listed as cardiopulmonary arrest. 
 A tall, soft-spoken man with a silver mane and a dazzling imagination, Mr. Roddenberry was a much-decorated B-17 pilot in the Pacific in World War II, and later a pilot for Pan American World Airways, a speechwriter for the Los Angeles police chief, a writer for episodes of "Dragnet" and "Naked City," and head writer of the 1950's television series "Have Gun, Will Travel."
But with "Star Trek," which made its debut in 1966 and ran until 1969 on NBC, Mr. Roddenberry took a generation of viewers along on a journey into "space, the final frontier," aboard the Starship Enterprise, to "explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
 
The Galaxies Beyond
 It was an idea that, in various permutations, consumed more than a third of Mr. Roddenberry's life and made believers out of the most skeptical critics. It gave American popular culture such futuristic hardware as "phaser guns" and "transporter beams," and a living-room window on worlds and aliens far beyond the reality of a bright new space age.
It introduced a cast of characters whose names became familiar to millions: the dashing commander, Captain Kirk (played by William Shatner); the omnisciently logical, pointy-eared Vulcan First Mate, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy); Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley); Scotty, the chief engineer (James Doohan); Mr. Sulu (George Takei), and Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nicols).
And it spawned a worldwide fascination that led to Trekkie conventions, products ranging from books and T-shirts to lunch boxes and toys, reruns of its 79 original episodes in 48 countries for more than a decade, a half-dozen feature films starting in 1979, and a sequel series, "Star Trek: The Next Generation," which had its premiere in 1987 and is still running, with audiences of more than 12 million households and numerous awards to its credit.
"Few ideas in the annals of motion picture and television history have inspired more passion and allegiance on the part of the audience than has 'Star Trek,' " said Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of Paramount Pictures, which made the "Star Trek" series for television and all the feature films.
For Mr. Roddenberry, the "Star Trek" phenomenon was more than entertainment, as he explained in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in May.
"It has become a crusade of mine to demonstrate that TV need not be violent to be exciting," he said. "I wanted to send a message to the television industry that excitement is not made of car chases. We stress humanity, and this is done at considerable cost. We can't have a lot of dramtics that other shows get away with -- promiscuity, greed, jealousy. None of those have a place in 'Star Trek.' "
 
From a B-17 to Starships
 Eugene Wesley Roddenberry was born in El Paso, Tex., on Aug. 19, 1921, and grew up in Los Angeles, where his father worked in law enforcement. He attended Los Angeles City College, the University of Miami and Columbia University, studying pre-law and aeronautical engineering.
He qualified for a pilot's license and flew a B-17 Flying Fortress in World War II on 89 missions, including Guadalcanal and Bougainville. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal, among other decorations. While in the South Pacific, he began to write stories and poetry for magazines and newspapers.
After the war, he joined Pan Am as a pilot, and flew for four more years. From 1949 to 1953, he was a sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department, working as a department spokesman and a speech writer for Chief William H. Parker. He also began writing for television, and from 1953 to 1962 wrote scripts for "The U.S. Steel Hour," "Goodyear Theater," "The Kaiser Aluminum Hour," "Four Star Theater," "Dragnet," "The Jane Wyman Theater" and "Naked City."
He won his first Emmy Award for "Have Gun, Will Travel," a western (starring Richard Boone as Paladin) that, according to some film and television critics, was a precursor of "Star Trek" in that its wit, characterizations and themes were only incidentally set in a particular time and place.
The original "Star Trek," Mr. Roddenberry told an interviewer a few years ago, was technically primitive but with high aims for adventure and in the way it portrayed people and their relationships.
"We had to explain computers," Mr. Roddenberry said. "And our effects were primitive. Our stars were a black cloth with holes in it and light behind. The episodes cost $186,000. They're $1.3 million for 'The Next Generation.' I wanted to cast a woman as second in command. NBC said no way."
Mr. Roddenberry, who said he always thought of himself as a storyteller, wrote not only the original shows, but also what he called a bible for later writers to follow. It detailed characters, the ship and its technology, the 23d century and the fantasy of deep space, in which they all traveled.
Some writers told him it was the hardest show in television to write for because they had to know so much about history, economics, moral values and the personalities of the running characters. There was formula in it, but the shows were hardly the standard television fare of car chases and grim faces.
Mr. Roddenberry was producer of the first "Star Trek" film, executive consultant on the next three and the executive producer of the sequel series.
Survivors include his wife, the former Majel Leigh Hudec, an actress who appeared in the two "Star Trek" television series under her stage name, Majel Barrett; a son, Eugene, known as Rod; two daughters, Darleen Incopero and Dawn Compton; a brother, Robert; a sister, Doris, and his mother, Carolyn Glen Roddenberry.

HEADLINE: In New York City's Tabloid War, The Combat Is Closer and Fiercer

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
A year after the start of a devastating strike that nearly killed The Daily News, New York City's tabloid war is more competitive than ever, new circulation figures show.
The figures indicate that The Daily News has regained about half the circulation it lost during the strike, which ended in March. 
 The New York Post and New York Newsday have kept a significant chunk of the circulation they gained at The News's expense, but they also saw what appeared to be huge gains slowly dissolve as many readers returned to The News. The New York Times's circulation was not significantly affected by the strike.
In effect, the city's tabloid playing field, which was dominated by The News before the strike, has become more level, and all the combatants say they are pressing on.
But all of New York's papers, including The Times, have felt the impact of the region's economic slump, which has created one of the worst advertising environments in memory. For the first eight months of the year, combined advertising for all four papers declined more than 18 percent.
Six months ago, The Daily News had been all but stripped of circulation and advertising by the strike and seemed destined to become the first casualty of the city's newspaper war.
While it is impossible to say precisely what brought readers back to The News, it was probably a combination of their loyalty to the paper, their dissatisfaction with the alternatives, a pro-union sentiment following the strike and successful promotion tactics by its new owner, Robert Maxwell, who introduced circulation-building games like "Lucky Bucks."
For the six months ending on Sept. 30, The Daily News reported an average circulation of 762,000 on weekdays and 911,000 on Sundays. A year ago, the figures reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations were 1.1 million on weekdays and 1.4 million on Sunday, but circulation in both categories dropped to 300,000 to 350,000 during the strike. The paper says circulation is now about 800,000 daily and more than 1 million on Sunday, but these figures are not official.
New York Newsday reported an average daily circulation of 269,000 for the six months ending on Sept. 30. That is an increase of 47,000 over the same period a year ago. A spokeswoman said that the paper's average circulation for the six months ending on March 31 was 312,000. The Long Island edition of Newsday reported daily circulation of 695,000, an increase of 2,500 over the year before.
The most important battle for The Daily News and New York Newsday has been on Sunday, the issue richest in advertising. For the six-month period, New York Newsday reported Sunday circulation of 297,000, which represented a gain of about 147,000 over pre-strike levels. But average Sunday sales at the end of March were 373,000. The Long Island edition's average Sunday circulation through September was 578,000, an increase of about 15,000.
The New York Post has reported average circulation of 552,000, up from 510,000 in the same period last year. The paper's circulation at the end of The Daily News strike averaged 645,000. It has no Sunday edition.
The New York Times reported average daily circulation of 730,000 in New York City and its suburbs. Including figures for its national edition, the Times's overall daily circulation was 1.1 million, reflecting an overall increase of 6,400. For its Sunday paper, The Times reported circulation in the New York area of 1.1 million and overall circulation of 1.7 million, an increase of 13,800.
Perhaps the most telling sign that The News is once again a genuine contender is the decision by Rupert Murdoch's News America Corporation to resume inserting its coupon publications in The News beginning on Jan. 5. The coupons, which are considered an important tool for building circulation, were withdrawn during the strike, and Mr. Murdoch refused to restore them when the paper was acquired by Robert Maxwell, his archrival.
Ken Bortner, president of News America's freestanding insert division, said the decision to "put our personal differences aside" and go back into The News came at the request of Kellogg, Procter & Gamble, Quaker and other companies that use coupons.
"I think the paper is on an upward trend," Mr. Bortner said. "The only question is, Will it be around for the long term and will it be profitable in 1992?"
 
Big Debt for Maxwell
 Mr. Maxwell's efforts to sell parts of his worldwide empire to reduce his overall $3 billion debt has prompted speculation that the empire might collapse, taking The News with it.
Mr. Maxwell said that he has no repayment obligations until next October and that he is in no financial jeopardy. He said that just before Columbus Day the paper had its first profitable week since the strike.
"But a swallow does not make a spring," Mr. Maxwell said, acknowledging that the paper had not reached a position of sustained profitability, a goal he hopes to reach by next March, the first anniversary of his ownership.
The post-strike period has been a roiling one for The News, with the paper trying to rebuild while working to overcome the strike's residue of bitterness. Much of it arose when some members of the Newspaper Guild, which represents employees in the news, advertising and clerical departments, crossed picket lines.
Barry F. Lipton, president of the guild, said that about 140 of those who crossed the lines had been brought up on charges by the union and that a majority had been fined, in some cases more than $10,000. Those who crossed the picket lines have retained their own lawyers and have fought the fines.
Juan Gonzalez, a columnist and strike leader, said that an effort is under way to resolve the situation -- and put the strike to rest -- by establishing a maximum fine of $1,800, coupled with a mea culpa from those who crossed the line.
 
Apology by a Friend
 "We want to have the old spirit back, but there's a lot of bitterness still," Mr. Gonzalez said. He said he recently went on an assignment to Haiti with a colleague who had been a close friend until the friend crossed the picket line. He said that the two had not spoken since work resumed after the strike but that in Haiti his friend apologized.
While The News's advertising linage has shown a significant increase over pre-strike levels, it is impossible to know what impact that has had on the paper's financial health because it is not clear what rates the paper has charged. Indeed, newspaper linage can indicate only relative performance because rates can differ widely and ads can be offered at discounts..
On assuming control of the paper, Mr. Maxwell first prohibited all overtime but was forced to relent when it became clear that the paper could not be delivered without overtime pay. There have been few such reprieves, however, and both business and news executives say there is extreme cost consciousness throughout the paper, whose work force shrank to about 1,900 from about 2,700. A number of news executives say that while Mr. Maxwell is strongly interested in the paper's coverage, he has not interfered with it. His main direct involvement has been to write editorials occasionally, especially on foreign affairs.
The paper was stunned yesterday by the news that John Cotter, who was scheduled to begin work on Monday as the managing editor for news, had died at his home in Darien, Conn., apparently of a heart attack. [Obituary, page 26.]
The appointment of Mr. Cotter, who had been city editor of The Post since 1989 and had held a similar position at New York Newsday, had aroused controversy at the paper. In 1987 Mr. Cotter resigned from New York Newsday after he was accused of using a racial epithet in referring to his chief deputy, who is black. Mr. Cotter maintained that he had been telling associates what someone else had said rather than making the comment himself.
Yesterday, the paper's editor, James P. Willse, said that no decision had been made about a replacement for Mr. Cotter.
The Cotter appointment came at a time when Mr. Gonzalez and other members of minority groups have complained that the paper lost a disproportionate number of its minority members during the strike. But Mr. Willse noted that black journalists now fill several key positions, including metropolitan editor, editorial page editor and deputy managing editor for business news.
The New York Post, which has long been considered the most vulnerable of the city's tabloids, has also whittled costs to the bone. Peter S. Kalikow, the paper's owner, now says he expects the paper to be profitable this year.
An executive at the paper who spoke on condition of anonymity said that The Post's weekly costs are about $1.6 million, that weekly circulation revenue is just over $1 million and that advertising averages between 180 and 200 pages a week, generating about $950,000 in weekly revenue. The executive said the paper expects to earn a profit of about $9 million this year.
Last February, Mr. Kalikow obtained yearlong advertising contracts from large retailers by charging rates based on pre-strike circulation figures, though at the time The Post's circulation was much higher. As a result, The Post is the only one of the city's weekday papers to show an increase in advertising linage over last year for the first eight months.
Those contracts expire in February, and Mr. Kalikow said he thinks he will be able to renew most of them.
Should many of his major advertisers abandon The Post, the paper could quickly become unprofitable, and Mr. Kalikow has said that he will not operate it at a deficit.
Indeed, this summer he sought to protect his other holdings from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Now it is is doubtful that his creditors would allow him to use any of his remaining assets to shore up The Post.
Newsday, like all of the city's dailies, has cut costs in recent months, but Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman, said that New York Newsday is maintaining a presence in Westchester County, where it expanded during the strike.
Of all the city's Sunday papers, only the combined editions of Newsday has maintained advertising linage at roughly last year's level, largely because of gains in the Sunday edition of New York Newsday.

HEADLINE: The Ever-Changing Literary Past

BYLINE: By Morris Dickstein; Morris Dickstein teaches English at Queens College and the City University of New York Graduate Center.

 BODY:
One of the best contributions to the debate on the classics and the curriculum was written 40 years ago in Buenos Aires. Jorge Luis Borges's essay "Kafka and His Precursors" is a fable about how Kafka's work somehow influenced writers who preceded him. His point is that they begin to look Kafkaesque once we've read Kafka himself. Borges's choices are fanciful but his conclusion is not: "Each writer creates his precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future."
The critic Harold Bloom once cited Borges's partly tongue-in-cheek essay as a key to poetic influence, but we can see it as a parable of the ever-changing canon, our literary past, always being reoriented by new departures in contemporary culture. 
 The canon today is full of writers resurrected or transformed because powerful new writers made them accessible, as when T.S. Eliot invented John Donne, Allen Ginsberg opened up a different Walt Whitman and Alice Walker rediscovered Zora Neale Hurston. These changes were in tune with broad cultural movements -- modernism, the 60's counterculture, black feminism.
This historical pattern demolishes the misguided notion of a fixed and unchanging canon, just as it undermines any calculated affirmative action approach to literary reputations. Instead, we observe the shifting tides of critical judgment, influenced by what each period needs and what the best new writers are creating.
Such a literary view of the rise and fall of writers and reputations holds little appeal for strident ideologues on both sides of the canon controversy. They debate the issues entirely in political terms: who controls the reading list? Who gets into the widely adopted anthologies? How is this text deceiving and indoctrinating us? What institutional forces lie behind it? Our sense of writers and their work has been swamped by this struggle for cultural power.
Multiculturalism has a long history in America. Our literature has repeatedly been enriched by outsiders who became insiders -- regionalists like the Southern and Western writers, Jews with their European and immigrant baggage, blacks bearing the historical weight of slavery and migration, women whose experiences undercut cherished male myths. There are political dimensions to this struggle for recognition, but many see only the political dimensions.
Conservatives like William Bennett and Lynne Cheney, who decry a tide of illiteracy and political correctness eroding Western values, are matched by cultural radicals who arraign the classics for bolstering racial, sexual and economic oppression.
Each side is profoundly ideological; each needs the other to confirm its caricature of a monolithic canon freighted with a particular set of values that one camp upholds and the other condemns. Neither will allow for the unpredictability of individual works, which constantly open themselves to new interpretations; for the enormous variety of the canon itself, porous, shifting, many-faceted; for the surprising tolerance of the Western tradition, with its varieties of dissent and internal contradiction.
We're seeing something different from previous conflicts over multiculturalism in America. As each side jockeys for academic influence and public support, as they strain to delegitimize their antagonists, they threaten to discredit the whole process by which marginal groups have always entered the mainstream.
The pressure for change is inevitable, thanks to the broader student population in the universities, the new outlook of faculty trained in literary theory, the genuine strength of some rediscovered writers, and the real history of prejudice and exclusion that helped undermine the idea of a common culture. But changing the reading list and altering the textbooks will not in itself reshape the canon or rewrite literary history.
Affirmative action in cultural studies is well meaning but futile. Only the best new writers will make us want to read their neglected forebears, and only the most thoughtfully chosen works will overcome the obstacles to literacy today. And it will take critics and teachers with unusual gifts to help us learn to read them without discarding the best our tradition has to offer.

HEADLINE: For Skiers, Bargains if Not Snow

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
This is a great year for bargains in ski equipment. Since early August, ski shops around the nation have been holding sales with markdowns of up to 70 percent. It's not always clear that the equipment on sale is left over from the 1990-91 year, but that's not much of a drawback.
With changing technology in skis and boots, is last year's equipment as good as what is coming on the market this season? The answer is a qualified yes. "Every year skis are getting better," said Bill Tanler, a former editor of Ski Tech, a publication for ski-shop mechanics, as the artisans are called, "but the basic technology has been pretty well mastered, so there are not many dogs on the market anymore. 
 "The boots are good, too," he continued. "But 90 percent of finding a good boot is finding one that fits. Technological developments in bindings have plateaued in recent years, and the really dramatic reduction in the number of broken ankles and so forth proves their effectiveness."
The reason for the big discounts is that skiers weren't buying equipment last season. Snow droughts on both coasts discouraged skiing, the recession kept pocketbooks closed and people stayed home in front of their television sets watching the Gulf war. In addition, Japan, the fastest-growing ski market in the world, had poor snow. In Europe, where most of the ski equipment is manufactured, there was so little demand that most merchandise never left the warehouse.
"There is lots of inventory out there because both the ski retailers and the suppliers were left with equipment," said Glenn Heitsmith, editor of Ski Business, a trade publication. "At the same time, retailers didn't place tremendous orders for this year, so there won't be so much product-leftover next spring."
Taking advantage of the abundance of leftover 1991 equipment, many ski shop managers borrowed money to buy ski bindings and other items from manufacturers and suppliers as well as unsold merchandise from 76 ski shops around the country that went out of business at the end of last season. The biggest savings will be at promotional sales, but even after the sales, the shops will have bargains.
For 10 years Princeton Ski Shops, which has branches in Manhasset and Roslyn Heights, L.I., Elmsford, N.Y., and Clifton, N.J., has held a sale in Giants Stadium, in East Rutherford, N.J., that has attracted 50,000 people or more. This year, the sale will be held there Nov. 4 to Nov. 10.
"The only way to make money in this business is to take advantage of a bad situation," said Jack Meyers, the company's vice president. "This is the best and biggest inventory we've ever had. Skiers can get the best values in many years."
Prices at the stadium sale will be about 20 percent lower than the discounted prices in the stores, he said. K2 TRC skis, for example, which sold for $390 last season, will be $189 at the November sale, but $199 in the store afterward. Those who miss the sale will have another chance: Princeton's anniversary sale over the Thanksgiving weekend.
 
'Cheapest of the Year'
 Ski Barn, which has shops in Paramus, Little Falls and West Windsor, N.J., is holding a sale Nov. 22-24 at the Ski and Travel Show at the Meadowlands Convention Center in Secaucus, N.J.
"If you don't have to have the latest color and you can live with green instead of orange, you can get great deals," said Rob Lane, manager of the Little Falls store. "At the ski show, prices will be the cheapest of the year. New, 1990-91 stuff will be 10 to 60 percent off."
He added that last year's equipment would still be 30 to 40 percent off in the stores after the ski show, but there would be fewer selections.
Even this year's new ski equipment can usually be bought for less than the list price, particularly when it is packaged with two or three other items of equipment. With skis, boots and bindings, the discount could be 15 percent.
 
Alternating Sales
 The Exhibition Inc. ski shop in Mount Kisco, N.Y., plans alternating sales of skiing equipment that dates from this year to last November; boots one week, skis the next. "In this business, you almost never sell anything at list," said Michael Lowell, manager of the store. "The only place where we try to hold the price is on current-model boots because of the amount of fitting they need and our fitting guarantee that lasts for one year."
He said 1991 boots at 30 percent off the list price were a particularly good deal because prices on the 1992 lines were 7 to 10 percent higher. Some bindings are 30 percent higher, reflecting a tariff change as much as inflation and the decline of the dollar against European currencies; most bindings are manufactured in Europe. But, as with skis, ski bindings are usually marked down 10 to 15 percent.
Skis in the 1992 lines will be 7 to 10 percent higher than last year's comparable or identical models, with cosmetic changes. Mr. Lowell said the only skis hard to bargain down would be Monocoque-style skis -- the top of the ski is molded in one piece. But even Elan MBX skis, made that way, were $600 last season and are $550 this year
Most ski shop managers who were interviewed said that once the sales events were over this fall, prices would return to normal until late January or mid-February, when a new cycle of sales began.
"Of course, when the sales begin again depends on the snow," said Jeffrey Heanue, manager of the Pedigree Ski Shop in White Plains. "Last season, when there wasn't much snow, we started sales in mid-January."
 
 
 
IT'S NOT A SAVING IF THEY DON'T FIT
 Here is advice from experts about buying skiing equipment.
Be sure your skis and your boots match: no high-performance racing skis with recreational boots.
If the skis and boots are mismatched, decide which category of equipment you prefer.
Because comfort is critical, buying boots at shops that guarantee the fit may be worth the extra cost,particularly to those whose feet are difficult to fit.
Safety features of ski bindings have improved significantly in recent years. If a ski-shop mechanic declines to adjust or repair your bindings, simply replace them.
Don't expect special service or even knowledgeable personnel at many of the bigger sales. And two final things, perhaps most important:
Know what you want before you go.
And if a ski store doesn't offer a discount, ask for one.

BYLINE: By Francine Prose; Francine Prose's new novel, "Primitive People," will be published next spring.

 BODY:

THE TRENCH
Volume Two of the "Cities of Salt" Trilogy.
By Abdelrahman Munif.
Translated by Peter Theroux.
554 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $25.  
 Certain novels inspire in us the visceral shock of discovery that we most often associate with travel and with landscape, with rounding a bend and coming upon a panoramic, breathtaking vista, at once eerily familiar and terrifyingly strange. One such book is "The Trench," Abdelrahman Munif's powerful saga in which the forces of history, greed, obsession and Machiavellian intrigue turn a somnolent desert outpost into a rich, corrupt Persian Gulf state.
Set in the 1950's in the invented but apparently recognizable city of Mooran (originally published in Lebanon, the novel was banned in Saudi Arabia, and Mr. Munif was deprived of his Saudi citizenship), "The Trench" sits on that stormy front where past and present collide and unleash a damaging hail of temporal dislocation. Oil has been discovered under the Sultan's land, imported earth-moving equipment has razed the camel dealer's souk, and emissaries no longer bring gifts of frankincense and myrrh but of sneakers, Faber pens and lucrative armaments contracts.
"The Trench" is the second volume in a trilogy, "Cities of Salt," but can be read totally independently of the first. Its skilled translator, Peter Theroux, writes that the title connotes an abyss, "a hole one is likely to fall into," in particular an undersea geological formation. As the novel progresses, seismic social and economic changes open chasms so wide that Mr. Munif's characters are always scrambling to keep from tumbling in. Their fates suggest the convolutions of a Victorian novel transcribed into Arabic calligraphy, or perhaps "The Arabian Nights" as retold by Stendhal -- with Sinbad driving a white Rolls-Royce and the Grand Vizier jetting off to Atlanta for counterintelligence training.
What makes "The Trench" so fascinating and so tricky to describe is that its texture and narrative methods embrace so many seeming contradictions -- paradoxes that mirror perfectly the book's atmosphere and themes. The novel is simultaneously epic and domestic, sweeping and claustrophobic, traditional and timely, linear and digressive, serious and satiric. It's a lengthy, complicated book, crowded with incident and character, requiring and rewarding close, unflagging attention.
At its labyrinthine center is a demonically ambitious Syrian, Dr. Subhi Mahmilji, who arrives to treat the dying Sultan. He finds a desolate Mooran where "fathers inherited from their forefathers a simple view of life and death; and because they did not expect much of life or fear death during the years they spent on earth, toiling for a crust of bread . . . they did find ample time to contemplate their surroundings, and took delight in memorizing poetry, verses from the Koran and old folktales. On the long summer nights they found their spirits departing beyond life and death and their eyes wandering the heavens to locate the stars and planets or trying to read in the wind the signs of dust storms, locusts and catastrophes."
What the doctor reads in the wind are the signs of change. "Forgotten, remote, a non-place," Mooran is about to wake up and mine the oily fortune beneath it. Plotting, calculating, flattering his way into the new Sultan's favor, the doctor weaves a web of influence that will allow him to control Mooran's leap into the future. The novel follows the doctor's career as he conspires to place his allies and spies in strategic places, and to construct the machinery of modern government that will soon render the old tribal ways -- and the doctor himself -- obsolete.
Our immersion in the doctor's machinations is so total and so dreamlike that Mr. Munif must rouse us at intervals to witness how the various projects initiated by Mahmilji, his rivals and co-conspirators are affecting Mooran. As we watch, a cluster of mud huts becomes a city of air-conditioned palaces, monitored by a repressive, C.I.A.-sponsored secret service and a state-controlled press. Camels are replaced by luxury cars, narrow alleys by boulevards; all at once the ancient market is prime desert real estate. "People's circumstances had changed, and so had their looks: they were fatter."
Even so, the past maintains its grip, not only on the Mooranis but on the novel's structure, with its flourishes suggestive of traditional Arabic storytelling. Frequent moments of foreshadowing give this tale of techno-modernization a feeling of mythic inexorability. ("A Moroccan astrologer . . . had warned Khazael against one thing: moving into his father's palace, since that palace would be ill-omened for the present Sultan's successors.") The characters speak in folksy, epigrammatic proverbs that, in this translation, sound natural and colloquial. Mr. Theroux's work should serve as a model for translators; its lovely, effortless cadences support an impressive range of tones, from the lyrical and poetic to the gritty talk of the souk.
The constant friction between present and past so undermines our own sense of time that, near the novel's end, we are almost as shocked as Mahmilji himself when his son returns from America to announce that the doctor's notion of palace intrigue is now hopelessly out of date. Because of Mooran's oil wealth and regional importance -- two factors that the doctor has helped to exploit -- "fate was more likely to be decided outside of Mooran than within. 'All this business about the Chamber of Commerce, Father, or whether or not So-and-so and What's-his-name aren't getting along, is meaningless.' " In an ironic, chilling scene, an American diplomat offers political advice that by contrast makes all the doctor's scheming look touchingly modest and bumbling:
"Very calmly and patiently -- the opposite of the way the doctor spoke -- he explained to him that the new circumstances in Mooran had helped to create a climate of stability and contentment, which required just two methods, or at least one: incentive and force. Incentives for those who saw the status quo alone as being their business, since it affected their interests; force toward the others, dissidents, those who were never satisfied with anything."
The novel glitters with brilliant, refractory character portraits, most strikingly of its women: Widad Hayek, the doctor's voluptuous, Emma Bovary-like wife; Ummi Zahwa, the ancient witchlike Sheikha, who rules the palace by the sheer force of spooky fear; and the elderly Umm Hosny, the mother of two mega-businessmen and a businesswoman herself, who cannot live without the intimacy and excitement of selling to women, in their homes, henna, incense and cosmetics. Such fully complex and moving characters enrich and deepen Mr. Munif's narrative and, together with the elegance of the writing, make it something more profound than a political roman a clef.
Reading "The Trench" is like seeing carved shutters thrown open or an embroidered veil drawn back, and glimpsing behind it the face of someone very much like someone we know. The book deepens, enriches and above all humanizes whatever sense of Arab culture we may have garnered from the Middle East experts we see regularly on television, and from the recent spate of nonfiction books about the history of the region. As our media, during and after the gulf war, attempt to portray the Arab as the unknowable Other, as faceless as a disembodied muezzin's chant announcing our evening news, Mr. Munif's wonderful novel is a welcome corrective. One wishes that it were required (or at least suggested) reading for every American. We celebrate the bravery, scope and precision with which he shows us how his people are and aren't like us, and the role that our intelligence community has played in what they have become.
 

 
SHEEP IN THE PALACE
 There had been no more than twenty or thirty cars in the days of Sultan Khureybit, and most of those belonged to the palace; their mystique had faded now, like a toy with which a child gets quickly bored so that he ignores it in favor of another, then another, and now cars were piled up in Mooran like discarded toys, changed as often as socks. And then Mooran moved on from cars to the love of a new game: palaces. People suddenly discovered that the tents that had shaded them and the mud houses that had sheltered them were hateful and degrading. . . .
Instead of one palace they had two or three, instead of one story they had several, instead of wide windows there were glass panels from wall to wall, which, they said, made them feel still a part of the nature around them. As they once named their horses, they now gave their palaces unusual or even ridiculous names and titles. They raised animals, especially sheep, inside the palaces, and the sheep roamed to the windows and sliding glass doors to rub their snouts against the glass and butt it, to the hilarity of passersby. -- From "The Trench."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
Doctor, Doctor, Give Us the News

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN; Jan Hoffman writes about social issues and entertainment for The Village Voice, Mirabella and Premiere.

 BODY:
After four years of medical school and another three for internship and residency, a doctor chooses a subspecialty: cardiology. Dermatology. Ophthalmology. But broadcast journalism, Dr. Atkinson?
Indeed, a decade after receiving a master's degree from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, Dr. Holly Atkinson set up practice in a television studio. Last month the 38-year-old former internist, who is a vice president at Lifetime Medical Television, joined NBC's "Today" show as its new medical correspondent, replacing Dr. Art Ulene, who has moved to ABC's "Home" show. 
 That newscasts need medical stories is almost a given. Audience surveys repeatedly indicate that "medical stories top the list after news updates and weather," says Jack Reilly, executive producer of "Good Morning America," which retains two on-camera physicians, Dr. Tim Johnson and Dr. Nancy Snyderman. More than half the morning viewers are women, ages 18 to 49, which begins to explain the soaring success of the vivacious Dr. Snyderman, who has also become a regular substitute for the show's co-host, Joan Lunden.
Though precise numbers are difficult to come by, estimates suggest that more than 250 physicians around the country appear on radio and television, at least on a part-time basis. And doctors like Dean Edell and James (Red) Duke have their own syndicated shows broadcast on hundreds of stations around the country. A Gallup poll of 101 TV news directors last year found that they all rated doctors to be the most credible and qualified to deliver medical news.
But do doctors need newscasts? Given the social prestige of American physicians, why would any of them soil their white coats by associating with the glitzy parvenus of TV?
Answer No. 1: The Noble Sacrifice. "We don't represent the public-health establishment; we represent the patient," says Dr. Bob Arnot, the medical reporter for the morning and evening CBS network news shows. "Patients trust doctors less, and they're looking for an independent source of medical evidence. I do things for viewers I wouldn't have time to do for patients: I read more journals, go to more conferences, and talk to specialists in many areas." And, he maintains, earns a good deal less money than if he'd stayed in private practice; though salaries vary wildly both in medicine and television, he and others declined to be specific.
Answer No. 2: We Were Destined for Each Other. "Being a doctor is the closest thing to being God, so we have perfect training to be on television," pronounces Dr. Dean Edell, who can be seen on 88 TV stations and heard on 300 radio stations five times a week. "I must get five phone calls a month -- typical doctors: 'Tell me what to do so I can get in!' Pathologists who've had their heads in formaldehyde for 20 years now think they're going to be TV stars."
As for his own motives, the unapologetic Dr. Edell, a San Francisco-based former eye surgeon/antique-store owner/traveling bus resident/hippie in good standing, says bluntly that as a media physician he earns "a very healthy seven-figure income" -- even though, he hastens to note, "I would have done it all for nothing."
Doctors might be bad patients, but they can be even worse media stars. Says Don Fitzpatrick, who recruits television talent: "I've dealt with on-air talent for 20 years, and the worst are the TV doctors. They've got all this education and they throw it in your face: 'I save lives and I'm grand!' You put that ego on TV, and you're magnifying it 400 times."
Though privately physicians may sniff that TV doctors aren't "real doctors," publicly the American Medical Association has aided and abetted them. For more than a decade, the A.M.A. has sponsored an annual Health Reporting Conference, a sort of three-day J-School 101 providing 150 star-struck doctors with seminars such as "Getting Started on Cable," "Advanced Interviewing," "Sharpening Your On-Air Image" and "How to Get on a Talk Show." And in 1983, a support organization formed, calling itself the National Association of Physician Broadcasters, which now claims some 250 members.
The doctors' notions of what topics they should cover varies. At one end of the spectrum is the ersatz family doctor, who provides gentle, clucking reminders about seasonal health hazards. That character is exuberantly exemplified by Dr. Red Duke, the popular cowboy-style physician and Willie Nelson buddy who's syndicated throughout the Southwest. He'll conclude a summertime admonition against sun exposure and skin cancer, for example, with, "If melanoma doesn't scare you, remember: sunshine causes wrinkles and" -- he doffs a 10-gallon hat and sunglasses, as the camera zooms in on his road-map features -- "you could end up looking like me."
Others differ less in approach than subject matter. Dr. Tim Johnson of ABC, a Harvard medical lecturer and associate minister, is especially adept at translating and evaluating the latest studies from the medical journals. Dr. Atkinson of the "Today" show, who has a background in public health, says she plans to cover mental health, as well as the "economic, human and political aspects of medicine, such as preventive care." Dr. Arnot at CBS, who is probably best known for research in sports medicine, has been rigorous in his coverage of international medical practices, having filed stories from 22 countries in the last 18 months.
But do they see themselves as physicians, reporters, or some curious, contradictory hybrid? "There's a tug of war between the roles," concedes Dr. Art Ulene, a former gynecologist who was with NBC for 15 years and is now ensconced at ABC's "Home" show. "I tend toward the doctor's role. As a physician on television, it is not inappropriate for me to give medical advice and talk about why I lean one way or the other on a medical issue. Reporters, who are supposed to be objective, can't."
Maintains Dr. Arnot: "I don't give advice. That's a trick of TV. I'm not setting myself up as better than your doctor -- I can't customize information enough to be responsible. So I try to give source lists and leave it up to the individual to pursue."
Dr. Edell not only files stories for the local San Francisco station KGO, but also dispenses opinions to callers on his regular radio and television shows. "I have no peers, and no hospital insurance. But I do my homework -- I read 80 journals a week. I let people ask me whatever they want" -- a typical broadcast may include inquiries ranging from AIDS to acne to narcolepsy -- "and I make a living because other doctors don't explain enough to their patients. I advise people to give their doctors hell.
"Am I practicing medicine on the air? Insurance companies don't know what to do with us."
Others are unabashedly doctrinaire.
"I'm a reporter," says Dr. Atkinson, the only one of the national pack with a master's degree in journalism.
"I'm a surgeon," retorts Dr. Snyderman without hesitation, the only national medical reporter to keep her day job. In addition to her responsibilities at "Good Morning America," Dr. Snyderman, a single mother of two young daughters and a full-time medical correspondent for San Francisco's KPIX, also has a practice as a head and neck cancer surgeon.
Last year, as she was preparing for the 5 P.M. broadcast, she got a call around 4:15 that a patient needed an emergency tracheotomy. "I caught myself thinking, is there anyone else around to do the operation?" and was immediately appalled at herself. "I left the station hanging with a big chunk of the newscast empty," she says. "But the news went on without me, so la-di-da."
The two professions of medicine and journalism, each fraught with ethical conundrums, can pose challenges when put to tandem use. Doctors are supposed to be hands-on; journalists are supposed to be hands-off. Using his journalist's credentials, Dr. Arnot managed to get into Kuwait City during the Persian Gulf crisis, where he canvassed hospital supplies and medical staffs, and then called Americares, an emergency relief organization. After he arrived with a CBS crew in Kurdistan, he filed some pieces, and then, after the cameras left, he stayed to treat patients. "I've probably broken rules and crossed lines," he says.
Dr. Atkinson points out that a doctor's commitment to confidentiality vies with the reporter's need to tell the big story; she tends to err on the side of caution if she thinks an interviewee has confided in her because she's a doctor. Nor does she belong to the A.M.A., in observance of the journalist's credo not to be affiliated with special-interest groups in one's area of reporting. Dr. Bob Lanier, a doctor and syndicated medical reporter for KXAS in Fort Worth, believes that medical journalists haven't been held up to enough professional scrutiny. The National Association of Physician Broadcasters, he notes, has a working relationship with the A.M.A. This summer he started the Academy of Radio and Television Health Communicators to work up a code of ethics.
"Doctors have the capacity to really violate ethics that journalists can't," he cautions. He offers a hypothetical situation: a prominent politician is hospitalized, nature of illness undisclosed. "As physicians, we can just pluck those medical charts and read them. As journalists, we can't. What should we do?"
Most part-time medical correspondents do maintain a practice. Most of the full-time physician-reporters think that's a bad idea. "How can you be responsible to your patients when suddenly you have to go to Iraq for two weeks?" wonders Dr. Arnot. Moreover, the on-air appearances "amount to a three-minute commercial for Dr. Phil," says Don Fitzpatrick, the recruiter. Lately, however, cost-conscious stations have begun to scale back their use of high-priced physicians, who in turn must rely more heavily on their practice for income.
But isn't having a practice why you went to medical school in the first place? So when are you going to settle down and buy some nice malpractice insurance? Dr. Arnot shakes his head, laughing, and shrugs his shoulders. "I never envisioned myself as having a little family practice at the foot of the street. My family did. They still do."
Booms Dr. Edell: "Are you kidding? My mom loves it -- I'm 'My Son the Doctor-TV Star!' "

HEADLINE: Blacks on TV: Scrambled Signals

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
When the name Malcolm X begins popping up, however casually, in prime-time entertainment, viewers are getting a signal that television may be gearing up to portray black Americans in their true diversity, their aspirations and their occasional rage. Blacks can no longer be kept in their standard electronic ghettos.
A couple of weeks ago, Judge Clarence Thomas and Prof. Anita F. Hill appeared live before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into sexual-harassment charges, and the ratings knocked baseball playoffs and lavish mini-series for a loop. Purely in terms of the medium itself, here was powerfully significant television, its "stars" accomplished black professionals who were clearly an integral part of the American mainstream. 
 But these are precisely the black people neglected on much of television entertainment. Prime time too often relegates them to scattered token roles (a judge and a litigator on "L.A. Law" or an assistant D.A. on "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill") or the clownish context of a sitcom ("Family Matters" or "True Colors"). Without the calculated efforts of a Bill Cosby, the black middle class would be virtually invisible on the home screen. Although its beginnings can be glimpsed on such new series as "I'll Fly Away" and "Homefront," both are set safely in the past.
At the other end of the economic scale, of course, encompassing the majority of black citizens, today's struggling poor are also just about ignored on prime time. For too many viewers, blacks are still simply the people who get busted the most on all those police "reality" shows. The diversity of the black community, the social and political ferment within that community, is reflected only occasionally. Both white and black viewers end up shortchanged.
One thing painfully clear about this season's new and returning shows is the almost complete absence of a sense of profound discontent in depictions of black life on prime time. Although sitcoms still wouldn't dream of an unhappy ending, polls show that a good many black people are fed up with the drugs and crime that constantly dim their lives. Many do not dismiss conspiracy theories that most whites would deem outlandish. Abrasive spokesmen like the Rev. Al Sharpton or Prof. Leonard Jeffries may be excoriated by both the white establishment and many blacks, but they continue to draw followers in portions of the black community. Rap singers uninhibitedly indict white society and are applauded by young audiences everywhere.
Significant in all this is the renewed prominence of Malcolm X, especially for black youth. Expounding on what he called "the castration of the black man," Malcolm prompted an incensed Mike Wallace in a 1959 telecast to warn America of his "gospel of hate that would set off a Federal investigation if it were said by Southern whites." Today, several young black film makers are gaining deserved prominence with their provocative explorations of the black experience, among them Spike Lee, who is making a major movie about Malcolm X.
The merest glimmers of these developments are allowed to penetrate the electronic curtain of television entertainment, controlled almost entirely by white males. And when those glimmers do appear, they are carefully softened around the edges. In "The Royal Family" (a new CBS series now in limbo because of the recent death of its star, Redd Foxx), a young Muslim character was brought into one episode only to be dismissed for his apparently silly unwillingness to appreciate good old down-home pork chops.
Fox's "True Colors," constructed around the racially mixed marriage of previously divorced parties, a white woman with a daughter and a black man with two sons, was considerably more provocative in a recent installment. The younger son, Lester (Adam Jeffries), feeling neglected by the family, suddenly withdrew to read "The Autobiography of Malcolm X."
In no time at all, Lester was bad-mouthing racially mixed marriages, calling his brother a clown in blackface and his sister a bleeding-heart liberal. But also in no time at all, Lester realized the error of his ways, especially after missing his own birthday party. Cake and ice cream, evidently, beat Malcolm X any day -- on a television sitcom.
There is only one new series this season in which the American black experience is given a unusually sobering dose of reality. Revealingly enough, though, NBC's "I'll Fly Away" is set in the late 1950's. Television is nearly always uncomfortable with harsh realities unless they are snuggled unthreateningly in the past. In any event, "I'll Fly Away" -- the title comes from a traditional spiritual -- is constructed around the beginnings of the civil-rights movement, viewed through the eyes of two families.
One is headed by white Forrest Bedford (Sam Waterston), local district attorney for a small Southern town; the other by black Lilly Harper (Regina Taylor), who works weekdays as the Bedford housekeeper. Lilly knows all about the Bedfords, tending to Forrest and his three children day after day in their comfortable home. They know little about Lilly, however, or her 6-year-old daughter living in the rundown "colored" section of town.
The series' intention is for the Bedfords to get to know more about the soft-spoken but forthright Lilly, to understand her as something more than an efficient employee. Small details can be perfect, as when Lilly's daughter mistakenly assumes that a cowboy hat belonging to the youngest Bedford boy is for her. Lilly's anguish, when she has to take the hat away, is painful. Developed by Joshua Brand and John Falsey ("St. Elsewhere," "Northern Exposure") "I'll Fly Away," is beautifully acted, ambitious and intelligent, and therefore something of a rarity this season.
There's also a black family on the new ABC drama, "Homefront," which goes all the way back to the 1940's, just after World War II. But this show, created by David Jacobs ("Knots Landing"), has wasted no time in getting down to traditional soap-opera shenanigans. Only a few weeks into the series, bed sheets are rumpled all over this fictional town. Race relations seem to unfold in a never-never land in which the local factory boss, a bigot and union-basher, plots privately with his black chauffeur as to how to best handle their touchy wives. Yeah, sure, Mr. Jacobs.
Nevertheless, television has come a long way from 1968 when NBC's "Julia" with Diahann Carroll could be considered a ground-breaker for having a black heroine who wasn't a domestic. The entertainment schedules these days feature black performers in a wide range of formats (newscasts, on the other hand, local and national, continue to be curiously inhospitable to black men as anchors). Have television executives grown more enlightened? Perhaps. But a more telling explanation can be found in bottom-line profit considerations, never far from a broadcaster's heart.
The fact is that, while the overall audience figures for networks have been steadily declining, black households -- accounting for 12 percent of the national pie -- have assumed major importance in the totals. A recent report from Nielsen Media Research, pegged to the November 1990 period, found that black households across the country watched just under 70 hours of television during the average week, some 48 percent more than "all other" households.
In one important subcategory, blacks age 2 to 17, watched a staggering 64 percent more than all others in that age range. The most popular shows in the black households: "A Different World," produced by Mr. Cosby; "The Cosby Show," and "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" -- all black-oriented and, as it happens, on NBC.
The report provides blacks with considerably increased clout to demand more and better programming having relevance to themselves. Since so many black youngsters are watching -- pressures on broadcasters for more socially responsible content, venturing more frequently outside the standard circle of criminals, athletes and entertainers, is likely to get more intense. For the moment, many of the plusses racked up in recent years for black audiences continue to be offset by lingering minuses, most of them stubbornly rooted in stereotyping.
On the sitcom front, for instance, a large step forward is being taken by Fox's new series "Roc," in which the title character is a Baltimore gar bageman with a gruff geniality as big as all outdoors. In most respects, the format is standard stuff, with one manufactured problem a week neatly resolved before the final credits. But "Roc" also has one of the best casts currently on weekly television, with Charles S. Dutton heading a repertory company recruited almost intact from the Broadway production of August Wilson's "Piano Lesson." Mr. Dutton's Roc can suddenly veer from broad comedy into a moving monologue about being a worker with sometimes impossible dreams.
At the other end of the spectrum is ABC's "Family Matters," another show about a workingman and his family. This one, though, has been taken over most weeks by the super-nerdy character of Urkel (Jameel White), a teen-age neighbor whose broadly caricatured antics uneasily smack of a modern Stepin' Fetchit in the making. "Family Matters" is sitcom business as usual, pouncing on every cliched teen-age crisis in the how-to-write-a-script book.
But some other seemingly ordinary shows can, at least occasionally, glance briefly in the direction of potentially controversial subjects, some more so than others. Time does change attitudes. Interracial marriages and affairs, for instance, used to be considered incendiary topics. Now "True Colors" and other black sitcoms are exploring it, and from a black point of view.
A recent episode of "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" began with fussy preparations for the wedding of Aunt Janice only for her black family to discover, just in time to use the cast's hanging jaws and a shrieking audience for a segue into the commercial break, that her boyfriend was white. The bride's sister minced no words: "Don't you have enough problems being an African-American woman?" adding pointedly, "Honey, I don't make the rules, but I know how to play the game."
The riskiest example was "Roc," in which Dad's kid brother showed up with the happy news that he was finally getting married and then his intended turned out to be a white man. This series clearly decided to play Double Jeopardy. Interracial marriages may be more acceptable these days, reaching into circles of prominence that include Judge Thomas and his wife. But being gay can still trigger howls of objection -- not least in the black community, as Marlon T. Riggs's angrily insightful documentary "Tongues Untied" illustrated on public television earlier this year.
So, there are more blacks employed on television these days. But why do so many of the sitcom fathers ("Family Matters," "Fresh Prince") have to be overweight and jolly when the dads in white situations can be played by ladies' men types like Patrick Duffy (ABC's "Step by Step") or Alan Thicke (ABC's "Growing Pains")?
And why do so many of the black young people have to appear so dimwitted or ridiculous, a phenomenon that extends well past the oddball Urkel to, for instance, the two brothers in "True Colors"? Clowning around is one thing, but these fellows, played by appealing actors, are sometimes made to seem positively retarded. Their white sister, though, is clearly no fool.
Images, images. Television researchers presumably have their reasons. The extraordinary attention paid to the Thomas-Hill hearings indicates that they should now get set to freshen up their tired repertory.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Collectors Read the Bottom Lines of Vintage Comic Books

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Comic books as collectibles went WHOOM!!! this month. Two books were published surveying 50 years of the genre as pop culture, and Sotheby's in New York announced that on Dec. 18 it would hold the first sale at an international art auction house featuring only comic books.
Both survey books are selling extremely well. The initial printing of "From Aargh! to Zap!: Harvey Kurtzman's Visual History of the Comics," Simon & Schuster's $25 paperback, is already sold out. And "Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics," by Les Daniels, is, at $45, the top seller this fall for Harry N. Abrams. About 100,000 copies are in print at this publisher, where a printing of 5,000 for art and coffee-table books is considered large. 
 "It's one of the biggest and fastest sales for a book of that price we've ever had," said Paul Gottlieb, Abrams's president and publisher. "One of the reasons for the resurgence of interest in comic books must be that it's an escapist medium. Right now, people are seeking just that."
Mr. Daniels agrees. "Nostalgia is what starts most collectors pursuing old comic books," he said. "The fantasy element and wish-fulfillment work like magic. I bought the comic books I had read as a boy in old magazine stores in Providence when I was at Brown in the 1960's. What I looked for then was the horror comics -- 'Tales From the Crypt' and that sort of thing."
For many people, one outrageous picture may summon up powerful feelings from their childhood. "For me, no image could ever replace that cover showing the superhero with a cape, holding aloft a black car," said Alexander Acevedo, a Madison Avenue art dealer who has handled some comic books since the early 1970's. "He's the Atlas of the 20th century."
When Superman made his debut on the cover of Action Comics No. 1 in June 1938, the Golden Age of comic books began. That era, and the 1960's Silver Age of the newer flawed and self-doubting superheroes, including Spider-Man, are well documented in Mr. Daniels's book and in the catalogue ($35) of Sotheby's forthcoming sale. Superman's popularity among collectors makes Action 1 -- a 10-cent purchase in 1938 -- the costliest comic book in the auction: The presale estimate is $28,000 to $38,000.
Most superheroes -- including Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, Flash and the Hulk -- are represented among the 350 vintage comic books and original artist's illustrations to be auctioned. Also up for sale are Detective No. 27 from 1939, which introduced Batman; the estimate is $24,000 to $28,000. A copy of the first Amazing Spider-Man from 1963, in near-mint condition, is expected to bring up to $9,000. Sotheby's, which is printing 8,000 copies of its catalogue, expects that the sale will total up to $2 million.
In his book, Mr. Daniels explains how the company now called the Marvel Entertainment Group was founded in 1932 as Western Fiction Publishing producing pulp magazines. Marvel Comics was added in 1939. "The comic book as we know it today," he explained in an interview, "is a hybrid of two late-19th-century forms -- the newspaper comic strip and the pulp magazine. In the late 20's, comic strips adapted some of this matter, and in the late 1930's, pulp fiction was adapted into comic books with the creation of their first superheroes."
Among the early 30's material in Sotheby's auction is a rare copy of the first comic book, "Funnies on Parade," a 1932 reprint of newspaper comic strips that is estimated to sell for $3,000 to $4,000.
Jerry Weist, a consultant to Sotheby's on the comic-book sale, is an owner of Boston's oldest comic-book store, the Million Year Picnic. According to him, collecting in the 1980's increased the prices for the rarest and most popular comic books.
"When we opened our store in 1974, an average copy of Action 1 would have gone for about $400," he said. "Today a good copy is $6,000 to $7,000, and one in near mint condition is $55,000 and up. No mint copy of Action 1 has been found."
At Sparkle City Comics, a mail-order concern in Glassboro, N.J., Joseph H. Vereneault, one of the owners, said sales of comic books dating from 1938 to 1975 are holding firm, even in the recession. "Oddly enough, at least at our end of the market, there has been no decline," he said. "In fact, there's been enormous increase." The biggest growth, he added, is to collectors overseas, primarily in Europe. This year the company anticipates sales of $500,000, up from $3,500 in 1976 when it first opened its doors.
"There are hundreds of comic-book shows all over the country each weekend," Mr. Vereneault pointed out. "Some comic books sell between $1,000 and $5,000. Others may be as high as $50,000. But comic books are still a collectible for the masses -- there are thousands and thousands of vintage ones to be had at 12 cents a copy."

HEADLINE: Home Buyers Holding Off Despite Low Interest Rates

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
DESPITE a steep decline in interest rates that has brought fixed 30-year mortgage loans to below 9 percent for the first time since 1977, home buyers are holding back across most of the nation in what experts say are stubborn fears that job cuts and other recessionary pressures will persist.
One area of relative strength, according to several studies, is the Northeast, including New York and its suburbs, which were hit first and hardest by the current housing slump, beginning in 1988. Home resales in the region increased suddenly in the spring and have continued since, although prices have continued to weaken. 
 Elsewhere in the nation, home sales have declined steadily at the very time that interest rates have dropped most sharply.
"Lower interest rates help, but the real problem now is consumer confidence," said Gopal Ahluwalia, research director for the National Association of Home Builders, a Washington trade group.
Home resales, which rose in March, April and May in what analysts described as a burst of optimistic buying after the Persian Gulf war, have fallen each month since then. The decline, amounting to a 10 percent reduction in monthly sales from June to August, the most recent month for which data are available, came while mortgage interest rates were falling a steep 0.4 of a percentage point.
New construction, as measured by the number of housing starts, has plummeted to its lowest level since 1982, when rates soared past 17.5 percent. For all of 1991, construction is likely to be at its lowest since 1945, Mr. Ahluwalia said.
To be sure, the lower rates are influencing the decisions of many home buyers. The strongest segment of the market, particularly in the Northeast, is in homes within reach of low-end, first-time buyers, who are taking advantage of low rates and steeply discounted prices.
But overall, the enthusiasm that infused the housing market during the spring has cooled, and those who had hoped reduced interest rates would reignite it have so far been disappointed.
So, too, have a large number of economists and business executives who hoped a rebounding housing market would emerge as a key engine driving the nation out of recession.
Now, they say, other segments of the economy are proving too weak to support improved demand for homes.
"The main thing people are worried about is the broad outlook for the economy, and they are not willing to commit themselves to the most important investment they will ever make," said Thomas Halloway, senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
Analysts say that demand for housing continues to build, even as many would-be buyers remain firmly on the sidelines. In one study, the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University found that only 36 percent of Americans 25 to 29 years old, and 51 percent of those 30 to 34 years old, owned homes.
Those rates of homeownership among people in the prime years of marriage and childbirth are far lower than a decade ago. They account for the relatively high current demand among first-time buyers and suggest that many more are poised to buy when the economy or their personal finances improve.
Other constraints may be at work. One is the more stringent lending requirements imposed by banks and thrift institutions since the savings-and-loan crisis began to unfold.
Where home buyers of the late 1980's were often able to get 90 percent financing with little documentation of their incomes, lenders now typically will not finance more than 80 percent of a home purchase. They also adhere more strictly to rules that limit mortgage payments to 28 percent of a buyer's gross monthly income and require voluminous documentation of employment histories, tax returns and assets.
"The only people who get a loan are those who can prove they don't need it," said Monte Helm, a spokesman for the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation, paraphrasing a line made famous by Will Rogers during the Depression of the 1930's.
Yet another drag on the housing market is reflected in a time-tested rule of buyer psychology. While interest rates are heading down, the rule goes, people wait, but at the first signs that rates have bottomed out and are beginning to rebound, they flock into the market.
"USUALLY the market bursts open just at the point when rates begin to trend up," said John Tucillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.
He predicted that rates would continue declining gradually until next spring, when they will reach 8.5 percent on 30-year fixed mortgages, and housing demand would then rebound.
But until then, he said, the market across most of the nation remains mired in recessionary worries.
The relatively strong demand among first-time buyers in the Northeast is reflected in a study by Century 21, which franchises real estate agencies across the nation from its headquarters in Irvine, Calif.
It found that 52 percent of the 1990 home sales in six Northeastern states -- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- were made to first-time buyers.
Nationally, it said, first-time buyers accounted for only 38 percent of the purchases, roughly the same as during the previous six years.
Although no comparable analysis is available for 1991, real estate executives say that first-time buyers have continued to lead what they call the early stages of a broad recovery in home sales in the Northeast.
"The decline in rates made all the difference to me," said one first-time buyer, Marsha Champlin, a toy designer in Brooklyn who last month contracted to buy a three-story, two-family, 19th-century Federal style house in Park Slope for $210,000. The price was less than half the $460,000 originally asked in 1988, and 30 percent below the $299,000 that was asked when she first looked at the house in May.
Despite the huge price decline, however, she said, she could not have afforded the house without qualifying for a loan at below 9 percent interest.
Mortgage rates across the nation began falling rapidly a year ago, when they averaged 10.18 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. After fluctuating during the first half of 1991, they stood at 9.62 percent in June, and had fallen to 9.01 by September.
Rates have continued declining in recent weeks, falling below 9 percent across the nation. Analysts say they expect continued declines until at least next spring, with fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages falling to 8.5 percent or perhaps lower.
Already, after steep declines in September and the first two weeks of October, the rate in the New York area is approaching 8.5 percent.
According to one mortgage broker in New York City and its suburbs, the Manhattan Mortgage Company, which compared rates at 10 of the region's lending institutions, fixed 30-year mortgages are now available at as low at 8.62 percent interest for one-family homes and condominiums and 8.87 percent for co-op apartments.
A decline of only one percentage point in interest rates can make a large difference in a homeowner's costs.
For example, Manhattan Mortgage said monthly payments for $100,000 in financing at its best current rate of 8.62 percent would be $777.79. In contrast, it said, its best rate as recently as August was a point higher, 9.62 percent. At that rate, monthly costs on $100,000 in financing were more than $70 higher, $849.99.
The combination of lower rates and deep reductions in home prices -- they are down 20 percent to more than 40 percent across the region -- mean that homeownership "is the most affordable it has been in years," said Ellen Feldschriber, a partner in Manhattan Mortgage.
The improvement is documented in an affordability index, which is calculated by the National Association of Realtors. With a median income of $36,533 in August -- and a median house price of $144,400 -- it said that people making the median income in the Northeast had an index reading of 93.5, or 93.5 percent of what was needed to buy a median-price house.
THAT meant the region remained more expensive than the country as a whole, where the August affordability index was 112.5. But while the nationwide index had declined since February, it had continued a period of rapid improvement in the Northeast. In August 1989, the Northeast index was at 68.9, the group said.
Analysts say the rapid gain in affordability accounts for the relative strength of home sales in the Northeast and should invigorate sales further as more first-time buyers come into the market and more people who sell their current homes move on to others.
In Connecticut, brokers report a rapid increase in sales volume since August but say the rise was largely among first-time, low-end buyers.
One large real estate concern, the William Pitt Agency, based in Stamford, said that in the first two weeks in October its Danbury office had 18 sales contracts signed, only one of them for a house priced over $145,000, and its office in Norwalk sold 26 homes, more than half to first-time buyers.
The Westchester County Board of Realtors said last week that its sales in the third quarter of 1991 had been higher -- both in the number of sales and the total dollar volume -- than in any quarter since it started keeping records in 1981.
The group said the largest number of sales were among homes priced between $200,000 and $300,000, which in most of Westchester's affluent suburban communities are at the low end of the price spectrum.
DESPITE the strong sales, however, recessionary worries have not bypassed Westchester.
"I'm seeing many buyers with one eye on the real estate market and another eye on their job security," said Merritt Mitchell, president of the Westchester Multiple Listing Service.
"We'll need broad economic recovery here to nail down the recent gains in residential real estate activity."
In another study of home sales in New York and New Jersey, Rae Rosen, an economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, found that resales, which had been declining steadily in both states from the end of 1987 to the end of 1990, have since begun a rapid rebound, particularly in New Jersey.
New Jersey sales, which last year reached their lowest point since 1982, have come back to their 1985 level, she said. In New York, where the decline was less steep, the recovery has been more gradual, she added.
Overall, "there is certainly no dearth of home sales" in the two states, she said. "Although national housing starts and existing home sales are anemic, the regional housing recovery has been comparatively robust."
Whether demand continues to strengthen in the region, and the recovery expands to the rest of the nation, now depends more on improvement in other sectors of the economy than on whether interest rates remain low or fall further.
"In previous periods when interest rate declines have prompted housing recoveries, other fundamentals in the economy were improving as well," said Mr. Halloway of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"Now the key issue is that we have a lack of strong economic growth, and if consumers are worried about their jobs they will not buy homes."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Nonprofit Tenants;
Wall Street Tower as a Site for a Service Association

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
MAYOR David N. Dinkins made it plain to his economic development team that this was to be a priority. Happily for them, Larry A. Silverstein offered up to 400,000 square feet in a Wall Street building with East River views, pledging a year's free rent, among other concessions.
One might think they were focused on some huge financial institution. Instead, they were trying to create a home for relatively small tenants, each of whom might need only 10,000 to 20,000 square feet: the nonprofit charitable organizations or trade associations that can no longer afford Manhattan. 
 Nonprofit tenants are big news these days. "They are very active," said Douglas Durst, whose family owns 733 Third Avenue, at 46th Street, one-fifth of which is now occupied by nonprofit tenants. "They are less affected, in terms of space needs, by the current economy. So while you see many businesses afraid to make a commitment, nonprofits don't have the same concerns."
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recently signed a 15-year lease for 37,133 square feet at No. 733, where it will have its headquarters. Mr. Durst said the rent would be in the mid-$20's. The society is leaving the Durst Organization's 205 East 42d Street.
"We did look into the boroughs and we did investigate all the areas of Manhattan," said Mitchell S. Steir, senior managing director of Julien J. Studley, which represented the society. "What we were ultimately able to achieve was a competitive transaction in midtown, which was the location of choice."
The society is to move into No. 733 by the end of the year. It will be joined a month or so later by the American Foundation for AIDS Research (Amfar), now at 1515 Broadway, which has signed a 10-year lease for 16,000 square feet, in the mid-$20's. The Leukemia Society, which has been in the building since 1984, has 15,000 square feet.
In another recent development, Newmark & Company Real Estate announced that 305 Seventh Avenue, a 20-story building on 27th Street that is about 40 percent vacant, would be converted into 45 commercial condominium units, specifically targeting nonprofit purchasers. (Property that is owned and occupied by certain charitable organizations is not subject to real-estate taxes.)
And an all-day conference, "Nonprofits and Real Estate Opportunities," is to be convened Nov. 22 at the New School for Social Research, 6 West 12th Street, under the sponsorship of Studley and the city.
The biggest milestone this year was the announcement two weeks ago that 20 floors of Mr. Silverstein's 34-story tower at 120 Wall Street were to be set aside as an Association Center, for use as headquarters by national and international nonprofit groups that could easily leave New York. Prospective occupants will have the choice of renting space, at less than $20 a square foot, or buying it, for roughly $120 a square foot. Nominal title to Association Center space will be held by the city's Industrial Development Agency, which will remove it from property tax rolls and also allow for the use of bonds issued by the agency to finance tenant improvements.
City officials realized how urgent the situation had become when they almost lost the headquarters of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. earlier this year. "The Girl Scouts were really a watershed because we learned how much caring about nonprofits mattered," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The Dinkins administration requested proposals from commercial owners in lower Manhattan who had up to 400,000 square feet available for an Association Center.
"We had a preference for downtown," Mr. Weisbrod said, "because we felt that the price would be better and we thought that the injection of a nonprofit community would add to the marketability of downtown generally, which is under severe economic pressure."
RESPONSES came from the owners of 13 buildings. Ten were south of Fulton Street, two were between Fulton and Canal Streets and one was around Cooper Square. Because of the implication that these buildings are in distress, city officials declined to identify them.
Mr. Silverstein's offer had a "combination of strengths," Mr. Weisbrod said. "It was very flexible about selling or leasing. It had the most attractive price to tenants. It had a central core and only one row of columns between windows and the core. The building was in very, very good condition. It had the best shared-facilities plan. It had a great location and great views."
The building was completed in 1930 to designs by Buchman & Kahn. Mr. Silverstein purchased it in 1980 for a price that was reported as $12 million, then spent what he said were "tens of millions" on its renovation. In the mid to late 80's, vacancy in the 615,000-square-foot structure was less than 5 percent. Today, it is approaching 40 percent.
An attempt to discuss the fate of 120 Wall Street in the context of Mr. Silverstein's fortunes generally was rebuffed when the developer declined to be interviewed. He did, however, respond to written questions submitted through Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, a public-relations firm.
Concerning a number of the biggest projects in which he has an interest -- none of which he has lost or intends to sell, he said -- Mr. Silverstein reported the following:
At Park Avenue Court, Lexington Avenue and 87th Street, "approximately half" of the 222 apartments have been sold. At A & S Plaza, on Broadway, between 32d and 33d Streets, "better than 75 percent" of the retail space has been leased. In the Childrenswear Center atop A & S Plaza, "approximately two-thirds" of the showroom and office space has been leased. At Seven World Trade Center, about 80 percent of the office space has been leased. Among his older properties, the enormous Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, is about 75 percent leased.
About the financial status of 120 Wall Street, Mr. Silverstein said operating expenses were about $6 a square foot and taxes about $5. He said he is current in his mortgage payments to Bankers Trust, but did not disclose the amount, and added that the bank had approved the Association Center plan.
As part of the Association Center announcement Oct. 16, Mayor Dinkins was quoted in a press release as saying that "no other city has set up this kind of facility to foster" the nonprofit industry.
The administrative director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, Stephen B. Borko, took exception to that. "The Mayor of New York should know that his city is not the first or only to work with nonprofits," he said. "The city of Washington started working on this in 1986."
At the time, the council was facing rents on I Street that it could not afford. Instead of leasing new space, however, it formed a partnership with the International City/ County Management Association and the I.C.M.A. Retirement Corporation.
From Washington's Redevelopment Land Agency, they purchased a site on North Capitol Street, between H Street and G Place, near Union Station, which was then under reconstruction. The $1 million price was about 75 percent of appraised value. The partners also received a 10-year abatement of property taxes from the City Council.
The first phase was a nine-story structure with 212,000 square feet, developed by Quadrangle Development Corporation. Construction was financed with a $31.35 million loan from the First American Bank.
It opened last year and is now fully rented, he said. A second phase is being developed in partnership with the American Psychological Association, Mr. Borko said, and has already signed up the National Association of Social Workers as a tenant.
"The city validated an entire area it wanted to get built up," Mr. Borko said. "Associations that wanted to move to the suburbs are not moving to the suburbs. It's one of those rare instances where everybody won."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Planner in Jamaica;
Carrying the Torch for Downtown Growth

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
WITH a few swift pen strokes on a paper napkin at Wendy's on Jamaica Avenue in Queens last week, Carlisle Towery demonstrated how competing retailing hubs have carved up downtown Jamaica's historic trading region.
First came the Roosevelt Field and Green Acres malls in Nassau County (two big circles representing trading areas, menacingly encompassing sections of eastern Queens). Then Kings Plaza in Brooklyn (encircling eastern Brooklyn, with a partial incursion into Queens). Finally, Queens Center in Rego Park (another circle, lopping off much of northern Queens). 
 The malls did in Jamaica as a regional retailing center, says Mr. Towery, a planner who is observing his 20th year as executive director of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation this year. But Jamaica has fought back.
Mainly it has primed the pump for economic revival with public investment. The biggest elements were a new campus for York College of the City University system, which opened in 1986; the long-delayed subway extension to Jamaica's downtown, now named Jamaica Center, which opened in 1989, and a new million-square-foot office building for the Social Security Administration's regional headquarters. It too opened in 1989.
"We have reached the point in the early 90's where a lot of little things and big things have been done," said Mr. Towery with the barest trace of an Alabama drawl. "That has primed the pump. We have reached the level that really can attract development."
Jamaica has the sites. It is a Long Island Rail Road hub. The subway now runs directly into its vital center. It has devoted boosters in government and the private world.
It also has Carlisle Towery. In New York City, no other professional architect-planner comes to mind who has devoted so many years to the revival of a single community, trying to fulfill a master-plan vision that the Regional Plan Association set forth in the late 60's. As a Regional Plan staff member Mr. Towery was project director of the Jamaica Center development plan. The Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, founded by local business leaders, hired him in 1971 to carry it forward.
The 55-year-old son of politically liberal Southerners, he grew up in Montevillo, Ala., a Birmingham suburb, studied architecture at Auburn University, in Auburn, Ala., and came to the architecture graduate program at Columbia to specialize in urban design. It was a time when the funds for redesigning downtowns were flowing. Mr. Towery worked on a plan for Dallas that the Murchison family funded, and wrote a master's thesis on redesigning 125th Street in Harlem.
In the late 60's The Long Island Press was still alive and publishing in Jamaica. Its editor, David Starr, was a Jamaica booster. So was Vincent M. Albanese, then president of the Chamber of Commerce and now an Urban Development Corporation board member. So were Joseph P. McMurray, a Jamaica native and president of Queens College, and Lawrence Cormier, who headed Ebony Oil, a Jamaica company.
THEY and Stanley Gertz, grandson of the Gertz department store's founder, invited Mr. Towery to head the development corporation. But no planning efforts were able to stave off the setbacks of the 70's and 80's. The Ideal Toy Company moved to New Jersey at a cost of several hundred jobs. The Long Island Press folded. Jamaica Savings Bank moved its headquarters to Lynbrook, L.I. Macy's closed its Jamaica store and in 1981 the big Gertz store closed.
"We took our hits," Mr. Towery said. "We survived those hits, I think because we had a plan and a public commitment and people could see that there was a future. And there was public consensus. York had a galvanizing effect on all constituent groups out here."
But the industrial employment level in the area, which had reached 10,000 jobs in the late 70's, had fallen to 5,400 by 1983. On the commercial front there were 1,400 job losses in the Macy's and Gertz closings alone.
Now industrial employment is back to 7,200, thanks in good part to employment in food-processing and distribution businesses. There are 2,800 jobs in the new Federal office building, and the conversion of the Gertz store to an office complex has produced 2,000 jobs. Total current employment in Jamaica is about 25,000, Mr. Towery says.
The Jamaica Avenue el has come down, public parking garages have been built, two hospitals have grown, the centrally located 11-acre King Park has been rebuilt, and with the development corporation's help local businesses have established two special assessment districts, one on 165th Street and another on Jamaica Avenue.
The question is, will private development follow the public investment?
IN the middle 80's it seemed about to happen. The Mack Corporation, a major New Jersey development company, undertook to develop a vacant site at Archer Avenue and Parsons Boulevard, across the street from the site on which the Federal office was built. But relations with the city's Public Development Corporation, now the Economic Development Corporation, broke down. The P.D.C. felt that Mack was stalling in the negotiations on the final terms of the land lease.
To the dismay of Mr. Towery, Mack was dedesignated as the site's developer. Mack had expected to build a 440,000-square-foot speculative office building, and swallowed with bitterness the loss of its significant investment in predevelopment work. The vacant Jamaica site and others nearby would seem to be ideal back-office locations. The former Mack land is fully cleared, on top of the Jamaica Center subway stop and zoned for a 440,000-square-foot building. A second site, also cleared, is zoned for 490,000 square feet. Mr. Towery believes both could logically accommodate greater bulk if the user needed it.
So far, private investment has focused on rehabilitating existing buildings. The development corporation itself has been one of the investors. Fred Trump, founder of the Trump Organization, once had his office in an eight-story, 55,000-square-foot building at 90-04 161st Street. He donated it to the development corporation in 1980. Now its 25-person staff occupies a floor, and other floors have been upgraded and rented out. Mortgages came from the Equitable Life and Crossland Savings Bank.
THE corporation has gone on to rehabilitate a three-story firehouse on 162d Street on a 50-year lease from New York City. A child-guidance firm is on the upper floors and a Sizzler restaurant on the ground level. National Westminster Bank supplied the financing.
The biggest rehabilitation has been done by the Gertz family at the former department store. It created about 400,000 square feet, occupied by state and city offices. There are two floors of retail space below.
Downtown Jamaica's largest current commercial project is neither big nor small, but medium-sized. This is a new Farmer's Market, in a permanent enclosed structure that is far advanced in construction on 160th Street half a block from Jamaica Avenue. Starting next spring farmers from afar will transport their produce to this 26,000-square-foot building at least three days a week, and perhaps six. Besides the selling in 16 stalls for farmers and plant growers, there will be food stores for on-premises consumption, and on a second level, 5,000 square feet for offices.
It is a $5 million development project, financed half by public grants and half by loans from the Equitable and the Urban Development Corporation. It will be owned and operated by the development corporation, which has run Jamaica's active open-air market for 15 years.
"Food and food-related businesses are our niche in the industrial field," said Mr. Towery. Continental Baking employs 500 people in Jamaica; Elmhurst Dairy/Honeywell Farms operates a milk-processing plant on Liberty Avenue that also employs 500.
The community's basic asset is its strategic position in the regional transportation network, with nine Long Island Rail Road lines converging there. The latest idea, by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, is to strengthen its role as a hub by establishing a direct train link to John F. Kennedy Airport.
"Our bottom line is jobs," Mr. Towery said. "Everything we've done has been aimed at priming Jamaica for substantial growth as an employment center."

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

M.C.I. Increase
 
Question: I have received a bill from my landlord for a retroactive major capital improvement increase for an 18-month period from February of 1989 until February of 1990, when I purchased my apartment after the building's conversion to a co-op. Do I have to pay a bill for a rent increase in an apartment where I am no longer a tenant? . . . Howard Hill, Brooklyn
 
Answer: Yes. According to Joseph D'Agosta, a deputy commissioner for the State Department of Housing and Community Renewal, a tenant is responsible for retroactive rent increases, even if he is no longer a tenant. The exception, Mr. D'Agosta said, would be if there was a provision of the offering plan in a conversion that absolved the purchaser of this debt.
"Even tenants who vacate the apartments are technically liable for the retroactive M.C.I. increase," said Mr. D'Agosta, "but because most increases are not that large, most owners do not bother with trying to collect once a tenant has moved away."
 
Liability for a Driveway
 
Question: I own a home that shares a driveway with other homes. It needs to be repaired, but not all homeowners want to contribute to the cost. If someone is injured because of its broken concrete, would all homeowners be liable, or would only the owner of the property in front of the section where the accident occurred be held responsible? . . . Barry Bloch, Flushing, Queens
 
Answer: All homeowners would be liable in case of an accident. According to Brook Boyd, an attorney with the firm of Herrick, Feinstein who specializes in real estate matters, all owners may be liable for accidents caused by driveway defects. "If one owner is sued," said Mr. Boyd, "the other owners are typically required to share the cost of judgment."
Anyone entitled to use the driveway, Mr. Boyd said, is required, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, to share in the cost of maintaining it. Owners who use the driveway but fail to share these costs could be sued by others who do.
 
Liability for a Lease
 
Question: I live in a co-op building. Our board of directors allows owners to take tenants under some circumstances and charges them a $100-a-month sublet fee. We now have a situation in which one owner has moved away and has turned the apartment over to his brother. This was done with board approval. To help with the maintenance charge, the brother of the shareholder has taken a roommate.
Some shareholders have suggested that we charge the sublet fee. Does the board have the authority to do this? . . . Joseph A. Gisler, Woodside, Queens
 
Answer Maybe. But it would depend on the terms of the proprietary lease.
According the Marc Luxemberg, an attorney who specializes in real estate matters and who is a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, most leases include language that stipulates which relatives of shareholders have occupancy rights. Typically, Mr. Luxemberg said, it would be spouses, children, parents, grandparents and brothers and sisters of the named tenant on the proprietary lease.
Mr. Luxemberg said that the exact wording of this type of clause is important. "If the lease says the shareholder or his or her brother or other relatives have occupancy rights," he said, "then this situation described would not be a sublet. But if the lease granted occupancy rights to shareholder and his siblings, then that would mean that the named party would also have to be in residence for the arrangement not be be a violation of the lease terms."
If the lease does not allow the brother to live in the apartment without the named tenant, then the board would have the right to demand a sublet fee. But this would be paid by the shareholder, not his brother.
The board would have the right to cancel the shareholder's proprietary lease and occupancy rights if the fee is not paid.

HEADLINE: Radio Station Offers Everything But Consistency

DATELINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
NEARLY 22 years ago Bill Nolan was cruising down Interstate 95 in his apple-red Mustang flipping the radio knob and searching for the answer to his prayers. Mr. Nolan's passion was 50's rock and roll, which at the time had all but faded from the American memory, he said. As a record collector and devotee of music from the early-rock era, he said, he knew he could help spark new interest in it if only he could find a station that would allow him to broadcast his message. After switching to 89.5 on the FM dial, WPKN at the University of Bridgeport, Mr. Nolan said, he knew his search had ended.
"I remember they were playing some pretty hot acid rock," he said, "real controversial, pre-Woodstock stuff that the commercial stations wouldn't touch." 
 Soon after, Mr. Nolan, who works for the Ansonia Copper and Brass Corporation, became the station's first volunteer program host with a Sunday evening program called "Antique Blues." Using his record collection, he sought to educate as much as entertain, he said. By the mid-1970's "Antique Blues" had attracted a faithful audience, and Mr. Nolan founded an organization for lovers of rhythm-and-blues music, the R. & B. Society, which he called the first group in the country devoted to promoting rock and roll. The society now has 50,000 members worldwide, he said.
 
'Hobgoblin of Little Minds'
 Mr. Nolan's debut also changed the character of WPKN, which had been a training ground for broadcasting students. Now operated by 120 volunteers with a drive to promote music and points of view not often covered by the commercial media, WPKN has built its reputation on its eclectic and often unpredictable approach, said the station manager, Harry Minot.
"Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,' " said Mr. Minot, the station's only paid employee. "Here at WPKN we have made it a point to take our listeners down roads they normally wouldn't travel."
Two years ago when the university, faced with mounting financial problems, cut the station's $90,000 budget, WPKN's listeners came to its rescue. With the help of its staff and more than 150 more volunteers, the station raised $100,000 during a monthlong on-the-air fund-raising campaign that has since become an annual event held each October. As part of its independent status, said Mr. Minot, WPKN has become the only listener-supported radio station in New England, and perhaps the country, that accepts no program underwriting, commercial advertising, grants or membership dues. He added that WPKN's transition to self-supporting status has unified the station and brought its personalities closer to their listeners, who often drop by for coffee, attend monthly meetings and come on the air to oppose the views expressed in commentaries.
"We've never abandoned our commitment to the community," said Mr. Minot, who estimated that the station had an audience of more than 30,000. "And I think that's why our listeners feel a great responsibility to keep the station and its message alive." Like a number of the station's 65 staff members, Mr. Minot said he started as a volunteer in the early 1970's after working in commercial radio. Mr. Minot, who was a disk jockey on a commercial station in Danbury, recalled tuning to WPKN for the first time and hearing Ray Terlaga, whose specialty is international music and readings of scientific news stories and prose.
"I had always been programmed to be up and bubbly and uncontroversial on the air, no matter what," said Mr. Minot. "Then I found myself listening to this guy who was talking very freely about how depressed he was, in between poetry readings of Armand Rauband, who committed suicide, and I thought, 'Now here's a station that does not compromise its artistic integrity.' "
One of WPKN's best assets, say staff members and listeners, is its relaxed, non sequitur style. Programs segue from Latin jazz, classical music, rockabilly and Cajun zydeco to discussions on topics like catching bluefish, art events, natural hygiene and prison issues.
"There's probably many listeners who may not like all of what goes on at the station but who listen anyway, to find out what happens next," said Cliff Furnald, a freelance writer and musician whose Monday afternoon program offers music from around the world. "I mean, where else are you going to hear Bulgarian electronic experimental music, unless some character gets on the air and plays it?"
Rod Ross, who has been as an announcer at WPKN since the early 1970's and has worked at stations in New York and Connecticut, started volunteering at WPKN 15 years ago. His program, which is heard twice a month on Saturdays, includes occasional journeys into the marine life and fishermen's lore of Long Island Sound. "The station's genuine and honest approach gave me a totally new insight into radio," he said. "Not only does it introduce you to various types of music, at its heart WPKN is a complete social structure where your listeners become your friends."
Mr. Ross's mother, Ruth Lampland Ross, a longtime arts reviewer in Fairfield County, is 84 years old and the oldest member of the station staff. She augments her roundup of the region's cultural events with personal reminiscences.
The 10,000-watt station first went on the air in the early 60's and now broadcasts to most of Connecticut, Long Island and parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In those days, like many college radio stations, it trained students who would later pursue work in commercial radio. Yet when Mr. Nolan and other community announcers came on board, they began charting new ground.
Mr. Nolan recalled scouting black churches in New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport for gospel groups to perform live on his program in the 1970's. "Some of these people had sung together for 40 years," he said, "and I can tell you that there isn't anything like gospel music performed on the air live. It just knocked us out."
He started the R. & B. Society after an on-the-air round-table discussion with 20 listeners on the social and cultural impact of rock and roll, he said. Over the years, he said, his organization has lobbied the music industry to promote dozens of American blues artists like Johnny Copeland and Memphis Slim, whose careers had been stymied by the British rock movement of the 1960's and 1970's.
In between music sets, Mr. Nolan embellishes the records he plays with anecdotes about the artists and their contribution to American music and often refers to his listeners as cats and kittens. Over the harmonies of the Hollywood Flames singing "Ride, Helen, Ride," Mr. Nolan told his audience recently: "Yessiree, rock and roll, just as fresh today as it was 30 years ago. It changed the social life for me and for you. Lest we never forget it."
As a student at the university in the 1970's Ruth Eddy found that listening to "Antique Blues" inspired her to create her own style of radio show, which she described recently as a spontaneous rendering of what's on her mind. "My philosophy is based more on what stirs the heart," said Ms. Eddy, now a massage therapist. "Often my programs reflect where I am in my life."
Her theme song, "Everything Reminds Me Of My Dog," by Jane Siberry, a folk artist, opens her Thursday afternoon program. While Ms. Eddy conducts interviews, reads essays, plays music or discusses health issues, her two dogs, Lucy Carmichael and Fred Mertz, snooze at her feet.
"I don't refer to them as my pets," she tells her listeners. "Rather, I'm their human companion."
 
Robust Opinions
 Since the late 1970's the station has also offered a range of public affairs programs that have included forums and listener call-ins on the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, nuclear power plants, United States policies in Central America and, most recently, the Persian Gulf war. The public affairs coordinator, Scott Harris, a pretrial intervention counselor for Norwalk Economic Opportunity Now, said the station is planning to hold a forum on urban problems later this fall and has invited the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to participate.
To have their own programs, volunteers must have Federal Communications Commission operator's licenses and go through a training session at the studio before presenting an audition tape, Mr. Minot said. If approved, the volunteers often fill in for colleagues until a slot opens. In general, he added, those who audition are musically sophisticated and hold robust opinions.
"There's no question that the personalities WPKN attracts are anything but dull," he said.

HEADLINE: Stamford, Hoping for Growth, Chooses a Mayor

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
WHOEVER is elected mayor of Stamford on Nov. 5, the road ahead is clearly marked: the city will try to attract more offices, more jobs, more growth. Stamford has followed the same road for the last 20 years, as it shook free from its fading factories along Interstate 95 and remade its economy in the image of the white-collar suburban neighborhoods that spread north for miles, in ascending lot size, to the Westchester line.
What promises to be different now is the speed of change, as Stamford competes with cities across the country to fill its empty office buildings, and the mayor's style, as the incumbent, Thom Serrani, departs after four two-year terms. 
 Both the Democratic candidate, Sandra Goldstein, president of the city's Board of Representatives for the past 10 years, and the Republican, Stanley Esposito, a member of the board for six years, say it is past time for Stamford to promote itself aggressively. "The city that is today is different from the city that was 10 years ago," Mrs. Goldstein, a 49-year-old real estate agent, said in an interview. "That is because the entire Northeast is experiencing a recession. But the one mistake we can make is to sit on our hands during times of recession and not plan for the future." Mr. Esposito, 43, a property manager, said, "We need that economic shot in the arm." Differing little on their goal of spurring more economic growth, Mrs. Goldstein and Mr. Esposito have battled mainly over their qualifications and Mr. Serrani's record. Both issues raise questions about Stamford's government and how well suited it is to manage the unusually varied community within the city's 38 square miles: part ghettos, part middle-class and upper-class suburbs, and part regional business center.
Mr. Serrani, a 44-year-old Democrat who has frequently fought with the city's elected boards, acknowledges his growing frustration with the limited powers of his office, especially as the recession has ended the steady growth of the city's tax rolls and made governing a matter of cutting services rather than adding them. "What you have is a nighttime government of experts, who get elected and by virtue of getting elected become instant experts, coming in once a month to sit at a board meeting," Mr. Serrani said of the 40-member Board of Representatives, one of the largest city councils in the country. "And then you get the daytime government that sees how government is operating on a daily basis."
The 40-member board dates from 1949, when the rural part of Stamford north of the Bull's Head section was consolidated, against its wishes, with the city. To give the unhappy north more voice on the board, the charter called for two representatives from each of 20 districts. It also weakened the mayor's powers.
The accommodation with now-suburban North Stamford, which still rumbles occasionally with talk of secession, created a structure that Mr. Serrani says is outdated. He recommends a strong four-year mayor and a 15-member council, with 10 members elected from districts and 5 elected at large as a finance committee that would take the place of the separate Board of Finance.
"If you're going to have a mayor, give him power," Mr. Serrani said. "If we're electing mayors just to go to social events, then have a city manager. Someone's got to run this operation every day."
But Mr. Serrani's impatience with the elected boards, with labor unions and with other groups in the city often seemed to be another side of a Mayor who thought he could do it all, from negotiating labor contracts to recruiting new corporate tenants. While business leaders give him credit for managing the city well and making tough decisions that kept property-tax increases low and preserved the city's triple-A bond rating, there is also a feeling that the administration has been too isolated to take full advantage of the help many corporations are eager to offer.
 
'He Participated'
 "The business community is looking for a city government that would work with it better, use it better," said David E. Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, a coalition of business, community and government leaders formed in 1978 to help the city plan for its future.
"Thom Serrani was a very effective Mayor for the Stamford Partnership for much of his tenure. He participated. He was the draw. But he didn't use it as much as he could have. I think he was unnecessarily distant from the business community."
In the campaign Mrs. Goldstein, a Democrat like Mr. Serrani, is the Mayor's chief critic, while Mr. Esposito, the Republican, tends to defend him, especially on budget issues.
"Whether you agree with him or disagree with him," Mr. Esposito said, "he was forced to make some really hard decisions. We're all adults. You have to respect a guy who's willing to put his money where his mouth is."
Mr. Serrani suggests that Mrs. Goldstein and other Democrats with ambitions caused many of his confrontations with the elected boards in his last term. Mrs. Goldstein, who takes credit for organizing her unwieldy board's committees to streamline its work, says the problem is not the form of government but people's willingness to work within it.
Stamford has a weak-mayor form of government, she said, but in practice only the mayor can propose spending, and he has the power to appoint all other boards and commissions. Mr. Serrani, like his Republican predecessor, Louis Clapes, has not acted like a weak mayor, she said.
 
Experience Cited
 "Your strongest time with Thom as Mayor, and Lou Clapes as Mayor, was when they took the time to bring the boards into the process," Mrs. Goldstein said. "Because our charter requires so much board approval, it's when you decide to do it alone and act in a vacuum that the system breaks down. You can't act in a vacuum in our form of government."
Mrs. Goldstein, given her experience directing the Board of Representatives, says she is the person best equipped to work within the existing structure and draw in the expertise and aid of the business community.
She has pledged to start a professional development program, with a committee that would find companies to recruit. And she has criticized many of Mr. Serrani's service cuts and layoffs, saying that some cost the city more than they saved, and that others would have been unnecessary if the city were managed better.
Mr. Esposito, she says, lacks any experience directing a government department.
Mr. Esposito, running in a Democratic city where his party holds only 10 of the 40 seats on the Board of Representatives, says he wants to work through the Stamford Partnership to encourage more corporations to choose the city.
He says his years on the board have earned him the respect he needs from other representatives to be effective. And spending must be tightly controlled, he says, to keep property taxes from driving more middle-class families out of the city.
"If you want to see some of the people I graduated from high school with," Mr. Esposito said, "you have only to look at the exit ramps of the Connecticut Turnpike first thing in the morning, or see them again on the entrance ramps at 5 o'clock. They've moved farther away, because they couldn't afford to live here."
 
'Almost Made It'
 The new mayor will take over at a time when overbuilding has left 25 percent of Stamford's office space vacant. Yet to secure its gains, the city needs to fill in and complete its downtown.
Planners say there is no question that Stamford, with its concentration of businesses and services, is marked for more growth. But the next phase will take much more planning and effort, they say, partly because competition has intensified, but also because Stamford needs to attract companies to its downtown. It will be competing as a city, rather than a suburban refuge.
"Here's a place that's almost made it," said Richard Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association in Manhattan. "With such a place during recession, the question is: What do you do to prepare for the next phase of economic development?
"The new mayor is building on success. That can be more difficult than the challenge Thom Serrani and his predecessors faced."

HEADLINE: County Uses New Tactic On Criminals' Unpaid Fines

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AN aggressive new effort by Hudson County officials to collect millions of dollars in outstanding criminal fines and penalties is being viewed as a potential model for similar programs that could be used on a statewide basis.
The program, through which officials collect delinquent fines by placing liens on property, garnishing wages, suspending drivers' licenses and seizing state tax refunds, is seen as an effective, efficient way of collecting overdue fines from recalcitrant offenders. 
 Collecting fines by such methods, officials say, is a more sensible alternative to imprisoning offenders for nonpayment and will prevent criminal deadbeats from ignoring their financial obligations by taking advantage of inherent inefficiencies in the present collection system.
Interest in the program arises as officials struggle to standardize and improve fine-collection practices statewide while keeping a cautious eye on increasing overcrowding in state prisons and county jails.
"We have introduced a whole new thrust in collecting and enforcing fines that have been imposed by the courts," said Joseph C. Mollica, the assistant to the court administrator of Hudson County. "The courts have never been very good at the collection business." Mr. Mollica said that in addition to statutory fines, the courts could also order restitution to crime victims and could assess penalties to offset costs of medical treatment of those injured in violent crimes. And all drug cases, he said, carry mandatory minimum penalties.
"A fine can be made a very severe sanction and an alternative to incarceration," Mr. Mollica said. "And if judges see that fines are collected effectively, they might tend to use them more."
Using a $166,000 grant from the State Justice Institute in Alexandria, Va., a federally financed organization that provides grants to state and local court systems, officials in Hudson County have been making aggressive use of standard civil remedies like garnishing wages and placing liens on real estate to collect outstanding criminal fines and penalties.
More than $16 million in criminal fines is now outstanding in Hudson County alone, Mr. Mollica said. Only a fraction of that amount is likely to be collected through traditional collection methods, he said. Last year, for example, only $1.6 million in outstanding fines was collected in Hudson County.
"We know that most of the time people do not pay their fines," Mr. Mollica said, adding that many convicted offenders simply "drop out of the system" before their fines are paid in full. "We needed to come up with better ways of collection and enforcement," he said.
Maureen Cassidy, coordinator of fines and restitution in Hudson County, said a better way was to take advantage of the New Jersey Department of Labor's Wage Reporting System. The system, Ms. Cassidy said, identifies the employer of every person covered by unemployment insurance.
Using an offender's Social Security number, she said, officials can find an individual's employer and obtain a court order for garnishment of wages. Once a person is found, Ms. Cassidy said, officials are able to obtain a civil judgment that allows them to seize personal property like automobiles, jewelry and bank accounts.
 
Lien on Property
 If the person owns a house, she said, the judgment can be used to place a lien on the property that must be satisfied in full, with interest, before the property can be sold.
Another tool that Hudson County officials are using to collect unpaid fines is automatic seizure of homestead rebates and state income tax refunds. Ms. Cassidy said that any time a taxpayer or homeowner owed a debt to any agency of state government, the State Division of Taxation was authorized to apply any tax refund or homestead rebate to satisfy the indebtedness.
Finally, she said, officials are also using a provision in the state statutes that permits the suspension of an offender's driver's license for nonpayment of certain fines.
"We've done a lot of those," Ms. Cassidy said. "Eventually, they're going to want their license back, and when they do, they're going to have to pay the fine before the license is restored."
 
Laws Were Rarely Applied
 Ms. Cassidy said that laws allowing civil liens for criminal penalties had been in existence for some time, but that they were rarely applied. "The traditional approach when an individual stopped paying his fine was to follow up with a violation of probation," she said. That, however, usually resulted in a judge's setting up a new payment schedule that the offender would eventually ignore.
"There's no backup there," Ms. Cassidy said. "There's no way to make sure that those payments keep coming in."
Under current state law, all criminal fines and penalties imposed by State Superior Court judges, along with some fines imposed by municipal judges, are collected by the probation department of the county in which the fine is imposed.
The department usually sets up a payment schedule for a convicted offender so that the fine can be paid in regular installments. Typically, the payment schedule runs for the term of the offender's probation, but it can be extended if necessary.
Very often, however, Mr. Mollica said, offenders fall behind on their payments, finish probation before fully paying the fine or simply drop out of the system altogether. When that happens, he said, probation officers can do little more than request the issuance of a warrant for the offender's arrest.
 
Enforcing Payment Termed Difficult
 Such a warrant, Mr. Mollica said, is often not a high priority with law-enforcement officers and seldom results in the arrest of the offender.
But even when an offender is arrested, Mr. Mollica said, the alternatives available to probation officials for enforcing payment are minimal. They can renegotiate the payment plan, a futile action in cases where offenders have already exhibited an inclination not to pay, or they can ask a judge to hold an offender in contempt and sentence him to jail.
"But then society ends up paying for the guy's room and board," Mr. Mollica said. "If a guy is working, why jail him when you can garnish his pay?"
Mr. Mollica said that using civil remedies was often more productive than threats of imprisonment.
"What usually happens is that the idea that we're coming after them prompts them to pay the fine or set up a new payment schedule," Mr. Mollica said. "In my opinion, every county should be doing this."
 
State Preparing a Report
 State officials agree that radical changes are necessary to make the system for collecting fines and penalties more efficient.
Harvey M. Goldstein, the state director for probation services, said that representatives of the county probation departments had been meeting monthly to develop ways to improve collections. Recently, he said, the state hired an accounting concern to prepare a report on collection practices and to suggest improvements.
"They had two major recommendations," Mr. Goldstein said. The first was to develop a uniform statewide collection process. Secondly, he said, "we've got to automate."
Mr. Goldstein said that while Hudson County's experience with using civil remedies was apparently proving successful, such a system could be used statewide only if all the county probation departments' procedures were automated. "We have 21 counties with 21 different systems, and not one has complete automation," he said.
 
Total Unpaid Amount Is Unknown
 In fact, he said, since each county handles its collection procedures separately, state officials do not even know the total amount of unpaid fines outstanding. "The number of cases we're talking about is 100,000," he said. "To try to add that up manually is an impossible task."
Some figures the state has compiled, however, provide an indication of the amount of fines outstanding on a statewide basis. The total amount of fines collected statewide in one year, Mr. Goldstein said, averages $17 million or $18 million, roughly the amount owed in Hudson County.
Mr. Goldstein said collection figures were skewed by the fact that most fines are being paid under installment plans and are not technically due yet. In addition, he said, some fines are owed by people who have left the state or are currently in prison and will probably never make full payment.
Peter N. Brill, chief probation officer for Bergen County, agreed that all collection practices should be standardized and automated. "If we were automated, every one of these people could be billed every month," he said.
But the main obstacle to automation, he said, is lack of money to make the transition. "The problem here is that this fine money is not going to the county," he said. "When you say to the county, 'I need X number of dollars,' their answer is that they don't see any of the money."
 
Most Fines Turned Over to State
 Most of the fines imposed against convicted defendants, Mr. Brill said, are turned over to the state. Such fines are those imposed under the Violent Crime Compensation Board, which provides a fund for victims of violent crimes, and the Drug Enforcement Demand Reduction penalty assessment, which carries high fines that are used for drug treatment and rehabilitation.
Some experts say they believe that high fines themselves might be the reason officials have difficulty collecting outstanding penalties.
"I think that there is great potential for using civil remedies," said Dr. George Cole, an expert in the administration of criminal justice at the University of Connecticut. "But you can only talk about successful collection of fines when the fines are commensurate not only with the severity of the offense, but also within the means of the offender."
Dr. Cole said that high mandatory fines in New Jersey took discretion away from judges. That, he said, leads to the imposition of fines that are essentially impossible to collect.
"It's silly to fine someone $5,000 if they're unemployed and poor," Dr. Cole said. "It's just never going to be paid."

HEADLINE: ART;
A 'Mountain-Climbing' Canal

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN

 BODY:
THE Erie Canal was born in 1825 and still lives. The Morris Canal opened six years later but had stopped functioning by 1929, and all that remains today are a few stretches -- at Boonton, Clifton and Wharton, for example -- and the mass of memorabilia on view here, at the Macculloch Hall Historical Museum.
This Georgian pile was erected in 1810 by George Macculloch, a prosperous businessman who had arrived in this country a few years earlier. His business had to do with banking and overseas trade and, evidently, his reason for immigrating was the economic inconvenience caused by the Napoleonic wars. 
 Once settled in Morristown, Macculloch plunged into local life, opening a school and, though a Presbyterian, assisting in the building of St. Peter's Episcopal Church. His chief contribution, however, was promoting the Morris Canal, for which he invoked nature as a justification.
She "seems really to have intended it," Macculloch wrote in Morristown's newspaper, The Palladium of Liberty, "by holding out every facility in the form and texture of the ground," the position of the water and its abundance. The big capitalist in the sky had even provided the incentive of minerals -- the iron, zinc, copper, black lead and lime that lay along the route the canal was to take, a route that led to the Delaware, Pennsylvania and the coal needed to process these elements.
It was 1822 and the United States, having lost three years to the War of 1812, was scrambling to catch up with England in the rush to industrialization. This meant implementing the recommendations in "Roads and Canals," a report by Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin.
The notion of Manifest Destiny cannot have been alien to Macculloch, for he had been born in India (1775), the son of an East India Company officer. Orphaned nine years later, the boy was sent home to Scotland, where he was educated -- unusually well, from the sound of it.
Macculloch, the family man, is covered in a booklet put out by the museum; the general focus is on the entrepreneur, along with his friends in high places. These included DeWitt Clinton, who, as Governor of New York, pushed vigorously for the Erie Canal, and James Renwick, a science and engineering professor at Columbia College and father of the architect of the same name.
Among the likenesses is one of Robert Fulton attributed, perhaps optimistically, to Benjamin West. Though he had died in 1815, Fulton is present as an eminence grise, notably by way of his illustrated treatise on canal navigation (1796) and the inclined plane invention that it includes. A powerful influence on waterway design the world over, this was a Rube Goldberg portage whereby cars or "cradles" mounted on rails were loaded with boats at one level and, attached to cables operated by water-powered machinery, hauled up to the next level.
The canal ran first from Newark, later Jersey City, to Philipsburg, on the Delaware, a distance of 102 miles. Approached from the eastern end, it climbed 914 feet -- to Lake Hopatcong -- and from the west, 760 feet, an accomplishment that called for 23 planes and 23 locks.
They are the best part of the show, these photographs of the equipment, the craft and the people who made a living from the canal. Unlike the present era, the machine age provided jobs in abundance and, for the "water gypsies," shelter, too. An entertaining picture features two small children chained to a boat's superstructure. The alternative, illustrated by a Harpers Monthly cartoon of 1860, was "Child Overboard."
The boat captains came in all types: the bewhiskered "Billy Black" Maccullough is captioned "the wildest kind of Irishman"; but, alas, he finally settled down as a "God-fearing, Sabbath-respecting citizen." James (Camel) Campbell, in his tweed suit, was one of several black captains.
The show's piece de resistance is the 15-foot-long mural of one craft drawn by mules and another in the cradle. Painted for the Wharton Town Hall by Louis Valdemar Fischer, the picture was recently reproduced in The Star-Ledger, much to the surprise of the 87-year-old artist, who hadn't laid eyes on it since completing it in 1938.
With its topographical maps, letters, samples of cargo like the nails that put Boonton on the map as an iron town, this is an encyclopedia, the work of Richard Simon, a museum trustee. But it says little about the Morris Canal and Banking Company and even less about its investors beyond mentioning the financial scandal that resulted in the appointment of Cadwallader Colden as president in 1827. It does, however, report that Washington Irving was on the board, from 1836 to 1840.
"The Morris Canal, New Jersey's Mountain-Climbing Waterway" is on view through Nov. 17. The museum is at 45 Macculloch Avenue and is open Thursday, Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M.

HEADLINE: Pressure Grows on Aid-Thirsty Israel to Adopt Reforms

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
While economies from Chile to New Zealand are shaking off the heavy hand of government and embracing freer markets, Israel seems stuck in a time warp.
"The Israeli economy is an anomaly in the world today," said Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs until earlier this year. "It's statist when everybody else is becoming un-statist." 
 Mr. McCormack and others maintain that Israel needs to "marketize" its economy by selling off state-supported enterprises, lifting restrictive labor practices and stripping away pervasive regulation.
A recent internal report by the International Monetary Fund takes a similar stance. Jerusalem is still more meddlesome than most European governments, the report says, and despite some significant reforms, has been lagging behind many countries in opening its economy.
Now pro-Israel charities and American taxpayers in general are being asked to dig deeper into their pockets to help Israel, already the largest recipient of American economic aid, absorb a huge wave of Soviet immigrants. Instead of framing the decision only in moral, military or foreign policy terms, some of the prospective donors are asking tough economic questions as well.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir acknowledged these concerns. In his official request to the United States for $10 billion in loan guarantees, he stressed that "the Government of Israel is committed to continuing the full implementation of reforms undertaken since 1985."
To be sure, Israel has many thriving private enterprises and its economy has recently been growing briskly. Since the mid-1980's, the Government has freed up financial markets, eased foreign exchange controls and slashed subsidies. The long-term economic prospects have brightened, according to a recent Standard & Poor's report, with "a significant lessening of the external threat facing the nation" and the influx of emigres from the Soviet Union.
Still, many of Israel's staunch supporters see the nation's recent request for $10 billion in loan guarantees as an opportunity to press the Government to tackle privatization and to lift obstacles to job creation. Such reforms, advocates say, would make the Israeli economy more efficient, attract foreign investors and help to reduce economic dependence on Washington. Israel now gets $3 billion a year in military and economic aid.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, has said he wants to make economic reform a quid pro quo for loan guarantees. "That way the Israelis can do what they have to do but blame the unpopular choices on us," he said.
Two prominent American economists who have been long-time economic advisers of Israel -- Stanley Fischer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Herbert Stein at the American Enterprise Institute -- recently urged the Government of Yitzhak Shamir to commit itself publicly to a timetable of reform. "Israel cannot count on a large, continuing, unconditional flow of aid from the United States Government," Mr. Stein said in a recent speech.
And some members of the American Jewish charitable community, which is sending $1 billion to Israel this year, are starting to focus on the issue. "Saying to Israel that you have to develop a plan for economic reform in return for aid might be a good thing," said Herbert Kronish, a leader of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
As it turns out, there is a precedent for the United States to employ aid for a bit of arm-twisting of the Israelis. In 1985, when Israel was facing 400 percent inflation and a run on its currency, Washington shelled out an extra $175 million in grants after Israel agreed to adopt an emergency program to stabilize the economy.
The Secretary of State at the time, George P. Shultz, formed the Joint Economic Development Group -- of which Messrs. McCormack, Fisher and Stein are still members -- to consult regularly with the Israeli Government on the stabilization program. According to Michael Bruno, a former Governor of Israel's central bank, and other top Israeli economists, the advisory group was effective in getting the Government of Shimon Peres to adopt painful measures that the Israeli economists had already been advocating.
Many Israeli economists think that reviving the group's advisory role could be helpful. "There's a lot of room for agreement," said Leonardo Liederman, an economist at Tel Aviv University. "I'm not worried about conditions." "Calling for faster reforms is very healthy," said Eram Yashiv, an Israeli who is a visiting professor at M.I.T.
Despite some reforms to date, Israel's bloated welfare state owns more than 90 percent of all land and controls more than one-fifth of the industries and services. And even with a shrinking military burden, the Government gobbles up half of the nation's gross national product, compared with one-fifth in South Korea, for example. The consequence has been a tendency toward "stagflation" -- a nasty combination of high unemployment and high inflation with low growth.
The big challenge now is for the nation of 4.5 million people to open its economy, not just its borders, to hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Up to one million Soviet Jews are expected eventually. These people, many of whom are highly skilled, could eventually increase Israel's growth potential by a third or more. But in the meantime, a mammoth $50 billion investment in housing, infrastructure and, most of all, jobs will be needed. Israel hopes to finance half of this undertaking abroad.
United States loan guarantees are supposed to enable Israel, which has an unimpressive BBB- credit rating from Standard & Poor's, to pry open capital markets and borrow as much as $2 billion a year from foreign banks and bondholders.
"Israel needs long-term financing," said Amnan Neubach, the Economic Counsellor at the Israeli Embassy. "The guarantees send a signal about a long-term commitment."
From the perspective of the United States, the American Treasury would be agreeing to pay Israel's creditors in case Israel cannot service its debts. Some American officials, including economists at the Export-Import Bank, worry that the American taxpayer will have to ante up. But Israel has never defaulted on a foreign loan and Standard & Poor's assessment is that Israel "should be able to cope with the increased debt."
The momentum behind supply-side changes aimed at lowering the cost of doing business seems to have petered out. "A year and a half ago there was a push for reforms," said Patrick Clawson, editor of Orbis, a foreign policy magazine. "Now it's dead, dead, dead."
The political gridlock can be traced to populists in both of the major political parties, according to Howard Rosen, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, who until recently was a visiting researcher at the Bank of Israel.
Though the economy is rebounding from recession, inflation has been running at a 24 percent annual rate and the budget and trade deficits are ballooning.
The biggest problem is that job creation is hamstrung by high taxes on employers, universal benefit guarantees and rigid work rules. "Start-up costs in Israel are very high," Mr. Rosen said, and Israeli businesses tend to hold back on hiring.
"The more sclerotic a labor market," said Nicholas Eberstadt, author of the book "Aid and the American Purpose," "the less it can benefit from an influx." Unemployment is already 10.8 percent, the highest level ever, even though most of the new immigrants have yet to join the work force. That reflects, Mr. Eberstadt said, "the dysfunctions of the modern Israeli economy."
By contrast, he notes, the freewheeling West German economy achieved its economic miracle immediately after World War II even as refugees from the East poured in.
Archconservative supporters of Israel have urged the United States and Jewish philanthropies to send no more aid until Israel has restructured its economy. But most others think that an abrupt withdrawal is too risky. "It's a very different situation from policy reform in Brazil," Mr. Eberstadt said. "There is no prospect of Brazil's being pushed into the sea."
Again, there is a precedent for a gradually reducing economic aid and one that pertains to another close ally of the United States that faced threats to its survival. Early in the 60's the Kennedy Administration decided that its huge aid progam was retarding economic reform in South Korea.
The Administration put the Seoul Government on notice that only military aid would be forthcoming in the future. (Despite the threat, economic aid actually continued for some years.) The realization that aid would not go on forever evidently spurred South Korea's Government to put changes into effect for which wide support already existed. What followed was one of the most spectacular 30-year growth spurts in economic history.
 
 
 
THE LIMITS OF PUBLIC SPENDING
 Israel's economy has recently rebounded, but this appears attributable more to a debt-financed Government spending spree than to reforms aimed at lowering the cost of doing business.
"The economy is not growing in a sustainable way," said Efraim Sadka, chairman of the Tel Aviv-based Housing and Construction Holding Company, wholly owned by Histadrut, the near-monopoly labor union. "Most of the growth is coming from housing."
A recent I.M.F. report said this reflects the Government's "disturbing tendency" to rush in where private enterprise treads in other countries.
The Israeli Government is spending huge amounts, for example, to build housing for immigrants. Tel Aviv has offered bonuses to builders for speeding up construction, has agreed to buy back unsold apartments and is offering immigrants cheap mortgages.
Though housing starts have quadrupled to about 80,000 a year, the Government's involvement has been extremely costly, Mr. Sadka said. A free-market solution -- letting a temporary shortage push up prices until supply catches up with demand -- would have been cheaper, he said.
The worst thing, Mr. Sadka said, is that the Government program "won't solve the housing problem." adding, "More houses are being built in the South, where there are no jobs, than in the North, where there are jobs."
Indeed, the Bank of Israel's latest report on the economy stated that it was "increasingly probable that the Government will have to honor a large proportion of its buy-back guarantees" on unsold apartments.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Hedging Bets on the Mark and Yen

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The dollar seems to be holding its own, despite new gloom about the economic recovery in the United States.
With the sudden burst of talk in Washington about a tax cut and the decline in durable goods orders in September, many people are wondering where the recovery is. 
 And as long as the upturn in the economy is in doubt, there will be downward pressure on the dollar because there is the possibility that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates again in an effort to give the economy a boost. When rates are cut in the United States, dollar-denominated investments become less attractive.
But the United States economy is ultimately expected to begin to grow while the economies of both Germany and Japan slow down. And this disparity more than offsets the whither-recovery downward pressure.
The economic slowdowns in Japan and in Germany are expected to prevent the dollar from taking a big dip below its recent low of about 1.65 marks to the dollar. The dollar closed on Friday at 1.7000 and recently reached about 1.7150.
At a conference in New York last week, David Morrison, the chief international economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company in London, said, "It would be a dangerous time for medium-term investors to buy Deutsche marks against the dollar."
He said that Germany's combination of a monetary policy featuring high interest rates along with heavy Government spending had propelled the mark to record highs against the dollar and that as this policy was undone, the mark would lose support.
Already, the Government is slowing its record spending. As the blending of the two Germanys moves ahead, the old East Germany shows some signs of new growth. And next year, with an economic slowdown in what was West Germany, the central bank, the Bundesbank, is expected to ease interest rates.
The yen never moved to the heights of the mark, but the Bank of Japan has followed a tight monetary policy that it is now being loosened as signals appear that the Japanese economy is losing momentum. This means the dollar will not strengthen as much against the yen as against the mark. But there is still an upward bias.
Mr. Morrison's view of the dollar is rather bullish. He expects it to be in a range of 1.64 marks to 1.82 marks three to six months from now. In a year to 18 months, he projects, the dollar will be more than 13 percent higher than it is now, in a range of 1.82 marks to 2.02 marks.
The risk of a decline in the dollar will be greatest in the next month or two, he said, because of the chance of a further cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Still, he projects that the dollar with remain in a range of 1.61 marks to 1.77 marks.
After that, he said, the dollar will move. "There are no fundamental barriers to the growth of the dollar," he said.
Part of Mr. Morrison's optimism is based on Goldman's expectation of a solid economic recovery in the United States. The firm's growth forecast, in fact, is more optimistic than the one the Bush Administration is apparently revising downward.
"I see the match," Robert Giordano, the director of economic research at Goldman, explained. He believes that relatively lean inventories mean business executives will have "to run to catch up" when demand is re ignited. And he disagrees with the stance of economists who argue that high debt levels, lagging consumer and business confidence and low income levels will keep the match of demand from being lighted.
Nicholas Sargen, chief investment officer for Global Fixed Income Advisers in New Jersey, is less sanguine about the pace of the recovery. But he is not worried about any sharp moves of the dollar in either direction. The dollar is protected from a steep decline, he said, by the slowdown in Germany and Japan and restrained from a sharp rise by the threat of a Fed interest rate cut.
All this adds up to a dollar that is, in his words, "fairly valued." And he believes that Americans who invest overseas face little risk from sharp moves in currency trading. That is a far cry from earlier this year when the dollar rose by nearly 30 percent and gains from investments abroad were cut to nothing or even to losses.
Until recently, Mr. Sargen was director of international bond research for Salomon Brothers, which meant he gave advice on how to invest. Now he is putting his analysis into action at Global, which is a subsidiary of Prudential. He favors bonds in Europe slightly over those in the United States, which gives him a currency exposure that would hurt him if the dollar rose sharply.
What is attractive about this bias in European bonds is that the fund can earn the higher European interest and not worry about a move in the dollar that would be strong enough to wipe out these gains.
He said that once he was assured the American recovery had begun, he would switch his portfolio so that he was better hedged against a rise in the dollar. "But it is too early to do that, with the uncertainty about the recovery and the moves of the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve," he said.

ECONOMY
 
How the U.S. Economy Is Handicapping Detroit
 
This is Detroit's worst year -- ever. The General Motors Corporation lost $1.1 billion and the Ford Motor Company lost $574.4 million in the third quarter. The Chrysler Corporation reports earnings this week and big losses are expected. Sales are down for Japanese auto makers, but most are still showing profits. "Don't blame this on Bob Stempel," said James Womack, co-author of "The Machine That Changed the World." Mr. Stempel is G.M.'s chairman. The problem, Mr. Womack says, is that as companies move to newer production techniques they are more vulnerable to the economy's ups and downs. The Japanese manage their economy better, he said, so their companies do better. "Lean production can't function in the extreme cyclicality that is normal in this country," he said. What will turn things around? "I can't see a way out without the Government stepping in. It's starting to happen with mini-vans."
 
Bad Timing for F.D.I.C. Chief
 
William Taylor took over as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last week. He may wish he hadn't. Just after his confirmation, the F.D.I.C. told Congress it was tripling its estimate of how much money it will need next year to protect the nation's bank deposits. Instead of a "mere" $3 billion, the F.D.I.C. said it will require $9.6 billion. In 1993, it will need $8.7 billion more. The F.D.I.C. estimates that more than 200 banks will fail next year with assets of about $86 billion. But the estimates assume the economy will grow at about 3.5 percent, which is unlikely. If it continues to limp along the fund could require as much as $28.9 billion over the next two years, the F.D.I.C. said. That casts a pall over the Administration's proposal to raise the F.D.I.C.'s credit line to $30 billion for two years. In a slow-growth economy -- with $28.9 billion needed -- there would be just $1.1 billion left to insure about $2.3 trillion of deposits -- not much of a safety net. It is now up to Mr. Taylor to mend that net.

A Big-Ticket Surprise
 
Durable goods are big-ticket items like refrigerators and railroad cars. They are supposed to last at least three years (some actually do). These big items are an important engine for the economy. But according to the Commerce Department, sales of these goods took a 3.2 percent slide in September after falling 4.1 percent in August. Economists were surprised; the consensus was that orders for durables would increase by 1 percent.

The Economy's Political Clout
 
After the coalition forces defeated Iraq in March, President Bush's popularity soared. But since then confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to manage the economy took the mother of all tumbles. According to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll released last week, 57 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is handling the economy. Sixty percent feel "things" have gotten "pretty seriously off on the wrong track." In January -- even as the gulf war loomed -- only 31 percent of all Americans thought so. The recent poll said 44 percent of Americans feel the country is in worse shape now than it was five years ago. With just 13 months left to the election, Mr. Bush had better hope the slow-growth economy has a quick rebound.

The 'Beige Book' Looks Bleak
 
The Federal Reserve's "beige book," released last week, was hardly a confidence builder. The book is a compilation of reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks. The book said the recovery had lost much of its oomph in September and early October. Retail sales were flat; factory output -- while improving -- was doing so at a laggardly pace. How will the Fed react to its own book? "It will cut the discount rate by Thanksgiving to about 4.5 percent," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Such a cut, he said, will drive money out of money-market accounts and into stocks.
 
A Whole New Telephone Game
 
The Federal Communications Commission proposed last week that local telephone companies be allowed to package and transmit video programs on their wires. With next-generation fiber-optics lines phone companies could offer a myriad of interactive services from entertainment libraries, recipe banks and educational programs, each tailored to a customer's needs. The $18 billion cable industry is likely to fight (unsuccessfully) against the ruling. "Among the top two or three concerns of every cable operator has always been head-to-head competition against local telephone companies," said John Mansell, of Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
End of an Era at Compaq
 
Legend has it Rod Canion wrote the business plan for the Compaq Computer Corporation on a napkin while seated in a Houston coffee shop. Six years after he founded Compaq, it was a $2 billion company dominating the portable-computer and I.B.M.-clone market and Mr. Canion was its chief executive. But though Compaq got off to a quick start in the 1980's, it has languished in the 1990's, losing market share to a new generation of clone makers. Early last week the company reported a loss of $70.3 million in the third quarter, its first ever, compared with a $123.6 million profit the year before. To cut costs, the company announced it would slash its work force by 1,400. Late in the week, Compaq raised the number to 1,401, when its board of directors relieved Mr. Canion of his job. Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's executive vice president, will take over.

Chase's Impressive Showing
 
Chase Manhattan managed to turn in a third-quarter profit of $136 million. For a company that was near the brink due to a huge portfolio of bad real estate and foreign loans, the turnaround reported last week was impressive. Chase, which had $630 million in losses for the same period a year ago, embarked on a massive cost-cutting program last year. That program -- coupled with lower interest rates, which gave the bank larger spreads between what it pays for money and what it charges -- helped make the company profitable. "Chase is turning itself around," said Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers.

Time Warner Inches Back
 
When Time Warner Inc. released its earnings reports last week, the big media company seemed to be limping its way back to health. True, Time Warner lost money -- $62 million in the third quarter -- but that was significantly less than the $91 million it lost in the comparable period the previous year. Revenue in the third quarter rose (somewhat) to $2.94 billion, from $2.90 billion a year ago. And some of the big media company's units, like the records group, showed genuine strength.

Prodigy Can Do No Right
 
A year ago Prodigy Services Company, one of the largest electronic bulletin boards and information services, got into trouble for screening the subscribers' messages. Rights groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, said Prodigy had no business censoring those communications. Last week, Prodigy got into trouble for not censoring its subscribers' messages. The Anti-Defamation League, a division of B'nai B'rith, accused the information service of failing to prohibit anti-Semitic messages some subscribers were putting on the company's electronic bulletin boards. The organization said that since Prodigy advertised itself as a "family service," it should keep certain messages off the screen. The A.C.L.U. disagreed. "The way to answer speech is with speech," said Jerry Berman, director of the A.C.L.U.'s technology information project.

The Clifford Defense
 
When Clark M. Clifford testified before Congress about his involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commercial International last week, he told the same story he has told twice before. He was deceived by B.C.C.I., the bank accused of wrongdoings such as working with terrorists and laundering money for drug lords. But a former B.C.C.I. official, Abdur Sakhai, told the committee earlier that Mr. Clifford, a former Defense Secretary, and Robert A. Altman, his law partner, knew about B.C.C.I.'s ownership of First American Bancshares, the Washington bank for which Mr. Clifford served as chairman. Mr. Clifford denied the accusations. "We have not violated any law," he said. "We have not committed any impropriety." Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, presented the witnesses with documents that he said seemed to tie them to B.C.C.I. and that suggested they knew who really owned First American. "Totally untrue," Mr. Clifford said of the charges.
 
Salomon Brothers Inc. estimated the profits it made from its illegal bidding in the Treasury securities market at between $17 million and $19.7 million.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Snatching the Soviet Purse
 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev borrowed an idea from Alexander Hamilton last week. The Soviet President decreed that the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs would be the sole agency responsible for servicing the country's foreign debts. The decree was approved by leaders of 10 republics eager to rid themselves of debts. But like Hamilton, Mr. Gorbachev was not making an altruistic gesture. By taking responsibility for foreign credits, the central Government in Moscow will also be at the center of any future borrowing. As Hamilton knew, power rests with the purse.

A Car of One's Own, Literally
 
Unlike previous shows, the companies that mounted displays at the Tokyo auto show last week highlighted their smaller, sportier and -- yes -- more frugal entrants into the market. Some, like Mazda's HR-X, were powered by hydrogen. Others were electric. But some attending the show said the car everyone wanted to see was not displayed: Saturn, made by G.M. in Tennessee. The Saturn is called America's import fighter.
 
The General Strike That Wasn't
 
When strikes were common in Italy, Italians joked that only when the country's union leaders went out on strike did everything work. No more. Italy is a smoothly running, smoothly growing country that recently surpassed Britain in per capita income and has little labor unrest. So last week, when the unions called a four-hour general strike to protest the budget-cutting plans of Prime Minister Giulio Adreotti, they met with meager success. A lot of workers went out -- but not enough to stop the country. And when they did go out, they were just as apt to grab a long lunch as to take to the streets.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Equity, Parity And Money

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
These are painful times for the minority business community.
"Minority businesses almost by definition are small, so the current economy is hurting them," said Harriet R. Michel, president of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, a New York-based network of 3,500 corporate purchasers and 15,000 minority-owned suppliers, vendors and contractors. "Their cash positions are thin and they are undercapitalized. That makes them extremely vulnerable." 
 Ms. Michel, 49, was busy last week overseeing the council's annual convention, which attracted some 1,500 people. She said about half of the 1.2 million minority-owned businesses in the country are suppliers of goods and services to corporations.
A job as head of a business networking group might seem incongruous for someone with Ms. Michel's activist and academic background. She has been, among other things, president of the New York Urban League, an official in the Labor Department during the Carter Administration and a fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
But she is also, with her husband, Yves Michel (pronounced mi-SHELL), the owner of parking garages and a taxi company in New York.
"This is an extension of what I've always done: addressing issues of equity and parity" in the minority community, she said. "The last unaddressed agenda is economic; we have political power and legislative power but not economic power."
Ms. Michel sees particular promise in what superficially looks like a contraction of opportunity: a feeling among many members of minority groups in corporations that they have hit the glass ceiling. Instead of sitting still, they are setting out on their own.
"This new group has advanced degrees and lots of skills," she said. "There is a great thirst for people to control their destiny. It's more important to have their own business than to be well employed by someone."

HEADLINE: Latvia Moves to Open an Air-Route Window on the West

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: RIGA, Latvia

 BODY:
In the two months since Latvia gained independence from the Soviet Union, Western airlines and investors have become keenly interested in the rights to fly to this Baltic capital at the center of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
The Latvians also have ambitious plans to form their own national airline as a joint venture with a foreign investor. But Latvia's concerns about how much control foreign investors might have and problems with a small, crumbling main passenger terminal threaten to stall plans to turn Riga into an air hub for the Baltics and the Soviet Union. 
 So far, Lufthansa, Swiss Air, El Al, Austrian Airlines, Hamburg Airlines, and even Malev Air, the Hungarian national airline, have all expressed interest in joining Scandinavian Airline System and the new United States-based Baltia Airlines in obtaining landing rights in Riga, according to the Transport Ministry.
"We are looking forward to the opening of these airlines and are very interested in cooperation with the West," said Janis Janovskis, Latvia's Minister of Transport.
The nucleus of the Latvia's new national airline would be the planes, staff and routes that make up the Latvian division of Aeroflot, soon to be turned over to Latvia by the Soviet Government. But the venture would also need Western investors' money, about $25 million of it.
A group of Houston-based investors say they have nearly completed negotions begun with the Latvian Government last spring to form the new national airline, to be known as Baltic International Airlines, though interviews here make it seem less than certain that the Texans will succeed.
According to Homi Davier, the head of the Houston group, and Girts Lejins, his lawyer in Riga, Baltic International would use Riga as its hub, to serve mainly European passengers bound for various parts of the Soviet Union. For a $25 million investment over five years, the Americans would receive a 45 percent interest in the new airline and Mr. Davier would become its president.
The new airline would receive from the Latvian division of Aeroflot up to 30 medium-size Soviet passenger jets, 400 pilots and the rights to fly to 76 cities in the Soviet Union. Thirty percent of ticket sales would be made in rubles or in the new Latvian currency, once it is introduced, so tickets would remain affordable for Latvians.
There are also plans for a joint venture between Riga's airport and the Americans to refurbish and expand the airport.
But several Latvian officials expressed reservations about signing the final agreement with the Houston investors. Ojars Blumbergs, chairman of the Latvian Parliament's Committee on Energy, Transport and Communications, said a foreign partner for the new airline should be chosen by bid.
Austris Zobens, the newly appointed Latvian director of the national airline, emphasized in an interview that a final agreement had not been signed with the American investors. He said that Latvia has a pressing need for financial and technical assistance, but expressed a hope that it would come in part from Western governments.
"The decision is up to the Latvian Government. I believe we have many opportunities and we must choose the best partner," Mr. Zobens said. "Only one thing can be said firmly. It will be difficult for us to have a good company without Western help."
Mr. Zobens also said, and other Latvian officials confirmed, that other investors have expressed an interest in forming a joint venture with the national airline.
Several Latvian Aeroflot employees wondered whether Latvians were being slighted in the proposed joint venture. One employee, who declined to give her name, said of the Americans, "They're just trying to get the best deal. Why should the president of the Latvian national airline be American? Is it fair?"
Even with an investor in place, the airline will have to overcome significant obstacles. Mr. Blumbergs acknowledged that most of the airport facilities the airline would use and the Aeroflot jets themselves are largely outmoded.
And Mr. Zobens, who would be a vice president in the airline and its senior Latvian executive, said that he lacks experience running an airline. He spent 15 years as an Aeroflot pilot and two years as the head of a small civilian airport on the outskirts of Riga before assuming his current post.
Still, the Latvians sense they are sitting atop a potentially lucrative capitalistic enterprise. Mr. Blumbergs said that the airline's routes to 76 cities in the Soviet Union would increase in value as more Westerners travel and do business in the Soviet Union.
"There will be a lot of confusion in the Russian economy in the next few years," he predicted. "It's important that Latvian Aeroflot take advantage of these routes and exploit the opportunity that the poor quality of Aeroflot's other divisions presents us with."
But exploiting such opportunities will also require a modern, competitive airport in Riga. While the city is ideally situated, a tour of what will soon become Riga International Airport revealed the enormous task the Latvians and a Western partner face.
The airport now handles a million passengers a year and has 20 daily domestic flights and 5 international flights each week. SAS, the only foreign airline, has two flights a week to Copenhagen.
"The airport was built in 1974 as a domestic airport and little maintenance has been done on it since then, except for the addition of the control tower," said Vilnas Azas, the airport's new director.
His most immediate problem is the terminal's leaky roof. "In most international airports you have leaks, but not in all parts of the roof all day. It must be completely replaced," he said.
The main terminal has few gates, which seem destined to invite long, Soviet-style lines. Serving possibly eight foreign airlines with a single international gate would require tricky scheduling. With only two baggage claim areas, two working fuel trucks, no hangars for passenger jets, and one customs area for passengers entering and leaving Latvia, drastic changes would have to be made to accommodate more Western airlines, Mr. Azas said.
Riga International will also have to cope with the attitudes of 300 airport employees. "Our employees must learn to smile and keep smiling all day," Mr. Azas said. "I see a big problem in changing our staff's mentality and pushing them up to a Western service level."
Mr. Azas, a 37-year-old former Aeroflot navigator, said he had seen only three Western airports: JFK in New York, Montreal and Stockholm.
"I am not afraid of my lack of knowledge of this kind of business," he said. "I realize that there is a huge task in front of me, but I want to complete it. I want to make this airport good enough to be one of the best in Europe," he said.

HEADLINE: Three Whiz Kid Economists of the 90's, Pragmatists All

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Economists make youth a prerequisite for winning one of the profession's top honors, the John Bates Clark Medal. "We tend to think that everything important is done early," said Paul Samuelson, who won the first Clark Medal, in 1947 at the age of 32, and like five others went on to garner a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
Most economists already know who this year's Clark Medal winner is -- indeed, committee members at the American Economics Association, which makes the award, have sent him congratulatory notes -- although medal traditions preclude a formal announcement until January. 
 He is Paul R. Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an expert on international economics. The favorite for the next biennial award is Lawrence H. Summers a Harvard professor who is currently in Washington serving as chief economist at the World Bank and was once an adviser to Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
A third overachiever who might have been in the Clark Medal race, Harvard's Jeffrey D. Sachs, effectively took himself out of the running by deciding that saving the economies of Latin America and Eastern Europe was more important than churning out scholarly articles, another requisite for the Clark.
All three can claim remarkable accomplishments and influence far beyond the walls of academia. All reflect the ways in which economics is changing, in style as well as substance. All are part of a countervailing current that contrasts with the highly abstract, Olympian, laissez-faire brand of economics that dominated the nation's universities in the 1970's and early 80's.
They are also likely to be around for a while. The graybeard of this group, Paul Krugman, has just turned 38.
Mr. Krugman, an elegant theorist, has re-written the book on global trade and finance, a field better known for received wisdom than lively innovation. He did so by inventing a theory, based on imperfections in the way markets function, that helps to explain why countries exchange similar goods, why protectionism can sometimes lead to lasting advantages and why a system positioned between completely fixed and freely floating monetary exchange rates can work.
"Paul is to international economics what I.B.M. is to computers," said one admirer.
Then there is Mr. Summers, 36, dubbed by one Clark selection committee member "a phenomenon," the rare economist who is equally at home in the ivory tower of pure theory and the down-and-dirty world of policy. Instead of turning a single subject on its head, Mr. Summers has cut a swath through half-a-dozen disciplines with clever, mostly contrarian contributions, like his finding that making it too cheap and easy to trade securities can be bad for the economy.
His colleague Jeffrey Sachs, also 36, is a virtuoso of still another stripe. Since the mid-80's, Mr. Sachs has made transformation of populist or socialist economies like Bolivia, Poland and, more recently, the Soviet Union his personal crusade. For this he won the prestigious Seidman political economy prize, an annual award whose past winners include Nobel laureates Gunnar Myrdal, Robert Solow and James Buchanan. But despite several important articles on 1970's stagflation and 1980's third world debt, Mr. Sachs probably has not produced enough pure scholarship to be a serious Clark contender.
Nobody makes as big a splash as these three without provoking criticism. Some economists simply think that there are other, equally gifted, economists who are getting far less attention. "Summers is advising Lithuania. Taylor, a really good conservative economist, is advising the United States," said Robert E. Lucas Jr., chairman of the University of Chicago economics department, referring to John Taylor, until recenly a member of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisors. "That's about the right division of labor between those two guys."
Some finance experts dismiss Mr. Summers's enthusiasm for taxing stock trades, saying such a policy has few benefits and many costs. Free traders resent the fact that Mr. Krugman's arguments have lent intellectual respectability to old-fashioned protectionism. Liberals often blame Mr. Sachs's economic shock therapy in countries like Bolivia and Poland for causing mass unemployment. "If the Bolivian Government decided to wipe out the tin miners, they could have done it without Jeff Sachs," said Lance Taylor, an economist at M.I.T.
Today's young superstars have much more in common with one another than with the superstars of a decade ago, many of whom are high-wire mathematical geniuses and laissez-faire theorists at the universities of Chicago and Minnesota. The previous generation tended to be proponents of rational expectations, a theory that holds that Washington's efforts to boost economic growth through fiscal or monetary policy are doomed to failure.
By contrast, the three young Cambridge, Mass., economists are on terra firma. "Each one is someone who thinks economics is to be used in analyzing real-world problems and finding solutions." said Stanley Fischer, an economist at M.I.T.
The three share a strong desire to make models fit facts. Mr. Summers's articles are brimming with data. Even Mr. Krugman's work, the most academic of the three, fits this reality-checking mode. Mr. Krugman proposed his new trade theory, for example, after observing that most global trade didn't fit conventional models. "I discovered a lot of contrary evidence that had accumulated in search of a theory," he said. "One of my principals ever since has been 'Listen to the people outside the mainstream.' "
Such fact-grubbing is complemented with a passion for history. "It's a data bank to draw on," Mr. Sachs said. His insistence that debt relief for countries like Bolivia and Poland made sense was partly based on the fact that in the past creditors have never insisted that essentially bankrupt nations repay their loans in full.
To varying degrees, the three see more scope for activist government intervention than do the Chicago and Minnesota economists. Partly for that reason, they are sometimes called neo-Keynesians, influenced by the British economist John Maynard Keynes, the patron saint of those who believe in economic intervention.
Mr. Krugman allows that some very limited industrial policy might be justified. Mr. Summers sees scope for government meddling with corporate taxes to stimulate investment. And Mr. Sachs contends that aid and active engagement by the West are critical to helping reform-minded governments overseas survive.
It would be a mistake, however, to view the three economists as younger incarnations of John Kenneth Galbraith, who thinks that markets often don't work, or even the liberal 1960's Keynesians like Paul Samuelson at Harvard or James Tobin at Yale.
"Larry's generation re-emphasized the importance of markets and the failures of government," said Anita Arrow Summers, Mr. Summers's mother, an economist who recently retired from the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania.
What was Mr. Krugman's reaction upon hearing that he had won the Clark Medal and that his nomination letters compared his scholarly articles to Japanese haiku, Emily Dickinson's poems and Henri Matisse's drawings? Ninety seconds of elation followed by hours of depression, he said. "I was concerned about my creative juices. I wondered whether I could keep it up."
Few people share Mr. Krugman's anxiety on that score. Even at unlikly moments, Mr. Krugman ideas flow. His ideas on the role of historical accident in shaping economic geography was sparked by a board game based on the evolution of the American economy that his wife, Robin Bergman, gave him.
The standard view when he came on the scene was that countries traded because they have different, more or less naturally endowed resources and tastes, that free trade was almost always ideal and that fixed exchange-rate systems were fatally flawed.
Mr. Krugman demonstrated that technology and the dominance of many industries by a few firms explained most trade between similarly endowed nations. He showed that countries could benefit by pursuing strategic trade policies, like import protection and export subsidies.
As dissatisfaction with floating exchange rates grew in the 80's and governments took steps -- like the European Monetary System -- to reduce currency fluctuations, Mr. Krugman proved that currency target zones were inherently stable.
An only child, Mr. Krugman grew up mostly on Long Island. His mother describes him as a dreamy boy who loved history and played for hours with toy soldiers. "Paul staged the battle of Gettysburg and then he loved to lecture us about it," she recalled.
Mr. Krugman got interested in economics at Yale, earned his doctorate at M.I.T. and eventually wound up on the M.I.T. faculty. Ms. Bergman, his wife, is a painter turned clothing designer and knitter. "Our working styles are very similar," she said. "We work in our heads a lot. We're not overly impressed with technique. We're more interested in a unifying theme."
Jeffrey Sachs has preached the virtues of free markets to Bolivian union militants, the new leaders of the Russian Republic and, yes, even the Pope.
While most of his colleagues were vacationing on Cape Cod last summer, Mr. Sachs was shuttling between Mongolia, which is privatizing the national herd of 24 million yaks; Slovenia, whose newly independent government is trying create a capitalist economy with close ties to Western Europe, and Poland, where the economic reforms of the Solidarity government face a critical electoral test today.
More and more of his attention in recent weeks has focused on helping the Russian government devise a plan to revive its economy. And from time to time, he looks in on Argentina and other Latin debtor nations.
"These societies are at a fundamental crossroads with one fork leading to political and economic chaos and the other way leading them back to being a prosperous part of the world economy," said Mr. Sachs. "That's very captivating."
When possible, his wife, Sonia Ehrlich, a Harvard-educated pediatrician who describes herself as "a happily married single parent," and his two children, Adam, 6, and Lisa, 9, tag along. The last Sachs family trip took them to Athens, Budapest and Warsaw.
The Sachs philosophy rests on a set of interconnected convictions.
One is that, contrary to populist dogma, workers and entrepreneurs, not government, create prosperity. "Economists, spoiled by a bastardization of Keynes, often talk as if all you had to do is turn a dial marked 'economic growth,' " said Mr. Sachs.
Another conviction is that government's job is to create a framework for growth, namely stable prices, a convertible currency, private ownership and legally enforceable private contracts.
A third Sachs idea, the one that originally attracted wide attention, is that debt forgiveness for struggling third world debtors is not only just and necessary but ultimately in the best interests of the creditors.
Being an outspoken advocate for underdogs is part of the Sachs family tradition. A Democrat, his father is a prominent labor lawyer from Detroit who has argued several cases before the Supreme Court.
But some bemoan Mr. Sachs's decision not to become a cloistered researcher. "He was clearly capable of doing pretty important work, but I don't think he did it," said Robert Barro, another Harvard colleague. "It's a major loss."
Mr. Sachs's reaction is characteristically impatient. "I do not believe in the life cycle model that says an economist ought to be isolated and insulated until age 60. I know I get better at this having confronted real problems." He adds: "With my views on what's important in economics, getting the Seidman prize was delicious."
A purposeful pursuit of objectives was evident long before Larry Summers set foot in Washington. A favorite story of his mother is about her son at about age 10 when she sent him off to a tennis tournament with a casual, "Have fun, Larry."
Young Summers reappeared at the the door. "Fun? Fun? It's 90 degrees and you think I'm going for fun?"
"O.K., Larry, O.K.," she said. "Go win."
Said James Poterba, a colleague at Harvard and one of Mr. Summers's many co-authors, "Larry has always had a clear idea of what he wants to do and how. He finds a unique, clear image of what he wants to say, how he wants to argue, what the supporting data and modeling will have to look like."
Mr. Summers came to economics from a remarkable family. Two of his uncles are Nobel laureates and both of his parents, lively and articulate, are also economists. Mr. Summers was offered a full professorship at Harvard before he had even finished his doctoral dissertation. To the surprise of his liberal parents, he followed Martin Feldstein to Washington for a year when the latter became President Reagan's chief economic adviser. He and his wife, Victoria, are the parents of 13-month-old twins, Ruth and Pamela. Mrs. Summers, an attorney and professor, is one of his many co-authors.
Indeed, Mr. Summers has produced an unusual number of eye-catching papers.
Although he has weighed in on everything from the effect of welfare programs on poverty to the role of machinery investment in economic growth, his main work has focused on unemployment, the taxation of capital and, recently, the behavior of the stock market. And like Mr. Krugman, Mr. Summers won attention by taking aim at conventional wisdom. "I always preferred to not be 100 percent certain of a world view," Mr. Summers said, "but relate to what's happening instead."
In the late 70's, when conventional wisdom said that unemployment wasn't a problem because most jobless spells only lasted a few weeks, Mr. Summers showed that while most episodes were indeed short, there existed a hard core of the unemployed that experienced many such short spells.
"Larry's biggest impact is that he has showed by example that you can be a superstar doing applied economics," said Andrei Schleifer, a Harvard colleague. "Larry is probably the most influential teacher in economics since Bob Solow."
Added Mr. Barro of Harvard, "You don't exactly see a home run, but when you add it all up you have a strong body of work. It's pretty clear that the favorite for the next Clark Medal is Larry."

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
The New OS/2: Impressive Rival for Windows

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation formally introduced the second generation of its beleaguered OS/2 operating system software last week at the Comdex fall trade show here. Company officials say it will be available in March 1992 -- even though I.B.M. had all but promised it would be ready by the end of the year. The officials said they decided to postpone the release after receiving requests for new features from many of the 20,000 I.B.M. customers who have been testing the software.
"In the larger scheme of things, three months doesn't matter very much," said Amy Wohl, president of Wohl & Associates of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., a consulting company. "But it is going to cost I.B.M. dearly in terms of marketing momentum. The big mistake they made was in being so firm about shipping by the end of the year, and then deciding to add to the feature set." 
 Discussions of the release date should not obscure the many virtues of the new software, which appears to be far superior to Windows on a technical level. In fact, OS/2 2.0 can run Windows software without modification, along with DOS and previous versions of OS/2 software.
"It's a better DOS than DOS, a better Windows than Windows, and a better OS/2 than OS/2 version 1.3," said Lee Reiswig, general manager of I.B.M.'s system software development effort. That's easy for him to say. But in demonstrations here, Mr. Reiswig showed how OS/2 2.0 can run the DOS-based Wordperfect word processor in one window on screen, Microsoft's Windows-based Excel spreadsheet in another, an OS/2 1.3 communications program in a third window, and a new OS/2 2.0 application in a fourth window, with all programs active at the same time. This ability is called multitasking, and it is one of the great advantages of OS/2 over DOS. Users can grab information from one application and easily paste it into another.
What will be central to the acceptance of OS/2 2.0 is the availability of useful application software, like database managers and spreadsheets, that take specific advantage of its 32-bit operating system. I.B.M.'s chief personal computer executive, James Cannavino, said more than 700 OS/2 2.0 applications from 500 different software companies are in the works.
"The key is, when do those 700 applications ship?" said John McCarthy, a senior analyst with Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. "If it's dribbleware, they're doomed."
John A. Soyring, an OS/2 manager, responded that 25 to 30 percent of the anticipated 700 programs will be ready within 30 days after the operating system ships in March. The Lotus Development Corporation and the Wordperfect Corporation were among those vowing early support for OS/2 2.0.
As a 32-bit operating system, OS/2 2.0 is capable of processing information at double the rate of DOS, Windows and earlier versions of OS/2. Overall system performance will not double, because many other factors are involved, but in general, 32-bit software will operate much more quickly than 16-bit software running on identical machines.
The drawback, at least for most users, is that OS/2 2.0 requires a lot of overhead in order to be able to juggle such tasks. Mr. Reiswig said the new operating system will require a minimum configuration of a 386SX microprocessor, 4 megabytes of random access memory and a 60-megabyte hard disk. Companies are notorious for understating operating system requirements, so plan on a fast 386- or 486-based system, 8MB of memory and at least 100MB of disk storage. Very few computers on office desktops have such features, although they are increasingly common on new machines.
OS/2 needs such hardware support because it is essentially three operating systems rolled into one. It will come on 13 diskettes, and will consume anywhere from 18 to 30 megabytes of hard disk space, depending on which features are installed. In other words, it needs half the hard disk space on a PC equipped with a 40- or 60-megabyte hard disk -- a demand that may cause many users to balk. Yet many people who use Windows today are giving up almost as much of their disks without realizing it.
Some major software developers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude before committing programming resources to the 32-bit version of OS/2. Borland International Inc., which earlier this year signed an agreement to work with I.B.M. in the development of 32-bit OS/2 programming tools, was noncommittal on future plans for OS/2 versions of its Paradox and dBASE database managers and its Quattro Pro spreadsheet.
As rewritten, OS/2 is expected to appeal to individuals and small-business users as well as to the large corporate customers that are I.B.M.'s traditional power base. With the necessary hardware, OS/2 2.0 appears to be attractive even if it is used merely as a replacement for DOS (suggested list price will be $195, or $149 for current users of DOS or OS/2, I.B.M. officials said). And it is much easier to use than DOS, thanks to a new graphical set of commands called the Workplace Manager.
The Workplace Manager makes it much easier to manage applications, files and printers. To print a document, for example, the user selects an icon representing the file and, using a mouse, drags it over to an icon representing a printer. Click. That's it. Even the installation process has been transformed by graphics. Users choose which OS/2 features they want by clicking on boxes on a checklist. To save space, for example, a user might not care to install the built-in PS/2 games, or the simple spreadsheet. The memory requirements of each feature are listed, which is helpful.
Strategically, this OS/2 should be a useful weapon for I.B.M., which has been desperate to hold off the onslaught of Windows. Windows clearly has the momentum, outselling OS/2 by more than 10 to 1 and winning over many independent software developers who might have built new spreadsheets, data bases and other applications for OS/2.
I.B.M.'s decision to postpone OS/2 2.0's release was helped by Microsoft's recent decision to delay the introduction of the next release of Windows, version 3.1, an improved 16-bit system, until spring.
Microsoft and I.B.M. had once been partners on OS/2, each vowing in 1987 that OS/2 would be the foundation for personal computing in the 1990's. But customers shunned OS/2, saying it was too hard to use, lacked suitable applications and required more computing power than most desktops had.
While Microsoft shifted its focus to Windows, a less-advanced and more easily used system, I.B.M. steadfastly clung to OS/2. The rift was so great that the two former allies are now adversaries. I.B.M. assumed total control of OS/2 last year, and Microsoft embarked on a strategy to build an advanced Windows operating system called NT, a 32-bit system, for delivery next year.

HEADLINE: Too American for Its Own Good?

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: TORRANCE, Calif.

 BODY:
In Yukiyasu Togo's first overseas assignment for the Toyota Motor Corporation 20 years ago, he donned the saffron robes of a Buddhist monk and begged in the streets of Bangkok so he could understand the Thai people. When he was transferred to Canada five years later, he sold cars door-to-door in order to learn English and understand the Canadian mindset. Finally in 1983 Toyota decided what its American workers needed most was a cheerleader, so Mr. Togo moved to the company's United States headquarters here, just south of Los Angeles, and began conducting pep rallies and handing out bonus checks, which have since become known as Togo bucks.
Mr. Togo's chameleon-like management style, so unusual for a senior Japanese executive, has proved particularly adaptive in the United States, igniting the enthusiasm of Toyota's work force and dealers. 
 During his eight years as president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, the company has vastly expanded its model lineup -- including moving upscale in 1989 with the Lexus luxury brand -- and become the biggest-selling foreign auto maker in the United States, posting sales of more than one million vehicles last year. Along with the Honda Motor Company, Toyota has already surpassed the beleaguered Chrysler Corporation in car sales; when trucks and mini-vans are figured in, Chrysler is still the third-largest in the country, behind General Motors and Ford, but Toyota is closing in.
At a time when Japanese-American trade relations are increasingly fractious, success on such a scale can spell big problems as well as big revenues. Indeed, Toyota's relentless growth has helped to unleash a political storm in Washington.
The Big Three auto makers, smarting from a weak economy and gains by Toyota, Honda and other Japanese competitors, are applying unprecedented pressure on Washington for protection. As the election year approaches, talk is being heard once more of proposals to restrict Japan's share of the American market. The situation was not helped by a spate of bad news last week: G.M. and Ford reported combined losses of nearly $1.7 billion for the third quarter and sales of domestically produced cars by the Big Three were off 16.7 percent in mid-October from the same period in 1990.
 
A Prime Target
 As the Japanese auto maker with the greatest clout in the United States, Toyota would be the prime target of any American reprisals, even though its sales have also been hurt of late by the lingering economic malaise.
"The momentum that is developing against import car companies is going to fall the hardest on Toyota, because it is No. 1," said Richard Recchia, executive vice president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America in Cypress, Calif.
All of which means that for political purposes, Toyota must slow down -- or at least give that impression -- or risk being pulled over by Washington.
But slowing down isn't a simple matter. For one thing, Toyota is going too fast to ease off at a pace that would satisfy many critics. For another, the company may not want to cut growth, despite the risks, when market share is there for the taking by Japanese competitors who are not as much in the limelight. Finally, Mr. Togo and his executive vice president, Bob McCurry, have been so hard-driving that it simply may not be in their natures to drop to a lower gear.
Both Mr. Togo, who is 67 years old, and Mr. McCurry, who is 68, are expected to step down from active management sometime next summer. That has sparked a lively debate within Toyota about just how coy the company should be in pressing forward for more American customers and dealers.
Where the debate will take Toyota is not clear. What is clear is that the company has been issuing mixed messages about its intentions, with a lot riding on which message Washington chooses to hear.
George Borst, who is in charge of Toyota's strategic planning for the United States, has been one of those voicing a conciliatory line. Three weeks ago in Detroit, he introduced the 1992 model lineup as the product of a "kinder, gentler" Toyota. He professed to be pleased that Toyota, because of capacity constraints, would actually lose market share to the Big Three next year if the economy improved. Toyota, he said, has abandoned its goal of 1.5 million United States car and truck sales, or 10 percent of the market, by 1995. It now has 8 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for Honda and 12 for Chrysler.
The 10 percent goal "was just a rallying cry," Mr. Borst said. "We don't really have the production capacity to get there anyway."
Yet at the annual dealer meeting in New Orleans last month, Mr. Togo punctuated a rousing speech with his trademark slogan: "Sell, sell, sell like hell." Mr. McCurry, who earned the nickname Captain Crunch for his handling of dealers and subordinates who miss their sales objectives, hasn't shown any signs of mellowing either: "I'm the meat grinder," he said in a recent interview.
 
Big Push for a Pickup
 Dealers, meanwhile, have been lobbying Toyota to proceed with production of a large pickup truck, a pet project that Mr. Togo and Mr. McCurry recommended to top management. The pickup truck, which has been designed specifically for the American market, is ready to go: It has been engineered and a prototype has been built. But the brain trust in the parent company's headquarters back home in Nagoya is nervous. Senior executives are concerned that a large-truck model could maim the Big Three, which derive a disproportionate share of their profits from the full-size pickup market segment. The danger of political retribution would be increased.
The Big Three's high profit margins in large pickups stem precisely from the fact that they have not had Japanese competition in that segment. The new pickup truck, if approved, would be portrayed by Toyota as posing little or no threat to Ford's F-100, Chevy's C/K series and the less dominant Dodge Dakota midsize model from Chrysler, which together account for about 1.2 million sales a year.
"If we brought them in, it would be less than 80,000 annually," Mr. Borst said of the large pickups, sounding almost apologetic. "They're bigger than compact trucks but not full size. We're not trying to attract owners away from G.M. or Ford; we're just trying to create a vehicle for the owners of our compact trucks who need more room."
Toyota has good reason to worry about retaliation. In response to Big Three instigation, the Bush Administration earlier this year started a dumping investigation against Japanese importers of mini-vans. The Treasury Department has also been auditing Honda to assure that its Canadian-built cars meet local content requirements.
But the most ominous development is on the legislative front. Senator Donald Riegle, Democrat from Michigan, Representative Richard Gephardt, Democrat from Missouri, and other lawmakers friendly to the domestic auto industry and the United Automobile Workers union are writing legislation that would limit Japanese vehicle sales to a fixed percentage of the United States market, including Japanese vehicles produced in the United States at so-called transplant factories. The idea gained steam last summer after the European Community passed an automotive market-share cap of 16 percent against Japan, including transplant production, through 1999. The Japanese already have nearly 25 percent of the American market.
 
Apologies and Anger
 Publicly, Toyota has been trying to mollify its critics. "We have been too ignorant of and too apathetic about the feelings that our growing influence arouses in people and nations around the world," said Shoichiro Toyoda, the company's president, in a speech earlier this month in New York before the Japan Society. "Overwork and overachieving without regard for our fellow humans does no good for anyone."
Privately, however, Toyota executives are fuming. They don't think a market-share limit has much chance to become law in the United States. But they fear the Bush Administration may have no choice but to pursue dumping investigations and other trade actions more aggressively to relieve election-year pressure exerted by Congressional Democrats. The Lexus brand might be a juicy target for a dumping investigation, as Big Three executives have long insisted that Toyota is selling the luxury vehicle for less than what it costs in Japan.
The irony, according to Toyota executives, is that they have comported themselves exactly as Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, suggested they should in the early 1980's. At first, the Japanese acquiesced under Government pressure to curbs on imports. Then, when imports continued to take sales away from the Big Three, Mr. Iacocca challenged the Japanese to build plants in the United States.
Toyota and the other Japanese auto makers did that and much more, including opening research laboratories in which American engineers and planners develop new models.
"One of the great tragedies is that there has been too little education about what Japanese auto makers have done in terms of jobs and investments" for the United States economy, said Mr. Recchia of Mitsubishi.
Toyota now has a multifaceted American presence, with a sprawling network of assembly plants, technical schools, research labs and 1,300 Toyota and Lexus dealers, not to mention a corporate contributions program that donates about $10 million a year to local institutions. Toyota directly employs 17,000 people in the United States, and 55,000 work for its franchised dealers here. Moreover, its purchases of American-made parts have increased fivefold since 1986.
The problem, from Detroit's point of view, is that as Toyota and the others have become more Americanized, they have taken even more of the market from the Big Three.
Now, Mr. Iacocca wants a market-share cap, ostensibly as punishment for the trade deficit with Japan and weak sales of American models there.
 
'Confidence Is Down'
 Mr. Togo seems more sad than angry about Detroit's hostility. "Unfortunately, Detroit Big Three used to have a strong confidence," he said. "I think the confidence is down. G.M., Ford and Chrysler have potential but it is not properly done. The American car man in Japan is not trying hard enough," he said, adding that few American models exported to Japan are equipped with right-hand drive.
Though Toyota has not named the next head of its United States operations, it is a safe bet he won't be another Mr. Togo, who is quite unlike the typically reserved, understated Japanese executive. Gregarious and informal, Mr. Togo encourages everyone to call him Yuki. His business card -- round, not rectangular -- carries a sketch of his smiling face. His rallies at headquarters often are capped by the announcement that everyone is getting a $50 bonus -- the celebrated Togo bucks.
 
The Camry Challenge
 Toyota's 1992 Camry, introduced last month, typifies the Americanization that Mr. Togo has pursued. It also reflects the aggressive approach that has brought Toyota success while drawing Detroit's ire.
The new model, built in Georgetown, Ky., as well as in Japan, is a dramatic redesign of what has long been a popular compact car.
Like many early Toyota models, the new Camry would have reflected more Japanese than American taste. But Mr. Togo and Mr. McCurry made sure that did not happen.
Visiting Japan three years ago to inspect the Camry's final clay model, they were crestfallen by what they saw: The sides of the car were flat, causing the vehicle to appear stiff and square, a far cry from the elliptical styling that was becoming popular. And the model needed another two inches of shoulder room for heftier Western bodies.
Sure that the new Camry was wrong for American customers, the executives delivered their frank assessment to Dr. Toyoda. "That sort of thing just isn't done," recalled Mr. McCurry. "We really bent some noses."
Nonetheless, Dr. Toyoda heeded his executives' advice. Within 30 days, a new clay model was constructed. New tooling was ordered. Last summer, Toyota rolled out its first bifurcated car model ever: one Camry for Japan, a second, specially styled Camry for America.
Like the pickup truck, the new Camry represents a significantly enhanced threat to the Big Three. Early reviews of the vehicle have been overwhelmingly positive. In redesigning the car, Toyota enlarged it from compact to mid-size class, thus positioning it as a true competitor for the Ford Taurus, Chevy Lumina and the new Chrysler mid-size models due next summer, which are a key to Chrysler's survival. Like pickup trucks, mid-size cars have been an important profit maker because Japanese competition has been scant -- until Honda's enlarged Accord and now the Camry.
A second Camry assembly line that is being built in Georgetown will double United States production capacity to 400,000 mid-size cars annually by 1994 or 1995.
Mr. Borst tried to throw cold water on Detroit's speculation that Toyota wants Camry to displace Accord as the best-selling car model in the United States. That cachet is not only important for ego gratification; it strengthens brand image, increases profit margins and helps sell more cars.
"Our goal is for Camry to be the most desired car, not the best-selling," Mr. Borst insisted.
That type of posturing will become increasingly more difficult for future Toyota leaders. With other Japanese brands nipping at its heels and dealers pressing for more and better models, Toyota may have little choice but to keep doing what it does best -- Detroit, and Washington, notwithstanding.

 
 
A Manager With a Feel for the Grass Roots
 Unlike many Japanese executives assigned to work in the United States, Yukiyasu Togo has had little trouble embracing American culture or building relationships with American colleagues.
Indeed, Mr. Togo has no thought of returning to Japan next year when he retires from active management. He is building a house in Kona, Hawaii, where he can play his stereo at a decibel level that would surely prompt angry complaints in a crowded Japanese neighborhood.
"People in Japan say, 'Yuki, you are an American,' " he said. "Quite an honor to be called an American."
Mr. Togo's self-immersion in the day-to-day operations of Toyota's American workers and dealers is consistent with the auto maker's goal to weave itself ever more deeply into the fabric of the American automotive business.
"I do not like the ivory tower,"
Mr. Togo said. "My career is always on the front line."
Mr. Togo's transfer to the United States in 1983 was at once the pinnacle of his automotive career and a demotion. In Canada he had reached the level of Toyota senior managing director. But Toyota didn't promote him to one of the four Tokyo-based executive vice president posts, the level just below chief executive.
This didn't bother him at all, he insisted. He was just as happy to work at a grass-roots level, where "human beings learn to understand one another."
David Shepherd, a Toyota dealer in Fort Scott, Kan., was witness to this belief. Mr. Shepherd sells only about 200 Toyotas annually, compared with about 20,000 for Toyota's largest dealership, owned by Roger Penske, in El Monte, Calif.
Nevertheless, Mr. Shepherd was astonished to receive a huge potted plant from Mr. Togo at his dealership's grand opening in 1988. "My family has been in the car business almost 30 years -- we have many different franchises -- and that was the first gesture like that from any auto company," Mr. Shepherd said.
 
 
 
Targeting The Heartland
 A big reason for Toyota's growth in United States sales and market penetration has been its aggressive pursuit of Midwestern buyers.
In the last five years, the company has added 140 dealers nationwide, giving it about 1,300 in all, including the 100 or so that sell the Lexus. More than one-third of the new locations -- 53 -- are in the Midwest, principally in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Kansas City and Chicago.
The results have been encouraging, if not yet overwhelming.
"Some of these points will sell 1,000 vehicles a year, some 300," said Irving Miller, Toyota's manager of new dealerships, who is looking for more growth soon.
"I think with the new Camry, which is a mid-size car, we're going to attract the Midwestern buyer," he said. The Camry had been a compact model.
The Midwest also will be an important market for a large pickup truck, if Toyota decides to offer it.
There had been little incentive to take on the Midwest, home of the Big Three, when Toyota was selling every vehicle it could import on both coasts and throughout the Sunbelt. But by opening plants in the United States, Toyota started to produce enough extra vehicles to make it worthwhile to find new opportunities.
One of Toyota's concerns initially was that anti-Japanese bias might be strong in small Midwestern towns and farming communities.
David Shepherd, a Toyota dealer in Fort Scott, Kan., since 1988, recalled hearing some people say they would not buy Toyota products because of Japan's role in World War II. But such feelings have subsided during the last two years, he said.
"Toyota has made a genuine effort to be considered an American car company," Mr. Shepherd said. "We explain to people that Toyota makes Camrys in Kentucky and trucks in California."

Admission Policy Blind to Finances Will Be Retained

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
The Amherst College president, Peter R. Pouncey, announced last week that the college will be able to retain its "need-blind" admission policy, despite earlier predictions by him and the trustees that the only methods of insuring the college's financial security would be either to eliminate need-blind admission or to require students to repay or work off a larger proportion of their financial aid awards.
The announcement came after two forums in the last month at which students press trustees and administrators to retain the need-blind policy, in which applicants are considered for admission regardless of their ability to pay. Students who are accepted then receive aid packages based on financial need. Approximately 45 percent of the student body now receives financial assistance from the college, which will spend $8.5 million on financial aid this year. 
 In a letter to the college community, Mr. Pouncey said, "The problem arose because the financial aid budget showed signs of spiraling out of control into increasing deficit -- $384,000 last year and $520,000 in the current budget." But the letter continues, "Need-blind admission will be retained by the college, by dint of some careful economies and adjustments elsewhere in the budget."
Among the adjustments, the letter continues, is a decision by the board to resolve the budget deficit over a two-year period, rather than in one year as had originally been intended. Students receiving financial aid will be asked to secure $570 more than currently required through loans and jobs, and Amherst's nonsalary expenditures will be held to an increase of less than 1 percent in next year's budget. The college will budget a 4.5 percent increase in financial aid, bringing total aid expenditures to a projected $8.9 million, Mr. Pouncey said in the letter.
Lisa Grumet, an organizer of the Financial Aid Coalition, a coalition of student groups that has pressed the college to retain its need-blind policy, said she was surprised by the move. "We're very happy about the announcement," she said.
But Ms. Grumet, a senior in American studies from Albany, said her group still had a number of concerns including the size of the increase in the financial aid budget, the additional burden of larger loans and work-study requirements on financial aid recipients, and the length of the college's commitment to a need-blind policy.
Ms. Grumet added that although student pressure could not be held directly accountable for the policy decision, "I think that students did have an impact in causing the trustees to think about it again."
In an interview, Mr. Pouncey said the trustees realized that it would be "extremely difficult" to make up the deficit in one year and remain competitive in the size and composition of financial aid packages. And while he played down the effect of student protests, he said, "The force of concern shown by students" at an Oct. 3 trustee-student forum "may have prompted a kind of gentleness of response."

HEADLINE: Restore the Road to Democracy

BYLINE: By Jean-Bertrand Aristide; Jean-Bertrand Aristide is President of Haiti.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
During these days of anguish and sorrow, the Haitian people find comfort in the generous support of the United States and the world community. The unanimous condemnation of the Sept. 29 military coup has earned our gratitude.
But as news of massacres and repression slip off the front pages, there is a danger that active support will wane, and with it the hopes and dreams of the Haitian people for democracy. 
 We have paid a high price for democracy in Haiti, struggling over 200 years against a series of vicious dictatorships. Institutions inherited from the past were rotten.
When the people overwhelmingly elected my Government in December 1990, accountability was unknown: The political system was designed to perpetuate internal colonialism. We inherited a nation with one physician for every 3,000 inhabitants, but a soldier or policeman for every 200. A nation in which more than 90 percent of the population lived in abject poverty, while the elite enjoyed a lavish standard of living.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Haiti's past cast a dark shadow on our future, erupting into a violent overthrow of the constitutional democracy the Haitian people had fought so bravely to craft.
The coup leaders have charged our Government with abuses of human rights and suggested that this justifies their violent actions. But what could be a worse human rights violation than overturning the constitutional democracy that is a guarantor of human rights?
Restoration of democratic rule in Haiti will require a comprehensive social dialogue, including a program to address the army's role as the key instrument of internal colonialism. Since Haiti has no war to fight, it does not need weapons for its defense. Tanks, cannons and armored vehicles have been used only to control crowds and to seize power, in lieu of allowing political speeches, arguments, polemics and fair elections.
The army's role should be limited to areas in which prompt and disciplined intervention is necessary: prevention of national disasters, search and rescue operations, assistance in the development of deprived areas, building and maintaining highway systems and patrolling our border and coastline.
A police force, as required by the the Constitution, will also insure order in various communities and will comprise people from the concerned communities.
Even as we triumphed in democratic elections, we recognized the danger posed by elements in the military -- people who had been tied to the previous dictatorship or aligned with the traffickers who turned Haiti into a key transfer point for drug smuggling. When we took the reins of Government, we spoke of a marriage between the army and the people. We spoke of security as the first child this marriage would yield, a security and peace never before known by our people.
The marriage was never fully consummated. But the initial effort yielded a remarkable reduction in human rights violations. The record speaks for itself. During the rule of Prosper Avril, from June 1989 to February 1990, there were 725 violations of human rights, according to the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. During the 10-month administration of Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, from March 1990 to January 1991, 590 violations were documented. In the seven months of our Administration, only 120 violations were recorded, and none were attributed to our Government.
Reports that our Government incited the people to violence or revenge have no basis in reality. Not one political assassination occurred during our Administration. Not one political prisoner was jailed. No boat filled with frightened, political refugees fled Haiti for U.S. shores.
Ours is an Administration based on charity and inclusiveness. We were elected under the Creole adage that all should sit at the table, not just a few. True, the gap between the haves and have-nots must be narrowed. But our agenda has never encompassed nationalization, seizure of property or encroachment on the legal rights of any Haitians, including those who enjoy tremendous wealth.
In the short seven months that Haiti's democracy flourished, we worked to create a Government that was accountable for the first time in Haitian history. We resurrected an independent judiciary, an institution that had been destroyed and corrupted by previous regimes. We unmuzzled the press. We initiated an unyielding crackdown on drug dealers. We began the arduous task of fostering a healthy, free-market economy that could benefit all Haitians. In June, for the first time, a positive balance of $8 million was recorded in our national treasury, which had been virtually emptied by former regimes.
Those accomplishments will be at risk if the will of the people is allowed to be overturned. The answer is to act quickly and decisively to return the democracy for which the Haitian people have sacrificed so much. The trade embargo initiated by the United States with the Organization of American States must be resolutely enforced. Except for shipments of humanitarian aid to Haiti's poor, the embargo should amount to a total blockade.
We seek a peaceful solution to our crisis through social dialogue among the different components of Haitian society. That is why we have requested that an O.A.S. civilian delegation be dispatched to the country as soon as possible to act as official observers. That is the only way to insure that the restoration of the legitimate Government in Haiti is carried out without compromise, within the framework of the Constitution and with respect for human rights.
Would-be coup leaders in other countries are watching the response to the assault on Haitian democracy with keen interest. The international community's unwavering support for our Constitution and our democracy will nurture the blossoming of democracy all over the world.

HEADLINE: Rich Aren't Paying at All in Congress's Boat-Tax Fiasco

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the name of making rich people bear their share of balancing the Federal budget, Congress last fall enacted a luxury tax on new boats. The result has been a disaster for the United States boat-building industry: more than 20,000 people out of work, bankruptcies among boat yards and economic depression in communities that depend upon boat building. 
 Now Congress has an opportunity to right that grievous wrong. It can repeal that tax and enact a more broadly based excise on marine diesel fuel, which now carries no Federal tax. By drafting the new law with appropriate safeguards for the commercial boating sector, fuel providers like marinas, and boating-safety interests like the Coast Guard, Congress can get rid of a bad law and tax the rich more effectively.
The rationale for the boat luxury tax was that if you taxed the things rich people buy, then you automatically taxed the rich. Any boater could have told Congress how misplaced that rationale is. Many boat buyers are modest-income people who sell their homes to live aboard their boats full time; they are buying a roof to cover their heads, not a luxury. Because the rich have money they also have choices, and they are choosing not to buy boats. Does the tax hurt them? Not in the least.
The boat tax was supposed to raise $145 million over its five-year life. Fortunately there is a more efficient and equitable way to get $145 million from wealthy yacht owners.
Ever since 1951 Washington has taxed diesel fuel used in highway vehicles. But a large pleasure yacht, which generally burns diesel, is an "off the road" vehicle and exempt from the tax. Like the farmer with a diesel-powered combine, the large-yacht owner pays no Federal tax on the diesel fuel he consumes. To carry the irony further, the gasoline generally used in smaller power boats carries a 14-cents-per-gallon Federal tax.
Like the luxury tax itself, the diesel tax could carry an exemption for commercial boaters. A small portion of the tax could also be earmarked to reimburse retailers for the costs of administration. And Congress could use the tax creatively to improve boating safety. I propose that one-half of the tax be earmarked for the Coast Guard and Boating Safety Fund.
Substituting a modest tax on diesel fuel used in pleasure boats for the clearly counterproductive luxury tax could save thousands of jobs, give hope to communities that depend on the boat-building industry, bring parity to the tax treatment of wealthy versus lower income boaters, encourage the design of fuel-efficient boats, and actually raise money from the rich.

HEADLINE: Maybe Grade Crossings Aren't All Bad

 BODY:
Elimination of these crossings has been studied for many years. The need for this project has become more acute as rail traffic increased and the Ronkonkoma electrification went into service. Accidents caused by thoughtless drivers continue, as they attempt to drive around lowered gates. A separate and valuable dividend from the grade separation would be the provision of a third track, badly needed to relieve congestion on what has become the busiest L.I.R.R. route.
In the original plan for separation of rail and roadway, the railroad was to be elevated, just as it all along the South Shore. Elsewhere in our country, the West Coast, Florida and other communities where commuter railroads are being built, elevated structures are accepted. Depressing the railroad would be costly, something like 50 percent more than elevation. In this depressed economic period, it is imperative that the most economical choice must be made. Indeed, the existing route through Mineola is elevated, both east and west of Mineola.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Providence, R.I.;
Preservation Of Last Farm

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
STATE and city historical preservation societies have joined to save what is believed to be the last farm with it buildings intact in Providence. Known as the Whitman Farm, the property consists of a 13-room farmhouse dating from 1750 and several smaller buildings on a shaded half-acre lot in a crowded residential neighborhood.
The Providence Preservation Society Revolving Fund stepped in five days before the property went to a foreclosure auction in May and negotiated a price of $117,000 with the second mortgage holder, ITT Financial Services. The society paid an additional $5,000 for expenses like back taxes and water and sewer bills. 
 The $1 million fund usually focuses on the preservation of houses in low-income neighborhoods. But Clark Schoettle, executive director of the revolving fund, says it bought the farm, in a middle-income neighborhood near two colleges, to prevent the auction sale. The Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission has since financed the purchase price for the Providence organization with a five-year loan at 5 percent.
"The context of the half-acre of land and the original character of the house itself is very representative of the agricultural heritage of at least that part of the city," Mr. Schoettle says.
The society plans to sell the farm to someone who will restore it. An open house there last month attracted about 200 people, some of them longtime neighborhood residents. The society is asking for $134,000, but at least $75,000 more will be needed for restoration work, including repairing structural damage caused by powder-post beetles.
The state preservation commission will provide a low-interest loan to cover the restoration work.
Originally, the farm stretched across 200 acres; it was last used for farming purposes -- chickens and corn -- in the 1950's by Prescott Whitman. The building that served as the corn crib and chicken coop is still on the property, along with a carriage barn, a Gothic-style well head, and a one-room schoolhouse.
The house was built in stages. The middle portion was built in the 1750's, while the Federal-style front portion and L-shaped kitchen were added in 1810. The added rooms were configured around the original chimney to allow each of four rooms to have a corner fireplace. The house has only one bathroom, and there is no heat or electricity upstairs.
The previous owner held the farm for at least 15 years, Mr. Schoettle said, but had two mortgages and debts on the property of more than $200,000. Two previous foreclosure auction sales fell through before the revolving fund stepped in.

HEADLINE: Adding on the Costs of Emissions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Using Compressed Air to Store Up Electricity" (Sept. 29) presented an optimistic view of the economics of compressed air energy storage, given the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 and other legislative and regulatory trends. In general, utilities and independent power producers will find that the quantity and cost of additional air pollution emissions associated with energy storage will often be decisive in negating the benefits of new storage projects. 
 A new cost component arises from the Clean Air amendments. Their acid rain provisions will create a value (or opportunity cost) for every ton of sulfur dioxide emissions. For every kilowatt-hour of generation that results in some emission of sulfur dioxide, there is a new cost: the cost of emissions.
Every electric system is different, with different marginal costs and sulfur dioxide emission rates for on- and off-peak periods. Nevertheless, many systems would use medium- or high-emission coal generation during off-peak periods to "pump up" compressed air units. During on-peak periods, when the compressed air would generate electricity, lower-emission generation would be displaced. The new economics of the Clean Air Act must then be applied.
Furthermore, the cost of coal generation -- and energy storage -- may be forced up further. Government may compel utilities to internalize the cost of environmental externalities in all planning and decision-making. There may be a Federal carbon tax, for example, or utilities could be required to internalize the cost of carbon dioxide emissions in their operations.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
As Cuomo Ruminates, The World Of Politics Calculates

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
For a homebody who rarely spends enough time away from New York to need even an overnight case, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would embark on a year-long Presidential campaign burdened by enough political baggage to keep a typical candidate from walking, much less running.
Mr. Cuomo isn't typical, though. Mostly by word and sometimes by deed, the Governor has cultivated an image that distinguishes him from most candidates. His acknowledgement this month that he is weighing a Presidential campaign has quickened the pulses of all politicians who believe he can magically transform perceived liabilities into assets and galvanize a party and a nation yearning for leadership. To be sure, a disproportionate number of the press's stethoscopes are wielded in New York. But few other public figures could generate so much interest in the mere possibility that they might run. 
 Six Democrats, including two governors, have declared their candidacies. So far, none has filled the vacuum that politics abhors, which has made Mr. Cuomo even more appealing. If he ran it would be considerably more difficult to dismiss the field as the Seven Dwarfs, as the Democratic primary contenders were dubbed in 1988.
"I would urge him to get in," said one of the seven, Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic Presidential nominee that year.
"He's the only person who can punch," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, who joined Representative Thomas J. Downey of Long Island in igniting the fuse of a Cuomo-for-President boomlet in Congress last week.
"It's as if a Broadway show opened," one Washington political consultant said, "but nobody's playing the lead."
The producers who want Mr. Cuomo to audition are convinced that he would begin as the best-known and best-financed of the group and the best able to argue the Democrats' case in 1992, win or lose. As Governor of New York, he is automatically granted a national platform and endowed with the stature of a Presidential prospect. But no New York governor has been elected President since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 -- nor has any other incumbent governor.
For all the messenger's eloquence and his faith in his own message, Mr. Cuomo's liabilities, on paper at least, would appear to make him eligible for a savings and loan bailout. Unlike Roosevelt, he has had no experience in Washington and even less in foreign affairs. He has never run in a national campaign. He is not only from New York, which is still regarded with fear if not antagonism in many places, but is also an Italian-American and a Roman Catholic, which may make him even more alien to many other Americans.
He is a governor, which may remind voters of the last one who ran -- Mr. Dukakis. If Mr. Cuomo runs without resigning, he may be held accountable for every crisis that develops at home during the campaign and every problem that is precipitated by Republicans who dominate the State Senate. He is grappling with a state deficit that he disclosed last week was approaching $800 million in the current fiscal year and, even without leaving the state, has already been accused of dereliction in dealing with New York City's political and financial deficits. He has been firmly opposed to the death penalty when the national mood may be better reflected by Congress's recent decision to expand the list of capital crimes. Finally, his rivals might turn the tables 180 degrees and ask New Yorkers, as Ronald Reagan asked Americans in 1980 and Mr. Cuomo is asking them today, whether they are better off now than they were four years ago. Even among the Democratic contenders, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia has indicated he can't wait to compare his initiatives to Mr. Cuomo's.
 
Compassion and Candor
 Mr. Cuomo's ability to spin straw into gold, however, is legendary. Problems once peculiar to New York are now part of a national dilemma. Mr. Reagan and Jimmy Carter, both former governors, had little foreign policy experience too (although they did offer a basic philosophy, as does Mr. Cuomo). His championing of middle-class values and his position on the death penalty, which has never cost him pivotal votes, demonstrate compassion, candor and political courage that might be admired, if not embraced.
Mr. Cuomo would, of course, be held accountable for his record and for his response to emerging crises, but, as Mr. Dukakis said last week, "he doesn't have any greater burden than the incumbent President." Indeed, Mr. Cuomo's response to deficits can be contrasted to the President's. And Candidate Cuomo could be expected to make a convincing case that deficits in New York, Connecticut, California and elsewhere can be blamed on the national economy and on the Federal Government's abdication of its responsibilities to urban America.
On Friday, Mr. Cuomo did just that before the Radio and Television News Directors Association in New York City, where he indicated that a Democrat who has the courage to tell the truth could win. "Maybe you can't win with it," he said cynically, then added coyly: "I don't know because I'm not a candidate."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
The Connecticut Tax Drama, Act 2

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S Legislature, hurrying toward a proposed special session next month to reconsider the state's two-month-old income-tax law, has come in recent days to resemble the cast of a whodunit more than a deliberative body. With public passions fully aroused against the tax, a recession stubbornly lingering and the two main political parties mutually mistrustful, nearly everyone appears to have both a motive in mind and an intense fear of being stabbed in the back.
Underlying each suspicion is the question of repeal or repair. Since more than 40,000 people descended on the capitol three weeks ago to rage against the tax in one the largest protest rallies in Connecticut, the sense of urgency to do something has become a force that many lawmakers predict is unstoppable. The tactics boil down to whether to try to fix the tax -- by easing the burden on middle-class families -- or to try to kill the tax outright. 
 "This is a popular uprising -- that kind of environment is one that people approach very carefully," said State Representative Reginald L. Jones, a Republican from Darien, who supports a repeal and opposes any effort to revise the tax, at least for now.
The tax, which ended Connecticut's distinction as one of only 10 states with no tax on wages, was passed by a razor-thin margin in the General Assembly Aug. 22 after a summer-long deadlock between Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and the Democrat-controlled House and Senate. Mr. Weicker, a third-party independent Governor who lacks even a single member of his party in the Legislature, proposed the income tax in February, then vetoed three budgets that supporters said would have solved the state's fiscal problems in other ways. The state faced a shortfall of nearly $1 billion for the year that ended in June and another $2 billion if spending commitments and taxes remained unchanged.
 
Plotting and Positioning
 Through the long summer, coalitions of Republicans and moderate Democrats found they could make majorities for those so-called "conventional" budgets -- which were based on an increase in sales tax collections -- but that they could not surmount Mr. Weicker's vetoes with the necessary two-thirds majority.
Lawmakers in both parties say that strong majorities now stand ready in the House and Senate to repeal the income tax and start over, and Mr. Weicker has said he stands ready to veto such efforts. Once again the two-thirds majority needed to override has not yet emerged.
The resulting environment is one where plotting and positioning may be all that is finally achieved. And there is no shortage of plots. Moderate Democrats in the House who support repeal have announced plans to devise an alternative, no-income tax budget because of suspicions about the Republicans' intentions.
State Representative Carl J. Schiessl, a Democrat from Windsor Locks and a leader of the moderate group, said he believes most Republicans in their hearts want the income tax dropped. His fear, though, is that their heads will win out: retaining the tax would keep the issue alive as a powerful weapon in the 1992 elections against the mostly Democratic majority that voted for it. All 187 members of the General Assembly are up for re-election next year.
Other Republicans, especially Thomas Scott, a former state senator who helped organized the Oct. 5 rally, have expressed similar fears about their own colleagues. Mr. Scott, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year in New Haven, said his group, the Connecticut Taxpayers Committee, will publicly identify and target for defeat Republican backsliders.
Mr. Scott has also vowed to oppose any bill to repair the tax, because making the law more palatable to the public "would ultimately make repeal more difficult," he said, and the best thing for the state is a complete repeal.
Lawmakers seeking to fix the tax say their strategy is to make repair seem inevitable with a bill that would cut taxes for a majority of residents, stimulate the economy and short-circuit the long-term repeal effort.
Those repair forces, led by the deputy majority leader in the House, Jonathan Pelto, a Democrat from Storrs, say their first goal would be to sustain Weicker's veto of the repeal bill. If that is achieved, a bill will immediately be introduced that would overhaul the income tax and provide cuts for families earning up to $100,000 -- at the expense of taxpayers at the upper-income levels, who would see their taxes rise further.
Those opposing the repair bill because they are holding out for complete repeal later on would then have to vote no to tax cuts for tens of thousands of residents in the midst of a recession. And if they vote for repair, they're on record for accepting the idea of an income tax.
But Mr. Weicker could play a role in any repair scenario as well. He has said he strongly opposes such fiddling with the income tax until enough time has gone by to judge realistically what works and what doesn't in the law, though he hasn't used the veto word -- yet.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Stalinist's Paradise In Korea Flounders

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
No country has so successfully created a Stalinist society as North Korea. It is a nation where every home has a speaker that broadcasts Orwellian propaganda throughout waking hours, where every adult must wear a button of the "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, where affection is banned until marriage in the mid- to late-20's, where there are no novels or light reading, where citizens must get permission even to travel to another town.
These days, the worker's paradise is in trouble. President Kim, who is 79 years old but in apparent good health, remains in absolute control of the nation's 22 million people, but North Korea is staggering economically from the effects of the disintegration of Soviet Communism. The Soviet Union used to supply oil and accounted for nearly half of North Korea's trade; this year Moscow put trade on a cash basis instead of barter, and imports and exports have plummeted. 
 For the first time in several decades, there are credible reports of hunger in North Korea. Koreans tell visiting relatives from China, Japan and America that what they want is food; they are now believed to be limited in some areas to two meals a day of just rice and kimchi, a kind of pickled cabbage. Virtually all food is rationed -- meat four or five times a year, two eggs a month, 1.5 pounds of rice a day for an adult male manual laborer.
"About one-third of factories are closed down, and half of the remaining ones are only operating part of the time because of the shortage of energy and raw materials," said a Russian who lives in Pyongyang. "Outside Pyongyang, at night it's all dark -- the electricity is cut off." One indication of the desperation, the Russian said, is that on the Pyongyang black market, the special kind of currency that foreigners use to buy food or clothing is worth 40 times the ordinary currency.
Still, it is difficult to gauge the seriousness of the problems because so little information is available. North Korea rarely admits Western correspondents and even those foreigners who live in the country and speak Korean say they are not allowed to have local friends with whom they can talk freely. There were reports of protest demonstrations last summer, but there is no conclusive evidence and in the past such rumors have often been incorrect. As for the Government's credibility, it is almost non-existent, partly because officials make ludicrous statements such as that there has never been a single murder or rape in the country.
North Korea had been increasingly distressed in recent years by the changes in the Soviet Union, and Pyongyang initially seemed to welcome the coup attempt in Moscow. These days relations between the former comrades are severely strained.
"They go out of their way now to show their malice," said another Russian who lives in Pyongyang. "If we're in a shop and they hear us speak Russian, they scoff at us. If we're in a restaurant, they wait 20 minutes before serving us."
The collapse of the Soviet putsch has not affected the stridency of North Korean rhetoric, which lately has been as xenophobic and unreal as ever.
"Socialism in our country does not waver in the face of the atrocious anti-revolutionary offensive of the imperialists and reactionaries," the Central Broadcasting Station reported last month.
North Korea also seems intent on continuing with its effort to build a nuclear bomb. Pyongyang ridiculed the declarations by American officials that they intended to withdraw nuclear bombs from South Korea as "empty words." A North Korean radio broadcast on Oct. 8 made a remarkable proposal: the North would agree to international inspection of its nuclear facilities only after foreign countries stopped demanding the inspections.
In a step forward, however, the Prime Ministers of South Korea and North Korea agreed Wednesday to work for an accord on easing their mutual hostility. The agreement, still a long way from being implemented, came during the fourth round of meetings between the Prime Ministers.
With the Soviet Union no longer seen as trustworthy, North Korea has moved closer to China. Just this month, the Great Leader spent 10 days touring eastern China and meeting with Chinese leaders. One item high on his agenda presumably was a request for more oil or other assistance, but most experts doubt he got it. The Chinese Foreign Ministry declines to comment, or to confirm reports that beginning in January all trade between China and North Korea will be moved to a hard currency basis.
Kong Dan Oh, a Korea specialist at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., believes that the collapse of Soviet Communism has led to a cleavage within the North Korean leadership about whether more reform is needed. She cites some indications -- including calls for more joint ventures and the rising star of Kim Yong Sun, a senior party official who seems reform-minded -- that those who favor changes may be gaining ground. The recent admission of North Korea into the United Nations may also encourage more pragmatic and responsible attitudes, she believes.
Still Mrs. Oh and most other specialists doubt that North Korea will change drastically so long as Kim Il Sung lives. The next major opportunity for far-reaching change, they say, will be the succession of his son, "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il. The younger Mr. Kim, who is 49, is generally thought to inspire much less support in the army and party leadership than his father. Perhaps he will unexpectedly institute radical change, or be pushed aside by others.
"The framework for the succession is no problem," Mrs. Oh said. "But Kim Jong Il will have to prove very fast that he has not only the biological legitimacy, but also the brain power to lead." She added: "That's the time we're looking for a crisis."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Soviet Fallback For Economic Reform: Hope for a Miracle

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In an economy that is half Dostoevskian gloom and half Kafkaesque absurdity, where it is unclear who, if anyone, is in charge, where most prices are fixed, but inflation is soaring by more than 100 percent a year, where staples like eggs and sugar cannot be found in stores, but are somehow hoarded in many homes, where people cry out for a market economy, but brand as criminal anyone who buys an object wholesale and then resells it at a hefty profit, it seems that only a worker of miracles can turn the economic morass into a Western-style success.
But economic policymakers in the Soviet Union -- or what used to be the Soviet Union -- are eager to attempt such miracles because they say if they do not embrace bold reforms the mess will grow only messier. In this divided land it is perhaps not surprising that there are differences over how change should come. Mindful that any scenario is likely to mean more hardship, some leaders, including the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, have shown some reticence amid the warnings of urgency. 
 And while Soviet officials trumpet their desire to move to a market economy, they know that the transformation will be far tougher than Eastern Europe's.
Recognizing this, the United States and other Group of Seven industrial nations have pledged large-scale humanitarian and technical aid to make the transition easier. They are also debating whether to grant Moscow short-term relief in handling its more than $60 billion in foreign debt. But even with such help, optimistic forecasters say the Soviet economy has a minimum of two years of tremendous turmoil ahead.
As with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the Soviet Union's economic reforms are coming at the same time as a democratic revolution. But unlike them, the Soviet Union is also undertaking the potentially explosive task of redrawing its political map and shifting power wholesale from the center to the republics. Launching its reforms over a far larger land mass with a much bigger, less homogenous population, the Soviet Union is also set to begin its reforms after its economy has been in free fall for a year. The Eastern Europeans, who endured four decades of Communism, have as another advantage that they can remember how a market economy functions.
Probably the greatest factor working on behalf of economic reform is that the Soviet people, sick of long lines, empty shelves and shoddy products, are ravenous for change. Warnings abound that with a winter of food shortages ahead, the normally stoic Soviet people could explode unless their leaders deliver some palpable change.
"They are coming to the point where enough is enough," said Anders Aslund, director of the Stockholm Institute of Soviet and East European Economies. "They want to have change and they don't see it coming."
 
An Obstacle to Unity
 President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Grigory Yavlinsky, a top economic policymaker, are pushing for quick reform, but their plans have been delayed by the republics' haggling over a barrier-free economic union. Russia and 7 of the 11 other republics have signed the economic union treaty, but the Ukraine, the nation's breadbasket, has refused. But even with 8 republics signing, it appears that the fractious republics rather than the center will call the shots on reform.
The coup's failure eased the road to reform by ousting the conservative forces, but Yevgeny Yasin, chief economist for the association of large state-owned enterprises, said, "In ways, the conditions for radical reform are worse than before because there is no longer any firm executive to push through reforms."
With the center fading, the public is looking to Mr. Yeltsin. But the man who was so decisive in stopping the coup has been Hamlet-like on economic reform. He is caught between two groups of advisers: one wants Russia to coordinate reforms closely with other republics, while the other urges a Russia-first, let-the-others-follow approach. Reformers hope Mr. Yeltsin will embrace radical change soon, perhaps in a program that he has reportedly promised to unveil tomorrow at the opening of the republic's legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies.
Mr. Yeltsin and other policymakers find they must walk a tightrope: once they begin pushing through reforms, the miserable economy is likely to grow worse, before returning to health. Reforms would likely entail removing price controls, slashing food subsidies and the budget deficit, privatizing shops and factories and allowing bankruptcies and layoffs. Economic output is expected to plunge by 17 percent this year, and these reforms could cause a further drop for at least two years, some economists say. Real growth could be three years away, and prosperity, at least a decade or two away.
Ivan Materov, Russia's First Deputy Minister of Economics, predicts that unemployment could soar to 30 percent once reforms are begun, permitting bankruptcies and forcing industry to become more efficient. "We have always thought that one-third of the Soviet economy did not function," he said.
 
Rubles for the Printing
 He added that once price controls are lifted, inflation could soar 800 percent before they start to stabilize. Inflation is already being fueled by the central government's budget deficit, which many economists say will climb this year to more than one-fifth of the gross national product. To finance the deficit, the nation is printing rubles around the clock, and the amount in circulation is expected to soar to twice last year's levels.
The 64,000-ruble question is whether the Soviet people, raised in a land where prices were stable and official unemployment did not exist, can endure the reform-induced shocks without exploding.
Ukrainian officials are convinced, after seeing the chaos in the central government's money supply, that the best way to achieve monetary stability within their republic is to establish their own currency. Byelorussia is weighing the same course.
Many officials argue that if the republics adopt different currencies, that will spur a further economic decline by making it harder to conduct trade among republics. "Keeping the ruble in all the republics will help create an economic union," said Mr. Materov, the Russian official. "In my view, this is much more important than nationalistic considerations. But not everyone buys this view."
The Ukrainians respond that the ruble is already worthless and that this has contributed to the breakdown in inter-republic trade.
To many officials, even more worrisome than the multiplication of currencies is the refusal of some republics to export products to other republics. Fearing shortages at home, the Ukraine is refusing to ship coal to Russia, and Russia is threatening to retaliate by withholding oil shipments.
Many reformers say this every-republic-for-itself approach is a recipe for disaster. What is needed, they say, is a coordinated approach to reform, whether within or without the economic union framework. But among those who would have to implement reforms, the details of such changes are not yet a matter of widespread agreement.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
As Soviet Republics Gain Power, U.S. Scrambles to Decide on a Policy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Speaking before the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev on Aug. 1 -- 20 days before the Soviet coup attempt -- President Bush put his Administration clearly on the side of a central Soviet government strong enough to pull together republics increasingly separating from each other. Now United States policy, especially on economic matters, is no longer so clear-cut.
"We will maintain the strongest possible relationship with the Soviet government of President Gorbachev," Mr. Bush had declared in Kiev, and he had gone on to argue that economic prosperity in the former Soviet Union required "greater voluntary interaction" among the nation's 12 republics. 
 True, the President hedged his remarks with the statement that the United States also wanted "good relations, improved relations, with the republics." But given the circumstances -- an American President addressing a parliament bent on Ukrainian independence and defiantly critical of Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- the Bush speech stood out as a bold statement of Administration policy: a clear preference for a strong central authority recognized by the republics.
Then came the unsuccessful coup, with its fresh outburst of nationalism and its new blow to the Gorbachev Government. And slowly, reluctantly, the Bush Administration has been moving with the Soviet tide, toning down its call for a Moscow-centered authority and speaking frequently of a "new reality" that requires greater recognition of the republics and more dealings with them.
"Power in the Soviet Union has shifted dramatically from the center to the republics and that heightens the need to deal with the republics," a senior State Department official said last week. "But at the same time, we are saying to the republics, 'Don't overlook the areas of cooperation.' We are nudging them toward the benefits of cooperation."
The Administration's increasingly evident ambivalence is mostly over economic issues. It still holds that political concerns like Mideast peace negotiations and control of the military and nuclear weapons are the province of a central government. But bring up economics -- the glue for nationhood -- and the language changes.
"There is an evolution in U.S. thinking in that we see centrifugal forces at work," said David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. "Agreements among the republics will replace central institutions."
The implications of this shift are significant. The old Bush Administration preference for a single Soviet currency and a single central bank to preside over its value is giving way in the State Department, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to talk of accepting multiple currencies and central banks -- if the republics coordinate exchange rates and monetary policies.
"What we would do would be to find ways to link the financial system, to argue for a council of the central banks of the republics," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 
Backing the Republics

 American food aid, once earmarked for distribution through Moscow, might now go to republics, Administration officials say. There is talk in the Administration of supporting republics that push free market goals. Thus, endorsement would go to those that privatized state companies, removed price ceilings and subscribed to trade agreements that encouraged the flow of goods among the republics. Support would be pulled back, on the other hand, from republics that insisted on pouring funds into a separate military, as the Ukraine plans to do.
Above all, Administration officials insist that the United States cannot control the Soviet drift toward autonomous republics. The American power of the late 1940's, when the Marshall Plan shaped Western Europe, is not an option today. Instead, officials hope that central authority and cooperation will againbe acceptable when the republics see that prosperity requires federation.
"The desire to be separate from a totalitarian center after 70 years of misrule by that center is so strong that you need to have them come to their own conclusions about the benefits of cooperation," the senior State Department official said.
 
Ukraine and Russia
 But that could take a decade, and in the meantime separatism might produce some undesirable results, says Jan Vanous, president of PlanEcon, a Washington research group that specializes in the Eastern bloc. The rich Ukraine could build ties with Western Europe, leaving behind a nation dominated by the huge Russian republic. Russia, with its vast oil and gas deposits, could drain wealth from lesser republics by charging them world market prices for these fuels.
"We are seeing a breakup of the Soviet Union, but it won't break up," Mr. Vanous said. "First, you will see a breakup and then a going-back to a confederation where instead of domination through the army and political force, the domination will be through economic strength."
The Administration's shift in policy was noted at a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations -- the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain -- in Bangkok this month, when Mr. Mulford proposed letting the Soviet Union postpone principal payments on more than $60 billion it owes in foreign debt.
European bankers and governments, to whom most of the money is owed, opposed that idea. But in the Administration's new view, debt repayment requires that the republics put money in a central fund, and neither an inter-republic agreement nor a central fund exist.
"Postponing payment," said Robert D. Hormats, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs & Company, "is a way of getting around the sticky issue for the time being of who owes the debt and who is to pay it."

HEADLINE: North Korea Digs In Its Heels on Nuclear Inspections

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Despite an elaborate international campaign of pressure on North Korea, the Communist Government in Pyongyang appears as determined as ever to become a nuclear military power, and Western diplomats and scientists say they are uncertain what to do about it.
This conclusion has become widely accepted even after the most recent round of direct talks last week in Pyongyang, where Prime Minister Chung Won Shik of South Korea made the latest direct appeal to North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program and agree to international inspections of its nuclear installations. 
 North Korea has denied that it is developing a nuclear bomb. But the Government of President Kim Il Sung, increasingly isolated and laboring under a collapsing economy, is generally assumed to be pursuing a nuclear weapons program in an effort to preserve its legitimacy.
"I have a feeling it's inevitable," said a Western diplomat who monitors North Korea. "The more a campaign is orchestrated to pressure North Korea, the more they may see nukes as a way to hold on to their power."
 
How Soon a Bomb?
 Analysts differ on how soon North Korea can produce a bomb at its main nuclear research center at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. Some Americans and Japanese say it could be five or six years, but the South Koreans say it could be a year or two.
But recent disclosures about Iraq's nuclear weapons program have increased alarm among many experts about North Korea. And Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently said he feared that the breakup of the Soviet Union could lead Soviet nuclear scientists to sell their expertise to Pyongyang.
The talks last week between the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea did achieve a modest breakthrough in easing tensions. The two sides dropped some of their most extreme demands and agreed to try to negotiate a single comprehensive peace accord.
But on all major issues of substance, the two sides remained far apart, and discussions on the nuclear issue hit at an apparent dead end.
"We could not find any significant change in the position of the north," Chang Man Soon, South Korea's assistant foreign minister, told reporters at the end of the talks.
 
Opposition Hardened
 Indeed, North Korea's opposition to inspections hardened, with Pyongyang demanding not only that all American nuclear weapons be removed from South Korean soil, but also that Seoul renounce the United States nuclear umbrella before it would agree to nuclear inspections.
Moreover, North Korea's official Communist Party newspaper went back to the old tones of vilification after the talks, accusing Seoul of "brazen and provocative" behavior in its demands for nuclear inspections.
North Korea's newest hard-line position meant that President Bush's recent moves on nuclear disarmament had failed to achieve any immediate dividends in the Korean peninsula.
Not only has the North Korean response been negative, but South Korean officials privately say they are nervous and uneasy that Mr. Bush is rushing into a conventional and nuclear withdrawal of the American military presence from South Korea without any concessions from Pyongyang.
South Korean officials make it clear that their concerns will be presented forcefully to President Bush when he visits Seoul in December.
 
Further U.S. Reductions
 There were 43,000 American troops in South Korea last year, but the Pentagon has cut the number to 39,000 at present and plans to reduce it to 36,000 next year. There have been reports in the Korean press that the Bush Administration plans to lower the number to 30,000 by the mid-1990's.
The reductions are described as being dictated more by budget problems than any policy of withdrawal from Asia, and Bush Administration officials insist that they will not lessen American preparedness here.
But in addition to cuts in conventional forces, President Bush announced plans earlier this month to remove all remaining nuclear weapons from South Korea as part of his plan to eliminate tactical nuclear weapons worldwide.
American officials decline to supply any numbers. But Robert Norris, an analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, estimates that the United States has about 40 nuclear-tipped artillery shells in Korea and another 60 nuclear bombs stored at Kunsan Air Base near Seoul.
 
Public and Private Views
 In public, South Korean officials have welcomed all these unilateral disarmament proposals, saying they would offer an incentive to North Korea to follow suit. The measures may also soothe the fears of South Koreans who do not like the idea of their country as a nuclear battleground.
But in private, many South Koreans are nervous that Mr. Bush may leave their country vulnerable. Officials decline to be quoted on this sensitive subject, but they indicate that the Ministry of Defense and the armed forces are especially upset about the latest American initiatives.
"People fear that all these pullouts may be premature, especially if North Korea doesn't concede anything in return," said Yang Sung Chul, professor of political science at Kyung Hee University in Seoul. "Bush will have to reassure South Korea on that score when he's here."
Already, for instance, the South Korean military is saying it wants the United States to compensate for the withdrawals by selling sophisticated new military equipment. Washington is unenthusiastic about such sales, because doing so would tacitly dmit that it is indeed leaving South Korea more vulnerable.
 
Fear of Military Action
 There is also a fear that the South Korean military may use this feeling of vulnerability to strike out on its own in some fashion. No one fears a military takeover right now in Seoul, but South Korea remains shadowed by its history of the military taking things into its own hands. Especially unsettling are the repeated comments of the Defense Minister, Lee Jong Koo, that a commando raid or some other military action might be necessary to stop North Korea from making its bomb.
South Korea has scored enormous gains in its campaign to isolate North Korea diplomatically. The Soviet Union has recognized the Seoul Government, China is improving its ties and last month Seoul fulfilled a longtime wish when both North and South Korea entered the United Nations.
The Soviet Union, which may have supplied some of North Korea's nuclear technology, is now pressing Pyongyang to accept inspections. So are countries in Europe, including former allies of Pyongyang in Eastern Europe.
Finally, Japan has insisted on nuclear inspections before it would consider any of the financial aid that North Korea desperately needs. Still, North Korea is seen as going ahead with its bomb, in part because it seems to feel even less secure as the world unites in telling it what to do.

HEADLINE: A Dying Fish May Force California to Break Its Water Habits

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUISUN CITY, Calif.

 BODY:
A decade ago, Peter Moyle would trawl the sloughs of the Suisun Marsh and haul in nets thick with delta smelt, an unremarkable creature smelling of cucumber and barely three inches long that was of interest only to a few fishery biologists.
Now the delta smelt is all but gone from these brackish waters and is vanishing elsewhere in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta, a casualty of California's drought and the huge pumping projects that divert fresh water from the rivers and estuaries in the northern half of the state to the farms and cities of the arrid south. 
 Unheralded when it was plentiful, the delta smelt has become a cause celebre in its passing, a little fish that could have a big impact both on water policy in California and on the future of the Endangered Species Act, the nation's most powerful environmental law.
 
Blocking the Water Pumps
 Last month, after much dispute and delay, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that the delta smelt be listed as a threatened species, the start of an 18-month process that could lead to protection of the fish and its critical habitat.
Environmentalists hailed the proposal as a step toward preserving the fragile delta ecosystem, a varied and dense seam of nature where the smelt is just one of many species that once flourished and are now in decline.
Farmers and water suppliers, on the other hand, predicted doom for the state's flagging economy and hardship for its 30 million citizens if the pumps were slowed at the state's primary water source.
The debate is reaching full boil as Congress prepares to reauthorize financing for the 1973 Endangered Species Act next year. And it comes at a time of growing concern in some quarters that wildlife conservation has gone too far, that jobs are being sacrificed to nature.
 
Saving Species or Jobs
 "Times are different now and it's not just some abstract law," said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Manuel Lujan Jr., the Secretary of the Interior and one of several members of the Bush Administration who has indicated a desire to weaken the Endangered Species Act. "It's one thing for you or I to say we must protect species at any cost. But what if the cost is your father's job?"
Environmentalists are aware that the act, always the subject of some dispute, will be scrutinized this time around as never before.
"The people whose toes are being stepped on want to weaken the law, that's for sure," said Michael R. Sherwood, a staff lawyer with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in San Francisco. "But endangered species remain popular with people at large. There may be some fine tuning of the act, but I'm confident it won't be substantially weakened."
To date, the most bitter environmental battle of the decade, and the biggest challenge to the Federal law, pitted the timber interests of the Pacific Northwest against the defenders of the northern spotted owl, which is dying out because of heavy logging in the ancient forests. The owl was listed as a threatened species in 1990 after years of litigation, which is also expected in the case of the delta smelt.
And looming is another collision between conservation and commerce, this one involving the California gnatcatcher, a tiny songbird that lives in the chapparal along the Southern California coast, a habitat much prized by real estate developers.
 
'Worthless Little Minnow'
 The delta smelt is sometimes compared to the snail darter, which delayed construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee in the mid-1970's. Both are small fish of little innate appeal -- harder creatures to warm up to, say, than owls, grizzly bears or even salmon.
"For Joe Sixpack, it's just a worthless little minnow," said Jason Peltier, the manager of the Central Valley Project Water Association, an organization of 80 urban and agricultural contractors.
Defenders of the delta smelt, or Hypomesus transpacificus, know that pleading the case of this fish will not be easy.
"We seem to relate better to mammals than to reptiles, to plants with big showy flowers and to insects with big showy wings, like butterflies," said Gail Kobetich, a field supervisor in the Sacramento office of the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service. She recommended an "endangered" listing for the smelt, which was overridden in Washington in favor of the lesser category of protection.
The argument for the smelt must be made on much broader grounds, environmentalists say. "What's at stake here is not a little fish, it's a whole ecosystem," said Thomas J. Graff, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland.
The smelt population has declined sharply since 1979, when Mr. Moyle, a professor at the University of California at Davis, first began counting them. A decade ago, he counted hundreds of smelt each season in Montezuma's Slough, which meanders through Suisun Marsh, also home to otter and elk, egrets and kingfishers, bulrushes and wild fennel.
But in the last five years, in the largest estuarian marsh in America, Mr. Moyle has netted a total of three delta smelt, which feed on zooplankton and are themselves nourishment for larger fish. Overall in the delta, Mr. Moyle said, the smelt population has dropped 90 percent, to 280,000 from 2.6 million.
Other species are also suffering from altered conditions in the delta, Mr. Moyle, Mr. Graff and others say. The striped bass catch has been meager in recent years. There are hardly any salmon, and last year five salmon species were listed as threatened. There are fewer catfish, fewer opossum shrimp, and, of course, fewer fisherman on the levees of the murky rivers.
Because the smelt live only one year and reproduce during prime pumping season for the reservoirs, between February and May, the fish is a particularly vivid indicator species. It requires a spawning and nursery ground where clear Sierra Nevada runoff mixes with salty ocean water -- in other words, an estuarial basin where rivers meet the sea.
That so-called mixing zone here in the delta has shrunk substantially in recent years because of the drought and the operation of the two huge pumps in nearby Byron and Tracy, which siphon off millions of acre feet of fresh water that would otherwise flow west, through Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, San Francisco Bay, under the Golden Gate and into the Pacific Ocean.
No one is sure what exact measures will have to be taken to protect the smelt if it is listed as a threatened species. But there is widespread agreement that it would include some restriction on the pumping stations, which provide water to thousands of farms and to two of every three residential customers in California.
The likelihood of restricted pumping has prompted water suppliers to make gloomy assessments, beginning with a seat-of-the-pants guess that one-third of the water that passes through the delta would not be delivered. The suppliers predict draconian rationing, acre upon acre of fallowed fields and countless lost jobs.
"This translates into tremendous economic and social dislocation," said Mr. Peltier. "Can we tolerate putting other animals ahead of homo sapiens, because that's what the Endangered Species Act does?"
 
Defining the Choice
 In counterpoint, the prospect of less pumping is a cause for celebration among those who consider California's system of pricing and distributing water to be irrational and inefficient, encouraging farmers to squander the scarce resource because they buy it at below-market rates.
Among these advocates of water reform is Representative George Miller, the new chairman of the House Interior Committee, who has earned the enmity of the agricultural interests here by pushing legislation that would alter their historic water rights. The demise of the delta smelt, Mr. Miller said, "only confirms what we already know -- that the state and Federal water projects are being run in an irresponsible fashion, subsidizing these farmers with our own environment."
If the system were redesigned, advocates of water reform say, there would be plenty of water for farms and cities and to protect the environment as well.
"There may be situations that come down to protection of a species or economic well-being, but this isn't one of them," said Mr. Graff. "We do not have to choose between the agricultural industry, the drinking water in Los Angeles and San Francisco and this little fish. That is a false dichotomy. That is just political rhetoric."
 
At the Pumping Station
 Even at the state water project pumping station in Byron, about 50 miles southeast of Suisun Marsh, there is some pro-smelt sentiment. Just ask Marvin J. Niemi, the chief of operations, who recently showed a visitor around the massive, rumbling plant.
Mr. Niemi explained the workings of seven electric pumps that set steel shafts spinning. He pointed to the head of the California Aqueduct, where the water begins its journey through the Central Valley, over the Tehachapi Mountains and into the Los Angeles Basin. He raved about the aluminum louvers that divert 17 million fish each year from the pumps that would otherwise kill them.
What Mr. Niemi does is move water, thousands upon thousands of acre feet of it, and so he has given plenty of thought to the possibility that pumping could be restricted because of a little fish.
"It's something that's way out of my field," Mr. Niemi said. "But looking at the other ecological mistakes man has made, you've got to respect that."

Status of some of the American speices listed as endagered or threatened.
 
Black-Footed Ferret: Ranged through the Great Plains from Montana to northern Texas. Placed on endangered species list in 1967. Breeding program began in 1987. First ferrets were returned to the wild in September 1991.
 
California Condor: Ranged from British Columbia to Baja California. Placed on endagered list in 1967. Fifty-two are in captivity. Two birds are being reintroduced into the wild this fall in a sanctuary north of Los Angeles.
 
Bald Eagle: Listed as endangered in lower 48 states in 1967. Population declined because of shooting, loss of habitat, and pesticides like DDT that weakened egg shells. Making a comeback and may be classified threatened in some areas.
 
Grizzly Bear: Listed as threatened in lower 48 states in 1975. Decline due to shooting, trapping and poisoning. The status is reported as stable, with recovery efforts centered on the Rockey Mountain area.
 
Snall Darter: Listed as endangered in 1974 and reclassified as threatened in 1984. Only known population was in the Tennessee River, halting construction on the Tellico Dam, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court. Congress disagreed and transplants of the fish were planned, before populations were found elsewhere.
 
Whooping Crane: Listed as endangered in 1967. Tallest North American bird, with males standing 4 1/2 feet. Ranged over most of North America, but declined due to hunting and agriculture,. At low point in 1941, 16 birds migrated to Texas for winter. Population is now 150.
 
American Crocodile: Listed as endangered in 1975. Found in tidal marshes of the Everglades and in Florida Keys. Hunting is major cause of decline. Now about 500 adults in the wild.
 
Northern Spotted Owl: Listed as threatened in June 1990. Found in forested areas of the Pacific Northwest. Fish and Wildlife Service is in the process of designating a critical habitat, which may include areas used for logging.

HEADLINE: The Banks That Built Connecticut Are Crumbling Under the Recession

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The mid-sized banks that helped build Connecticut, and then basked for decades in the state's image of Yankee industry and wealth, have been smashed by the recession and are not likely to recover soon, if ever, economists and bankers say.
Two years ago, Connecticut looked smugly north toward the troubles of banks in Massachussets. Now the state is facing some of worst banking problems in the nation: a financial landscape dominated by big money-center banks from out of state, small local banks that are left with little power and a general tightening of lending policies and jobs. 
"I would call it a credit catastrophe rather than a crisis," said Peter M. Gioia, the director of research for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business group. "Banking in Connecticut is changed forever from this."
 
13 Banks Seized in 10 Months
 In the last 10 months, 13 commercial banks with assets of nearly $12 billion have been seized by Federal regulators, including two more last week. That represents one-eighth of all the banks in the nation taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1991, and more than 19 percent of the total assets seized. In the most recent reports in June, Connecticut banks had the highest percentage of bad loans, on which borrowers were three months or more behind on payments, of any state.
Although Federal deposit insurance has prevented the kinds of depositers' losses that were common in the 1930's, the state's last great rash of bank failures, the wave of seizures and bleak headlines have regularly reinforced an impression of a deep recession. That impression has added its own momentum to the downturn, some bankers and economists say, by tightening the lending policies of the banks that remain.
What has been almost as unsettling, especially for an industry where counting and careful planning is part of the ethos, is the lack of precedent. Falling real-estate prices and falling employment on top of a go-go decade's worth of optimistically acquired debt have made study of past recessions little help in gauging this one.
"In 20 years, I've never seen anything comparable to it in terms of the size or the impact that the problems have had," said Robert J. Higgins, the chairman and chief executive of Fleet Bank, a unit of the Fleet/Norstar Financial Corporation, a company based in Providence, R.I., that took over the failed Connecticut Bank and Trust Company this year. "I don't think we've bottomed out, but at what point we are on the cycle I'm not sure."
 
Pending Bankruptcy Cases Up
 In past recessions, for example, people who got behind on home mortgages because of lost jobs could sell their homes and get out from under the debt.
"Now if we rattle the saber, the person says, 'What can I do? I've got the house on the market and it's the third one on the block,' " said Thomas E. Hylinski, a vice president for residential lending at People's Bank, one of the state's largest mortgage lenders.
And while falling real-estate prices have been a phenomenon throughout the New York metropolitan region, Connecticut's problems have been aggravated by its dependence on a defense industry that is in retreat, and by its geographic and economic ties to Massachusetts and the rest of New England, where the banking crisis has been centered. For the 12-month period ending on June 30, Connecticut had the second sharpest increase in the nation in pending bankruptcy cases, up 77.6 percent over the previous year. Rhode Island was first and Massachusetts was third, according to Federal Bankruptcy Court figures.
Behind the numbers are tens of thousands of individual stories: from people who lost jobs and fell behind on their mortgages, to real-estate developers who borrowed money to build condominiums or office buildings that could not be rented or sold, to healthy businesses that found that they could not expand because banks had become gun shy about taking risks.
 
State Losing Economic Culture
 In addition, an entire slice of the state's economic culture is being lost because the victims of the crisis have been so heavily concentrated among the mid-sized state banks that linked their fortunes to those of Connecticut. The Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, the state's largest bank last year, had roots in the 19th century as a center of Connecticut economic life. Fleet/Norstar is to begin changing the names on Connecticut Bank signs and closing down 34 branches over the next two months.
In August, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, based in New York, took over two other failed Connecticut-centered banks, Citytrust and Mechanics and Farmers Savings Bank. Chase says some branches of both will have to be closed.
"Maybe we've all been too spoiled," said Thaila Kottler-Watkins, who was laid off from her job as a retail sales clerk last year. Ms. Kottler-Watkins said she and her husband have fallen more than $3,000 behind on the $688-a-month mortgage on their home in Unionville, even though the bank, American Savings, already set up a flexible payment plan in which the couple pays whatever they can each week.
She said she would find out on Monday whether the family qualified for a Federal Housing Authority mortgage that would allow payments to be reduced or worked out over time.
 
Dealing With Troubled Loans
 Other banks have for the first time established specific units to deal with troubled mortgages. At Bridgeport-based People's Bank, for instance, the new home mortgage "workout" department is designed to select delinquent mortgages in which some accommodation might be found, like lowering monthly payments to keep the customers in their houses and at least paying something to the bank.
Bank officers say their motivation is, at least in part, to help themselves. With foreclosures in Connecticut up more than 300 percent over the last two years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, and prices continuing to fall, the last thing many banks want is to seize property that might be worth less in six months than it is now.
"Are we more liberal than we have generally been? Yes," said Mr. Hylinski in the residential lending department. "We look for more creative solutions because it's in our best interest."
Ray Landreville, a Stratford resident who said his household income has fallen about 50 percent in the two years since he was laid off from his construction supply job, said he and his wife, Annie, did not want to wait until we were "panic stricken." They called People's Bank in July, just as Mr. Landreville's final unemployment checks were coming in.
 
Refinancing Troubled Mortgage
 "We went to them and said, 'Next month we're not going to have the money; that's where we're at,' " Mr. Landreville said. The bank refinanced the loan, reduced the monthly payments by about $200, to just under $600, and set up an escrow account under which the Landrevilles would have to pay only half of the monthly bill for eight months. But the deal had its price: the couple lost all the equity they had paid down on their modest duplex home in 1985.
Other casualties can be measured in the dashed hopes of those who tried to ride the banking wave and contributed to what some economists say was an oversupply of lending institutions. Between 1984 and 1991, 36 new state-charted banks started doing business in Connecticut, according to the state Department of Banking, compared with only 13 new banks in the 14-year period before that.
Whether the bottom is near or still yet to come is also a matter of speculation, although even the most optimistic banking officials say that the wave of failures is not over. Some see a rosy view if only in that some old bankers have learned new tricks.
"The adjustment to a recession and falling real-estate prices was traumatic," said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Connecticut National Bank, a unit of the Shawmut National Corporation in Boston. "But we're fully adjusted now."

HEADLINE: Garment Makers Find New Home in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Beyond a sprawling storage room piled high with fabrics and filled with rack upon rack of skirts, scores of mostly Chinese workers attend to the meticulous but mind-numbingly repetitive tasks of attaching zippers and pockets with row upon row of Japanese-made Juki sewing machines.
The scene, at first glance, is familiar to anyone who has ventured into the small garment-making shops that have been a fixture for generations in crowded Chinatown and in commercial buildings in lower Manhattan. But this garment contractor, called the Metropolitan Fashion Center, neither fits the Jacob Riis-like image of a brutalizing sweatshop nor is it in Manhattan. 
 The center, which is in the historic Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park, is only the most prominent of a growing number of garment manufacturers and contractors that have moved to the 97-acre terminal, which is being rehabilitated as an industrial park. The terminal, which was the embarkation point for millions of American troops during World War II, has become a magnet, particularly for Chinese-owned garment-makers because of its proximity to New York's third and newest Chinatown, in Sunset Park.
 
Economic Success Story
 Although it accounts for only a small part of the city's garment trade, the terminal is a rare economic success story for Brooklyn in 1991, and a major provider of jobs for Sunset Park.
"We moved here in February because Manhattan has become more expensive, and this gives us more space," said Edison Wong, managing director of this consortium of 22 Chinatown-based garment-makers, explaining why they have set up shop on the fifth floor of the terminal's Building B.
Indeed, Mr. Wong's consortium is far from alone in the 5 million-square-foot, eight-story building. Two floors below Metropolitan Fashion, at E. B. Design, dozens of women in white frocks and caps laminate thousands of earrings a day, while others glue rhinestones to pieces of costume jewelry. And on the fourth floor, at J. Abouchar & Sons, women fold and staple pricing bar codes onto mountains of multicolored towels that are embroidered next door in a room filled with the relentless din of 100 sewing machines.
"This is the cleanest and best-developed factory I've worked in," said Sean Reagan, a designer for E. B. Design, whose 160 employees, mostly of Chinese, Hispanic or Russian descent, reflect the polyglot population of southwestern Brooklyn. The company had moved from Coney Island.
 
2,000 Jobs at Terminal
 About 40 garment- and apparel-making companies, with about 2,000 employees, have moved into the partially renovated waterfront complex in the last few years, said Ira N. Brophy, the terminal's director of industrial business development.
And because of economic need, demographic change and city planning, the Army Terminal is rapidly becoming a new hub for New York City's garment industry. Small manufacturers have been attracted to the building not only because of its comparatively low rents but also because of its proximity to the expanding community of Chinese immigrants who have settled in Sunset Park, largely since the mid-1980's -- and who provide a convenient labor pool for an industry that has long employed many Chinese workers.
Other apparel-related companies that have moved in include Crest Shoulder Pads, True Colors Sportswear, with a $10 million-a-year business in medium-priced sportswear, and Frank Mode, which makes women's coats and employs about 200 sewing-machine operators.
Specialized garment contractors, like Gem Knitting, Lazer Beam and A & T Stitching and Pleating, also rent space in the terminal, as do even more esoteric fabric-related businesses, like Linen Star, which buys close-out sheets from manufacturers and remakes them to fit the needs of hospitals.
Also typical of the many light-manufacturing tenants are Lowell Light, which makes photographic lighting equipment, and C & W Sewing Machine Attachments, founded by Felix Salganik, a Soviet emigre.
Among the other tenants are the in-house printing divisions of financial-services companies, like Smith Barney and Salomon Brothers; the New York Railcar Corporation, a renovator of subway cars, and a repair shop for the Circle Line sightseeing boats.
But space, rents of about $5 a square foot and a nearby population desperately in need of jobs are not the only reasons that this mammoth, indoor industrial park is among New York's relatively few economic success stories in 1991. The landmark building has been transformed into a futuristic complex that, as Mr. Reagan said, "is like something out of 'Blade Runner.' " In fact, the Ridley Scott movie, as well as episodes of the television series "Kojak" and music videos by performers like the Rolling Stones have been filmed here.
More than 3 million American soldiers passed through the terminal en route to combat during World War II, but it fell into disuse in the late 1960's after serving as an Army postal building and as a site where bodies of American servicemen killed in the Vietnam War were brought.
The city bought the terminal in 1981 for $8.5 million, renovated the northern half of Building B by 1987 and the southern half last fall at a cost of $77 million. Renovation of part of Building A is to begin soon, but a timetable for work on other buildings in the complex has not been set, Mr. Brophy said.
Despite New York's economic problems, Mr. Brophy said the city's investment has been vindicated by the terminal's growth into a center for the garment industry and other light manufacturing. "Our public purpose has been to stop the industrial out-migration from New York," he said. "The 40 companies here are 40 companies that probably would have left the city."

HEADLINE: TAIWAN SETS PLAN TO REBUILD NATION

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
Like the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Taiwan wants to modernize its concrete skylines and cracking sewers, but unlike them, Taiwan not only has the dreams but also the money -- $72 billion in official foreign exchange reserves, more than any other country.
And so it has embarked on a bold program to lift itself into the upper ranks of developed nations, planning to spend more than $300 billion for new railroads and highways, a subway system, power plants, refineries, schools, housing, medical facilities, water treatment plants and sewage systems. The six- year construction program -- which will cost more than three times as much as rebuilding Kuwait -- has prompted a contest among American and other foreign contractors for some of the biggest plums of the 1990's. 
 The 779 projects involved in the plan were announced by Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun this summer. The magnitude of the proposals stunned many business people.
 
'A Gigantic Project'
 "This is a gigantic project and will be Premier Hau's legacy," said James F. O'Hearn, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. "There aren't too many six-year plans around the world where countries have the money, capability, intent and the wherewithal to make them happen."
American executives estimate that Taiwan will spend $50 billion to $70 billion on foreign purchases over the next six years. Japanese and European companies are expected to be among the major bidders, but American companies have historically won a large number of contracts there. Although the United States has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, in 1990 American companies received 34 percent of Taiwan's major contracts, worth about $650 million, many of them part of the six-year plan.
American companies are likely to be strong bidders to provide engineering expertise and equipment for incineration, pollution control, oil refining, transportation and communications.
The General Electric Company and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation have built all three of Taiwan's nuclear power plants and are strong contenders to build the fourth, which is part of the plan. Companies like Combustion Engineering Inc., Ebasco Services Inc. and Sargent & Lundy that have supplied equipment for the other plants are also likely to vie for contracts.
 
Rapid Transit Contracts
 American companies have also won leading roles in Taipei's effort to build the initial phase of its first rapid- transit system. The Union Railcar Partnership, of Yonkers, won a $170 million contract for the rail cars; the General Railway Signal Company, of Rochester, received a $100 million contract for signaling equipment, and a consortium that included Bechtel Group Inc. won a large share of $200 million worth of engineering consulting business. "We have tremendous interest in it," said a representative of an American company bidding on contracts. "There are big, big dollars."
But American companies will be locked out of the main contract for a high-speed railway system, partly because the United States does not have such a system. Instead, companies from Japan, France and Germany will compete.
Purchases of American equipment and technology should help reduce the United States' trade deficit with Taiwan, which declined only slightly in 1990, to $11.9 billion -- the second highest deficit, after Japan. Taiwan, which had a total trade volume last year of $122 billion, is clearly mindful of the impact that contracts can have on its trade balances with other nations. Last year, Taiwan had an overall surplus of $12.5 billion. Because Taiwan has a trade deficit with Japan, it has opened bidding in some cases only to American and European companies.
 
Wealth, but Little Gloss
 Despite its astounding economic development of the last few decades and its enormous wealth today, Taiwan's appearance is dull. Mercedes- Benz and Porsche automobiles fill the streets of Taipei, but scarcely move during rush hour because of the poorly designed traffic system.
The reasons for such disparities have much to do with Taiwan's history. The Nationalist Chinese regime that fled here in 1949, after its defeat on the mainland, saw the island as a base and temporary refuge, and always intended to return to the mainland. Only in the last few years, as the older generation has died off, have Government leaders seemed to reconcile themselves to the notion that Taiwan is their home, and well worth modernizing.
Taipei is planning to finance most of the projects through its normal annual revenue sources, and economic planning officials say the Government can pay all but one-eighth, or about $38 billion, of the costs without dipping significantly into its foreign exchange reserves. To cover the shortfall, Taiwan says it will probably issue bonds and encourage the private sector to invest in some projects.
 
Diplomacy May Benefit
 The Government's goals in announcing such a huge program are in part diplomatic. Officials are trying to entice government delegations from countries, including the United States, that no longer have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
In August, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei sent a letter to President Bush calling on him to lift a ban on visits by Cabinet-level officials to Taiwan. The chamber fears that visits by European delegations will encourage the Government to award many contracts to European, rather than American, companies.
Taiwan's leaders respond coyly to suggestions that they are using the plan to reduce their diplomatic isolation.
"If people have the kind of assumption we are using this economic strength to upgrade our political relations with other countries, this is wrong," John H. Chang, a vice foreign minister, said in an interview. "The only purpose and goal of the six-year plan is to upgrade the quality of life on this island. If at the same time we can help further develop relations with other countries, why not?"
 
Skeptics See a '12-Year Plan'
 Critics of Taiwan's plans point out that past large-scale projects have encountered delays. Now the Government will face squabbles over eminent domain as it tries to purchase land from people who may not want to sell at Government prices. It will be a tall order merely to assemble the needed labor and materials in six years.
Some business executives are skeptical that the projects will be completed on schedule and mockingly refer to the program as the "12-year plan." It has also been criticized for its scale and for the packaging of old, continuing projects with new ones to attract greater attention from the foreign business community.
About 60 percent of the projects are already in planning or construction, some for several years.
 
Growing Wealth
 For some time, Taiwan has successfully relied on labor-intensive industries to create wealth. After years of rapid economic growth, per capita income is about $8,000. While that leaves Taiwan well behind the United States' figure of $20,900, South Korea is at only $4,400 and China is at $350, according to the World Bank. Now, Taiwan authorities hope the economy will grow by 7 percent a year so that per capita income will reach $14,000 by 1996.
The spending plan is the clearest sign of Taiwan's recognition that it must upgrade its technology and move into more sophisticated industries if it wants to increase its wealth. Thus, the plan also includes money to improve manufacturing processes, enhance research and development in many industries, including agriculture and electronics, and expand Taiwan's airports and airplane fleet.
Besides spurring economic growth in the next decade, the plan is a means of gaining foreign expertise, technology and equipment to build a base for growth in the next generation. "It is something desperately needed," said Liang Chang, president of the Shearson-Global Financial Services Company. "This is a chance to show how to build a country."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Democrats Try to Cool Tax Fever With Campaign Cash

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 25

 BODY:
New Jersey Republicans may have outrage working for them in state legislative races on Nov. 4, but the Democrats have the money.
Anger over the Florio administration's $2.8 billion tax program has prompted grass-roots campaigns to unseat incumbents and support Republican candidates. But collectively, incumbents have raised $2 million more than their challengers, and Democrats, the targets of the anti-tax sentiment, have raised and spent more than Republicans. 
 Democrats control the Governor's office and both houses of the Legislature and have been able to use that political muscle to mine political contributions that match the level of fund-raising in 1987, the last year all 120 seats in both the Senate and General Assembly were on the ballot.
Total fund-raising by all candidates reached $7 million this month, according to figures released by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, and is expected to top $14 million when final campaign reports are submitted after the election. At this point in 1987 all candidates had reported raising $7.3 million, and the final amount raised was $14.8 million.
 
Appearance Tomorrow Night
 The Democratic State Committee reported having about $2.1 million on hand, and the Republican State Committee $775,000. Since then the Republicans have had one fund-raising event that Jeff Michaels, executive director of the Republican committee, said brought in about $150,000. He said the party is expecting another financial boost from the appearance on Monday of Nicholas S. Brady, the Secretary of Treasury and a New Jersey resident.
"We're going to keep raising money until the end and spend every penny of it," Mr. Michaels said. In addition to intensive tracking of voter sentiment starting this weekend and sending campaign mailings, the Republican campaign will increase its use of radio advertisements attacking Gov. Jim Florio's tax program and the Democratic incumbents who voted for it. Republicans are also considering buying television time.
 
'Still Very Bullish'
 The state's Republican chairman, Assemblyman Robert D. Franks of New Providence, said he believes that the party "has enough money to get the job done, but I have a certain level of discomfort from the fact that the Democrats have raised three times the amount of money we have."
"I'm still very bullish about our chances of capturing the Legislature," he said, "but it catches your attention."
The Republican strategy is to picture the Governor's tax program as aggravating the effects of the recession instead of positioning the state to rebound. Democratic candidates avoid talking about the tax program, but several campaign on the benefits, likeincreased rebates to homeowners to offset property taxes and increased aid to education paid for by the taxes.
The executive director of the Democratic State Committee, Steve DeMicco, said that in addition to a larger cash reserve, the state party is getting help from the national organization in the closing days of the campaign, something the Republicans have not yet been able to report.
The party will have the money to take people to the polls, and several staffers from the Democratic National Committee have already arrived to lend expertise "in very precise targeting" of likely Democratic supporters to be taken to the polls, Mr. DeMicco said. Earlier in the campaign, the state committee hired campaign managers, some from out of state, to run legislative campaigns in the close districts and provided support in polling and consulting.
Mr. DeMicco said the Republican campaign strategy of making Mr. Florio and his tax program the issue has had limited success. "They aimed a bullet at the Governor and hoped it would ricochet, or pass through and hit our candidates," he said. "It has succeeded in suppressing the Governor's popularity numbers, but it hasn't affected the ability of our legislative candidates to get their messages out."
But some of those messages adopt an anti-Florio stance, showing that some Democratic candidates are worried about the Governor's lack of popularity. A campaign mailer paid for by the Democratic State Committee for Senator Paul J. Contillo, Democrat of Paramus, who did not vote for the Governor's income tax, describe him as one Democratic senator who "had the guts to vote against Florio's tax plan." The mailer states: "Paul took a careful look at the plan. He saw that hard-working families struggling to make ends meet would be hurt."
 
Shift of a Few Seats
 Mr. Contillo's 38th legislative district is one of seven that leaders of both parties say could hold the key to control of the Legislature. Democrats now hold a 23-to-17 majority in the Senate and a 43-to-37 majority in the Assembly. The shift of a few seats could give Republicans control of both houses for the first time in 20 years.
Collectively, Democratic candidates reported raising $3.8 million and spending $2.7 million by Oct. 11, while Republican candidates raised $3.1 million and spent $2 million, according to election commission figures. By contrast, although there are 47 minor-party and independent candidates -- more than in any previous legislative election -- they have been able to raise a total of only $92,842 and have spent $45,499.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
U.S. HOPES SESSIONS ON MIDEAST CREATE A NEW ATMOSPHERE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Bush Administration policy makers say the core of their strategy for the Madrid peace talks is very simple: keep the Arabs and Israelis talking long enough to create a changed environment so breakthroughs that now seem impossible might become possible.
There is no "Bush peace plan" that the President will suddenly pull out of a briefcase when he arrives in Madrid, replete with maps, compromises and novel ideas to settle all outstanding issues, say American officials who have been planning for the peace conference, which opens on Wednesday. 
 But there is an American conviction that the very act of getting all the parties to sit down with one another for the first time will create a new dynamic between them and open the door for compromises down the road. The United States plans to nurture such compromises, first from the sidelines and later as a direct mediator with bridging proposals of its own if the parties alone cannot make any headway.
 
The U.S. Balancing Act
 The trick, say American officials, will be to carry out such mediation without supplanting the direct, face-to-face encounter between the parties, which is essential for changing how they look at, and deal with, one another.
The Administration's strategy, said one senior policy maker, is based on the assumption that over time "the very act of the parties' sitting down will begin to shatter mythologies on both sides." In particular, they hope to destroy the Israeli argument that there are no Arabs to talk to, and the Arab argument that all the Israelis want is Arab lands.
But for those long-held views to be shed, and for concrete peace agreements to be produced, the senior official added, "it is critical that this process continue over time."
 
Defining Areas of Substance
 He elaborated: "The longer these negotiations go on, the greater the likelihood that areas of substance will be defined to hook them into something that in fact is a real negotiation."
Officials acknowledge that this strategy is untested, and has three potential weaknesses. First, they could discover that the problem between Arabs and Israelis is not that they fail to understand each other, but that they understand each other all too well, and therefore the more they talk directly, the more the fundamental disagreements will be highlighted instead of bridged.
Second, a change of the atmosphere and dynamics between Arab nations and Israel ultimately requires change within the countries. Is a minority Government like Syria's -- dominated by members of the small Alawite sect of Islam in a country with a Sunni Muslim majority -- really ready to end its conflict with Israel and slash its army? Can Israel's governing Likud party, whose very raison d'etre is its commitment to keeping the West Bank, conclude agreements that would gut its ideological core?
Third, the United States did not get the parties to agree to talk by gentle dialogue, but by using economic clout over Israel, by letting the leaders of Saudi Arabia know that they owed Washington for the Persian Gulf war, by using the Soviet Union and the Saudis to press the Syrians and by tacitly threatening the Palestinians with international isolation.
 
Washington's Hardball Tactics
 American officials say privately they know that these same hardball tactics, if not tougher ones, will be required to promote actual agreements. But the challenge will be to twist arms without contradicting the terms of the conference, which President Bush described innocently on Friday as not intended "to impose a settlement" but "to bring people together so they can achieve a settlement."
For now, Washington is not discussing these issues publicly. To pursue its strategy -- which was worked out by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Administration's senior Middle East experts, Dennis B. Ross, Daniel C. Kurtzer, Aaron D. Miller, Richard N. Haass and William J. Burns -- Washington has evolved a game plan.
It deals with each phase of the talks: from the three-day opening conference at the Royal Palace in Madrid starting on Wednesday, through the first bilateral negotiations that will follow that meeting and into the third phase of detailed negotiations.
Phase one in the Administration's strategy involves getting the most mileage from the ceremonial opening in Madrid.
 
Bush's Presentation
 President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will address the opening session. Mr. Bush is planning to use the opportunity, officials say, to lay out a broad American vision of why peace is in everyone's interest, as well as what Washington regards as the basic ingredients of a settlement -- themes like trading land for real peace.
Already, the two sides have publicly put forward their well-known positions. The Arabs have insisted that Israel give up all of the territory it gained in the 1967 war -- namely the Golan Heights, which once was controlled by Syria; the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which once were under Jordanian control, and the Gaza Strip, which was controlled by Egypt. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Government has repeated its position that it does not intend to give up any more land.
While the Administration does not expect any party to drop or modify its basic positions at this opening session, it is nevertheless quietly coaching Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians to use their opening speeches to convey the message that there really are new possibilities.
For instance, the Administration would like the Israelis at least to hint, even vaguely, that the Golan Heights might be negotiable -- or to say that while Israel wants to keep that territory forever, it is looking forward to hearing Syria's views on the subject because alternatives might be possible.
Similarly, the Administration is urging the Syrians at least to hint that the payoff for Israel if it returns the Golan Heights, with its commanding view of northern Israel and of Damascus, could be more than just nonbelligerency, but real peace.
Phase two of the talks starts after the opening, when Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon and Israel and the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation are supposed to sit down for separate, face-to-face, two-way negotiations.
 
Confidence-Building Gestures
 The Administration wants these talks to evolve in two stages. Washington expects the parties to make conflicting demands. But it hopes to prevent these collisions from derailing the bilateral talks by encouraging the parties to consider first trading small, confidence-building gestures.
For instance, Administration officials say they hope to encourage a deal in which Israel would agree to suspend building settlements in the occupied territories in return for suspension of the Arab economic boycott of Israel and suspension of the Palestinian uprising, against Israel.
Prime Minister Shamir has rejected such a deal already. Washington is talking to the Israelis as well as to the Saudis and other Arabs about ways to "sweeten the pot" for all sides.
Exactly how the United States will make its suggestions, though, raises what American officials say is the most sensitive aspect of the bilateral talks. How does the United States encourage the parties to keep talking long enough to produce psychological transformations without stepping in and becoming a mediator interfering with the give-and-take of direct talks?
 
Standing Outside, Whispering
 According to the conference invitation, Washington is allowed to attend the bilateral talks only if both sides invite it. Initially at least, the Israelis are unlikely to do that, because they want to underscore the face-to-face aspect of talks and the implicit recognition this connotes.
Therefore, said an American, Washington's representatives will stand "just outside the door," whispering to both sides.
"We have told all parties that we expect these to be genuine and meaningful negotiations," said a senior American official. "Our role will be to go in at times to offer advice on how best to approach certain problems. We are not going to go in and say, 'You ought to do it this way or that way.' But we will say: 'Hey, if you are going to present something that way, you are bound to get the following response. So you need to think that if you are going to say X you have to couple it with Y.' "
When President Carter mediated between Egypt and Israel in 1978 and when Henry Kissinger mediated between Syria and Israel after the 1973 war, both Americans had a very clear idea of what the bottom lines were for all parties. Arabs and Israelis sought American intervention to bridge their positions; this time Washington forced the parties together.
The framework for negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians is already agreed on. The two sides, according to the conference invitation, will begin with "talks on interim self-government arrangements" for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But the Israeli-Syrian negotiations have no agreed framework. Washington's first challenge is to find some imaginative way to bridge Syria's desire for a return of total sovereignty over the Golan Heights with the Israelis' insistence on not giving up the strategic high ground.
The second challenge posed by the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, say American officials, is that if they deadlock, the Syrians not be allowed to exercise a veto over the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
But this is easier said than done. The Syrians have already announced that they are not going to take part in the multilateral talks between Israel, Jordan, the Palestinians, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, which are supposed to accompany the bilateral negotiations. These talks will deal with regional problems like water, arms control, refugees and economic development.
Washington has managed to persuade the other Arabs to go despite the Syrian objection, but the Syrians struck a quiet deal in Damascus last Wednesday with the Saudis and other Gulf Arabs in which the Arabs promised Syria that while they would engage the Israelis in a dialogue in these multilateral talks, they would not "close" any agreements until Syria was satisfied that Israel would cede territory in the bilateral negotiations, Arab diplomats said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Having Ridden Racial Issues, Parties Try to Harness Them

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Race is one of the enduring forces in American politics, but the events of the past few weeks forecast a new and far more complicated racial politics as the nation heads into the 1992 campaign.
Each party is struggling to adjust, and neither seems fully in control. 
 The Republican Party has long recognized the political value of issues like racial hiring quotas and welfare abuses in helping to swell its white majorities. But now a shaken party confronts the rise of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader whose campaign against affirmative action and the welfare system could carry him into the Louisiana Governor's mansion -- as a Republican.
Although the White House has publicly disavowed him, Mr. Duke has given new ammunition to the critics who accuse the Republicans of practicing racial politics, at great cost to the country.
 
Democrats' Delicate Task
 The Democrats are dealing with their own racial complexities. They have long relied on near monolithic black support, but they suddenly found themselves in opposition to most black Americans who had an opinion in the fight over Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court, according to the public opinion polls. The Republicans are quietly trying to chip away at the black vote, while the Democratic Presidential candidates have begun the delicate, difficult task of trying to woo back whites with appeals to "middle-class voters."
Moreover, White House acceptance on Friday of a compromise on civil rights legislation it long attacked as a "quota bill" has some analysts wondering whether Mr. Bush had pulled off yet another deft move in racial politics. He presented himself Friday as both the opponent of quotas and the defender of civil rights, a comfortable place to be in American politics.
All this maneuvering comes in an unsettled time of economic anxiety and deep public cynicism. When Mark Tubbs was asked about the debate over affirmative action, the 34-year-old Birmingham, Ala., construction contractor, who is white, replied: "The problem is that the politicians are the ones debating it. Their basic motivation is not human rights but in being elected and making as much money as possible in and out of office."
In interviews in several cities last week, many people seemed to be carefully sorting out their feelings on race and race-related issues and how their politicians handle them. They voiced concerns and doubts about the way some affirmative action programs work; The New York Times/ CBS News Poll has shown a growing majority in recent years opposed to giving racial preferences in hiring or promotions to correct past discrimination.
 
The Duke Dilemma
 But many people also expressed concern over the success of Mr. Duke, a Louisiana State Representative, and what they perceived to be a general rise in racial tensions. Asked if he felt racism was growing, Roger J. Park, a 35-year-old Republican real estate appraiser from Corona, Calif., who is white, replied: "Yes, dramatically. Just look at Louisiana."
This underscores the Republican dilemma with Mr. Duke, and it helps explain why the White House was trying to send some strong signals of racial moderation this week.
Ever since the 1988 campaign, Democrats have been accusing the Republicans in ever more forceful terms of playing the race card, notably with the case of Willie Horton, the black convicted murderer who committed rape after escaping on a weekend furlough from the Massachusetts prison system. The two-year-long feud over civil rights bills, in which Mr. Bush tried to depict the Democrats as advocates of racial quotas, added fuel to the fire.
Now, the Democrats cite Mr. Duke as an example of a Republican politics of racial division carried to its logical conclusion. "David Duke has found this bed very comfortable, but it's the bed that Bush and Reagan made," said Representative Mike Espy, the first black Congressman from Mississippi since Reconstruction.
The Republicans have angrily disavowed Mr. Duke and brushed aside the Democrats' allegation, but they are clearly concerned. "I have not liked these characterizations that I really didn't want a civil rights bill," Mr. Bush said, with a wounded air, as he signed off on new civil rights legislation Friday. "I've wanted it all along."
Democrats were skeptical. "They clearly realize that they've gone too far and they're trying to reclaim it by their positioning vis-a-vis Duke and their capitulation on the civil rights bill," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker.
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, one of the strongest critics of Mr. Bush's handling of racial issues, said Friday afternoon: "Maybe some of the pleas to have the President de-escalate his use of race are paying off. The campaign remains ahead, though, so you don't know."
At the same time, Democrats are facing new Republican attempts to chip away at their most faithful constituency -- black Americans, who have given 80 to 90 percent of their votes to Democrats in recent Presidential elections.
Republican efforts to recuit black support have met with little success in recent years; indeed, many Democrats question their sincerity, arguing that Republicans are really concerned with making enough gestures to ease the fears of white moderates, who do not want to feel they are voting for an anti-black party.
Still, Republicans are keenly aware that even the shift of a small segment of blacks can make a huge difference in many Southern states. "If we can hold the vote we've got and get 25 percent of the black vote, we're going to win every election in North Carolina," said Jack Hawke, the state Republican chairman.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, now exploring a third race for the Democratic Presidential nomination, argues that the Democrats need to take these Republican efforts very seriously. "All these books are coming out, saying that Democrats can't win with minority votes," Mr. Jackson said. "If Democrats can't win with minorities, with 12 million registered black voters, try winning without 25 percent of them."
Clayton K. Yeutter, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told reporters this week that the Thomas hearings "coupled with a number of other elements of the political picture, provide us with an opportunity to garner black votes that goes beyond anything we have had in a substantial period of time."
All of this accounts for the strange and complicated way that race is filtering through politics these days. "There's some cross-cutting politics and positioning going on," said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic polltaker. The old, simple rules and the political arithmetic of race and politics are changing.

HEADLINE: Health Care Costs Are the New Crux of Contract Talks

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The question of who will pay for sharply escalating medical costs -- employers or employees -- has replaced haggling over wages as the most contentious issue in labor negotiations, management and union representatives say.
Health care was once a fringe benefit, something to be considered after the critical matter of pay raises. But as health costs have increased rapidly in the last three to five years, medical benefits have quickly taken center stage in collective bargaining and have often been the prime reason for strikes, many labor experts say. 
 At the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, for example, long and difficult negotiations that included a two-hour walkout by 100 unionized staff members were concluded only after an elaborate compromise was reached on sharing medical costs. At Indian Point No. 3, a nuclear power plant in Westchester County, employees worked without a contract for almost two years until the wrangling over medical benefits was resolved last month.
One of the most prolonged and disruptive strikes in the New York metropolitan area in recent years was over health benefits: the 17-week walkout in 1989 by 60,000 workers at the Nynex Corporation.
"It is the impasse area," said John Phillips, a professor of health science at the State University of New York at Brockport and an expert in the economics and politics of health care. "In my judgment it has become the most difficult issue to resolve."
Some unions have been able to keep all their medical benefits, although many labor leaders admit that they have done so at the expense of better wage packages. Many other unions have made concessions to employers, who have been aggressively seeking to share more of the burden of double-digit inflation in medical care.
The concessions have taken many forms: increasing deductible expenses, having employees pay more of covered medical expenses, making them pay some of the cost of premiums for family coverage and sometimes eliminating family coverage altogether.
"It's a battle every time," said Jack Sheinkman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which represents 250,000 workers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. "I'm not going to lie to you and say we've held the line every time."
Often it has led to strikes. The most recent statistics come from a study last year by the Service Employees International Union, which found that nearly two-thirds of the 43 major walkouts in the United States in 1989 were caused by disputes over health benefits. Thirty percent of the 66 major strikes in 1986 were over medical care, the study found.
But even that does not fully measure the impact on collective bargaining over the last five years. The union study determined that the largest, most prolonged and most bitter strikes of 1989 -- including the one against Nynex and a nine-month walkout by miners at the Pittston Coal Company in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky -- were over management attempts to reduce health coverage or to have employees shoulder more of the cost.
 
'The Major Obstacle'
 These walkouts, while the most public and emotionally charged manifestations of difficulties over health care, reflect a broad problem for most companies and unions. "It has increasingly become the major obstacle in collective bargaining in virtually every industry," said Jan D. Pierce, a vice president of the Communications Workers of America in charge of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and five other Northeastern states.
Health care spending increased nationally by more than 10 percent a year through much of the 1980's, and it rose about 10.5 percent in each of the last three years, according to the Federal Health Care Financing Administration.
The Federal Government, as well as many state governments, have sought to limit increases in health-care costs by shifting some of the burden to the private sector. For example, companies that provide medical benefits must insure employees older than 65. They used to be covered by Medicare.
As a result, some companies have endured increases of as much as 20 to 30 percent a year in their premiums, Professor Phillips said.
 
Tab None Want to Pick Up
 In the New York region, companies have typically faced annual increases of 10 to 20 percent in their medical plans, said Thomas E. Burns, Nynex's corporate director for benefits and compensation. Many business officials said that they had little choice but to try to shift more to their employees.
Union leaders and their members, accustomed to improvements in their medical coverage over many decades, have generally resisted picking up more of the tab.
The unions that struck Nynex in 1989, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electricians, took great satisfaction in a settlement that kept their medical benefits intact.
Last month, the Communications Workers reached an agreement with Nynex on their next contract, nearly a year before the current one expires. The unusually early settlement was possible, Mr. Pierce of the union said, because the company decided not to press for health-care concessions.
 
Concessions From Unions
 But many unions have agreed reluctantly to share more of the costs of medical care and many others are being pressed to do so. Businesses whose workers are not unionized have had even more success in shifting health-care costs, business representatives and labor leaders said.
Mr. Sheinkman said that his union had managed to keep medical benefits in the two national contracts that it negotiates, with manufacturers of men's suits and men's leisure wear. But the price was clear: "It has obviously impacted on the wages," he said.
Many union leaders, particularly those like Mr. Sheinkman who represent workers making relatively low wages, said that they have been willing to sacrifice part of a salary increase. They are not always successful. Mr. Sheinkman said that the contracts his union negotiates with individual textile manufacturers have often included concessions on medical costs.
 
Eventually Paying More

Escalating health-care costs have had an unsettling effect on negotiations throughout the New York region.
At the Museum of Modern Art, the museum basically agreed to maintain existing benefits and the union granted several concessions that are to begin when the contract reached in December expires in 1993.
The union, which is affiliated with District 65 of the United Auto Workers and which represents 227 professional and administrative workers, agreed that its members would eventually pay more of their medical costs. Union members now pay 20 percent of their first $2,000 in medical procedures each year. In 1993, the members' contributions will apply to the first $4,000 in medical costs.
At Indian Point No. 3, about 500 employees worked for nearly two years without a contract because of disputes over health care. A new contract was approved last month after the union agreed to some concessions, said Jeff Cuffee, a nuclear plant operator who is a shop steward. Workers will now pay $8 toward each medical procedure, said Mr. Cuffee, a member of Locals 1 and 2 of the Plant Utility Workers of America. Management, in return, agreed to drop other demands, including a fee for family coverage, he said.
One large union medical plan almost shut down last month because of debt. The plan, operated by District 65 of the United Automobile Workers, covers more than 40,000 workers in 27 states. About 25,000 members -- most of whom do not work in the auto industry -- are in New York and New Jersey.
 
Companies Agree to Pay More
 The health plan spends $42 million a year for medical care. But it had also run up an accumulated debt of $30 million that threatened the plan's financial viability, said David Livingston, the union's president. An arbitrator ruled that all benefits would be suspended unless management and the union found a solution.
Under union pressure, several dozen companies agreed to increase their payments from 15 percent of annual wages to 16.5 percent, Mr. Livingston said. When the union's medical plan was created in 1945, the contribution was 3 percent.
Some local unions are anticipating great pressure for health-care concessions in negotiations. One union, Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union, has told members to expect a strike.
Formal talks on the union's prime contract, covering 65,000 workers in more than 400 private hospitals and nursing homes in New York City, on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties, begin in March. But Dennis Rivera, the local's president, said the hospitals have already indicated that they want to cut costs. Mr. Rivera said he expected the hospitals to demand that some benefits be eliminated and that new out-of-pocket payments by employees be added.
Mr. Rivera said the union would oppose that. "The irony to us is that the health-care workers who provide these services to the community are now going to have some of the services we provide taken away from us," he said.
Many union leaders say the only long-range solution is national health care, because it would reduce administrative costs and be more equitable. "It has to be addressed systematically," said John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union and chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s health committee.
Organized labor is split over whether national health care should be operated by a single quasi-governmental entity or built on existing health plans to include the estimated 38 million Americans who lack medical insurance.
 
Shifting the Costs
 Either way, there are formidable opponents to national health care: the United States Chamber of Commerce and many corporations as well as insurance companies and the medical profession, which are often viewed as beneficiaries of the existing system.
Many opponents say that it would represent just another attempt to shift costs to someone else, in this case the Federal Government. It would be better, they say, to concentrate on managing medical costs by using networks of doctors and hospitals that agree to limit costs.
"We should build on our current system," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and the New York City Partnership. "I think it's a bit simplistic to say that if you create a Federal system it will magically make all the problems go away."

HEADLINE: '92 Elections Outlook: Divide and Distract

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peggy Noonan's "Bum Ride" (Op-Ed, Oct. 15), while not valuable as regards the Clarence Thomas confirmation, was very revealing as to Republican plans for division and distraction in 1992. 
 By now we should be familiar with the false distinctions. Pejorative labels stand in place of facts. The only difference between being the voice of "the real" (normal, regular Americans) and "the abstract" is which side you are on. The article offers no arguments, only classifications meant to distract.
In 1992 we can expect more misuse of class, race and ideology to divert the public's attention from the record of the Administration. Republicans will even try to convince the middle class and black Americans that they have done better in recent years when in reality they have lost ground. Will facts intervene? We have the question for 1992. Will the politics of distraction continue to work?
For our kinder, gentler nation, what is "real" is that we have had an Administration that has been indifferent to working people, the environment, drug abuse and a whole host of domestic issues that are important to "regular Americans." The growing legions of long-term unemployed are not an abstraction; they are real. What is abstract is the effort that is being used to divert our country's attention from the serious problems we face.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 76 Units in the Bronx;
Low-Income Housing

 BODY:
The big developers may be sitting on what is left of their money, waiting for home building to resume, but the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal is still putting up new units for the poor and those with low incomes.
The latest example is in the Crotona Park area of the Bronx, where Eae J. Mitchell Terrace, a six-story, 76-unit brick rental project at 945 East 174th Street, between Hoe and Vyse Avenues, will have a grand opening at 3 P.M. Wednesday, with the first families moving in soon after. Financed by the state and sponsored by the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes, the housing advocacy group, the development has 10 studios, 45 one-bedroom and 21 two-bedroom apartments, a 13-space indoor garage -- the rent for a space is $50 a month -- indoor and outdoor recreation areas and a laundry. The Liebman Melting Partnership was the architect. 
 Sixty-eight of the apartments will be reserved for families earning no more than $21,000, which is 80 percent of the city's median income. They will pay rents of $400 to $500 per month. The rest of the apartments will go to people on welfare, with their rents adjusted to family size.
The project cost $8 million in state funds.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 3, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Postings column last Sunday about Eae J. Mitchell Terrace, a low-income housing project in the Bronx, described its developers incompletely. It was developed jointly by the Procida Construction Corporation of the Bronx and the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes.

HEADLINE: At Moscow's Planning Agency, Many Economists Look for Work

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
As he climbed the career ladder at Gosplan, the Soviet ministry of central planning, Oleg Yun used to have a heady sense of power, helping the ministry's efforts to pull every economic lever from Azerbaijan to Vladivostok.
 In the 1960's, he helped prepare a grandiose 20-year plan that sought to fulfill Nikita S. Khrushchev's goal of overtaking the American economy. In the 1970's, he was part of a trailblazing team that developed computer models on maximizing production. 
Now in the 1990's, with central planning heading toward the dustbin of history, the 56-year-old economist finds himself worrying that he will soon be out of a job. Now that Adam Smith's invisible hand is set to replace Stalin's heavy one, the ministry that bestrode the Soviet economy like a Colossus risks being abolished.
 "The ministry is disintegrating," said Mr. Yun, a Moscow native whose father was Korean. "It has lost face and importance."
 Gosplan, the once-omnipotent ministry that gave orders to every cell in the nation's giant economic organism, has been slowly dying since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985. The agency lost considerable influence after a law passed in 1987 gave managers autonomy in running their enterprises, and suffered even more in the wake of the failed coup in August. But still, despite efforts to dismantle it, a shrinking staff and the fact that many managers ignore its commands, Gosplan still functions.
 Mr. Yun, a short, dark-haired, cerebral man, has been a witness to the rise and fall of Gosplan, which is still called that although its name was changed in April to the Ministry of Economics and Prognosis. He joined the ministry in 1960, three years before it was named Gosplan, when ministry officials were confident they could build the world's strongest economy. He was there in the 1970's, when officials began to recognize the flaws in the Soviet economic model. And now he has a close-up view of the ministry's struggle to survive.
 "A lot of people in the ministry are thinking about their fate, where they're going to work next," said Mr. Yun, whose newest job is analyzing the long-term needs of heavy industry. "When you don't know what's ahead, your mood cannot be happy."
 The mood at Gosplan's imposing headquarters, just across from the Kremlin, is a far cry from what it was when Mr. Yun signed on. For those who dreamed of creating the perfect economy, it was paradise. Across the vast economy, Gosplan commanded how much steel should be made and how many eggs should be laid.
 
Times Have Changed
 But times have changed. Its work force has fallen from 2,800 to 1,800. Mr. Yun and many Gosplan colleagues are holding on, hoping there will be a role for a successor to Gosplan, although it is so discredited for botching up the Soviet economy that many officials want to dismantle it. Every year, Gosplan continued to issue thousands of commands, but as the Communist Party's grip weakened, it was unable to force enterprises to obey.
 Although Mr. Yun says he believes that a market economy delivers the goods better than central planning, he said shunting Gosplan aside before a new system has replaced it has pushed the nation's weak economy into chaos.
 "All the vertical structures of managing the economy were destroyed, but the horizontal system of market relations had not been established," he said, retaining the vocabulary of bureaucratic socialism. "It turned out to be economic anarchy after 1988."
 Mr. Yun, who displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of the Soviet economy, talked while sipping black coffee in a room decorated with an Oriental rug and portraits of Marx and Lenin.
 For decades, Gosplan and its little brothers -- Gossnab, the ministry of material supplies, and Goskomtsen, the ministry of prices -- controlled production and commerce. But after industry stopped listening to Gosplan, many enterprises found they could no longer get supplies.
 The economic chaos that has accompanied Gosplan's decline has made many conservatives want to turn back the clock. Last spring, Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov, now in jail for taking part in the coup in August, sought to restore Gosplan's powers.
 "Pavlov sent around a plan that wasn't much different from what I received under Leonid Brezhnev," said Vladimir S. Kostakov, director of Gosplan's economic institute. He said one goal of the coup was "to restore the centralized system in which the party commanded the economy while ignoring all laws of economics."
 The coup's failure hastened Gosplan's decline. After the coup, Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic, ordered that the ministry cease activities there. His decree was overruled, but once again Gosplan was humiliated.
 Nonetheless, it still plays one traditional role: formulating state orders, which are mandatory orders to sell to the state. Planners often use state orders to redistribute goods.
 For instance, the Ukraine is rich in grain and poor in oil, while Russia has abundant oil but not enough grain. So central planners place state orders for Ukrainian grain that they redistribute to Russia, while they buy Russian oil that goes to the Ukraine.
 But many enterprises and farms ignore these state orders, knowing that they can earn far more by selling goods on the open market. This is one reason St. Petersburg and other cities fear a food shortage this winter. Because many collective farms are not turning over the food they are supposed to under state orders, central planners do not have enough food to distribute.
 "Gosplan was the keystone of the command economy system; it was at the top of the pyramid," said Gennadi Zoteyev, deputy director of the ministry's economic institute. "But now the pyramid has been destroyed, and we have the top, but no bottom."
 In the early 1960's, Mr. Yun did the calculations for the ambitious 20-year plan. "It called for catching up to America and overtaking it," he said.
 Instead, the Soviet Union's economic growth rate declined, and the plans were often embarrassingly inefficient.
 Mr. Yun told of a factory that was ordered to make "100 tons of pans." Seeking to make its job easy, the factory turned out a small number of huge, heavy, almost useless pans rather than a larger number of the light ones that consumers prefer.
 The question remains of what to do with Gosplan. Mr. Yun says Gosplan should be preserved to make economic forecasts and recommendations for the whole nation.
 "There are still a lot of economists at Gosplan whose expertise could be used for the good of the nation," he said.

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
The Independents See Vultures Circling Overhead

BYLINE: By DAVID BROWNE; David Browne is a senior writer at Entertainment Weekly.

 BODY:
As long as there have been hungry young rockers, there have been independent record labels, or indies, as they're known. From Sun Records in the 60's to rap labels like Def Jam in the 80's, the independents -- small-staffed, low-budget operations -- have helped steer the course of pop music. Even the Beatles' first singles in America were released on Vee-Jay, an independent doo-wop label from Chicago. More recently, the independents have played an important role in the development of the alternative rock music scene.
The equivalent of the small presses, independent record companies stumble upon young talent before the huge, slothful corporations step in. "I have to believe that the majors will overlook some great bands and the indies will fill that void," says Michael Gallelli, a director of artists and repertory for Columbia. 
 Independents are still responsible for much of the folk, jazz, blues and gospel found in record stores. But with the recent consolidation of the record business (six conglomerates are responsible for 93 percent of all records released), the independent labels are in trouble.
At one time, underground rock stars like R.E.M., Sonic Youth, the Replacements, Nirvana and the Meat Puppets all recorded for guerrilla companies like I.R.S. (now distributed by CEMA), Homestead, SST and Twin/ Tone, which released their albums when no one else would. But today many of the independents face cash-flow problems stemming from a slump in the record business, the defection of their most popular bands to the major labels and the financial burden of switching from LP's to CD's.
In the last two years, such prominent independents as Enigma (which recorded such diverse groups as the Smithereens and Stryper) and Coyote (the Feelies and Yo La Tengo) have closed shop. Others have laid off employees. The sharpest blow to the world of the indies occurred last May, when the record company Rough Trade, a leading distributor of independent labels in America and Great Britain, filed for bankruptcy. By overextending itself in both recording and distributing, the company went heavily into debt, estimated at $1.3 million in the United States alone.
"It was a real confidence shaker," says Robert Haber, publisher of the College Media Journal New Music Report, the college-radio tip sheet. "Two years ago, it would have been unheard of that Rough Trade would have folded. Combined with the economy and no one getting paid, it doesn't bode well for the future of new music. It's not a pretty picture."
The alternative music of the early 80's was never pretty; a refined outgrowth of punk and hardcore, it was brash, feisty, rooted in suburban ennui and disdain for the mainstream. The music and attitude found a sizable audience of mostly confused, disgruntled college-age rock fans.
"Suddenly it spread like wildfire," says the guitarist Thurston Moore, whose band, Sonic Youth, recorded for four independent labels -- Homestead, Neutral, Blast First and SST -- before signing with David Geffen's big-time DGC label. The Replacements' "Let It Be" became a best-selling record for Twin/ Tone, with 120,000 albums sold to date, a huge figure for an independent.
It was only a matter of time before companies like CBS and Warner Brothers swooped in. By the end of the decade, many of the leading alternative bands were sharing record company accountants with Madonna and Sting. According to Gerard Cosloy, co-manager of Matador Records, a New York-based independent label, the major labels are "vultures." "They're eager to step in and take the lead from the indies," he says. "And when major labels start taking bands away, there's nothing left to support the indie network."
Even college radio, one of the last bastions of free-form radio, became more institutionalized. Whereas independently produced records once represented at least 30 percent of the albums played on college radio, a look at the Oct. 18 issue of the New Music Report shows that the share is down to 20 percent.
"The turning point was the success of R.E.M.," says Greg Ginn, the owner of SST Records and formerly the guitarist for Black Flag, one of SST's leading bands. R.E.M. started with the ultra-obscure Hib-Tone Records, then moved to I.R.S. before hitting the big time at Warner Brothers Records in 1988.
"A lot of groups went chasing after that dream," Mr. Ginn says, "and it produced worse music without reaching the goal of selling more records. Just because you can build up sales of 30,000 to 40,000 records doesn't mean you can move on to a major and sell more than that." (Indeed, a number of musicians who moved from the independents to the majors -- the Mekons, Husker Du's Bob Mould, Big Dipper, Redd Kross -- had disappointing sales and are now without contracts from any record company.)
Sagging sales aggravated what was already a hand-to-mouth existence for many independents. According to Alan Becker, director of purchasing for Important Record Distributors, which handles 30 small labels, the independents have always been the last to be paid by the record stores, and, with the slump in record sales, many of those payments are past due.
Not all independents are in trouble, of course. The rap labels that emerged in the 80's prospered, thanks to major-label distribution and the loyalty of hip-hop fans. According to one New York record store owner, rap fans often ask for the latest releases from a particular label, such as Priority Records, the company that recorded Ice Cube and N.W.A.
By contrast, college listeners tend to be fickle. "Rock indies depend on a crowd aged 15 to a year or so out of college," says Paul Stark, president of Twin/Tone. "What's hip to one group isn't hip to another."
Perhaps most devastating for the industry was the defection of many of the scene's biggest names. Over the years, the independent labels developed reputations for paying little, if anything, making the lure of a corporate contract that much more enticing. "We became disenchanted with working with indie labels," says Mr. Moore of Sonic Youth. "We knew we were selling records, but we weren't getting paid for it. To this day, getting money from SST is like pulling teeth." Mr. Ginn of SST admits that payment was "definitely" a problem; he attributes it to a loss of more than $400,000 when four of his distributors, including Rough Trade, went out of business.
Twin/Tone is currently $100,000 in debt, according to Mr. Stark, and 70,000 of its records are languishing in a San Francisco warehouse. Mr. Stark says he has lowered the typical recording budget from an already modest $15,000 an album to a paltry $2,500, which means that each record has to be turned out in a few days. "The records might not sound as clean, but I'd rather put out three records than one," he explains.
Bar/None, a Hoboken, N.J., independent that made its name with They Might Be Giants, hasn't released an album in more than a year because it has no distributor. "There are times when we're more a state of mind than a record company," says Glenn Morrow, the creative director.
A slew of active independent labels -- Sub Pop in Seattle, Caroline and 4 AD in New York, Touch and Go in Chicago -- continue to turn out records that are sometimes striking, like this year's "8-Way Santa," a biker-rock album by Tad, and This Mortal Coil's "Blood," which sounds like a ghostly murmur. But these records seem far less vital than the independent rock releases of the past.
This week the annual College Media Journal Music Marathon convention will be held in New York, bringing together 4,500 musicians, record company executives and other new-music hangers-on. Among the questions that will surely be debated in the hallways and hotel rooms are: Will the indies have to sell out to the conglomerates? Indeed, do independent labels have anything to offer, now that alternative rock can be found on major labels? Even more key, has alternative rock simply run its course?
Not according to Matador Records. The label, started two years ago and based in a ramshackled office with a three-man staff in lower Manhattan, has released eight albums and some singles. Its most popular band, Teenage Fanclub, has already been scooped up by a major label (Geffen) after selling 10,000 copies of its first album, "A Catholic Education."
"These are great records, and if we don't put them out, who else will?" asks Mr. Cosloy of Matador, as he sits surrounded by grating and uncompromising albums from bands like the Dustdevils and Superchunk.
Yet he is probably speaking for many independents when he adds, "Whether anyone's paying attention, it's hard to tell."
 
 
 
TREASURES FROM THE INDIES
 Here are some of the more memorable alternative rock records produced by American independent labels in the 80's.
The Dream Syndicate, "Ghost Stories" (Enigma, 1988). Tales of loners and losers in Los Angeles, played with bench-pressing power.
The Feelies, "The Good Earth" (Coyote, 1986). Pastoral, meditative dronings from the Haledon, N.J., cult icons -- music to accompany a late-night conversation with a friend.
Husker Du, "Zen Arcade" (SST, 1984). The underground "Tommy," a double-album chronicle of a day in the life of a skinhead, rendered with ballistic noise and pop melodies by a Minneapolis trio.
The Minutemen, "3-Way Tie (for Last)" (SST, 1985). The best album from the San Pedro, Calif., band that set leftist political commentary to feisty punk-rock.
The Original Sins, "Big Soul" (Bar/ None, 1987). Part garage rock, part wistful folk-rock, all from Bethlehem, Penn.
R.E.M., "Murmur" (I.R.S., 1983). On their first album, artfully murky folk rock for a new generation.
The Replacements, "Let It Be" (Twin/ Tone, 1984). You thought alternative bands weren't supposed to combine straight-ahead rockers, ballads, a Kiss remake and mandolins, right?
Sonic Youth, "Daydream Nation" (Blast First, 1988). The New York iconoclasts harness their fuzzy-guitar assault to actual songs; their finest hour.
Various artists, "The Wailing Ultimate" (Homestead, 1987). A sampler featuring such groups as Live Skull, Dinosaur and Big Dipper.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
In Westport, 'Flora, the Red Menace'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
THE first time around, "Flora, the Red Menace" was a slight, short-lived musical. That was in 1965, when the composer, John Kander, and the lyricist, Fred Ebb, were first teaming up, and the star, Liza Minnelli, was making her Broadway debut at age 19. For Flora's next time around, a 1987 Off Broadway revival, the producers reasoned that the renown of the original creators, who included Harold Prince as producer and George Abbott (book and direction), would spark new interest in an old flop.
Beyond that "Flora" needed a new frame of reference. The cartoonish and cumbersome story focuses on an ingenuous high school graduate, class valedictorian and new recruit in the Young Communist League, right after the Depression. For the 1987 staging at the Off Broadway Vineyard Theater, David Thompson reworked the book, originally adapted by Abbott and Robert Russell; Kander and Ebb deleted three, and wrote three, new songs. Perhaps most tellingly, the new production highlighted the importance of thinking small. A big-time Broadway musical was reduced to a single setting and piano, with 9 actors playing 25 roles -- a good idea. 
 It is the Vineyard version that is being produced by the Boston Post Road Stage Company at the Westport Playhouse. Given its intimate space and partiality for non-mainstream, often neglected, works, it is just the theater for the occasion. For all that, "Flora" remains a minor league musical, and neither the local, ever-busy cast nor the staging by Peter Flynn -- fluid but lacking in climaxes -- alters the impression of a slow-witted musical with a few terrific songs and a bunch of extraneous, dopey ones.
While the audience is instantly made aware of plot relevance ("till the economy turns around") and production design ("please use your imagination"), the effect is of musical comedy pallidity, rather than social significance.
Standing on bread lines and picket lines, selling pencils and apples, moving crates and boxes to denote changes of scenery, the nine players echo the refrain, "Give Me a Job," but ultimately they succeed in complicating and diverting a bittersweet story from its real purpose.
Unavoidably, the best songs -- "Quiet Thing," "Dear Love" and "Sing Happy" -- with their wistful melodies, mounting intensity and simply exquisite phrases, reverberate with the distinctive sound of Ms. Minnelli, a new talent with a floundering style when she first sang them 26 years ago and a second choice for a role that had been offered to Barbra Streisand. Now, it is thrilling to hear how Flora's songs presage a sustained, continuing association among Minnelli, Kander and Ebb, with "Sing Happy" emerging as the first of a line of exciting, upbeat anthems of affirmation, resilience and defiance that eventually led to "Cabaret" and "New York, New York."
As Flora Meszaros, aspiring fashion illustrator and all-around do-gooder who unwittingly becomes a young comrade until her own sense of fair play and assertiveness wins, Ellen Grosso might have made a more original stab at avoiding the unavoidable. The wide-eyed vulnerability, the catch in the voice, the dogged kookiness are all too familiar knockoffs on an established style.
Most lively in an earnest company are Adrienne Doucette, adept as an insinuating party leader who vamps Flora's stammering party-loyal boyfriend, Harry (played by Stephen Stout). Stacey Todd Holt and Leslie Beauvais are seen in, among others, a pair of irrelevant new parts, a dance team for whom Flora gets an audition at the Rainbow Room.
Somehow, a sincere, almost dour sense of purpose overhangs a silly, often muddled musical that puts too many obstacles -- and plot holes -- in the way of its intentions, for all "Flora" means to me is a story about idealists who are determined to change the world -- in too many different ways.
"Flora, the Red Menace," at the Westport Playhouse, 25 Powers Court, Westport. 227-1072. Remaining performances today and next Sunday at 3 P.M., Wednesday at 2 and 8 P.M., Thursday and Friday at 8 P.M., Saturday at 5 and 9 P.M. Closes next Sunday.

Affordable Homes Help Slumping Oil City

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE growth of this high-desert city has come in lurches over the last decade. Now it is counting on affordable housing to help propel it into a new role as the latest suburban outpost of Los Angles, 100 miles to the south.
In the mid-1980's, when energy was a growth business, this city close to oil fields and refineries expanded. The collapse of oil prices later in the decade, however, resulted in the loss of 10,000 jobs, the departure of several major employers and foreclosure for a clutch of office buildings. 
 The real estate market had nearly recovered when the combined force of the savings-and-loan fiasco and the real estate slump hit, leaving empty and unfinished buildings in its wake. Downtown vacancy rates are a sobering 30 percent.
But in the slow economy, the combination of affordable housing, low office rents and abundant cheap land has made the city attractive to corporations.
Affordable housing, in particular, helped persuade the State Farm Insurance Companies to choose Bakersfield as the site of a 500,000-square-foot regional headquarters. By 1996, the company plans to have 1,000 employees at work there.
Many State Farm employees are expected to relocate to the city from other parts of California and to be able to buy homes here, despite the state's notorious reputation for out-of-reach prices.
"You can buy a fine home in Bakersfield for about half of what you would pay in Orange County," said Roger Tompkins, a State Farm vice president in Westlake Village, Calif.
In August, the median home price in Bakersfield was $95,000, compared to $241,300 in Orange County, according to the California Association of Realtors.
Home prices also figured in a decision last year by Chevron USA to locate its Western Production Business Unit in Bakersfield. A Chevron spokesman, Jonathan Lifa, said home prices looked "especially affordable" compared to those in San Francisco, Chevron's corporate base, where the median price was $290,000 in August.
Bakersfield represents the dividing line between urban southern California and the San Joaquin Valley, an agricultural area that stretches 230 miles north to Stockton. The region -- the destination of the Joad family in John Steinbeck's Dust Bowl-era novel "The Grapes of Wrath" -- remains largely agricultural, although California's urban growth is gnawing away at its edges.
Although some Bakersfield residents cringe at the suburbanization of their city, the phenomonen is familiar in southern California.
Since the 1960's, the quest for affordable housing, coupled with the willingness of Californians to commute long distances, has pushed the suburban frontier of Greater Los Angeles south to Orange County, north to the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita, east to Riverside and San Bernardino Counties and west to Ventura County.
THE Antelope Valley, a Los Angeles County region a few miles south of Bakersfield, was the state's hottest homebuilding market in the late 80's.
The Bakersfield boom is part of that larger growth phenomenon. Its population, now 185,000, leaped 65 percent in the last decade, according to the city's planning department, while the number of nonagricultural jobs grew 19 percent in the same period, to 171,000, the state Economic Development Department says.
Bakersfield's resilience, as well as the occasional shocks to the local economy, can be traced to its role as an oil city. It is the seat of Kern County, one of the busiest oil-pumping regions in the country. Although the oil slump of the 1980's induced several "majors" to leave the city, Big Oil is now returning.
Chevron surprised the region last year by pulling up stakes in Ventura, 80 miles south, where the company had already built a luxury office building, to lease offices in Bakersfield. Besides the lure of affordable housing, Mr. Lifa, the Chevron spokesman, said, the move reflected a new company policy to locate management near drilling sites.
ANOTHER recent arrival, Santa Fe Energy Resources of Houston, has leased 40,000 square feet in a suburban office building.
Despite hopeful signs from the oil industry, the city is not out of the woods. Some problems in downtown Bakersfield have so far defied solution.
A half-finished 293-room hotel, abandoned by both developer and lender, and an empty, foreclosed office building have been persistent headaches for the Central District Development Agency, the city's redevelopment arm. It has tried to bring new activity to a downtown area that resembles a time capsule from the 1940's and 50's.
When the seven-story, 92,000-square-foot City Center office building was completed in 1989, the local office market was still reeling from the contraction of the oil industry. Developers of other buildings had slashed rents to induce companies to sign leases; much of that space ultimately went for less than $12 a square foot, considerably less than anywhere in southern California.
Those low rents, in turn, undercut the economics of the City Center building, which needed at least $17.40 a square foot to pay its mortgage. An affiliate of U.S. Bancorp foreclosed on the empty building last year.
The city itself foreclosed on the hotel project when the lender, a savings-and-loan institution, became insolvent; the city was the landowner and was entitled to the project if there was a default. Now it is having little luck finding another developer to buy the rusting, gray hulk.
As in many aging downtown areas, government itself has become a valued tenant. In January, Kern County employees will move into the $32 million, 276,000-square-foot County Courts and Administration Building, where the county plans to employ 600 people.
With homebuilding continuing steadily in Bakersfield and other high-desert areas, the city has been drawn into the commuter orbit of greater Los Angeles.
"I HAVE talked to developers who have sold their entire subdivisions to people who work in the San Fernando Valley" 85 miles to the south, Jack Hardisty, the city planning director.
The suburbanization of Bakersfield may accelerate if state officials make good on plans to build a high-speed train linking Sacramento and Los Angeles; Bakersfield would be a stop on the route.
The train, which would travel at 180 miles an hour or more, could make the city suddenly "seem a lot closer to the Los Angeles basin," said Jake Wager, the city's economic development director.
Employees who work in the San Fernando Valley but cannot afford housing in that area could buy homes in Bakersfield, catch the high-speed train and arrive at their jobs in 20 minutes, Mr. Wager said.
But Mr. Hardisty said he was not enthusiastic about one possible effect of high-speed rail: losing the traditional independence of the local economy.
"We have always been remote enough that people have to bring jobs here," he said. "I'm not fond of the idea of becoming a bedroom community for someplace else."

HEADLINE: Economic Troubles Bedeviling Orchestras

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

 BODY:
AS their corporate contributors struggle with the recession, most of the state's orchestras and its one remaining opera company have been forced to reduce their dependence on the business community and turn to foundations and individuals. Some have made small increases in ticket prices. Others have cut back on concerts.
"In this economy, you can't get blood from a stone," said the marketing director for the Hartford Symphony, Jean Spivey. "A lot of sponsors and would-be sponsors are pulling back. Many of the corporations we used to go to went out of business." 
Compounding the problems for the Hartford Symphony is the impasse over the orchestra's contract with its musicians. Last week management and Local 400 of the American Federation of Musicians said they were $746,621 apart in their proposals. The orchestra's management said the union's proposal would bring the symphony's accumulated deficit to $1.4 million in fiscal year 1991-92. The orchestra's total operating budget for the year is $2.8 million.
 
'With a Pen Stroke'
 "The alternative is to go out of business in three years," Ms. Spivey said of the 48-year-old institution.
But a spokesman for the musicians said the orchestra is not really in such severe financial trouble. "They could get rid of that deficit with a pen stroke," said Emery Tapley, a French horn player, who one of the musicians' chief negotiators.
Mr. Tapley said the orchestra's proposal would use 29 percent of its operating budget for wages and benefits, while the national average for symphony orchestras is 42 percent. The management plan would give full-time musicians, who have been earning $20,000 a year, "a 37 percent pay cut," he said.
The musicians have "offered to play under last year's contract and continue to negotiate," Mr. Tapley said. "We want to get back to work."
Ms. Spivey said the Hartford Symphony's problems stem from a heavy reliance on corporate contributions, past cost-of-living increases in salaries and the city's own economic difficulties. The symphony used to share a core ensemble of 21 full-time musicians with the Hartford Ballet, the Hartford Chamber Orchestra and the Connecticut Opera. But the ballet company will begin using taped music for its performances this season, the opera company negotiated a separate agreement last summer, and the chamber orchestra is now defunct.
"We can no longer support full-time work for full-time pay," Ms. Spivey said. "That's where the big difference is in dollars."
 
'We Have Subscriber Confusion'
 The impasse, which the musicians are calling a lockout, forced symphony officials to postpone the season's first concerts, which had been scheduled for Oct. 15 and 16. The musicians gave a free concert without pay on the 16th, saying they wanted to garner public support and demonstrate that they want to perform.
"We have subscriber confusion as a result," said Ms. Spivey.
Hartford Symphony management gave the union a deadline of tomorrow for replying to its latest proposal, saying any further delay would hamper planning for the next scheduled concerts.
The New Haven Symphony's contract with its musicans was due to expire this fall, too, but an agreement was reached earlier this fall, after the muscians accepted a substantial reduction in the number of rehearsals, among other changes.
The two orchestras were awarded a grant of $100,000 for each ensemble over two years from the National Endowment for the Arts on the condition that they each raise another $300,000. "The grant will be used to expand each orchestra's outreach programs" in schools and throughout the state of Connecticut," said the general manager of the New Haven Symphony, Catherine Weiskel. "During the two-year period of the grant, the programs will reach 28 communities representing over 900,000 state residents."
The Greater Bridgeport Symphony is projecting a small loss for the first time in several years, said its general manager, Jena Maric.
"The main fallout was in the corporate sector," she said. "Our fund raising is now based so we have a very large public, individual support. If we were relying solely on corporations, then we would be in a very bad situation."
 
'Dealing With an Image'
 Mrs. Maric said she is also dealing with a problem unique to her 46-year-old organization: "We used to get support from the City of Bridgeport. That stopped several years ago," when the city began having severe financial problems of its own, "and we understood why."
Negative publicity about Bridgeport hurts the orchestra, Mrs. Maric said. "We are dealing with an image," she said. "It's a long-term problem. Once people do come to the Klein Memorial Auditorium, they realize it's easily accessible, with easy parking, and the music is high quality.
"Sometimes you need to go through this sort of thing to come out stronger. We are in pretty good shape."
The Eastern Connecticut Symphony, based in New London, is "in general, very pleased" with its prospects, despite being in the red for the second year, said the executive director, Isabelle Singer. "We have seen things occur in the audience, in sales. We usually give five classical and three popular concerts. Last December, in view of the economy, we suspended our pops series, performing only one pops concert."
The orchestra, which has an annual budget of $354,000, had its grant from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts cut by $1,600 this year.
"We are trying to keep costs down and be more aggressive in individual support," she said.

 
Merger Discussions
 The Stamford Symphony's executive director, Barbara Soroca, said that the orchestra has exceeded its fund-raising goals so far this year despite a minor reduction in state funds and slower subscription sales. "We have to be creative," she added.
Last year the Stamford Symphony approached the Fairfield Orchestra (formerly the Fairfield Chamber Orchestra) to discuss a possible merger. Several meetings followed, but the project was dropped.
"I think that financially many of the orchestras across the state should merge and perform around the state, much as the New Jersey Symphony does," Mrs. Soroca said. "It would be much more cost effective. As to the likelihood, it would take a lot of negotiations and emotional energy. For the musicians, it would be a difficult situation."
Also vying for dollars in Stamford is the Connecticut Grand Opera. Financial problems have haunted the company, based in Stamford and Bridgeport, for the last few years. Musicians said their paychecks were often late.
"Our cash flow is uneven," acknowledged John Hiddlestone, the opera's general manager. "We've always managed to scrape through. The problem is that there's no telling when this economy is going to bottom out. You hear talk about an upsurge on the horizon. We're trying to do anything we can to save money without sacrificing the quality of the product."
Last spring the opera postponed a new production of Mozart's "Magic Flute," replacing it with an all-Mozart concert with four soloists.
"We did it for purely economic reasons," Mr. Hiddlestone said. "We saw the beginning of the effects last year of the downturn in the economy in terms of our contributions from corporate sources and the uncertainties of our state and city funding. Those were looking very much in jeopardy. Rather than risking getting into difficulty with 'Magic Flute,' we thought it would be prudent to do a program that cost considerably less to produce. People were very understanding."
 
Promising Newcomers
 "The Magic Flute" has been rescheduled for Nov. 9 in Bridgeport at the Klein, and Nov. 16 at the Palace Theater in Stamford.
Mr. Hiddlestone also pointed out that the company has gradually been implementing a policy of casting young, promising American singers instead of paying more for established stars.
"We're doing a lot more auditioning than ever before," he said.
In the music business, "it's essential to be optimistic," Mr. Hiddlestone said. "At the same time, you have to keep those feet planted on the floor."
And what of the musicians in these troubled times? They have to make some adjustments, said Richard Shillea, 32 years old, of Stratford, a clarinetist with the Greater Bridgeport Symphony, the Stamford Chamber Orchestra and Connecticut Grand Opera, and the Eastern Connecticut Symphony, who is also on the substitute list for the Hartford Symphony. While orchestra jobs used to be his main source of income, he said, in recent years he has had to depend more on private teaching. He is on the faculty of Fairfield University and teaches in the pre-college division of the Juilliard School.
"The amount of work is down to an all-time low in the 10 years I've been freelancing," Mr. Shillea said. "A person like myself is turning toward other areas -- thankfully, for me, musical ones."

THE TURN
From the Cold War to a New Era:
The United States and the Soviet Union, 1983-1990.
By Don Oberdorfer.
Illustrated. 514 pp. New York.
Poseidon Press. $25.  
 In December 1988, during a private New York meeting documented in Don Oberdorfer's authoritative new book, Mikhail S. Gorbachev told President-elect George Bush, "You'll see soon enough that I'm not doing this for show and I'm not doing this to undermine you or to surprise you or to take advantage of you. I'm playing real politics. I'm doing this because I need to. I'm doing this because there's a revolution taking place in my country. I started it. And they all applauded me when I started it in 1986 and now they don't like it so much, but it's going to be a revolution, nonetheless."
The Soviet leader could not know how right he was. Completed seven months before the Russian revolution of August 1991, "The Turn: From the Cold War to a New Era" focuses on the improvement in United States-Soviet relations during the middle and late 1980's. In so doing, it anticipates a coming historical dispute that will, no doubt, continue for years, if not decades: When, precisely, did the cold war end?
To reach a firm answer, we will have to have a great deal more hindsight and information -- particularly about internal Soviet decision making -- than we have today. In the meantime, Mr. Oberdorfer, a foreign affairs correspondent for The Washington Post, has brought us the most thorough account yet of what we can all agree was a crucial era in world politics. "The Turn" does much to fill the gap between the daily journalism of the time and the history that will one day be written on the basis of classified documents released by both Governments.
The author's long and excellent reputation for conscientious reporting has helped him to gain useful access to the upper ranks of the Ronald Reagan and George Bush foreign policy hierarchies, especially to his fellow Princetonian, the former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, whom he interviewed 13 times. Mr. Oberdorfer has also exploited opportunities offered by glasnost, interviewing more than 32 Soviet officials, scholars and journalists in Washington and Moscow.
His chronicle opens in 1983, when the Soviets downed a civilian Korean airliner and walked out of the Geneva arms talks; faulty intelligence caused them to fear, we now know, an imminent American surprise nuclear attack. The following year, Soviet-American relations were in such disrepair that a White House visit by the chilly veteran Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, to conduct the highest-level dialogue between the two countries in four years, was greeted with public jubilation.
During the 1984 Presidential campaign, the Democratic candidate, Walter Mondale, complained that Mr. Reagan was the first President since Herbert Hoover who had not met with his Soviet counterpart. Who might have anticipated that seven American-Soviet summit meetings would be held during the next six years? "The Turn" is largely the story of those summit meetings and the interstitial meetings between American and Soviet foreign ministers.
One thread through the diplomacy of the Reagan period was the President's cherished space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, which led Mr. Gorbachev into dark imaginings: a choice between further ransacking the exhausted Soviet economy or being faced someday with American dominion over the world. As the author shows, as early as the Geneva summit meeting of September 1985 Mr. Gorbachev complained: "Why should I believe what you have to say about sharing the results of research? . . . If S.D.I. is implemented, only God himself would know where it would lead."
In 1986, frustrated by Mr. Reagan's undiminished enthusiasm for the program, Mr. Gorbachev dragged his feet on another meeting and then pressed the President for a surprise October meeting at Reykjavik with only one week's notice. There, the Soviet leader dealt the first hand in what Mr. Shultz described to Mr. Oberdorfer as "the highest-stakes poker game ever played." After hearing out Mr. Gorbachev's suggestions for heretofore unimaginable cuts in nuclear arsenals and delivery systems, Mr. Reagan told his aides, "He's brought a whole lot of proposals, but I'm afraid he's going after S.D.I."
Nevertheless Mr. Reagan raised the ante, calling for the elimination of all Soviet and American nuclear weapons. Mr. Shultz was warily silent about this. Sounding like John Foster Dulles on Dwight Eisenhower, the Secretary of State later told the author: "I really felt that he's the President. He got elected twice. He has made no secret of his view on nuclear weapons. So who am I to stop him from saying what he believes and what he's campaigned on?"
Despite the failure of Mr. Reagan's proposal and the Reykjavik meeting's collapse, the two leaders were sufficiently reconciled that they hastened negotiations over a treaty to ban intermediate nuclear forces, which they signed at the White House in December 1987. Mr. Oberdorfer describes a large session in the Cabinet Room that included Mr. Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev and many of their aides. When Mr. Reagan "seemed unable to remember or relate the U.S. position, Shultz took over the conversation," while his boss "sat by in embarrassed silence." Later, Mr. Shultz frankly told the President that it had been "a terrible performance," and persuaded him to move future such meetings to the privacy of the Oval Office.
Mr. Oberdorfer effectively conveys Mr. Gorbachev's growing impatience with Mr. Reagan, and his worries about George Bush's skepticism toward perestroika. Mr. Gorbachev told Mr. Shultz that the Vice President must be "trying to display some muscles" on the campaign trail. At the Malta summit meeting of December 1989, in the wake of the fall of Eastern Europe, Mr. Gorbachev privately confided to the new President that he had been waiting for evidence that Mr. Bush was ready to move the Soviet-American relationship forward more tangibly. No longer. Presented with a host of American proposals to aid Soviet reform, Mr. Gorbachev declared: "Now I know."
The author wisely observes that "we are far too close to the events recorded here" to reach ultimate judgments about them. Yet his readers might have been better served had he strained a bit harder to show them the forest as well as the trees. His prose is usually serviceable, but one sometimes wonders whether his editor occasionally fell asleep. Mr. Oberdorfer writes, for example, that Mr. Shultz "worked patiently to apply steady inputs over time toward his long-range goal of improving U.S.-Soviet relations."
Such flaws do not seriously damage the book's central achievement. Mr. Oberdorfer succeeds in his goal: to record "what can be learned at the present time about one of the great turning points of history, and to convey something of the excitement, vitality and uncertainty with which it unfolded before our eyes."

PRAIRYERTH
(A Deep Map).
By William Least Heat-Moon.
624 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.95. 
 A nation's literary history is always rich in phantom pregnancies. As you know, many writers produce a first book, worthy in every respect, and while there is often a muttered mention or a breathless hush regarding a second book, the thing never appears: phantom pregnancy. Isn't there a man in New Haven, sounding as desperate as a woman in a paternity suit, who is always threatening to publish his book? But it's a common condition. And I think most people, reflecting on the silence since "Blue Highways" appeared in 1982, believed -- and who could blame them? -- that William Least Heat-Moon's excellent book would not have a successor.
Yet that had also struck me as peculiar, because there must have been any number of publishers cooing into telephones, urging the man to repeat the formula. Why not try the blue highways of Russia or Brazil? "Or what about the back roads of Italy, Bill?" you can almost hear them saying. "Listen, they got plenty of roads in Australia." In the simple act of writing a travel book about your peregrinating down back roads you sort of lay claim to every back road on earth, or so people think. In that same spirit, it is sometimes felt that the world's railroads, and all their splendors and miseries, belong to me and that anyone else who writes about them ought to be shot for poaching. Travel writing is a queer and insufficient preoccupation, which is why I practice it only with my left hand.
With the appearance of "PrairyErth" it is immediately obvious what Mr. Least Heat-Moon has been doing for the past almost 10 years, and that is researching and writing this densely printed 624-page book. "PrairyErth" (a term used to describe prairie soils that Mr. Heat-Moon draws from "an old taxonomy") is not on the face of it a travel book, any more than is Gilbert White's "Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne" -- a work it much resembles in form and intention. The subtitle, "A Deep Map," is not much help, being at once idiosyncratic and gnomic (I suppose he means the invasive procedure of writing about an alien landscape). But "Blue Highways" proved beyond any doubt that Mr. Heat-Moon is nothing if not gnomic. If "Prairy Erth" is travel at all it is travel in eccentric circles -- but the word "eccentric" in the sense of "off-center" is also wildly inappropriate, since the landscape of Mr. Heat-Moon's book, Chase County, Kansas, is at the geographical center of our country. "I have traveled a good deal in Concord," Thoreau said, and in this book Mr. Heat-Moon has covered just about every inch in the 774 square miles of Chase County, met most of its people, noted most of its Burma-Shave signs, and disproved the scribbled graffito "Living in Kansas is a contradiction."
It is a wonderful and welcome book and has the distinct virtue of being completely unexpected. It is as different from "Blue Highways" as any book is likely to be, but obviously written by the same man, who is thoroughly friendly and patient, rather self-conscious, slightly pedantic (he knows the words "forb" and "chert" and you don't), something of a loner, a trifle old-fashioned, a bit mystical and just as much at home in the tallgrass prairie as on the far side of a cracker barrel. He is also something of a naturalist, though he is lacking in the misanthropy that characterizes that calling -- nature lovers are so often people haters.
Chase County has a total population of 3,013, and on Mr. Heat-Moon's reckoning there is not a bad egg among them. To his great credit, he is lavish in reporting the Kansas idiom: "He's been around the sun bettern fifty times," and "All I ever caught was a limb in the face," and the man who "wasn't worth a bushel of damn hedgeballs" and, in a more sinister vein: "The other guy shot the colored boy in the back of the head and got off on self-defense -- convinced the jury the guy use to wear his hat backwards."
Of the living heroes and just plain folks Mr. Heat-Moon finds, there is the cowboy Slim Pinkston, "a character shaped by the bovine nature of the animals he spends his days with"; Larry Wagner, crippled by polio, who is eloquent in his attempt to save the tallgrass prairie; Linda Thurston, whose cafe went bust: "We never did get the farmers to eat alfalfa sprouts. They know silage when they see it. Maybe we should have tried it with gravy"; and Blanche Schwilling from Bazaar, serving up Scripture tea (a Bible quotation on every tag), and Frank Gaddie of the same hamlet who loves the treeless prairie so intensely that he remarks, "It's got so I hate a tree"; Fidel Ybarra, who remembers every spike he has driven and every railroad tie he has set; Lloyd Soyez, who perhaps saved de Gaulle from being assassinated by German snipers in Paris -- and spared the French nation; and a nameless but memorable customer in the Strong City cafe, who described his Kansas encounter with a history professor in Hush Puppies from Back East: "Couldn't tell a sycamore from a cottonwood, hadn't the least idea of what kind of tree to cut a wagon axle out of. He wasn't exactly sure what an ox is. He didn't know how to make hominy, hadn't ever skinned a squirrel or milked a cow -- and he got paid fifty thousand a year to tell college kids about the West."
This is rural Kansas, but a far cry from the grim lunacy of "In Cold Blood," the fantasy of "The Wizard of Oz" or from Ian Frazier's vivid but shapeless "Great Plains." It is all prairie, and mostly pleasure -- nothing here that smacks of the prairie fear felt by such natives of it as Willa Cather, who had an absolute horror of grassland. If "PrairyErth" has a fault it is that it is almost entirely a celebration, even when it does not mean to be. It is a good-hearted book about the heart of the country. Mr. Heat-Moon does not make much of the xenophobia he encounters, nor does he explore the racism -- the anti-black and anti-Hispanic sentiments he hears. He takes people as he finds them and they put up with his note-taking. Nagged for drinking a beer with his lunch in a cemetery ("This isn't a tavern") he just smiles. "You'll be tolerated even if they do think you're about a half bubble off plumb," a woman tells the author, making him feel he has been complimented. I kept wondering why he apparently spent all his time in motels. If these people are the salt of the earth why didn't they offer him a bed? And while I am quibbling, why was it that few showed much concern about the greater world beyond Kansas? I have recently been in the Solomon Islands, and I heard more intelligent political talk and global concern from one naked Melanesian on Guadalcanal than Mr. Heat-Moon heard from a whole county of Kansas farmers.
It is risky for any book to attempt to be exhaustive, and this is as true for "Moby-Dick" as it is for "PrairyErth." The risk is that lengthy extracts can break the spell of reading, and because such a book -- as shuffling and potbellied with undigested stuff as the Kansans it describes -- may quickly became nothing more than a data base, something to sort and study. The catalogue, the long digression, the essay-within-the-text, the scrapbook, the potted history, the rural lexicon, the natural history exhibit -- all of this served up as narration -- can blunt the edge ofreading.
I was bouncing along quite nicely with "PrairyErth" when I turned a page, came upon a new chapter and read the opening: "A couple of sentences of personal testimony (thoroughfare readers not happy on byways may proceed to the next chapter)," which is hardly a gripping way to begin, or one likely to inspire a reader to dig in. And this diffident caveat is not necessary, since the chapter is a useful disquisition on Mr. Heat-Moon's own name and on the 140 ways Kansas has been spelled. This being an exhaustive book, each different name is lovingly set down.
Another chapter is entirely about Kansas hawks, yet another concerns the Kansas wood rat, there is a disquisition on fence posts (Kansas being particularly rich in this item) and 17 pages containing colorful news stories that the author found in old Chase County newspapers ("Chewed By Hogs," "Homestead Notes" etc.). A 22-page chapter is made up of extracts from eyewitness accounts of the indigenous people, the Kaw Indians. There is a 200-item inventory of the contents of a covered wagon. I have read it all, and because I have I know that some of it seems skippable. There is also, toward the end, a chapter about nothing in particular -- simply a long quasi-mystical rumination about what might have been in that chapter, though in it the author discloses that his book is twice as long as he had intended. A hundred pages, nearly one-sixth of "PrairyErth," are given over to squibs and quotations from the author's "commonplace book" -- extracts from authors as various as D. H. Lawrence, Thoreau, Horace Greeley, Audubon, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, James Agee, Walt Whitman, Laurence Sterne, and -- yes -- Gilbert White's "Selborne."
If Mr. Heat-Moon does not know when to stop, that is the sign of real passion in a traveler. There is a great deal of love and happiness in the book, and because he is truly inspired by the landscape he has achieved something akin to Gilbert White's book, and made his own a home-grown oddity, something that would rather uncertainly be catalogued in a library under "Topography." And yet what is it? It is history, travel, anthropology, geography, journalism, confession, memoir, natural history and autobiography. It is the life and times of Chase County, and incidentally everything you need to know about Kansas. That last might seem a backhanded description, but we live in strange times when every economic refugee and his brother and sister have begun to regard America as a sort of ship that will speed them as far away as possible from their own hungry and quarreling homeland.
America was a good idea, and also an idealistic notion, long before it was a destination for desperate souls. "PrairyErth" is a salutary book because it goes against the notion that America is all flux and newcomers.
Kansas is the way we were, and it is the way many people in this country still are. By concentrating his scrutiny on this small area of rural America, where families have been settled for generations, where folks are folks and there is a strong sense of attachment to the land; by accumulating a vast mass of detail, and querying whether the West was won in quite the way we felt it was, Mr. Heat-Moon has succeeded in recapturing a sense of the American grain that will give the book a permanent place in the literature of our country. I mean to say that in its doggedness, its thoroughness and its ingenious design, the book -- in its intentional crankiness -- has value both as a historical document and as personal testimony.
 
 
 
THE PURGATORY OF MILEAGE
 There are several ways not to walk in the prairie, and one of them is with your eye on a far goal, because you then begin to believe you're not closing the distance any more than you would with a mirage. My woodland sense of scale and time didn't fit this country, and I started wondering whether I could reach the summit before dark. On the prairie, distance and the miles of air turn movement to stasis and openness to a wall, a thing as difficult to penetrate as dense forest. I was hiking in a chamber of absences where the near was the same as the far, and it seemed every time I raised a step the earth rotated under me so that my foot fell just where it had lifted from. Limits and markers make travel possible for people: circumscribe our lines of sight and we can really get somewhere. Before me lay the Kansas of popular conception from Coronado on -- that place you have to get through, that purgatory of mileage.
But I kept walking, and, when I dropped into hollows . . . I focused on a rock or a tuft of grass to keep from convoluting my track. Hiking in woods allows a traveler to imagine comforting enclosures, one leading to the next, and the walker can possess those little encompassed spaces, but the prairie and plains permit no such possession. Whatever else prairie is -- grass, sky, wind -- it is most of all a paradigm of infinity, a clearing full of many things except boundaries, and its power comes from its apparent limitlessness; there is no such thing as a small prairie any more than there is a little ocean, and the consequence of both is this challenge: try to take yourself seriously out here, you bipedal plodder, you complacent cartoon. -- From "PrairyErth."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
When the Final Act Is Only a Beginning

BYLINE: By A. R. GURNEY; A. R. Gurney's latest play, "The Snow Ball," has had productions in Hartford, San Diego and, most recently, Boston.

 BODY:
People in the theater tend to lament the evanescence of our craft, as performances and productions come and go like bubbles on a stream. Sometimes, however, this very transience gives us an opportunity we might not find elsewhere. Books and films, for example, once they are published or produced, are pretty much frozen for eternity, with all their virtues and flaws permanently in place. A play, on the other hand, can be rewritten and reworked after its initial production, in many cases to its considerable improvement.
Until recently, this process of adjustment would usually occur on the way to New York, where a Broadway opening was deemed the ultimate destination for a new play. Yet nowadays, a very different process can take place to keep a work alive. A play may open for a limited run at an Off Broadway theater, be reviewed and then be rewritten or amended for a new and extended life elsewhere in the country. 
 I myself am going through this procedure right now. Last spring, a play of mine called "The Old Boy," directed by John Rubinstein, with Stephen Collins in the title role, opened at Playwrights Horizons. Good as the production may have been, the play itself had problems from the beginning. Prior to and during the previews, we made many changes, but I don't think any of us was totally content with what we had. Nonetheless, the play worked well enough in the weeks before opening to garner serious offers from two sets of producers. One group thought it should go right to Broadway, while the other was interested in a run at an Off Broadway theater. Of course, once the reviews came in, all smiles stopped. No reviewer gave that loud unqualified shout of praise normally needed to carry a play forward over the shoals of economic risk into the pleasant harbor of an unlimited run on Broadway or Off Broadway.
In our desperation to keep the producers on the line, John Rubinstein managed to cull from all these notices a list of complimentary quotations. But the cost of producing plays in New York being what it is today, and the risk of keeping a problematic one alive during the summer and early fall seasons with their erratic attendance, caused both sets of producers to have second thoughts.
I was harboring second thoughts as well. I had begun to notice an inconsistency of response in the audience, which particularly bothered me. One night, the actors were playing to good laughs, the next, the audience seemed introspective and intense. Houses, of course, vary from night to night, but this variance didn't feel quite right.
In addition, many reviews seemed to circle around a few common complaints: I may have written a number of strong scenes, but there was too much exposition, a slight tipping toward melodrama, and the supporting characters kept running away with the ball. Friends and colleagues also suggested that the ending didn't quite pay off. You can always tell when you're not hitting down the center of the fairway by the coded responses of those who speak to you afterwards: "Congratulations on your play." "I had an interesting time." "You sure pushed a lot of buttons in this one." Very few people said, "I loved it," which is what I was hoping to hear. I thought about all this for a while, and after the dust from the closing settled, decided I'd better get back to the drawing board.
Rewriting can be a dangerous enterprise. You can do too little or too much, particularly when you're not playing nightly to a paying audience, whose reaction should be the final arbiter of whatever you do. Most of us in the theater are so wedded to our work that the smallest change seems to us to send wild tremors up and down the entire evening.
Furthermore, the fact that you feel the need to rewrite at all may be, in itself, a bad sign. Good plays are supposed to be inherently organic, and it may be some sort of violation to mess around with them. Those that need to be tinkered with may end up seeming carpentered and contrived, if they weren't that way to begin with. Did Beckett rewrite "Waiting for Godot" after its first bad reviews? Wasn't Shakespeare supposed to have never blotted a line?
A few times in my life I've written plays that, for better or worse, required very little tuning once they were under way. I know it's a special pleasure to work on these plays, but I also know that these are not the only plays that are any good. "Hamlet," to me, has the feel of a play that Shakespeare fussed with a good deal, and we know how many tries it took Chekhov to come up with "Uncle Vanya." Lucky as we are when works spring to life fully armed, there are many times when we write other things that need to be patted and pushed and pulled into the right shape.
There's another problem with rewriting a play if you reassess it immediately after a production you feel proud of. The actors and the director have, of course, put their special stamp on the enterprise, and in many cases have made moments work, or seem to work, which possibly have no right to. If you are now trying to retool the play for subsequent productions, you can delude yourself into holding onto lines, bits or even scenes that may have been totally dependent on the special talents of your recent collaborators. There are plays that good actors or directors can make particularly their own, and which may evaporate once they're divorced from the talents of the Lunts or Jerry Zaks.
Still, here I am, armed with the hope that I have a good thing at its core, and the conviction that I should take one more stab at making it better. I'm detached by several months from the compelling immediacy of the Playwrights Horizons production, influenced by the insights of several people I've learned to trust, and lured by the anticipation of another production at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego later this year.
"The Old Boy" is about a youngish State Department official, about to run for governor, who is invited to give the commencement address at his alma mater, a distinguished New England boarding school. During the weekend there, he learns that a classmate, for whom he was an "old boy," or mentor, has recently died of AIDS. Through a series of flashbacks, the politician comes to recognize the bankruptcy of the old-boy values by which he both lived his life and guided his friend, and therefore his own complicity in his friend's death. He proclaims as much in an emotional address at the school graduation, possibly destroying his career but liberating himself as a human being.
Most rewrites require a certain amount of carpentering -- the sort of cutting and shaping and sanding that writers learn to do if they've been around awhile. The trick is not to let the seams show. I've tried to make these adjustments on "The Old Boy," hoping to simplify the beginning, shore up the strange dip from seriousness to solemnity in the middle of the first act and keep the ball in the air more effectively throughout.
Yet, I had two knottier problems. One was the climactic commencement address, which, no matter what we did, always seemed self-conscious and stagy. In our attempt to do something different -- have the main character give an impassioned speech while another character comments cynically on it -- we seemed to take the audience out of the play, rather than pull them in deeper. This sense of a double perspective is achieved all the time in the movies or in opera, but we couldn't do it on the Playwrights Horizons stage. We tried scrims, microphones, cutting, adding, but we never got the thing quite right. The result always seemed tricky and artificial, and the audience came away more concerned with a sense of the device than with what we were trying to say through it.
Another problem was that my main character, the "old boy," didn't seem to engage either the audience or the critics as much as several minor characters did. William Sloane Coffin makes the distinction between a "nice guy" and a "good man," and in one sense my play was supposed to be about a conversion from the former to the latter. Yet his transition wasn't happening the way we wanted on stage. Other characters with less subtle journeys to make kept attracting attention. "Too many stories," Elia Kazan told me after he came to see it.
In addressing these two concerns, my hope was that if I could get the hero right, his final speech would fall into place in the right way. I found myself exploring in more depth the limits of his own emotional life, and once I had found those, I could revise the dialogue so that he became more understandable as he tried to impose similar limits on his friend. I also tried to simplify and smooth out the more baroque elements in the plot lines of the supporting characters so that they would remain firmly in the same play, and therefore more firmly supportive of the protagonist.
Having done all these things, I found, when my hero arrives at his final speech, that our scrim, microphone and synchronized dialogue were no longer needed. He seemed to want to talk simply and directly to the audience. The tonal complexity we strove for is, to a degree, still there, but it now emerges from the form and nature of the speech, as the speaker provides his own commencement by giving himself a final exam.
The producer Roger Stevens is fond of saying, "O.K., now take out the improvements," and possibly Old Globe audiences for "The Old Boy" will tell me to do the same. But I like to think I've been plugging the leaks, recaulking the seams, reshaping the bow and stern in the hope that this time the ship will have a longer voyage.
This is not to say that the New York experience hasn't been extremely valuable. New York preview audiences are the savviest in the world -- with their strange combination of skepticism, empathy and professional awareness -- and the changes I've made are largely the result of their responses. But I also have to conclude that, at least for me, a New York production of a play has become more and more like the "Go" square on the Monopoly board. You have to pass through it to stay in the game, you may collect your $200, but landing there is not necessarily the end of the game.

HENRY CLAY
Statesman for the Union.
By Robert V. Remini.
Illustrated. 818 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $35.  
 In 1832 a gangly 23-year-old grocery clerk was occasionally seen in a skiff on the Sangamon River in central Illinois, charting depths and wondering how improvements might bring steamboats and prosperity to New Salem. Politically attuned people would not have needed to ask about his politics: young Abraham Lincoln obviously was a Henry Clay man. When in the winter of 1837 the Illinois legislature passed an enormous ($10 million) appropriation to subsidize construction of railroads, canals and turnpikes, there were bonfires and dancing in the streets of the state capital, Vandalia.
To understand why such things engaged such passions, and why they should have, read Robert V. Remini's fine biography "Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union." One of the master builders of modern America, Clay was a man of the middle, and not just politically, in his role as "The Great Compromiser" of sectional disputes. His career flowered smack in the middle of America's protracted founding. How protracted was it? Precisely fourscore and nine years. The process of coming together, institutionally and emotionally, from a loose aggregation of colonists to a single body politic -- citizens of a nation with a competent central government -- began in Philadelphia in early July 1776, and was punctuated with an exclamation mark in April 1865, at Appomattox.
Clay was 29 years old and constitutionally under age when he was first sent to the United States Senate by the legislature of Kentucky. But he preferred the turbulence of the House, to which he won election at the age of 34. He became Speaker on his first day as a member. He, together with the other two-thirds of "the great triumvirate," Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun, was a star of "the next generation," the one that would build a commercial society on the political foundations the Founders had put in place.
Clay came as a young man to a Washington where rain often made Pennsylvania Avenue impassable. It was a Washington where President Thomas Jefferson agreed to sign the bill authorizing Federal construction of roads, but admonished Congress that the Constitution should be amended to authorize such activities, lest the doctrine of "implied powers" become a large loophole and the Constitution itself mostly a loophole. Clay quickly became what the country became and still is. Rhetorically he was a Jeffersonian; actually he was a Hamiltonian, asserting implied powers sufficient for his "American System." That system involved enactment of tariffs, "internal improvements" (roads, canals, railroads) and other elements of the infrastructure of a unified commercial nation with an energetic central government "adequate to the exigencies of the Union" (Hamilton's words).
 Mr. Remini, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has spent most of his professional life in the company, as it were, of Clay's most formidable enemy, Andrew Jackson. He has written many books about the general, his era and the ideology to which Jackson gave a name: his own. Jackson's name became an adjective; Clay's never did. Clay was a legislator; Jackson was a leader.
Clay's name is usually near the top of lists drawn up to support the assertion by the British political theorist, Lord Bryce, that America's greatest statesmen generally do not get to the White House. But reading Mr. Remini's book leaves one far from certain that Clay, although unquestionably a great man, was suited to the Presidency. Clay, who had an acute sense of the dynamics of America's rapidly evolving society, was remarkably blind to the public's changing political values and expectations.
Clay is primarily remembered for relentlessly pursuing an ambition that went unfulfilled, and for meticulously crafting and doggedly enacting compromises that ultimately failed. He burned with Presidential ambition, burned so fiercely that he irrevocably blighted his chances early on, in the Presidential election of 1824 -- or, more precisely, the election of February 1825.
Today, as this nation sleepwalks into a remarkably dull Presidential season, it is instructive, diverting and amusing to read Mr. Remini's account of the events of 1824, when John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Crawford and Clay competed for the Presidency. Clay wildly misjudged his strength in the various state procedures that selected Presidential electors. When these procedures failed to produce a majority for any candidate, the choice went to the House, which had to pick from among the top three. Speaker Clay had finished fourth. There was bargaining galore, some of it involving trivialities that were ludicrous in light of the great office at issue (the man who alone would cast Missouri's vote presented Adams with a list of printers he wanted appointed to print the laws in Missouri). And Clay supposedly made the "corrupt bargain" that was to haunt him the rest of his life.
Was there an explicit agreement between Clay and Adams? It is hard to say for sure. But against the instructions of the Kentucky legislature, which favored Jackson, Clay supported Adams, who had not officially received a single popular vote in Kentucky. When Adams became President he named Clay his Secretary of State, an office Clay craved because he was sure it was a stepping stone to the White House.
Reading Mr. Remini's book it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Clay, when operating outside of legislative chambers, was a lousy politician. He was comfortable in Congress; indeed, he was an artist in Washington's ways. But he was barely conversant with what was just then beginning to matter: public opinion. A century before there was a Washington Beltway, Clay had what is now known as the "beltway mentality."
He had a melodious voice, a flair for self-dramatization and a sense of style that he acquired in his youth (he had heard Patrick Henry speak) and modified with appropriate anecdotes and profanity for Kentucky tastes. Mr. Remini's descriptions of Clay, the consummate actor, evoke an era when rhetoric, sent forth by the unamplified human voice, was a vital instrument of governance.
He was full to brimming over with the juices of life, frequently injuring his own political interests by acts of inadequate calculation. But his incaution makes him particularly alluring to any student of today's politicians. Clay, you see, was utterly unmanaged and unpackaged. He had what the 41st President was to call "the vision thing." He created it from his own observations and passions, without the help of polls or "focus groups" massaged by committees of consultants. Further, he was on speaking terms with the English language, which he wielded energetically, sometimes as a club, often as a stiletto, occasionally one too sharp for his own good.
Clay not infrequently drank too much and gambled recklessly. Westerners, as Kentuckians then were, were thought susceptible, and even entitled, to such behavior. His strenuous conviviality, which political enemies insisted was much more unsavory than that, included a conspicuous enjoyment of the company of various women when, as was frequently the case, Mrs. Clay was away. It is as impossible to know the truth of the innuendoes that swirled around him as it is to know their consequences, but they cannot have helped his career.
Part of the poignancy of Clay's life is that we can now see that his clever attempts to legislate compromises concerning slavery amounted to attempts to lasso a locomotive with cobwebs. Consider, for example, Clay's last great work, the Compromise of 1850, which addressed conflicts concerning the treatment of slavery in the several jurisdictions within the vast territories acquired in the war with Mexico (1846-48). Mr. Remini believes, reasonably, that the Compromise postponed the Civil War for a decade, and may thereby have saved the nation. Thanks to Clay, the nation had 10 more years to enlarge its manpower and develop its industrial might and find that good Clay man, Lincoln, and thereby prevail.
It is a measure of Mr. Remini's thorough yet understated scholarship that he notes, but does not dwell on, the fact that after winning passage of the Compromise of 1850, Clay "left Washington on Saturday, September 28, and arrived back in Lexington on October 2, a journey of incredible speed, thanks to the railroad." Seven hundred pages earlier Mr. Remini had written of Clay's trip from Kentucky to Washington in December 1806, "traveling by boat up the Ohio River and then by stagecoach over almost impassable roads."
By the 1850's the roar of steam powering steel wheels over steel rails was the sound of American society -- meaning, primarily, the economy -- preparing to settle what politics and legislatures could not. The supposedly prosaic (as we are apt mistakenly to think) matter of "internal improvements" was crucial to the improvement of the nation's inner, meaning moral, life -- and to the showdown over slavery. Railroads carrying conscripts, who were carrying weapons mass-produced from interchangeable parts, would be the North's decisive riposte to the South's constitutional arguments. Railroads, and the steel mills and coal mines and immigrant labor behind them, closed the question that could not be compromised.
Clay's "American System" helped to save the American experiment. Thus the life of the Great Compromiser illustrates the practical importance of political programs. But it also illustrates the limits of politics as a leash on large, rushing events.

HEADLINE: Bailout Data Questioned

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Congressional auditors say they cannot determine the accuracy of the savings and loan bailout's financial statements because of uncertain real estate markets and the agency's poor accounting controls.
The refusal of the General Accounting Office to offer an opinion on the Resolution Trust Corporation's 1990 statement, although expected, is another blow to the two-year-old agency's efforts to obtain $80 billion from Congress to continue its cleanup program. 
 It has received $80 billion since its creation in August 1989 and says it will run out of money in weeks. It is asking for another $80 billion to finish its work by October 1993.
Some Democrats in Congress have warned that they will vote against the fund request unless G.A.O. auditors give the R.T.C. financial statements what accountants call a "clean," or unqualified, opinion.
"Our audit disclosed that significant uncertainties exist affecting the corporation's cost estimates for resolving institutions and that the corporation lacked certain internal critical controls in 1990"' the G.A.O.'s head, Charles A. Bowsher, said in a letter to Congressional leaders.
But he noted that the R.T.C. had begun new procedures to cure its internal control problems. And he said that the chief sources of uncertainty were beyond the agency's control, including the weak economy and overbuilt real estate markets and their effect on the value of the properties the R.T.C. had inherited from failed savings and loans.

HEADLINE: Third World Debt Relief

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The Paris Club of creditor governments will meet in November to review Britain's proposal for greater debt forgiveness for the world's poorest nations, the Treasury Department says.
Officials of the club, made up of Western creditor nations including the United States, met last week in Paris to discuss debt relief requests. 
 Treasury officials said on Friday that the British debt-forgiveness proposal, which calls for write-offs of two-thirds of about $25.5 billion in debts held by 20 low-income nations, received support from some of the 18 Paris Club states present at the meeting.
But a Treasury spokesman said representatives at the talks were seeking further review of the proposals with their government ministers before giving a specific response.
The Paris Club officials were formally presented with Prime Minister John Major's appeal to put into effect quickly the so-called Trinidad terms he proposed in September 1990, a Treasury spokesman said.
The Trinidad terms allow debtor countries to renegotiate their entire debt instead of rescheduling parts of it, provided the eligible countries have begun economic reform programs sanctioned by the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Clients See Better Service From Agencies and Media

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE relationships of American advertisers with their advertising agencies and the media are improving, the departing chairman of the Association of National Advertisers says, as agencies and the media rediscover that "their focus has to be on one thing -- how to build business for their clients."
"If the clients' business prospers, all prosper," Philip Guarascio, the executive in charge of corporate marketing and advertising for the General Motors Corporation and the association's departing chairman, said in a telephone interview before the group's 82d annual meeting and business conference. The conference, at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, began yesterday and will continue through tomorrow. 
 With rare exceptions, prosperity is a quality in scant supply among the association's members, companies that account for almost 80 percent of the regional and national advertising spending in the United States. As the enonomic doldrums drag on, those afflicted include not only advertisers like General Motors, whose businesses are cyclical in nature. Also hampered are advertisers like the Procter & Gamble Company, whose businesses were once deemed recession resistant if not recession-proof.
"Given the pressures we are under," Mr. Guarascio said, "we all understand we have to deal with problems unique to our own industries." Even so, he added, he is pleased that during his year as chairman, the association's members have been able to spend more time on "what we share in common."
And what they share most is a recognition that "the structure of the business has irrevocably changed," he said, "in terms of our relationships with agencies and the media."
Elaborating on the agencies, Mr. Guarascio said, "for too long, they got into the business of managing their business first and their clients' business second; that order has to be reversed."
Mr. Guarascio said he was now glimpsing signs that agencies were indeed "making a major effort to get that back in balance." In particular, he added, "agency resources are being concentrated on client business, and senior managers are spending more time on clients."
Mr. Guarascio gave no specific examples, but among recent evidence is Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide's announcement last week of a restructuring meant to enable top executives to devote more energy to key advertising and direct-marketing accounts and less to public relations and sales-promotion activities.
As for the media, Mr. Guarascio said, they are "doing less prepackaging and more listening."
He said, for example, that they are de-emphazising cross-media advertising sales programs based solely on what properties they happen to own. Instead, he continued, the media are "saying first, 'Let us understand what your problems are,' " and then designing programs to meet those needs.
Two media companies that Mr. Guarascio cited as having shifted focus in such a manner were Time Warner Inc. and Hachette Publications Inc.
Mr. Guarascio's one-year term as chairman of the association is to end today, when members are scheduled to elect as his successor L. Ross Love, vice president of advertising of Procter & Gamble Worldwide. Mr. Love has served as the association's vice chairman for the last year. Scheduled to be elected to succeed Mr. Love as vice chairman is Harry E. Davis, director of communications in the external affairs department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
Among those scheduled to speak during the conference are Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and chief executive of Procter & Gamble; Robert L. Crandall, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines Inc.; Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman and chief executive of BBDO New York, and David Ogilvy, the founder of Ogilvy & Mather.
The conference is expected to draw 450 people, up from about 430 last year.

HEADLINE: Lower Pollution Tied to Prosperity

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
A study correlating economic development and air pollution by two Princeton University professors has concluded that pollution tends to diminish as a country's economy grows beyond a certain level of prosperity.
The study, which taps international pollution data not readily known to economists, also finds that patterns of United States investment in Mexico do not indicate an effort by companies to avoid American pollution controls. 
 The research tends to support the Bush Administration's position that a free-trade agreement with Mexico would not be environmentally destructive. And it suggests that some environmentalists' predictions that economic growth and free trade in the developing world may ravage the world's environment are overstated.
The study was done by Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, economics professors at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and was presented at a conference at Brown University on Oct. 18. Mexico's Ministry of Commerce and Industry sponsored the conference and indirectly helped to finance the research, although the authors said the Mexican Government took no part in their work.
The study compared national economic output figures with air-pollution studies conducted in several dozen cities worldwide over the last 14 years by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Health Organization. It found that air pollution was most severe for countries with an economic output of $4,000 to $5,000 a person and less severe for considerably poorer and considerably richer countries.
Mexico, with an output per person of $5,000, "is at the critical juncture in its development process, where further growth should generate increased political pressures for environmental protection and perhaps a change in private consumption behavior," the report said.
 
Suspicions Confirmed
 Vinod Thomas, the World Bank's chief economist for Asia, said the study was the first to confirm many experts' suspicions that pollution increases during the early stages of a country's development and then begins to diminish as countries gain adequate resources to tackle pollution problems.
Jagdish Bhagwati, the Columbia University professor of economics who is overseeing a report on trade and the environment for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said, "There's been no systematic work" until now. He added that the GATT report would include a separate discussion of the new findings.
Justin R. Ward, a senior resource specialist and trade expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group, said that while the Princeton study's results were encouraging, specific environmental safeguards should be written into the agreement to insure that Mexico did not prove an exception.
 
Savings in Labor Costs
 To examine the role of pollution regulations in trade and investment with Mexico, the Princeton professors used Census Bureau data on pollution control spending as a percentage of total costs in each of many different industries. Savings on labor costs dwarfed pollution control savings, they found, and American industries with the highest pollution-control costs have lost an almost imperceptibly larger portion of their markets to imports than industries with average pollution control costs.
Mr. Bhagwati expressed skepticism at the report's conclusion that companies move operations to Mexico to take advantage of low wage costs rather than lax enforcement of environmental rules. "I find it difficult to believe people aren't going to pay attention if the pollution abatement costs are at least 20 percent less, much less 50 percent," he said.
Mr. Grossman, who assumed in his analysis that companies faced no pollution-control costs in Mexico at all, said that his work only showed that there were few companies for which even the elimination of pollution-control costs would make a difference in deciding where to locate factories.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Higher U.S. Cost Is Seen In New Auction Rules

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Changes announced last week to broaden participation in Treasury auctions will probably not have a noticeable impact on the quarterly refunding auctions next month, some analysts and Wall Street executives say.
But they add that the changes in the auction rules, in conjunction with other shifts under consideration, could drive up the Government's borrowing costs in the future. 
 The changes follow the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal, which has severely shaken faith in the decades-long manner in which business has been conducted by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the primary dealers of Government securities.
With the economy soft and inflation under control, fundamental conditions remain favorable for the coming auctions. Moreover, the rule changes announced by the Treasury will not change the auction process much.
 
Some Short-Term Risk
 Nevertheless, by choosing to put the changes into effect at the start of the refunding auctions on Nov. 5, the Treasury has opened itself up to some short-term risk.
The size of the refunding is expected to be announced on Wednesday. Most analysts expect the Treasury to sell a total of $38 billion worth of 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
The overall size of the auctions and the existence of the speculative 10-year and 30-year offerings make these quarterly debt sales the riskiest the Treasury conducts each year.
And the auctions will take place in the week after credit market participants will have digested a series of important economic reports, including the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate on third-quarter economic growth, and October employment data from the Labor Department.
 
Potential Market Shift
 If those statistics are stronger than currently anticipated, the market's mood could suddenly shift. And a shift in market sentiment could make even the mildest changes in auction rules difficult and possibly expensive for the nation's taxpayers by driving up interest rates.
"I don't think there will be any impact, but financial regulation is subject to the law of unanticipated circumstances," said Louis van B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. "And when you change auction rules, the last place you want to experiment with is the refunding."
Apart from the potential effects of the economic statistics, Mr. Crandall and others said that for the time being, the Treasury's decision to open the bidding process would not mean much. Until now, only primary dealers have been permitted to submit bids for clients.
"Until the Treasury automates the auction process and allows customers to bid directly through a computer facility, it is to customers' advantage to continue bidding through primary dealers," said Richard M. Kelly, chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer.
 
Choice for Customers
 Without an automated system, customers will have the choice of physically submitting tender offers to the New York Fed before auction time, or telephoning primary dealers to place their bids. The Treasury has made it plain that it will accelerate efforts to automate the process. But that job will not be completed before the refunding auctions.
For the time being, the decision to increase the maximum amount of securities awarded to noncompetitive tender bids to $5 million, from $1 million, will also not have much impact.
But Mr. Crandall said that under different market conditions, increasing the size of noncompetitive awards, which are made at the yield reflecting the average of accepted competitive tenders, will drive up borrowing costs.
"There is no way that change is more favorable to the Treasury," Mr. Crandall said. "We are in a bull market right now, so it won't have any impact. But in a down market, where you have a wider dispersal of bids, the larger noncompetitive awards will produce higher yields for the Treasury. At the margin, this rule change can only be bad for the taxpayer."
 
Righting Another Wrong
 Along with promoting broader distribution of securities at the auctions -- which presumably will make it more difficult for dealers to gain control of a particular security at an auction -- the Treasury also intends to right another wrong Salomon committed by developing a way to prevent primary dealers from placing unauthorized bids on behalf of customers.
The method under discussion would require customers to send letters of verification to the Treasury before the settlement dates of securities sales indicating they had bid for a certain amount of securities.
Mr. Kelly, who served as a Treasury official in the Carter Administration, contends that policing firms and their customers in this manner would be inefficient and costly.
"I already find customers who have indicated reluctance to send letters of any kind to the Fed or Treasury verifying an auction bid," he said.
"Some customers might find this to be such a nuisance that they choose no longer to bid at the auctions but rather to purchase their securities in the secondary market," he added. "That in turn will transfer the auction risk to the primary dealers."

Various Culprits for Ailing Recovery

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
It was forecast to be the recession that Washington could safely ignore -- a stumble in response to gulf war jitters, then a graceful return to growth with hardly a break in stride. But somebody apparently forgot to tell Corporate America, whose efforts to regain financial stability and to become more competitive have slowed the recovery to a crawl.
Bad news keeps trickling in: falling auto sales, depressed lending activity, rising unemployment insurance claims. And last week the Federal Reserve reported flat manufacturing output and flatter moods across the economy. A plausible guess now is that it will take another year to erase the effects of national recession -- and at least five more to complete the recovery in the badly depressed Northeast.
 
Two Reasons Cited
 What went wrong? Americans are used to seeing the economy bounce back after recession. But the sharper business swings of the past are not useful as a benchmark for this recovery for two reasons, says Neal Soss at the First Boston Corporation. Mild recessions like the one we have just had, he argues, are generally followed by weak recoveries because as companies scramble to increase inventories, the built-in kick is smaller. 
 But more important, Mr. Soss says, are the unique forces that are chilling the recovery this time around.
There are several, and everyone has a favorite culprit. The Bush Administration blames bank regulators and banks, which no longer seem willing to bet the depositors' money on anything less than a sure thing. Liberal Democrats and their sometime allies among supply-side conservatives blame the deficit-reduction agreement, which made it far more difficult to use the budget to stimulate private spending. And many business economists blame a sobered Corporate America, whose survival strategy is built on keeping payrolls lean and moving profit-draining inventories onto someone else's balance sheet.
 
A Painful Transition
 Robert Reischauer, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, says they all have a point. He argues that both Government and business were insulated from pressures to become more efficient in the 1980's. The chickens may not yet have come to roost, he says, but they are "circling the barn."
The modest downturn precipitated drastic cost-cutting measures in many industries, which have made it far more difficult for the economy as a whole to rebound. When the transformations are complete, American industry in general and service industries in particular will be more productive and, presumably, more competitive in the world economy. But in the meantime -- a period likely to be measured in years, not months -- the transition will be painful.
The first signs that the economy was headed for hard times actually date from mid-1989, when stable growth dissolved into a wobble. But America's first recession since 1982 began only in the summer of 1990 with the Hussein-inspired spike in oil prices.
Buffered by a timely easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the 1.2 percent slip in output was less than half the decline in the 1982-83 recession. Unemployment, which peaked at 7.0 percent in July, seems a mere glitch beside the 10.7 percent recorded in Nov. 1982. If, as widely anticipated, the economy had rebounded briskly this summer, the latest recession would surely have been written off as the least traumatic in two decades.
But while the recession probably is over -- output did grow a bit in the third quarter of this year -- the bloom is likely to remain missing from many a cheek for a very long time. David Hale of Kemper Financial Services notes that the recovery in employment is proceeding at just one-third the pace of the 1981-82 and 1974-75 recessions. First-time claims for jobless benefits in early October reached a five-month high. And auto sales this fall have been running well below last year's already depressed levels, virtually guaranteeing that Detroit will post its worst-ever losses in 1991.
The No. 1 villain at the White House is the credit crunch. Unlike previous recessions in which inflation was seen as a problem, the Federal Reserve moved nimbly to make money available for private spending: interest rates on short-term loans are down by a third since last year. But this financial easing has apparently been largely offset by banks' reluctance to make risky loans after taking a bath in commercial real estate in the 1980's. Moreover, the banks' born-again conservatism has been reinforced by regulatory reforms (imposed long before the recession) that require them to back higher-risk loans with extra capital.
 
Struggling Service Industries
 Alan Blinder of Princeton University notes that there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that small businesses are feeling the effects of the banks' zeal. And "while the data has yet to dry," he said, research by Ben Bernanke of Princeton and Cara Lown of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York support the idea that credit is being rationed by region: the volume of business loans has collapsed in New England and the Middle Atlantic States, where banks are in deepest trouble.
Another factor draining wind from the recovery's sails is widespread corporate reluctance to add to overhead costs as orders increase. Robert Giordano of Goldman, Sachs & Company notes that employers are making more use of overtime, thereby limiting employment gains in recent months to just half what might have been expected.
Tightfistedness is also working to slow orders for industrial supplies, the classic antidote to recession blues. At the beginning of September, manufacturers' inventories were still 2 percent below the level at the trough of the recession in April. And manufacturers like the General Electric Company, which have been pushing "just-in-time" supply policies for years, continue to pare away at inventory expenses. Gary Rogers, a senior vice president, says G.E.'s appliance division can now transform piles of parts into finished washers and refrigerators in just three hours.
Yet more troublesome to those pinning their hopes on a speedy recovery in employment is the special plight of service industries. The speculative boom in commercial real estate has left a legacy of boarded-up shopping centers and see-through office buildings. And the resulting glut of office space, David Shulman of Salomon Brothers Inc. predicts, will take 11 years to work through.
Other service industries are not in quite so dire straits. But the prospects for jobs in banking, advertising, insurance and publishing are considered poor because all of these businesses now see consolidation and cost-cutting as their best hope of survival in a more competitive economy.
Robert Hall, an economist at the Hoover Institution in California, offers the perspective that no recession takes place in a vacuum. Every business cycle, he notes, is layered on top of economic trends that can affect private spending and employment. But the timing of these structural changes, Mr. Reischauer of the Congressional Budget Office argues, could hardly have been worse because the Federal Government is in a poor position to take up the slack.
Under the deficit reduction agreement negotiated last year, spending can be raised beyond an arbitrary "baseline" only if savings are found somewhere else in the budget. This budget lock can be broken only if Congress and the President declare an "economic emergency." And thus far President Bush has been unwilling, even vetoing a Democratic initiative to extend jobless benefits for the hundreds of thousands of workers who have run through their 26 weeks of eligibility.
As a consequence, the fiscal response to the recession has been tepid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the net stimulation from changes in the budget at about one-half of a percent of the G.N.P. -- just one-third the response to the recessions of 1982 and 1974. And Mr. Bush's likely strategy for stimulating private purchasing power without undoing the budget accord is not likely to win friends among Congressional Democrats.
 
Capital Gains Cuts
 A key part of the fiscal package expected from the White House next week is a cut in tax rate on capital gains. Unlike other tax cuts, this one would actually generate revenue in the first year as property owners rushed to realize capital gains from the past. And that, concedes George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution and no fan of Mr. Bush's economic policies, would make room in the budget for the increased domestic spending and family tax credits favored by Democrats.
The catch, Mr. Perry notes, is that most Congressional experts believe the capital gains cuts would generate revenue losses in the future, leaving Washington to cope with bigger budget deficits after the 1992 election. Moreover, many Democrats are loath to make the rich even richer at a time when middle-class living standards are falling.
The Federal Reserve could act if Congress and the White House do not, enticing new spending by lowering interest rates. But the Fed has already gone a long way down the path of easy money and is reluctant to signal the slightest tolerance for inflation as the price of recovery. In any case, the lag in response to monetary stimulation is long: its full impact might not be felt for a year, after demand had already recovered.
"We chose not to make the structural adjustments necessitated by the excesses of the 1980's when the economy was strong," Mr. Reischauer concludes. Now, he suggests, we are fated to adjust when adjustment is most painful.

HEADLINE: Europe's Shifts on Trade May Help World Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The agreement last week to create a 19-country common market in Europe, combined with a recent shift in Germany's position on agriculture subsidies, means that a broad international agreement lowering trade barriers worldwide may well be reached by February, senior European and American officials say.
The sticking point in the five-year-old world talks on freeing trade has been agriculture, with the United States and other countries with internationally competitive farm economies refusing to strike a deal unless the 12-member European Community substantially reduces its agricultural export subsidies, import quotas and direct farm subsidies. 
 International trade in grain and other commodities has stagnated as many countries have subsidized overproduction to prevent their farmers from losing jobs as advances in production techniques have made small farms uncompetitive.
Two major developments have improved the odds of a successful conclusion to the talks, conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said a senior United States trade official who insisted on anonymity and European officials who insisted that they not be identified.
First, on Oct. 9, the German Cabinet changed its position concerning the European Community's agricultural policy. The Cabinet decided that instead of relying on consumers to subsidize full production through prices inflated by import restrictions and other measures, production should be reduced and farmers' incomes should be maintained through payments ultimately coming from taxpayers.
European farmers have opposed such a move, which would make their subsidies vulnerable to cuts during fiscal crises, and both France and Ireland criticized the German move. But American and European officials said that Bonn's decision to break ranks with Paris significantly increased the chances that the European Community would reach a compromise with food-exporting countries.
Then last week, the European Community in western and southern Europe and the seven-member European Free Trade Association in central Europe and Scandinavia struck a last-minute accord. Negotiations leading up to the accord had absorbed the attention of senior European Community officials, who now ought to be able to pay more attention to the GATT talks.
But last Tuesday's agreement between the European trade group and the community could also create new complications for the GATT negotiations, European officials said.
While the agreement creating the new trading bloc specifically excludes agriculture, the trade association sought the deal in large part to influence European Community decision-making on economic policies and technical standards and may seek at least to be consulted in the already bitter debate over agriculture.
On the other hand, European officials said, the participation of strong free-trade advocates in Scandinavia could tilt the balance in the European Community. Its northwestern members tend to favor free trade; its Mediterranean members tend to be more protectionist. The addition in recent years of Greece, Portugal and Spain had begun to weight the community toward more restrictions on trade.
Considerable pressure has been mounting on the Bush Administration in recent months to put more emphasis on environmental issues during trade negotiations. But several environmentalists and trade experts told the Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade on Friday that they accepted that the current round of GATT negotiations was too close to completion for the environment to be included.

HEADLINE: Mexican Trade Pact Advances

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZACATECAS, Mexico, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Four months into their discussions on a North American Free Trade Agreement, negotiators from the United States, Mexico and Canada said today that they were ready to begin drafting treaty language.
But even as they swapped smiles and handshakes, they declined to specify areas in which they had moved closer to agreement, and a senior American trade official who privately discussed the talks acknowledged that in some areas, they had run into roadblocks. 
 "We're not at the point where a lot of these issues are ready to be decided," the official said.
 
Skepticism by U.S.
 Contrary to the predictions of several Mexican officials that a treaty could be ready early next year, several American negotiators suggested that progress would be slower. The senior American official said he did not expect a complete first draft to be ready when trade ministers from the three countries are to meet again early next year.
Even before the talks began, some American officials said they were losing hope of being able to deliver an accord to Congress without handing Democrats a political issue at election time.
Under the "fast track" procedures approved in May, legislators will vote either for or against whatever agreement is negotiated but cannot amend it. But from the time a treaty is ready, enabling legislation could still take as long as eight or nine months -- which could force the Bush Administration to weigh political considerations against economic ones.
 
Denial by Hills
 In a telephone interview this afternoon, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, denied that campaign politics would influence the timing of a trade accord.
"I don't see our elections in November as a problem or an impediment at all," she said. "It's not a Republican issue; it's an issue of vision."
Other United States officials say the growing demands of groups concerned about the effects of free trade on American jobs, the environment and the future of Mexican democracy are another complicating factor.
For Mexican officials, there is extraordinary sensitivity about cutting deals with a neighbor that their history has portrayed as an untrustworthy bully. Canadian officials, meanwhile, have had to grapple with fears that Mexico's inclusion in a continental free-trade zone could jeopardize some benefits of the trade pact they made with the United States two years ago.
As the Mexican negotiations have moved forward, the three teams have made notable progress only on the subject of tariffs. The three sides exchanged proposals for reciprocal tariff cuts on Sept. 19.
Mexico's heavily protected energy sector, which appeared not long ago to represent a major stumbling block, has fallen on the list of concerns. With Mexican officials adamantly opposed to opening the exploration and production of their oil to outside risk capital, American negotiators said last week that they were not inclined to press the issue.
 
Loosening on Petrochemicals
 In an area where United States officials had hoped for concessions, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari indicated this week that Mexico was likely to remove more petrochemicals from the list of those barred from development by foreigners.
Agriculture, another politically sensitive issue in Mexico, will not be settled so easily, Mexican and American officials said.
The United States' push for access to Mexican grain markets comes as Mexico is about to announce what officials here say will be a radical but lengthy transformation of the inefficient, almost feudal land-tenure system. The Government is expected to soften laws that bar peasants from selling or leasing communal lands and from bringing in business partners to help them develop.
But while Mexican farmers would like freer access to American markets, they would also like continued protection.
Similarly, the framework of a new North American textile trade may be determined by both the worldwide General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and changes that some American manufacturers are seeking in the Multifiber Arrangement covering world textile trade.
Mexico's single biggest bargaining chip may be its automotive market. Car sales are expected to boom with the country's economy. With about one-third the population of the United States, Mexicans now buy less than one-tenth the cars.
Mexican negotiators want the United States to do away with its 25 percent tax on imported light trucks and to change fuel-efficiency rules so that compact cars produced here can count as part of an American company's domestic fleet.
The odd wrinkle is that while American negotiators want to clear Mexican restrictions on car imports, Detroit's Big Three want continued protection in Mexico. Along with Nissan and Volkswagen, Ford Motor, Chrysler and General Motors -- which have produced cars in Mexico for years -- would like to keep other manufacturers out while they adapt to the demands of free trade.
The issue of how much North American content a product must have to pass beneath the tariff barriers of a new free-trade zone also pits the United States against Canada. The Canadians, who cut their high auto duties in 1965 in return for assurances that American car makers would remain in Canada, want content rules set no higher than 50 percent in order to attract and keep Japanese manufacturers. Mexican officials, who have similar hopes, say they would support those levels.
 
Contentious Issues
 Several negotiators said the broadest issues have been the most contentious. Mexican representatives, for instance, have demanded the same recourse of appeals now given to Canadians who are hit with American antidumping sanctions.
"What we want is that Mexican exports have access to Canadian and American markets with certainty," the country's chief negotiator, Jaime Serra Puche, the Commerce and Industrial Development Minister, said in an interview late last week.
A senior Mexican official added, "There is no way we can accept anything less."
American negotiators have pushed hard for a Mexican commitment to national treatment -- the principle that American companies working in Mexico be treated by the Government like any native company. But for some Mexicans, this idea goes well beyond the definition of free trade.
Yet, as negotiators move from such principled discussions to draft-treaty language on specific topics, one American trade official predicted that all sides would show greater flexibility. "There is not a lot of flexibility so far," he said. "You can't compromise on principles. You can compromise in text."

HEADLINE: Brady Sees Sign of Growth

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the nation's economy was not recovering "as strongly as it should," but that economic data to be released this week would indicate that the recession was technically over.
In a television interview on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Mr. Brady acknowledged that the White House viewed President Bush's recent decline in public opinion polls as a serious problem. 
 Mr. Brady said he expected, however, that soon-to-be-released figures on the nation's gross national product would show that the United States economy grew at least 2.5 percent in the third quarter.
A Newsweek poll released on Saturday found that Mr. Bush's overall approval rating had slipped to 55 percent, with nearly one in three Americans saying he deserved most of, or a lot of, the blame for economic problems in America.

HEADLINE: Gains but No Profits at Eagle Snacks

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Staring at two six-foot racks of salty snacks that flank the entrance of an A.& P. in Manhattan, Malcolm Horton pointed to a red, white and blue bag of Eagle potato chips.
"It's really a super-looking design," said the 22-year-old shopper, dismissing the cascade of Frito-Lay chips on the other rack just four feet away. "At 99 cents, how can you go wrong?" 
 But at such a low price, the question in the world of snack foods is, how can Eagle go right?
Eagle Snacks Inc. is a rising force in the $10 billion snack food industry. Owned by the Anheuser-Busch Companies, which knows a thing or two about mass marketing, Eagle emerged from practically nowhere three years ago and zipped by the Keebler Company to become the nation's No. 3 purveyor of salty chips, nuts and pretzels.
In doing so, it woke up the giant of the industry, Frito-Lay Inc., which is now trying to knock Eagle out of the business. By cutting its costs to keep retail prices low, Frito-Lay hopes it can prevent Eagle, which is losing $10 million to $20 million a year, from ever making a profit.
Eagle, which sells its products under the Eagle and Cape Cod brands, now says it is prepared to overtake Borden Inc., a distant No. 2 from Frito-Lay in the industry. Borden, the New York based maker of Wise potato chips and other snacks, says it, too, is mustering a counterattack.
If Eagle continues losing money long enough, its competitors hope that Anheuser-Busch will eventually be forced to call it quits.
"Eagle has shown that it has a good product, good marketing and good packaging," said George E. Thompson, a food-industry analyst at Prudential Securities. "But it hasn't shown it can make a profit. What you ultimately end up with is that Frito-Lay is going to determine in large part when and how much money Eagle makes in the business."
This year, Eagle expects to lose more than $12 million on sales of $400 million to $500 million, after losing more than $15 million last year and the year before.
 
Future Profits Seen
 But the company's top executives, led by Kevin Bowler, the president, predict that over the next few years Eagle will churn out large profits for Anheuser-Busch, which is eagerly searching to diversify from the slow-growing beer business.
Since Eagle first started selling its products nationally in 1988, the company has waged a savvy and successful marketing campaign. It has expanded its sales by an average of about 25 percent annually and captured nearly 6 percent of the market for salty snacks. The campaign relied on sprightly packaging, television commercials featuring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman in their "Odd Couple" roles, and low prices.
Since 1988, Eagle's share of potato-chip sales in supermarkets grew to 9.4 percent, from 5.5 percent, while Borden's fell to 12.7 percent, from 15.2 percent, according to Information Resources Inc., a leading market research firm in Chicago. Keebler had about 7.7 percent and Frito-Lay's share stood at 31.3 percent.
But Frito-Lay is striking back.
Last month, Frito-Lay, a Pepsico Inc. subsidiary based in the Dallas suburb of Plano, announced a restructuring to cut Frito's costs by $100 million, including a work force cut of 7 percent, or 1,800 people. The move was intended to keep the company lean to be able to compete with low prices and take advantage of economies of scale unavailable to its smaller competitors like Eagle.
 
Profit Margins Trimmed
 Earlier this year, Frito-Lay lowered prices on two of its most heavily advertised products, Fritos and Dorritos corn chips, and other products by more than 15 percent and reduced its profit margins to 17 percent from 21 percent.
Roger Enrico, Frito-Lay's chairman, said the company's goal was to increase its market share by 1 percent annually and to continue its double-digit earnings growth through increased sales rather than higher prices.
To meet that goal, the company introduced small 25-cent packages of all its snack foods this year and has begun selling a stream of new products including Sunchips, a low-salt multigrain chip, and Suprimos, a low-oil wheat-based chip. Several other new products are now in test markets around the country.
In addition, Frito-Lay says it is drawing up plans to double the number of outlets that receive Frito-Lay products to 800,000 and to begin a new media and marketing campaign next year to freshen the images of its major products.
The head of Borden's snack division, George Wado, acknowledges that his company erred seriously in its competition with Eagle earlier this year when it cut back on its marketing campaigns on salty snacks, and as a consequence lost a half-point of market share in the first quarter.
 
14 Borden Acquisitions
 In addition, the company has suffered from some high costs and redundancies resulting from its acquisition of 14 snack food companies in recent years.
But Mr. Wado said the company had been moving aggressively to increase its market share and reduce costs by closing redundant plants, creating more-efficient delivery routes and laying off 400 of its 7,400 employees
Borden has more than 38 brands, including major regional ones like Wise on the East Coast, Jays in Chicago and Laura Scudders in California. It has cut prices on many of its products, like Crunchers, which previously sold for $1.69 and now appears on supermarket shelves as low as $1.19 a bag.
By organizing its companies into three regional groups and finding new ways to cut costs, like switching from peanut oil to corn oil, the company says it can match Frito's 17 percent profit margins. Borden's margins on salty snacks, Mr. Wado said, are now near 10 percent.
In any case, he added, Borden will do whatever is necessary to stay ahead of Eagle.
"We can't allow them to achieve their goal at our expense," Mr. Wado said. "We are doing everything we can to prevent it."
Keebler Mum on Strategy
A spokesman for Keebler, Stuart Greenblatt, said his company would not discuss its marketing strategy. He did say Keebler hoped to gain market share with some new products, like its Pizzeria snack chips. Keebler, based in Elmhurst, Ill., is a subsidiary of United Biscuits (Holdings) P.L.C. of Britain.
The central question for many analysts is when will Eagle be able to turn a profit, if it can.
Mr. Bowler, Eagle's president, declined to disclose Eagle's production, transportation and delivery costs. Such costs are crucial questions in an industry where 22 to 30 percent of every sales dollar is spent on getting products to supermarket shelves.
Recently, Eagle pushed back the year it expects to become profitable to 1993, from 1992.
But Eagle executives argue that their company can survive and prosper despite the price pressure from competitors because its costs are already low. Production is centralized at three modern plants. In addition, Mr. Bowler said the company's staff remained lean, with only 60 of 1,500 employees at its corporate headquarters in St. Louis.
"Remember the little engine that could?" Mr. Bowler said. "I will reach my goal of being a successful No. 2 in the snack food industry. We will prevail."
 
Beer Market Slows
 Another question for Eagle is how much patience Anheuser-Busch, the nation's largest brewer, will have with Eagle if it continues to lose money. A combination of factors, including higher excise taxes, a social climate that the beer industry regards as neoprohibitionist and the aging of the population, is holding the United States beer market to annual growth of no more than 1 or 2 percent.
But Busch experienced disappointment with other ventures in the 1980's, including a failed cruise line and an abortive attempt to market natural sodas. A $1.1 billion acquisition of theme parks came with surprisingly poor profits and a host of unexpected headaches, like a $6 million settlement to buy back the rights for Sea World's Shamu the killer whale.
As a result, several analysts suggest, Busch, a company with annual earnings of more than $800 million, may want to stand behind Eagle, even as it loses money for years.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tool Orders Up by 3.4%

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools showed a modest rise of 3.4 percent in September, the fourth straight month of increases, the Association for Manufacturing Technology says in a report to be released today.
The gains in September, however, were well below the 22 percent surge of orders in August, the trade group said. September orders rose to $243.65 million, from $235.75 million in August. 
 And orders last month were off by 7.8 percent from a year earlier, when they totaled $264.35 million.
Machine tools are used to manufacture a broad range of goods, from cookware to jet aircraft. The industry is closely watched by economists as a guide to the general health of manufacturing.
Actual shipments of machine tools rose 16.4 percent in September to $213.50 million, from $183.35 million in August. They declined 28.6 percent from $298.90 million a year earlier.
Export orders surged 20.4 percent, to $37.80 million, from $31.40 million in August. Compared with September 1990, export orders were up 36.5 percent.
"I am encouraged by the developments over the past four months," the association's president, Albert W. Moore, said. "Orders are up, cancellations down, and backlog levels seem to be firming."
The group said the September backlog of orders was $1.39 billion, up from $1.36 billion in August.
Huge gains for metal-cutting tools last month were offset by fewer orders for metal-forming machines. Orders for metal-cutting tools shot up 36.8 percent, to $172.90 million, from $126.40 million in August.
Metal-forming tool orders skidded 35.3 percent, to $70.75 million, from $109.35 million in August.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Plans Munich Trip, Expenses Paid

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, whose international travel plans have stirred controversy in recent months, said yesterday that he has accepted an expenses-paid invitation to attend a tennis tournament in Munich, Germany, in December.
The Mayor, an unabashed tennis fan, added that he hoped to use the trip for other purposes, including exploring economic opportunities for New York City in Central Europe and visiting a memorial to Germans who defied the Nazis. 
 But Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, whom Mr. Dinkins invited to attend the event as his guest, said last night she would decline, in part to avoid a possible appearance of a conflict of interest.
 
No Conflict Seen
 Both the Mayor and Ms. Shulman have been negotiating with the United States Tennis Association over its request to expand the site of the United States Open tournament in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The association is a member of the International Tennis Federation, which sanctions the Munich tournament.
The invitation was extended by a promoter of the Munich tournament, the Compaq Grand Slam Cup, said a spokeswoman for the Mayor, Jennifer Kimball. The invitation includes airfare and hotel accommodations for the Mayor, a guest and two aides, but the tennis portion of the trip is purely for pleasure, Ms. Kimball said, and is not connected to the association negotiations.
"We don't believe there is any conflict of interest in accepting an invitation from a private entity that does no business with the city," Ms. Kimball said. "Many mayors in the past, in this city and others, have accepted trips from private entities to promote their cities."
Ms. Kimball said there were numerous precedents for the Mayor to accept a trip from a private group, including Mr. Dinkins's trip earlier this year to Israel, which was financed by the American-Israel Friendship League.
But Ms. Shulman, who said she was too busy to attend the tournament, expressed reservations about the appearance of a conflict. "I just feel very uncomfortable about it," she said in an interview, "and I say that not knowing any of the facts."
Ms. Shulman said she had yet to inform the Mayor of her decision. Later last night, Ms. Kimball said that "it's our understanding after speaking with the Borough President's office that there is a conflict of schedule, not of interest."
The trip, tentatively scheduled from Dec. 10 to 15, would follow the Mayor's planned journey next month to South Africa, where, he said, he hopes to forge an economic partnership with those who he believes will lead post-apartheid South Africa.
Critics of the South Africa trip have questioned its purpose, as well as the size of the delegation, which originally was to include several dozen people. But the Mayor, who has often described the visit of Nelson Mandela to New York City as a high point of his term, has angrily defended the journey, saying it would bring the city both economic benefits and influence in post-apartheid South Africa.
 
Plans Visit to Memorial
 The Mayor first mentioned the Munich trip in a passing reference during an address yesterday morning to more than 1,000 Jewish civil servants gathered at the New York Hilton.
"In December, I expect to go to Munich, if plans go as I expect," Mr. Dinkins told the civil servants at the annual breakfast of the Council of Jewish Organizations in Civil Service in the hotel's Grand Ballroom.
Mr. Dinkins then told the group that while he is in Munich, he intends to visit a memorial commemorating the White Rose, a small group of German students who were beheaded in 1943 after denouncing the Nazis. Mr. Dinkins said he had first visited the site in 1985, when he accompanied members of the American Jewish Congress to protest President Ronald Reagan's controversial visit to the Bitburg military cemetery.
Though the Mayor made no other mention of the Munich trip in the speech, he and Ms. Kimball later sketched out the details in response to reporters' questions.
 
Still in Planning Stages
 Mr. Dinkins said that by itself, the tennis tournament did not warrant a trip to Germany. "I would not go to Munich only for that purpose," the Mayor told reporters. "I've directed my staff to look at other things we might do."
Ms. Kimball, the Mayor's spokeswoman, said the trip was in the "very preliminary planning stages," and that Mr. Dinkins and his aides have focused on two major concerns. She said the first is the pursuit of economic opportunities in Germany, a topic that Mr. Dinkins hopes to broach with the mayors of Munich and Berlin, among others.
Any side trips from Munich, like one being planned to Berlin, would be paid for by the New York City Alliance for International Business, a private nonprofit organization that is not affiliated with city government, Ms. Kimball said.
Ms. Kimball said the Mayor was uncertain which of his aides would join him, but he would be accompanied by an undisclosed number of police bodyguards, which will be paid for, as is customary, by the city.
The second part of the trip, which Ms. Kimball described as far more solemn, might involve outings to the White Rose memorial and the Dachau concentration camp, as well as meetings with German Jews.
The Mayor recently received an invitation to the tournament from Dr. Axel Meyer-Wolden, a prominent German businessman whose company is promoting the tournament. He formally accepted the invitation on Friday, Ms. Kimball said.
A spokesman for the tennis association, Edwin S. Fabricius, said in a telephone interview yesterday that he was unaware of any association role in the invitation to Munich.
The Mayor announced plans in February for a $150 million expansion of the National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the site of the United States Open since 1978. Though the cost of the expansion will be paid for by the tennis association, it still has no business agreement to extend its lease on the property with the city, which is its landlord.
The association plans to begin construction in 1992, and open the new center, which will have three new stadiums, in 1995. The Mayor said yesterday that the two sides were "pretty close to agreement."

HEADLINE: Zaire's Chief Vows to Stay in Power and Warns West Not to Meddle

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Oct. 27

 BODY:
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire vowed today to stay in power despite growing opposition to his rule. He accused Western governments of wanting "my head at any price" and declared, "They cannot dictate how I run Zaire."
In an interview with foreign reporters at his home near Kinshasa, the capital, the President said there would be no compromise with the main opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, whom he dismissed as Prime Minister last Monday. 
 Mr. Tshisekedi was appointed under intense pressure from Western governments after rampant street violence spread across Zaire late last month. The rioting and looting were led by disgruntled soldiers who had not being paid in several months.
 
'Flagrant Interference'
 In the interview, granted to reporters from Reuters and two French newspapers, Mr. Mobutu repeatedly accused Western governments of "flagrant interference" in Zaire's internal affairs. He said the West had acted inconsistently by criticizing Zaire while maintaining military and financial aid to African countries that have not even considered democratic change.
A virtual cutoff of American, French and Belgian assistance in recent months has eroded morale in this central African country of nearly 40 million people.
The remarks today by President Mobutu were the most extensive he has made since the violence erupted last month. He has recently kept a relatively low profile, and Western analysts said that he appeared to have finally acceded to a power-sharing arrangement with opposition groups after 26 years of near-absolute rule.
But Western and African diplomats said today that Mr. Mobutu has reneged on his promise to relinquish some of his powers and allow Zaire to join the shift toward democratic government sweeping much of Africa.
"He intends to hang on as long as he can," a senior Western diplomat here said, "and he really doesn't seem to care one bit whether the country slides into chaos."
Mr. Mobutu spoke amid signs of renewed violence in the capital. The state-run radio and television broadcasting center in Kinshasa was seized Saturday night by soldiers loyal to the President after announcers read a series of letters criticizing Mr. Mobutu and his choice of Bernardin Mungul-Diaka, the leader of a minor opposition group, as the new Prime Minister.
 
Attack on Opposition Paper
 Today a big explosion destroyed the offices of the leading opposition newspaper, Elima. Crowds outside the building accused the military of sabotage, though no witnesses came forward.
Mr. Mungul-Diaka vigorously defended his decision to accept President Mobutu's offer to replace Mr. Tshisekedi. The Sacred Union, an opposition coalition of more than 150 groups, has branded Mr. Mungul a "traitor" and vowed to boycott any government he forms.
At a news conference, Mr. Mungul-Diaka insisted that he was among President Mobutu's oldest opponents, saying, "I have opposed his regime for 22 years, since August 1969."
Asked whether he wanted Mr. Mobutu to resign, he replied: "The whole opposition has been fighting for that. So I say yes." But he added that "radical change" would have to come peacefully, through elections.
Mr. Mungul-Diaka also criticized the way in which Western countries have severed economic aid and political ties with Zaire in recent days.
"Everyone must take their fair share of blame. During 26 years your respective governments supported his regime," he told a group of reporters, mostly representing foreign newspapers and agencies. "Now that the Zairean people are fighting to obtain democracy, the West leaves.
"People could at least eat and drink under the dictatorship," Mr. Mungul-Diaka added. "But now they are beggars. The West should help us during this crisis, or the people will think you are more for dictatorship than for democracy."
It is unclear whether any political accord could end the unrest at this point, for groups of marauding soldiers seem to be beyond the control of even Mr. Mobutu. Another sector that is not automatically responsive to political pressure is the huge and mostly poor urban population, which could wreak further violence if no cure is found for the swiftly deteriorating economy.
Several Western governments urged their citizens again today to leave Zaire as soon as possible. They advised foreigners to depart on one of the Belgian flights or military-escorted convoys leaving over the next three days from provincial centers in Zaire.
Officials at the United States Embassy said that about 125 Americans were still in Kinshasa, and that another 300 are living elsewhere in the country.
The French Minister for Cooperation, Edwige Avice, urged the estimated 500 French citizens in Zaire to "use every means at their disposal" to flee the country.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Says Reports of Crime Rose This Year

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The number of crimes reported to the police rose 2 percent in the first half of 1991, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today, and some criminal justice experts say a weak economy may be a factor.
Violent crime reported to law-enforcement agencies increased 5 percent over the same period last year, while property crime edged up 1 percent, the bureau said. 
 About 16,000 law enforcement agencies across the country supply information for the F.B.I.'s crime index. The agency did not provide a state-by-state breakdown.
The agency's report comes after a household survey made public a week ago showed that crime over all for 1990 declined 3.9 percent. That survey issued by the Justice Department is considered a more accurate reflection of crime trends because it measures crime generally, not just crime reported to the police.
Less than 40 percent of major crimes are reported to the police, the Justice Department estimates.
According to the F.B.I. index, there was a 3 percent decline in the Northeast in the amount of reported crime in the first six months of 1991. But there were increases elsewhere.
The increases have some connection to unemployment and drug addiction among poor youths in the most crime-prone age group, ages 15 to 24, said Gene Stephens, a professor in college of criminal justice at the University of South Carolina.
The youths' situation is worse with the economy in the doldrums, he said.
The bureau not break down crime statistics by age.
There were indications in the Justice Department's household survey that crime might be rising, said Alfred Blumstein, dean of the school of urban and public affairs at Carnegie Mellon University.
For example, robberies in 1990 were up sharply, by 5.3 percent.
A recession can tend to drive crime rates down in some categories, Mr. Blumstein said. Many people are home more, which can lead to less household crime like burglary. Attempted forcible household entries, larcenies and car thefts were down sharply last year.
The F.B.I. said that in the first six months of this year robberies reported to the police were up 9 percent, murders were up 5 percent, forcible rape 4 percent and aggravated assault 2 percent. In property crimes, there was a 1 percent increase each in burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle thefts.
The nation's biggest cities showed a 2 percent decline in reported crime. The biggest increase was in cities of less than 10,000 population, where there was a 5 percent rise.

HEADLINE: THE MIDDLE EAST TALKS;
Golan Heights' Return Called Syria's Chief Aim

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Syrian Government of President Hafez al-Assad is going to the Madrid conference on Wednesday with the hope that it can, above all else, persuade Israel to return the Golan Heights, Western diplomats say.
But Syrian officials have repeatedly said that they will not strike separate deals with Israel. They say that any exchange of land for peace must be part of a package that would include all of the occupied territories and be approved by all neighboring Arab countries and the Palestinians. 
 The Syrians have adopted the toughest stance of any of Israel's Arab neighbors, vowing not to attend the proposed third stage of the negotiations, in which Arab countries will discuss regional issues like water rights with Israeli officials, until Israel makes "progress" in returning occupied territory.
"It all depends, to a great extent, on the intentions of the Israeli Government," President Assad said in a Cable News Network interview. "Do they want peace or do they want the situation to remain as it is now?"
 
Israelis Harsh About Syria
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has said that peace treaties must be signed and the Arab economic embargo of Israel lifted before he will be willing to discuss further issues with his Arab neighbors. He has ruled out trading land for peace.
Israeli officials have reserved their harshest criticism for Syria, blaming it for continued guerrilla attacks against Israeli troops in southern Lebanon and for giving sanctury to radical Palestinian groups and questioning its commitment to the peace process.
Shlomo Ben Ami, Israel's Ambassador to Spain and a member of the Israeli delegation, complained recently that the Syrian President "has not even used the word peace."
The meeting between Syrian and Israeli officials in Madrid, a meeting in which the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, has already said he will not shake the hand of his Israeli counterpart, will nevertheless mark a watershed for one of Israel's most implacable foes.
Syria, which under Soviet sponsorship once sought to achieve "strategic parity" with Israel, has been moving closer to the West, although relations remain cool because of Syria's support for Palestinian groups the United States believes are engaged in terrorism.
 
New Channels to U.S.
 But Syria's decision to send troops to join the allied coalition in the Persian Gulf and its help in bringing about the release of Western hostages has opened real channels of communication between the Assad Government and the United States for the first time in many years.
Syrian officials express support for the Bush Administration's move to defer a decision on Israel's request for $10 billion worth of housing loan guarantees.
"For the first time the Syrians believe that someone in Washington is willing to listen to them," a Western diplomat said. "They hope that an end to the cold war will diminish Israel's importance as a regional ally and that the U.S. can pressure Israel to give the Arabs the territory they want."
The Syrian Foreign Minister, noting that the United States will be the "moving force" in the coming conference, said, "We are confident we will arrive at the desired results."
The decision by the Syrians to sit down with the Israelis, something they vowed in the past never to do, has required verbal acrobatics on the part of the governing Baath Party.
 
Return of Land Demanded
 "Syria now goes to the conference in Madrid not because it has changed its position," a Baath Party statement said, "but because changes in the positions of other Arab countries showed they were nearing the Syrian position, which reflects the interests of the Arab nations."
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all agreed not to make separate deals with Israel.
With the Palestine Liberation Organization, the three Arab countries have demanded a return of all occupied land, including East Jerusalem, a freeze on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and the restoration of Palestinian rights before normalization of relations with Israel.
But in a meeting last week in Damascus, the Jordanians, Palestinians and Lebanese refused a Syrian motion that would preclude the Arabs from entering into the third stage of negotiations -- the multilateral talks on a wide range of issues like water rights and arms control -- until the Israelis make "progress" in handing over occupied territory.
Western diplomats still worry that if the Syrians boycott the third stage it will be harder, if not impossible, to induce other Arab countries to sit down with the Israelis.
The Syrians appear to want to act in concert with their Arab neighbors and the Palestinians, or at least to give the appearance of acting in concert, before stepping forward to take back the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and annexed in 1981. And they want to make Israel pay in advance of any deal. What the Syrians fear most, Western diplomats say, is that they will sit down with the Israelis, breaking their pledge, and come up empty-handed.
Syrian policy, in the end, will rise and fall on the whims of one man, President Assad, diplomats contend. And few are ready to predict exactly how far he will be willing to go.
"I think that at this point even the Syrians do not know what they are going to do," a Western diplomat said. "They will see what happens, what Israel is willing to offer and send back their reports to the President. Then they will wait for him to decide."

HEADLINE: Uncertainty on Gorbachev Gives New Twist to Meeting With Bush

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
For the first time in the long history of East-West summit-level diplomacy, the American President will go to meet the Soviet President in Madrid on Tuesday uncertain whether the man across the table has real power to represent his country or is little more than a figurehead.
The talks between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are not even planned as a full-scale summit conference, a far cry from past meetings that rewrote Europe's map, forged arms control agreements, provided the setting for cold war confrontation or ushered in warmer phases in Soviet-American relations. 
 Demonstrating how this peculiar diplomatic art has moved so far from center stage in world affairs that it is in danger of becoming an anachronism, the two leaders will confine themselves to a two-hour lunch session on the day before they attend the opening of the Middle East peace conference. "They're both going to be in town, and they're having a long lunch together," a senior Administration official said.
In a way, this is what Mr. Bush has sought to achieve since he took office and began trying to make his meetings with Mr. Gorbachev more routine and less fraught with expectations. The far-reaching progress in solving the major Soviet-American disputes has clearly reduced the urgency of summit meetings and made it possible to have such a quick get-together with no formal agenda.
But more significant, the aborted Kremlin coup in August and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have so eroded Mr. Gorbachev's power that American officials are uncertain about what kinds of deals they can negotiate with him and wondering whether the days of formal summits may indeed be over.
"What's a thing of the past," the senior official said, "is the focus on two human beings sitting down and talking their way through a list of issues."
It is still possible that the two leaders might come up with some surprise, as they have in past meetings. But the Madrid meeting seemed likely to be less a meeting of equals than a recognition of Mr. Gorbachev's accomplishments, an observation of diplomatic protocol and a courtesy to a man who American officials believe sees his relationship with Mr. Bush as one of the last threads of his power, and who seems to enjoy his appearances at summit meetings.
Clearly Mr. Gorbachev has more at stake than Mr. Bush in the meeting, and it is not clear whether the Soviet President settled willingly for such a brief encounter on a day in which Mr. Bush will also meet with the Spanish King and Prime Minister, as well as a string of other dignitaries who will be attending the peace conference.
 
Food Loans Unlikely
 Administration officials said they did not expect Mr. Bush to give Mr. Gorbachev the emergency food loans that they had hoped at one point to take to Madrid. Washington has yet to work out the details of those credits, they said, in part because of uncertainty among American officials about what political entity in the Soviet Union could accept a loan intended for more than one republic and then be counted on to repay it.
Administration officials said they were even more uncertain about how to proceed after the President of the Russian federated republic, Boris N. Yeltsin, telephoned Mr. Bush on Friday to tell him of his plans to announce major economic reforms in a speech on Monday.
No real progress in arms control is expected to be made -- or even attempted -- at the Madrid meeting, officials said. With Mr. Gorbachev's command of the Soviet armed forces an increasingly tenuous thing, the Administration has already shifted arms control from the traditional domain of summit meetings to a largely unilateral process in which each side is proposing to cut its nuclear stockpiles and challenging the other to go further.
Indeed, officials said the concerns of the United States had suddenly shifted from persuading the Soviet Union to cut its weapons stockpiles to discouraging independence-minded republics, like the Ukraine, from trying to build armies of their own -- a prospect that Washington has indirectly suggested would make it harder for those republics to receive Western assistance.
Although the ostensible purpose of the summit meeting is to put the Soviet-American stamp of approval on the peace conference, the Soviet Union's role in that event is peripheral as well.
A senior official said a fundamental shift in the currents of Soviet- American summitry was evident when Mr. Bush went to the Soviet Union for a more formal meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in July. "Even there, it was becoming more of a meeting with the leadership, rather than a leader," he said.
But since the aborted coup in August, officials said, uncertainty about Mr. Gorbachev's powers as a negotiating partner has increased sharply. That has left the Administration in what an official called "an end-game situation" in which Washington is approaching the point at which it must decide whether to deal with the central Government or the republics.
"The talk for the past two months is how they are going to create a center, but everything that we've been seeing is moving away from the center," an official said.
Max Kampelman, a career diplomat and longtime arms control negotiator, argued that the change in the tone of summit meetings is a healthy product of the improvement in Soviet-American relations. There is no need, for instance, for Bush and Mr. Gorbachev merely to get together as a way of reducing tensions.
 
Frequent Telephone Contact
 "You've got two people who have met each other on many occasions, know each other well, don't have any ground to break and talk on the telephone in between meetings," Mr. Kampelman said.
But he and others said Mr. Gorbachev's crumbling power was also an important factor. Alexander M. Haig, the former Secretary of State, said, "Mr. Gorbachev is yesterday's leader, to whom we owe a great debt because he didn't resort to force to prevent the breakup of the empire, but as far as the future is concerned, is history."
One area where this is strongly felt, officials said, is in economic relations. Mr. Bush is committed to providing the Soviet Union with short-term humanitarian food and medical assistance and is trying to work out the details of more long-term aid. But officials said that there had to be some guarantee of repayment and that it was not clear that Mr. Gorbachev could provide that authority.
"The fact that the Ukraine just unilaterally declared it will no longer be responsible for any debt incurred by an entity called the Soviet Union means that we've got to pause and think about further lending," said Jan Vanous, research director of Planecon, a Washington concern that has been helping the Soviet Union plan reforms of its central economy.
Administration officials said they were studying the newly created economic union, covering eight republics, as a possible recipient of loans. But they said it was not clear whether that entity was a reliable debtor.
The Ukraine's talk of having its own army and controlling nuclear weapons on its territory complicates matters, since the United States does not want to subsidize such an effort.
This sort of uncertainty, officials said, is one reason why Mr. Bush clings to the relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. "Bush likes Gorbachev and recognizes him as the Soviet head of state, and there is real concern here about the consequences of the collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union," an official said.
He added: "For Gorbachev it's almost a summit of desperation. He's clearly hanging on by his fingernails and trying to stay a domestic political player by sustaining the Soviet Union's great-power role abroad."

Cuomo Struggles Toward Answers To Big Question

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action. -- "Hamlet," Act III, Scene 1
To run or not to run away -- that is the question. 
 Can Gov. Mario M. Cuomo justify, to his constiuents and to himself, leaving New York to run for President? Can he afford not to, when he argues convincingly that fundamental solutions to state and local crises rest with Washington, not Albany? Can he get his message to the nation -- a case he is espousing with growing passion and self-confidence -- without being the messenger?
Any conventional politician would respond reflexively: Yes, no and no.
But Mario Agonistes, on the verge of delivering his answer, has defied convention before. He is grappling with philosophical questions that would have confounded even Hamlet, whose ambivalence was finally resolved when mere spectral evidence was confirmed by personal observation during the play within a play.
For Mr. Cuomo, the campaign's the thing. He will not run, even in this abbreviated campaign, though, until he reconciles his commitment to the state with his mission for the nation as every other elected Governor of New York has done for decades.
Like another Governor, Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, was, Mr. Cuomo is thoughtful and thinks aloud. Two events nudged him to ratchet up his Presidential pondering in a process taking on a life of its own.
Last month, an article in The New York Times on Mr. Cuomo's visit to California focused on his noncandidacy, rather than on the substance of well-received remarks, the gist of which he had delivered before. Mr. Cuomo said he was angry that reporters semed to have decided that if he was not a national candidate, his message would go largely unreported, regardless of its value. He was also incensed over the shortcomings of senators from both major parties in the confirmation hearings for Judge Clarence Thomas.
Though critics would object, Mr. Cuomo may have already convinced himself that he has done as much as he can as Governor to mitigate New York's economic woes and can make only a marginal difference from Albany. But what of his implicit commitment to his constituents? And if he runs, should he resign as Governor?
In 1986, he insisted that running for Governor again meant he would not and could not run for President, a personal vow that went beyond his oath to "discharge the duties" of office. In 1990, Mr. Cuomo declined to make a similar commitment because, he said, nobody believed him the first time. But he seems genuinely troubled by the prospect of disclosing a grim deficit and budget cuts one day and then abandoning his job the next to campaign out of state. "There's a little bit of an awkward character to these moves," he said last week, although he has finessed more difficult contradictions before.
Mr. Cuomo recalled that the last Governor nominated for President, Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, ran "when Massachusetts was still a miracle." No New York governor has been elected President since Franklin D. Roosevelt was chosen at the 1932 convention after minimal personal campaigning.
As late as Nov. 9, 1931, though, Mr. Roosevelt remarked: "I'm too busy right here as Governor to give any thought to anything else." More than two months later, allowing his name to be entered in the North Dakota primary, Mr. Roosevelt cited his obligations as Governor and cautioned: "Were I now to divert my efforts in any degree by personal efforts in furtherance of my own political future, I would not only be untrue to my own convictions but I would also stamp myself as one unworthy of my party's choice as leader."
If Mr. Roosevelt harbored doubts then, he succumbed to what he described as "the simple duty of any American to serve in public position if called upon." If Mr. Cuomo does, he seems unlikely to quit as Governor under provisions of his personal constitution. Resigning would demonstrate unusual single-mindedness and would free him from daily decision-making for which no alter ego has been delegated.
But quitting would not insulate him from responsibility or blame for problems that are no longer unique to New York or those that are. And, with the possible exception of his modest Lieutenant Governor, Stan Lundine, Mr. Cuomo says: "I don't see anyone out there I would consider turning the state over to."
A decade ago, before declaring for governor, Mr. Cuomo wrote: "When will we learn? If one wants to run, one should simply run; put your head down and go if it's worthwhile." This time, Mr. Cuomo wants to, but won't if he hangs down his head after concluding that his rationale for running is only a rationalization.

HEADLINE: In California, Nature Refuses to Remain Mastered

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 24

 BODY:
In a grim way, it was symbolic that the deadly fire that swept Oakland and Berkeley last Sunday should have started near the Caldecott Tunnel.
The tunnel, opened in 1937, was one of those daring and defiant acts of engineering that Californians have long used to tame a harsh environment that has proved to be as dangerous as it is beautiful. The tunnel punched a nearly mile-long hole through the Berkeley Hills, opening the way to vast suburbanization of the arid and geologically unstable hills east of San Francisco Bay. 
 The newcomers built their California dream, landscaping barren neighborhoods with eucalyptus and Monterey pines, trees never intended to grow in such an arid place, and planted shrubs near their homes -- all fine fuel for fires. They built a natural environment that was not at all natural. It was as beautiful as it was artificial, fragile and dangerous.
"The fire underscores the fact that all of California is a vast artificial environment," said Kevin Starr, a historian at the University of Southern California. "We are constantly being reminded what an artificially engineered construct" the state is, he went on, "and consequently how fragile."
California is like "the skin of an enormous egg, with infinite curve but no thickness so fingers of shock reach up," to quote the poem that Jeremy Larner, a screenwriter and poet, wrote after the 1989 earthquake. This time it reached up and burned down his home on Grand View Drive in Oakland, allowing him to escape with little more than his life and his computer.
It is no small paradox that the land early adventurers pronounced unsuitable for human settlement or much agriculture is now both the most populous state and the leading farm state in the country. This was achieved with a massive rearrangement of the environment that snubbed nature. Huge dams and aqueducts were built to channel water from the Sierra to the cities of Northern and Southern California. Bridges and huge highways knitted together far-flung towns into metropolises. And houses were propped up against canyon walls.
There have been ample signs that all this was vulnerable: earthquakes leveled San Francisco in 1906, Long Beach in 1933, Santa Barbara in 1925, not to mention the deadly Loma Prieta quake that jolted the Bay Area just two years ago.
Then there have been floods and fires, like the one that destroyed 500 homes near Santa Barbara just last year, repeated droughts, a winter freeze last year that killed millions of trees, adding to the fire danger. And the Oakland fire, which denuded about 1,800 acres of steep terrain, will almost certainly be followed by another California hazard, mudslides, when winter rains erode the bare land.
 
Allure Remains Undiminished
 Yet little of this seems to have dulled the allure of California. There were the predictable recriminations in Oakland over who was to blame, and promises of new legislation to outlaw roofs of wooden shake shingles and other fire hazards. But even as rescuers searched for more bodies in the scorched rubble here, residents were already planning to rebuild and replant, as have hundreds of property owners who were wiped out by the Santa Barbara fire.
The author James D. Houston marvels at this disdain for nature's forces in his 1982 book "Californians: Searching for the Golden State." In it he describes a visit to Malibu, on the parched mountainous coast northwest of Los Angeles, after a fire ravaged expensive homes in 1978.
"You wonder how many houses it is wise to build at the bases of these dry and fire-prone mountains," he wrote. "But you don't ask. New and expensive houses are already rising from the ruins and right next to the ruins. It is like asking about the smog. It is like asking about the water." He added: "The question belongs in a science fiction story or a disaster novel: Suppose 10 million people were living in a semidesert where there was not one adequate source of water closer than 200 miles?"
Today, 15 million people live in that semidesert: the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Overall, the state grew by a staggering 6.1 million people in the 1980's, to nearly 30 million people. While a stagnant economy may have slowed migration a bit, the population continues to grow at a rate of more than 10,000 a week and some experts estimate the population could double by the year 2025.
 
More Wilderness Disappears
 Even as the rubble still smolders in Oakland, developers are pushing urban civilization further into the wilderness. The Nature Conservancy in San Francisco, a private group that attempts to buy wild lands to preserve them, calculates that every six months, an area the size of the City of San Francisco is converted from farmland or natural vegetation to residential and commercial use, further endangering numerous animal and plant species.
Increasingly, the California dream means living on a brushy hillside amid the smell of eucalyptus and pines. Already about seven million people, nearly a quarter of the population, live in what local officials call the "urban intermix" zone, where development has pushed into what was only recently desert or forest. State officials are warning of "the fires of the future" that these developments promise. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention says fire is a potent threat in the fast-growing counties in the foothills of the Sierra, in the drought-stricken Santa Cruz Mountains, which have become a suburb of San Jose and Silicon Valley, in Marin County north of San Francisco, and in hilly parts of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in Southern California.
In all this, the hills of Berkeley and Oakland provide a paradigm for California. Nothing is more quintessentially Californian than these neighborhoods, with their steep winding streets lined with eclectic redwood-shingled houses, many of them designed by such pioneering California architects as Bernard Maybeck, John Galen Howard and Julia Morgan in the 1920's. They have been home for the state's literati and Berkeley academics for generations.
On the night of the fire, Herb Gold, a novelist, gazed at the eerie red glow over Berkeley from his apartment on Russian Hill in San Francisco and pitied his poor colleagues who had left the city for the relative country of the hills. "These are people who looked for a peaceful, enveloping, hospitable mother-earth environment," he said. "I don't know what conclusion I can draw except that we live at risk."
 
Every House Is Gone
 Mr. Larner, the poet, considered life in his house on Grand View "the most comfortable life I have ever had." The house was perched on a slope over a ravine and he wrote while looking out over the creek and listening to birds. He said he did sometimes look up as he walked his dog at all the trees killed in the freeze last year and wonder if the city should cut them down as a fire hazard, but he dismissed the thought as needless fear. Today, every house in his little valley is gone. The valley, nothing but a black pit of ash, turned out to be a natural fire corridor.
Luther Nichols, another writer, and his wife, Rhoda, lived only a couple of streets away on Roble Road in Berkeley, but they were luckier. Mrs. Nichols escaped with the dog in a car, not knowing that her husband was talking his way past police barricades back to the house to protect it.
As his wife frantically searched shelters for him, he spent the night manning a garden hose as a blizzard of embers tried to ignite his house. He succeeded, giving much credit to the Spanish tile roof, while most of the other houses nearby were incinerated. "My great lament is that so much charm that took so many years to develop is now gone," he said, while admitting the "inherent vulnerability" of what he and his neighbors had built.
To Mr. Starr, the historian, the earthquake and fire have brought home a lesson about the state's capacity for much more growth. "There are limits to what can be done with California," he said. "We have a new kind of environmental limit, not so much having to do with damage to the environment but how much population is sustainable in the environmental engineering formula. If you over-engineer, there are all kinds of unexpected side products. California is not a nice place. It is very dangerous."

HEADLINE: John G. Burnett, 67, an Ex-Head Of Rockefeller Development, Dies

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
John G. Burnett, former head of the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation, died on Thursday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 67 years old and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
He died of a heart attack, his family said. 
 He joined Rockefeller Center Inc., now known as The Rockefeller Group, in 1976, and the next year became president and chief executive of its real-estate development subsidary. He continued in those posts until he retired in 1989.
During his tenure at Rockefeller he helped plan several major developments, including the Wells Fargo building in Los Angeles, the Renaissance Center Phase II in Detroit and the International Trade Center in Mount Olive, N.J. He also helped in selling the Exxon building in Manhattan to Mitsui Fudosan in 1986, in buying the Time & Life Building the same year and in negotiating the lease renewal that kept NBC at Rockefeller Center in 1987.
 
Adviser to David Rockefeller
 He also served as a real-estate adviser to David Rockefeller, particularly on the development of the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco.
Before working for the Rockefeller Group, Mr. Burnett spent seven years as an executive of the state's urban development agency, eventually becoming its president and chief executive. Among the projects he oversaw was the high-rise community created on Roosevelt Island in the East River between Manhattan and Queens. He was also in charge during the troubled period when shaky finances forced the agency to reorganize.
Born in Milwaukee, Mr. Burnett was an honors graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduation he served two years as a law clerk to Justice William O. Douglas on the United States Supereme Court.
For the next eight years he was the general counsel to the United States Agency for International Development, with special responsibility for aid to underdeveloped nations. For the next nine years he was executive vice president of the Development and Resource Corporation in New York City, after which he was hired by the state urban agency in 1969.
His survivors include his wife, Jane Holmer Burnett; three sons, John S., of St. Petersburg, Fla., Anthony M., of New Canaan, and Mark H., of Bloomington, Ind., and a daughter, Barbara Jean Berman of Bridgeton, N.J..

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Game 7 Was a Gift From Above

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
NOTHING was happening, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing but increasing tension. The zeros on the scoreboard last night in the Metrodome were dropping inning after inning after inning, as if a row of hens were working overtime. It appeared that the best and concluding moments of this baseball season -- maybe the best of any baseball season -- might last forever.
This was the seventh game of the World Series, and, after three, four, five, six, seven innings, nobody could score. People tried: The Minnesota Twins got a runner to third in the third inning; the Atlanta Braves did likewise in the fifth. But nothing happened. The pitchers, Jack Morris of the Twins and John Smoltz of the Braves, were matching sets of excellence, bookends of bravado. 
 It was preposterous. It couldn't get more dramatic. It did.
In the eighth, both teams loaded the bases with one out, but the Twins turned a double play to end the Braves' threat. In the bottom of the inning, the Braves did precisely the same thing to the Twins, behind Mike Stanton, who had replaced Smoltz.
It went into the ninth inning, 0-0. That is, 16 zeros. Nothing had happened, and it just kept on happening. And into the 10th: zero, of course, to zero. The longest Game 7 with no score in the history of the World Series.
And there it ended. Dan Gladden hit a broken-bat double, and there was a sacrifice bunt and two intentional walks, and then with the bases loaded and a pulled-in outfield, Gene Larkin, a seldom-used infielder, stepped up to pinch-hit. He was facing Alejandro Pena, now on the mound for the Braves. The noisy home crowd of 55,000 was on its feet and creating a snowstorm by waving its white homer hankies. And Larkin responded. He looped a fly ball over the outstretched glove of left fielder Brian Hunter, for a single to score the lone run of the game.
Suddenly it was over. Suddenly the Twins had won. But the Braves did not lose. They just didn't win the World Series, is all.
Sometimes the gods are just. Sometimes even they, taking time from their flutes and lyres and various dalliances, will determine that we, too, down below, could use a bit more pleasure, especially in these times of gloomy national recession and despairing world affairs and the football season. And so they, along with Kirby Puckett, in the guise of a mere mortal, conspired to give us one more game of baseball.
Not just any game, of course, but a Seventh Game of the World Series. And not just any World Series, either. But one that has gone from the dramatic to the melodramatic, from suspenseful theater to the old Saturday afternoon serial thriller.
Four of the first six games between the Braves and the Twins had been decided by one run, and three had been determined only in the home half of the final inning, to break up a tie game -- one concluding in the ninth inning and one in the 12th, with plays at the plate, and, on Saturday night, in the 11th, with Puckett's game-ending home run.
But we needed this game, Game 7, and that's the simple truth. It was only fitting and proper. It was all so unlikely, all so upside-down, but this seems to restore the cosmic balance: Two teams that finished last in their divisions the year before win the pennants. Each team knowing in its heart that it cannot lose, that the fates have ordained that this is their season.
Each team understanding that it has come this far, that it has done it by coming from behind not only during the season, but in game after game, and thus overcoming all the odds fashioned by Las Vegas and Olympus.
Each team has had its improbable heroes: Mark Lemke, brought in for defensive purposes, hits a trio of triples, and is prominent in winning Games 3, 4 and 5; Scott Leius, who was only iffy on making the team in spring training, homers to win Game 2; and Jerry Willard, who had left baseball for a season a few years ago because he was going nowhere, is called in to pinch-hit and hits a sacrifice fly to win Game 4. And finally Larkin.
It just had to come down to the wire, to a photo finish.
The Twins went up two games to none, and then the Braves came back to take a 3-2 lead, and then the Twins tied it up, three games each.
The dream season would end on a dream: Game 7 of the World Series. "Every kid has dreamed about this," said Jack Morris on Saturday night. "When I was a kid, my brother and I used to play whiffle ball and I pretended that I was Bob Gibson and he was Mickey Mantle."
But since this is real life, we know that the gods can be cruel, and, using us for their sport, may turn dreams into nightmares.
Ask Charlie Liebrandt, who got knocked out of Game 1, and then in Game 6 was brought back in relief to start the home half of the 11th inning. He faced one batter, Mr. Puckett, and threw a total of four pitches. Two were balls and two were strikes, including the last, which ended up in the left center field bleachers.
After the game, a large group of reporters gathered around Charlie Liebrandt's locker. After a long period in the trainer's room and the shower, with most of his teammates gone, Liebrandt, lean, grim, a cup of beer in his hand, and his eyes looking only straight ahead, parted the crowd around his locker. "Nothing tonight, guys," he said to the newsy assemblage.
There was nothing tonight, guys.
Except, of course, for the memory, and the dream, and the nightmare.
And there was the tingling anticipation that all this set up: Game 7. It had to be. And better than anyone could have imagined.
As the scoreboard, in its way, had been reminding us: Oh, oh, oh yes.

HEADLINE: The Talk Of Hollywood;
High-Stakes Battle: Midler and Streisand Go Screen to Screen

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27

 BODY:
There's the Streisand team at Columbia, and the Midlerites at 20th Century Fox.
With the highly competitive film industry in an economic torpor, two of the biggest studios in town have, in not so subtle ways, taken on the public persona of their competing stars: Bette Midler and Barbra Streisand. 
 At Fox, which is soon to release the Bette Midler film "For the Boys," the brash, aggressive, even unpredictable mood is plainly a reflection of their star, who is planning a truly mammoth publicity campaign. But at Columbia Pictures, which is releasing Ms. Streisand's "Prince of Tides," based on the Pat Conroy novel, the tone is more secure, confident and a little disdainful of the upstart Midlerites.
 
So Far, So Good
 Intensifying the competition is the fact that preview screenings have been strong for both films, which are vying for the same adult audience. Both are expensive, too, costing at least $30 million each. And in typical Hollywood style, each studio professes nothing but the best for its rival, while wishing a little ill will, too. (Also in typical Hollywood style, executives at the two studios would not let their names be used, because the studio they criticize today might be one they want to work at tomorrow.)
" 'Prince of Tides' is a beloved book," said one Columbia executive. "It's timeless. This picture will leave you feeling good. On the other hand, 'For the Boys' is a period piece. Nostalgia may be in but it's depressing."
Although they have never acknowledged it publicly, Barbra and Bette, as they are called here, have been rivals for years, in part because of the similarities and contrasts in their styles, backgrounds and talents. Both actresses are powerful singers who began on the New York stage. Ms. Streisand is a megastar, a diva, a performer who selects her roles slowly. Ms. Midler is also a star, but with a more turbulent career, a singer who enjoys performing onstage in contrast to the reclusive Ms. Streisand. They could play each other's roles.
 
Stars, Studios and Money
 Now, with these new movies, the two are colliding almost head-on, and in the current bleak mood seizing the film industry the competition carries financial implications not only for the actresses, but for Fox and Columbia as well.
Ms. Midler's movie, with James Caan, is a musical drama directed by Mark Rydell about 2 U.S.O. performers over nearly 50 years. "For the Boys" is, perhaps, Fox's major entry in the Thanksgiving-Christmas competition, when moviegoing around the nation reaches its peak.
Ms. Streisand produced, directed and co-stars, with Nick Nolte, in "Prince of Tides," an adaptation of Mr. Conroy's best seller about a Southern teacher who comes to New York to pick up the pieces of his life.
Although there are half a dozen other major holiday movies -- including Steven Spielberg's "Hook," Oliver Stone's "J.F.K.," Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" and Martin Scorsese's "Cape Fear" -- the Streisand and Midler films are vying for the same grown-up, largely female audience whose failure to show up at the box office in big numbers over the summer and fall has shaken the industry.
"Everyone's watching this because it's so competitive -- for the same adult audience, for sound tracks, for advertising, for publicity and possibly for an Academy Award," said one film executive at a rival studio. He added, "It's shoot-out time between these two movies."
"For the Boys," opens in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco on Nov. 22, and around the country five days later. "Prince of Tides," opens in New York on Dec. 18, and in the rest of the country on Christmas Day.
Even in this time of relative austerity, Fox has already taken out a series of expensive three-page ads in major newspapers to herald "For the Boys," which Joe Roth, the head of the studio, calls "an event film." The studio also pushed the opening of the film forward to gain a beat on its competitor.
"They got frightened of 'Prince of Tides,' " said one Columbia executive. "They were supposed to open Christmas. They moved away."
A Fox executive said: "Originally, 'Prince of Tides' was to be released in September. In fact they had a Vanity Fair cover of Streisand timed to the release of the film. They couldn't pull the cover. So a little bit of their campaign broke early."
Columbia executives insisted they were not concerned about the Midler movie.
"These films are going to be released six weeks apart," said one Columbia executive. "If 'For the Boys' holds up well, and plays like 'Dances With Wolves,' until next summer, then Columbia has something to be concerned about. But failing that, and quite likely we won't have that, then chances are good that 'Prince of Tides' will be out in 1,200 theaters and 'For the Boys' will have a lot of its theaters gone."
"As for competition between Barbra and Bette, well, maybe Bette is concerned about Barbra," said the executive, "but Barbra is certainly not concerned about Bette."
 
Well, They Worked Once
 With television, like the film business, in the creative doldrums, the networks are reviving numerous old war horses to lure audiences that have been slipping away.
These include "The Very Best of Ed Sullivan" (CBS, Nov. 24); "Memories of M*A*S*H" (CBS, Nov. 25); "The Return of Eliot Ness" (NBC, Nov. 10), and "Back to the Streets of San Francisco," which began production last week.
Some executives insist that the effort is intended to bring some zest, nostalgia and variety to nighttime programming. Others insist that bringing back new versions of the old shows only underlines the creative void on the major networks.
"Television is feeding on itself and it's obscene," said Barney Rosenzweig, the producer of such shows as "Cagney and Lacey." He added: "It's an attempt to woo back an audience that's not there anymore. It's a strong indication that we're rather bereft of ideas."
Mr. Rosenzweig, who is 53 years old, blamed the creative paucity on television's writers and producers. "The people making television programs are young, they didn't really see movies or plays or read books, but they watched television," he said. "What they're feeding back to the new generation is their own version of 'Eight Is Enough.' It's frightening."
Barry Diller, the chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Inc., said: "It's the last gasp of a dinosaur. I think it was excessive behavior to put on a whole group of television series that were so odd and moderne last season, such as what 'Twin Peaks' became. This is the opposite end of excessive behavior, which is to say that the audience is so conservative that what we'll do is scrape history's barrel. What they're not doing is to be edgy, contemporary and relevant."
 
Roasting 'The Bonfire'>
 Six months ago, Julia Phillips's acid "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again" was required reading here. Now the most talked-about book in town is Julie Salamon's "Devil's Candy: The Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to Hollywood" (Houghton Mifflin), which documents in grim detail the making of Tom Wolfe's novel of social satire into a disasterous film.
Ms. Salamon, a film critic for The Wall Street Journal, was given unusual carte blanche by the director, Brian De Palma, to the entire production, largely because he believed the film would be a masterpiece about greed that would serve as a metaphor for the 1980's. Instead, the film maker and Warner Brothers made a film that was, according to Ms. Salamon, a metaphor for inept decisions (casting the boyish Tom Hanks as a Wall Street financier, Bruce Willis as a reporter who was British in the book, and Morgan Freeman, who is black, as a character who was a white Jewish judge in the book); out-of-control costs; creative compromises that engulfed the film, and movie stars behaving like petulant children.
Ms. Salamon said she believed Mr. De Palma's claims not to have read the book. "I've spoken to him and he's been friendly," she said. "At the moment he's trying not to think about the movie."
What seriously damaged the film, she said, was an array of decisions, including not naming a producer to replace Peter Guber, who left before full-scale production began, to run Sony Entertainment, as well as the enormous sums of money spent on the movie -- least $50 million -- which often crippled the studio's ability to make decisions.
"Now with movies costing so much, studios want it both ways," said Ms. Salamon. "They want complete control because so much money is being spent. But at the same time they want those lucky accidents in which a bunch of elements are thrown together that can produce a great movie." She added, "A kind of nuttiness just took over this production."

Travel Coalition Turns To Foreign Visitors

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
More than 60 travel-related companies plan to follow up their efforts to encourage domestic travel in the United States with an advertising campaign to encourage overseas travel to the United States.
At a news conference today in Washington, members of Go USA! The Travel Coalition, including hotels, airlines and car-rental companies, are expected to discuss details of the campaign, which could begin running in February if sufficient money is forthcoming. Also participating is the Commerce Department's United States Travel and Tourism Administration. 
 The coalition spent about $7 million earlier this year on a campaign aimed primarily at business people who were reluctant to travel because of the Persian Gulf war or the recession. A small portion of that campaign, created by FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York, was aimed at business travelers overseas.
A spokeswoman for the coalition said no decision had yet been made on an agency to handle the campaign, which is expected to make use of a message from President Bush inviting overseas visitors here.

HEADLINE: Coming Back;
See the Future, in the Schools

 BODY:
No issue is more important to New York City's future than the performance of its public schools. The economy cannot prosper without a well-educated labor force, the city's huge immigrant population cannot be assimilated without good schools and more middle-class families will flee if they think the schools are inferior or dangerous.
There is some reason for concern. Test scores are improving slightly, but still only equal the average for the rest of the state. The physical plant was allowed to deteriorate; only since 1987 has there been a coherent building plan. And budget cuts this year have stripped away hundreds of teachers and counselors, forcing crowded classrooms, reduced course offerings and shortages. 
 But the city's schools are not plummeting toward catastrophe. Indeed, by some performance measures, they have at least held their own and may actually have improved over the last 20 years.
What has changed most dramatically is the demands imposed by society. The schools must now educate a population that is markedly poorer, more socially handicapped and less competent in English than 20 years ago. And they must prepare students for jobs that require far more skills than ever before. The schools have to run a lot faster just to keep pace with the new demands.
The school system is the largest in the nation, dauntingly large: a $7 billion budget, 980,000 students, 984 schools, 63,500 teachers, 22,600 principals, counselors and other supervisors and 3,600 administrators. The racial balance has changed. In 1967, half the school population was white. Now, in a city that's 43 percent white, white pupils represent 19 percent of the population, blacks 38 percent, Hispanics 35 percent and Asians and others 8 percent.
In addition, the system must grapple with privation. A third of the students come from welfare families and 60 percent live in single-parent households. About 110,000 students are enrolled in classes for limited English proficiency. The schools are much more dangerous than 20 years ago, although the number of serious incidents last year, 3,843, was down from 5,233 in 1984.
Despite these problems, students are performing better. Overall attendance in 1990-91, at nearly 87 percent, was the highest in 24 years. Reading and math scores showed slight improvements. And students are staying in school longer.
But that's not enough. Students need ever-more sophisticated skills to compete successfully for jobs in this information-based economy. That's why the system must meet the challenge of providing a better education to a needier population.
How can that be done? The first answer is more resources. The city now spends about $7,100 per pupil, 10 percent under the state average. Maximum class sizes, 32 for elementary schools and 34 for high schools, are higher than in many districts; and even those limits are often breached.
The schools are entitled to more state funds. With 37 percent of the state's students, and an even higher proportion of its needy students, the city schools get only 33 percent of state education aid. The difference amounts to $485 million this year. That's more than the grim reduction they suffered this year. More money could provide a longer school day and year and expand pre-kindergarten programs, after-school activities and services for children from troubled families.
Schools need more autonomy. Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez advocates more authority for individual schools, with principals, teachers and parents sharing power. The idea is to let teachers and principals innovate and to encourage parental involvement. It's a promising idea, but schools need more responsibility for budgets, curriculum and hiring. In exchange for more power, teachers could accept more training and less protection for incompetents. And parents ought to have more opportunity to choose schools.
The system needs a stronger curriculum, of just the sort Mr. Fernandez is pushing by increasing math and science requirements.
The system needs authority over custodians. In the past, custodians have been allowed to charge "opening fees" to outside groups using schools and avoid doing routine repairs. Lately, the Board of Education has got tougher with the custodians' union, and just last week Mr. Fernandez said he would hire private contractors rather than give in to unreasonable demands.
New York City has come back from distress before, usually to new triumphs of commerce and culture, transforming neighborhoods, industries and people. The future now, as in the past, depends on the schools.

HEADLINE: No Debt, No Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Money Supply Doesn't Tell All" (Economic Scene, Oct. 9) breathes new life into a favorite cliche of financial writers, a cliche that should have been given a decent burial long ago. 
 The article says: "No one can ever be sure that stagnant money growth is not a portent of an economic downturn. But simply assuming that it is -- and putting pressure on the Fed to crank up the printing presses -- carries its own risks."
The Fed cannot crank up the printing presses. Our money is debt-based. To create new money requires new debt. All the Fed can do is create new reserves that permit the creation of new debt. But if you do not have borrowers seeking credit you are not going to have new debt. That is the Bush Administration's problem, not any so-called "credit crunch." We have a dearth of borrowers. The consumer is tapped out and can't take on any more debt. So too is the Government.

HEADLINE: Bills Seek More Competition in Electricity Market

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Access to the power transmission grid, a key element of the utilities' monopoly control of the nation's electric system, is up for grabs for the first time in the history of the industry.
As part of the National Energy Strategy package moving through the Congress, a House subcommittee has approved provisions that will require utilities to carry electricity from independent buyers across the utilities' territory to independent sellers, even if the utilities lose electric sales as a result. The version of the bill that the Senate is planning to take up this week does not have the same provision. 
 But the Senate version would repeal a law concerning who may own power plants, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and many other participants in the electric market are demanding access to transmission in exchange for the repeal.
Taken together, these legislative proposals would vastly extend the deregulation of the utilities that Congress started in 1978, opening the transmission system and freeing participants to build power plants.
"A key to whether there is any real competition at all is transmission," said Larry Hobart, the executive director of the American Public Power Association, many of whose members are small utilities that serve commercial and residential customers with power they buy from larger utilities. "If you have an independent power producer, that's like a dot inside a circle that is the service territory of an investor-owned utility. We're another dot, outside the circle. Unless you can tie them together with a transmission line, it's of no use to us."
The producers also seek more competition, arguing that they must be freed from "monopsony," a variation of monopoly in which there are many sellers but only one buyer. Under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, independent producers now sell to the utility in whose territory they are situated at "avoided cost" -- the price that the utility would have to have paid to make the power for itself. Many independent producers think they could do better if they could offer their product more widely.
 
'Just Like the Phone System'
 The utilities argue that their control of the transmission system is essential to the stability of electric supply. At the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman, said the demand to open the transmission system came from "a bunch of people wanting to take something without paying for it."
Many investor-owned utilities see no advantage to a proliferation of independent producers, because no one can build power plants more cheaply than they can. But some utilities would like to see more such plants, because they themselves would like to build them, either inside their territories or far afield. That group of utilities is also seeking repeal of the holding company act, which puts onerous regulation on utilities doing business in more than one state.
Experts say that opening the transmission system would remove a large part of the monopoly power of utilities, turning transmission lines, now private property, into something akin to common carriers. If the market were thrown open to competitors, the amount of power traded that way might be small, but it would go far toward determining electric prices for everyone. When President Bush proposed the National Energy Strategy earlier this year he called for such open access, and there is substantial support in Congress.
"It's got to be opened up, just like the phone system," said Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat. Giving small producers and small utilities more access to transmission would mean big improvements in competition and efficiency, he said.
In a possible model for opening the transmission system, in two recent cases courts or regulators have required open access as a condition of utility mergers.
Lurking behind both the holding company act, which the Senate bill would repeal, and the transmission access issue is the question of whether the utilities' three traditional roles -- as generators, transmitters and distributors of power -- should be split up.
Independent producers say access will create competition that lowers price for everyone. Traditional utilities say that with access, independent producers can go "cherry picking," stealing away the best customers, like major industrial plants, and leaving the utilities with generating stations with no one to serve, creating "stranded investments."
The cost of those plants will have to be spread among small consumers, they say, who will be captive and heavily saddled. "You've built to satisfy all customers equally, and now these customers can go elsewhere, so who pays for all that investment?" said Dick Disbrow, the chairman of American Electric Power, a Midwest holding company. If the cost of idle plants is spread among the remaining customers, he said, the price that the traditional utility must charge will rise further, creating an even bigger cost differential.
 
The Issue of Priority
 On the other hand, the Public Service Company of Indiana favors transmission access and has proposed opening its system in exchange for the right to sell its surplus power elsewhere at whatever price it can get.
"Injecting competition into regulated industries is good public policy," said James E. Rogers Jr., the company's chief executive, in a speech in Chicago earlier this year.
In between is the position taken by a coalition of 17 large public power agencies, led by Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority. In this hybrid, small producers would negotiate for access, and impasses would be resolved by binding arbitration.
"The maximum savings from competitive bidding won't flow to consumers unless all potential power suppliers have a fair shot at the transmission system," Mr. Flynn said.
Among the thorny issues is who should have priority on the system. Should it be the third-party buyer and seller, who want round-the-clock access, or the existing utility customers, who use the system far less but save money doing it?
 
'Economy Transfers'
 Utilities currently use their lines for unscheduled "economy transfers," so that if one company has a plant that can produce power for 2 cents a kilowatt-hour but is idle and a neighboring utility is running a plant at a cost of 4 cents a kilowatt-hour, the second utility will shut its plant and buy from the first at a cost of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. The volume of such transfers increased nearly 20-fold between 1960 and 1985, when a huge difference existed between the fuel costs of oil and coal.
Costs have narrowed somewhat since then, but transfers still save consumers $18 billion a year, the investor-owned utilities stress.
The system was paid for by those customers through their monthly bills, the investor-owned utilities point out. At the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington, Michael Foley, an electricity specialist, said, "Given the fact that they paid for that hardware, shouldn't they get first dibs on any of the power?"
The Edison Electric Institute casts it in a somewhat grimmer light. "If access to the system is mandated for a few special interests, the benefits now accruing to the majority of a utility's customers may be compromised," it said.

HEADLINE: At Crossroads, U.S. Ponders Ethics of Helping Others Die

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
For years, in hospitals, courtrooms and the privacy of family discussions, Americans have been grappling with a painful question: What should be the limits, if any, on medical efforts to keep people alive?
Now with two medically arranged suicides in Michigan and a coming statewide ballot on euthanasia in Washington State, that question seems suddenly to have taken another form: What should be the limits, if any, on medical efforts to help people die? 
 In the view of religious leaders and specialists in medical ethics, the United States is approaching a critical juncture in its attitudes toward ending life and caring for the dying. And though much attention in recent days has focused on Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan doctor who helped two women end their lives last week, the issue that preoccupies these ethicists is Initiative 119, the measure on the ballot in Washington a week from tomorrow.
 
Nightmare or Breakthrough?
 Initiative 119 would make Washington the first place in the world to pass a law authorizing doctors to assist in suicides or give lethal injections to patients who have asked to die.
For some people Initiative 119 is the first step in a nightmare scenario reminiscent of Nazi Germany. For others it is an overdue breakthrough in human rights. Many on both sides believe that the nation is embarking on a struggle as protracted, as emotional and as ethically unyielding as the battle over abortion.
To Margaret P. Battin, a University of Utah philosophy professor who specializes in issues of professional ethics, the vote in Washington and the suicides in Michigan highlight "the most important new civil-rights issue likely to come along: whether one has the right to determine or control the circumstances of one's own death."
But to Dr. Leon R. Kass, a physician and ethicist at the University of Chicago, Initiative 119 represents "a betrayal of the deepest meaning of the art of healing." Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, calls Initiative 119 "the most important bioethics decision of the postwar era." And the Rev. John J. Paris, a professor of medical ethics at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., says, "If Initiative 119 passes it will set the agenda for the entire country."
Such unequivocal judgments are unusual among those professionally devoted to studying and teaching medical ethics. Unlike many voters in Washington, who may base their views on a single, searing family experience or on an appealing slogan, these scholars are forced to consider a wide range of cases, justify their responses on the basis of a broad set of moral or pragmatic principles, and try to calculate the consequences for future policy.
Among medical ethicists there are vigorous advocates of Initiative 119, people who say afflicted patients have a right to medical help in committing suicide or to a peaceful death by lethal injection.
But it is also noteworthy how many ethicists are adamantly opposed to such measures, even though they defend patients' rights to choose or refuse treatment and though they criticize doctors for aggressively prolonging the lives of dying or comatose patients with modern technology.
 
'A Gift From God,' But How to Use It?
 The nation's major religious faiths have adhered to traditional patterns in confronting the issues posed by Initiative 119. Protestants, Catholics and Jews all describe life as "a gift from God" over which humans only have "stewardship." But they differ over how that stewardship can be exercised: whether people have the right to choose when and how to die, or whether the choice must be left to God.
Leaders of the country's two largest Christian groups, the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention, reiterate their opposition to all forms of euthanasia or suicide. And Rabbi David Bleich, a professor of Talmud and ethics at Yeshiva University in New York, voices a similar view in the name of Orthodox Judaism: "Autonomy does not extend to one's own life. Man's body and life is the property of the Creator."
Assisted suicide and euthanasia are "clearly unacceptable," said Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, chairman of the subcommittee on biomedical ethics for Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.
But Initiative 119 has also found religious advocates, mostly from liberal and mainline Protestant churches, where euthanasia and assisted suicide appear to be increasingly accepted.
This summer the General Synod of the 1.6-million-member United Church of Christ passed a resolution referring to euthanasia and suicide and affirming "individual freedom and responsibility to make a choice in these matters." And the Pacific Northwest Conference of the United Methodist Church endorsed Initiative 119. The sentiments of the entire nine-million-member Methodist denomination will be tested next May, when its governing body votes on a statement acknowledging that in some circumstances assisted suicide could be "responsible stewardship of God-given life."
Unlike the religious groups, whose statements focus primarily on the choices facing dying patients and their families, medical ethicists have given far more attention to the consequences of legalizing euthanasia for the medical profession, the health-care system and public policy in general.
Many ethicists, including some who do not oppose assisted suicide in all circumstances, question whether doctors should ever be involved in such practices or in killing suffering patients who ask to die.
All medical ethics, they argue, spring from the reality that doctors have an exceptionally intimate, private and powerful relationship with their patients, who are exceptionally dependent and vulnerable. To inject a legal power to cause death into this relationship would alter the role of medicine drastically and ominously, they say.
Dr. Eric J. Cassell, who teaches at Cornell University Medical College and is the author of "The Nature of Suffering: And the Goals of Medicine" (Oxford University Press), said: "I don't think doctors should be killers. The decision to assist someone in their death should be agonized and private. Doctors administering injections is bad for doctors and bad for medicine, not because it is too hard but because it is too easy."
Dr. Caplan, a philosopher, said: "The greatest deterrent to abuse is to ask people to bear responsibility for what they do, and to ask their loved ones to help them. Asking the doctor is often asking a stranger."
 
The Risks of Abuse: A Slippery Slope?
 Much of the debate surrounding euthanasia and Initiative 119 focuses on potential abuses, and on whether such measures place society on a slippery slope that could lead to the elimination of unwanted individuals or whole categories of people, like the retarded, seriously disabled or senile.
Supporters of Initiative 119 emphasize that to be eligible for "aid in dying" -- the term used in the measure -- a person must be conscious and mentally competent, must be certified by two doctors within six months of death, and must sign a voluntary written request witnessed by two unrelated and impartial adults.
Opponents reply that these requirements are not nearly specific enough. For example, they say, the determination that a patient would die within six months could be made by "a dermatologist and a gynecologist," in Dr. Caplan's words.
Many ethicists question whether euthanasia would remain voluntary or whether the terminally ill would feel obliged to "go quickly and quietly" rather than burden their families.
Alexander Morgan Capron, a law professor who directs the Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics at the University of Southern California, said the "hard cases" facing medicine, ethics and the law "are those involving long and indefinite course of mental decline." Those cases, he said, "are not addressed at all by the initiative."
Indeed, the women who committed suicide in Michigan with Dr. Kevorkian's help were apparently not terminally ill but anguished by the prospect of prolonged, debilitating illnesses. In the best-selling suicide manual "Final Exit," (Hemlock Society/Carol Publishing), Derek Humphry argues that such people should also be eligible for assisted suicide or euthanasia.
It is just such arguments that worry many ethicists. Daniel Callahan, director of the Hastings Center, says the logic of the case for euthanasia will inevitably lead to its extension far beyond terminally ill people who are mentally competent.
The case rests on two legs, he said: first, the right of people to determine their own fate and, second, the relief of suffering. But if self-determination is critical, why limit assisted suicide or euthanasia to the terminally ill and deny it to those who wish to die for other quite heartfelt reasons? If relief of suffering is critical, "why should that relief be denied to the demented or the incompetent?"
"The ingredients of the argument are inherently unstable," he said.
Dr. Battin of the University of Utah rejects these criticisms. Suicide, she said, "must be regarded as a fundamental right of self-determination where it conduces to the preservation of human dignity." In cases of extended terminal illness where controlling pain is a problem or where the individual suffers other grave impairments, "that right is pretty obvious," and it should include getting a doctor to facilitate the death or, if necessary, cause it.
Medical involvement in suicide and euthanasia is unavoidable, said Cheryl K. Smith, staff attorney and deputy director of the national Hemlock Society. "Physicians are the gatekeepers," she said. "They have the authority to prescribe. They have training in drug dosages and drug interactions, and they're the ones patients turn to for relief of suffering."
 
Must Technology Fight Compassion?
 Ethicists who accept euthanasia often ask whether there is any moral distinction between halting a life-sustaining medical treatment and directly killing someone. "A doctor discontinuing a treatment often thinks he isn't morally responsible but thinks that he is when he gives a lethal injection," said Joel Feinberg, Regents Professor of Philosophy and Law at the University of Arizona. "That is superstitious -- he's responsible either way."
As for the possibility that legalizing euthanasia could lead to abuses, Professor Feinberg said, "Not to let a person cut off six months of unnecessay pain or suffering is an abuse, too."
Opponents and supporters of assisted suicide and euthanasia say remarkably similar things about the shortcomings of American medicine. But they often draw different conclusions.
Both sides worry about introducing euthanasia into a medical system increasingly driven by economic pressures and incentives. Both insist that dying, pain-ridden or anguished patients must be given compassionate care rather than simple prolongation of their lives through technology.
But for some, giving doctors the power of releasing people from life altogether is a necessary form of compassionate care, an essential check on high-tech medicine. For others, it is the ultimate surrender to technology, a dangerous substitute for compassion.
"I think it is the issue of the next 20 years," said Dr. Cassell, "and it won't be resolved on a ballot."

Sun Belt Shock: High Health Costs

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
COMPANIES that move from states like New York to lower-cost areas like south Florida, Houston or Dallas rarely inquire beforehand about employee medical costs. They are mainly concerned about wages, real estate and taxes, which are indeed lower in most Sun Belt states. But benefits consultants say some executives may be shocked after the move to find health-care costs as high or higher than in New York.
Robert D. Eicher, a principal in New York with A. Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm, said several client companies recently moved to south Florida and ended up spending $7,000 an employee for health care -- more than double the national average of $3,200 an employee and 40 percent higher than their New York costs of about $5,000. He said health-care costs for some big companies in Houston and Dallas were also $5,000 or more. 
 Doctors and hospitals in Florida, which has a high concentration of elderly residents, often raise their charges to private insurers to offset cutbacks in Government Medicare allowances. John Sforza, president of the Florida Health Coalition, an employers group, said South Florida had 92 hospitals -- "too many," he added -- and nearly 12,000 physicians. He contended that doctors often inflated charges, and he acknowleged that some South Florida companies "experience costs close to $5,000" an employee. But he said he did not know any paying $7,000.
Mr. Eicher said hospital rooms in Miami often cost about the same as in New York. He added that for-profit general and pyschiatric hospitals, which are numerous in Southern cities, were adept at piling on extra charges. And, he said, physicians often refer patients back and forth so that several doctors can submit bills. "You can easily see psychiatric costs double or quadruple" after moving to South Florida, he added.
The Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board, a state agency, recommended to the Legislature last week that doctors who are among the owners of laboratories or centers for imaging, radiation or physical therapy be prohibited from sending patients to those centers.
Mr. Eicher said Texas, which is also a stronghold of for-profit hospitals, went through two recessions in recent years, but "there has never been a reduction in medical costs." He said oil companies and other large Texas employers had been slow to use health maintenance organizations or networks of doctors who agree to eliminate possibly unnecessary medical services.
Greg Scandlen, a health-policy analyst in Alexandria, Va., who publishes Health Benefits Letter, said only 8.6 percent of Texans were enrolled in an H.M.O., well below the 14.6 percent national average. William Custer, research director of the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, said many Houston employers had been unable to keep charges for outpatient services from rising.
Mr. Scandlen said medical societies in at least 19 states, including 11 in the South and Southwest, had been able to put restrictions on medical reviewers who "second-guess" doctors about their treatment plans. Insurers and self-insured employers hire review companies to determine if a patient might be treated effectively in a clinic or doctor's office at less cost than in a hospital. State laws generally establish licensing requirements and working rules for the reviewers. But several states are talking of going further and prohibiting reviews by long-distance telephone from other states.
Mr. Custer said the screening process, which insurers call utilization review, is used mainly by large companies because of its relatively high cost. In small cities and rural areas, where doctors and hospitals are scarce, it is often difficult to persuade them to join a cost-control network, he added.
In a study of medical costs in Houston, Los Angeles and Rhode Island, the Employee Benefit Research Institute concluded that utilization review reduced costs in places where there was competition among doctors and hospitals.
But the study said medical inflation was still an unsolved problem. Referring to the cost pressures from new medical technology, hospital workers' pay increases and the growing needs of the aging population, the institute said, "The question remains whether cost-management strategies will ever restrain health-care cost inflation."
Mr. Custer said geographical differences in health-care costs might become "much more important" for companies deciding to move, as health costs continue to rise. Employee benefits add about 37 percent to wage costs at most large companies, with about one-third of benefit costs going to health care. What worries companies is the rapid growth in medical expenses, Mr. Custer said. "The scary part is the rate of inflation."

A Positive Move For Illinois Central

 BODY:
A leading Midwestern railroad company -- the Illinois Central Corporation -- got a green light yesterday from the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The rating service put the company on its Creditwatch with positive implications, which means that its current B rating on subordinated debt might be raised in the near future, along with improved ratings on other debt like equipment trust certificates. A total of about $177 million of debt is involved. 
 Operating results have been better than anticipated despite the downturn in the economy, S.& P. said. It noted that for the nine-month period this year, the company's pretax income increased 36 percent, to $68.9 million, on $409.1 million of revenue. Bank loan refinancing and a $72 million common stock issue will help improve near-term results even more, the ratings agency said.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Many Banks Are Seeking Help in Sales

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
AS a training specialist from the outside, W. Anthony Turner, executive vice president of the Selbst Group of White Plains gets an inside look into many banks. And he says that despite a wave of layoffs and consolidations in banking, the growing number of brokerage operations at many banks provides some job opportunities for people with sales or financial bankgrounds who have lost their jobs at other types of companies.
Mr. Turner's firm specializes in training bank personnel at many levels, including customer service representatives, branch managers and private bankers who handle the accounts of wealthy individuals. 
 The Selbst Group, for example, is now training 600 branch managers for Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills, Calif. It has also worked for banks like C&S/Sovran of Atlanta, which is now in the process of merging with NCNB of Charlotte, N.C.; Mercantile Bank of St. Louis, and Fleet/Norstar of Providence, R.I. The focus is often on programs to train bank employes to market more effectively a variety of new products, including securities and annuities.
"I think so many of the displaced middle managers today, young and old, have not taken the time to investigate the opportunities in banking," Mr. Turner, who is 31 years old, said in a telephone interview last week. "They are so overwhelmed by losing their jobs and trying to find another with brokerage firms."
Mr. Turner said banks were working to create their own types of sales cultures, now geared more toward building relationships than simply promoting products.
Thirty years ago, many leading brokerage firms had street-level brokerage offices, easily available to the public and often crowded at lunchtime with people watching the stock ticker. Nowadays, many brokerages prefer to do retail business mostly by telephone or computer, and they avoid making their branch offices convenient for tape watchers.
Mr. Turner noted some exceptions, like First Union Brokerage Services, a unit of First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.. It operates what used to be called "walk-in offices" in Hallandale, Fla., and Charlotte, so that customers, mainly retirees or wealthy individuals with time on their hands, can watch the tape at their leisure.
In Atlanta, First Union Brokerage has a small headquarters office, from which a staff of four makes calls on branches to give investment help to bank customers. "We call that the hub-and-spoke arrangement," Mr. Turner said.
Banks are now moving slowly to take advantage of rising investment interest among customers and turn their bank customers into securities customers as well. Naturally, they want to draw their bank customers away from doing business with brokerage firms.
Recently, for instance, Citicorp ran a large advertisement inviting customers to buy mutual funds at its Citibank branches and offering the advice of fund-wise brokers.
Citicorp, Mr. Turner said, has been a client of his firm. "We provided mutual fund product knowledge training," he explained.
Lincoln Savings Bank in New York has a private banking unit, only a year old, with several registered representatives who make customer contacts and then turn them over to the bank's brokerage unit. Charles Potters, a former registered representative for Prudential-Bache, is one of them. He works under the aegis of Arthur M. Silverman, 33, who came from Citicorp to organize the new division.
Mr. Silverman, said he had four account officers, mainly brokers like Mr. Potters, working with 10 other staff members.
"My experience from being a director of executive banking at Citicorp," Mr. Silverman said, "leads me to believe that registered representatives from brokerage firms come to the job with tremendous product knowledge, as well as the skill, experience and willingness to ask for the business.
"I found that in my former banking environment," he said, "there continues to be a battle between senior management and the line managers to get their people to become more aggressive in terms of selling."
Mr. Silverman said that over the last 30 years, the banking culture had not emphasized sales.
As for training the new brokers and others in banking techniques, Mr. Turner, the training expert, said he usually divided the training into three components.
"First comes the research phase, where we like to get to know the group -- usually no more than 25 persons -- as individuals," he said. "We interview each person about sales experience and what he or she believes is needed to become more effective."
Then, he said, the Selbst Group holds two three-day workshops covering topics from product knowledge to prospecting for new business.
Finally, he said, his trainers go back to the bank and work with each person a few hours once a month for six months.

Dollar Gains on Expectation Of Strong Report on G.N.P.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher against most major currencies yesterday on optimism that the United States economy might be stronger than expected. Gold prices fell.
Several traders said the dollar's rise came amid speculation that the Government's report on gross national product for the third quarter, scheduled to be issued today, would suggest faster growth. 
 The consensus estimate among economists is that the Commerce Department will report a growth rate of 2.2 percent to 3 percent for the quarter. That would be a sharp gain from the decrease of five-tenths of 1 percent in G.N.P. in the second quarter.
A healthier G.N.P. report will make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, traders said. Lower interest rates tend to reduce the dollar's value.
 
Principally Against Mark
 Anticipation of the report sent the dollar higher principally against the German mark, which in turn helped the dollar rise against some other important currencies.
In late European trading, the dollar closed at 1.7100 marks, up from 1.7050 late Friday. Later, the dollar closed at 1.7173 marks in New York trading, up from 1.7000 late Friday.
Currency dealers say the dollar has exhibited surprising strength in the face of pessimistic economic reports that suggest the United States' recovery from recession has stalled.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.92 yen to a closing 132.28 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 132.13 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 132.29 yen, up from 131.45 yen late Friday.
 
Pound Falls in London
 In London, the pound fell to $1.7040 from $1.7115 late Friday. In New York, sterling cost $1.69425 at closing in New York, less expensive than $1.7135 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5060 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870; 5.8580 French francs, up from 5.8000; 1,283.25 Italian lire, up from 1,270.75, and 1.1250 Canadian dollars, down from 1.12625.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $358.60 an ounce from $361.90 an ounce late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $358.45, from $362 late Friday.

Treasuries Up on Greenspan Talk

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A pessimistic economic assessment by the Federal Reserve chairman helped to lift the prices of Treasury notes and bonds yesterday.
In a speech to business executives at the University of Rhode Island, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the economy had "turned demonstrably sluggish" in recent weeks. 
 Mr. Greenspan suggested that a "credit crunch" was dragging the economy down.
Compared with his recent measured assessments -- he proclaimed the recession over in July, during his official midyear review of the economy -- Mr. Greenspan's comments on the economy struck some credit market participants as almost shrill.
 
Mollifying Bond Investors
 "His remarks were much better than what the market had anticipated," one trader of government bonds said, referring to their effect on the Treasury market, which often reacts favorably to sour economic news.
Many analysts and traders said the comments were almost certainly intended to mollify the bond market, which over the last week has been rattled by talk of tax cuts.
Reacting to early news reports of Mr. Greenspan's comments, which characterized his speech as somewhat more pessimistic than it actually was, analysts interpreted the remarks as a signal that the Fed intended to lower short-term interest rates again soon. In fact, Mr. Greenspan gave no indication even indirectly of what his intentions might be in regard to interest rates.
"It's pretty tough talk," said Edward S. Hyman, president of ISI Group Inc., an investment firm, "and coming on top of other soft economic data it says the economy is faltering and will need lower interest rates to get it to pick up."
"I don't think there is a case the economy is getting a lot worse," he added. "It's just not getting any better."
James Fralick, a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said the remarks were primarily an attempt to soothe skittish bond investors.
"The Fed has to get this market in the right frame of mind, and there was a lot of damage done last week" by the talk of tax cuts, he said. "But he can't do much to ease policy further until bond yields fall below 8 percent and are moving toward 7.75 percent."
Mr. Fralick added that with the Commerce Department schedued to release what is widely expected to be a healthy estimate of third-quarter economic growth today, Mr. Greenspan may have been trying to remind market participants that "significant difficulties" remain to be overcome.
Most analysts anticipate the preliminary estimate to show that the economy expanded at a rate of 2 to 2.5 percent in the third quarter.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks did have a salutary effect on bond prices, which moved higher.
 
Prices Up in Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 101 5/32 late yesterday, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 8.02 percent, compared with 8.04 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 5/8, up 7/32, to yield 7.63 percent. And the new 6 percent two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.88 percent, compared with 5.93 percent on Friday.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell at the weekly auction.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.99 percent, down from an average rate of 5.04 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average rate of 5.04 percent, compared with an average rate of 5.14 percent a week ago.
 
European Debt Priced
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the European Community, which rarely sells debt in American capital markets, priced $65.4 million of noncallable securities yesterday through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 6.25 percent securities, which mature on April 28, 1994, were priced at $100, or par, 32 basis points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants said prices of most issues were little changed in light trading.
Activity was also sluggish in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities.
With roughly $1 billion in new issues expected to be priced this week, traders said that at this point investors were reluctant to make new commitments.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: New Vistas for Tourism's Mr. Italy

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Until he joined the army in 1944, Mario Perillo had never journeyed farther than 40 miles from his home in the Bronx. But since then he has traveled much of the world, and he has taken more than a million others with him -- most of them to Italy, the land of his parents.
Now, at age 65, Mr. Perillo is striking out in several new directions. Compared with a decade ago, the number of participants in his package tours to Italy has fallen by half, leaving Perillo Tours -- one of the nation's largest independent tour operators, with annual revenue approaching $60 million -- to make up the difference by promoting Caribbean cruises and Hawaiian packages. 
 Some of the continuing changes at Mr. Perillo's family-owned company involve bolstering the non-Italy side of the business. After a five-year association with Merv Griffin's Paradise Island Resort and Casino in the Bahamian capital, Nassau, Perillo recently moved its Bahamas package tours to the Crystal Palace, the 1,550-room resort and casino owned by Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. And next year Perillo Tours will inaugurate a 7-day New York-to-Bermuda cruise.
But the man who refers to himself in his advertising as "Mr. Italy," is clearly eager to reinvigorate tourism to that country. Some of that hope is tied to one of the biggest changes Perillo has ever made. Starting Nov. 14, Perillo Tours customers will no longer fly Pan American World Airways to Italy, as they have for 45 years, but Alitalia, Italy's national carrier.
In an arrangement that involves joint promotion and volume discounts on air fares, Perillo has agreed to use Alitalia exclusively for its Italian tours. To celebrate the alliance, from January through March the new partners will spend more than $2 million on advertising.
The pitchman will continue to be the gray-haired Mr. Perillo, whose untutored voice has for years sung both the glory that was Rome and the glories of trying to recapture some of it on a Perillo tour.
 
A Process of Elimination
 Under ordinary circumstances, Pan Am's loss of Perillo, which had flown Pan Am exclusively to Italy since 1974, would have been a major blow. "They have consistently been our single biggest customer," said Jeff Kriendler, a Pan Am vice president.
But the financially strapped carrier recently sold the routes to Delta Air Lines.
So why did Perillo not simply transfer to Delta, which on Friday will take over Pan Am's routes to Italy? Frances Conner, Delta's general manager of public relations, said that instead of the 747's that Pan Am flew each day from New York to Rome and Milan, Delta -- which does not own 747's -- will fly the much smaller Airbus 310's to Italy.
Mr. Perillo said the impending switch to smaller airplanes is a main reason he chose Alitalia. (Perillo Tours will still fly Delta to Honolulu and Nassau, and it will use Pan Am to take cruise-ship passengers from New York to Miami). "Delta is a fine airline, but they told us they did not have sufficient capacity for us," he said.
Of the other United States carriers that fly nonstop to Italy, American Airlines flies only from Chicago. And for some reason, Mr. Perillo said, talks with T.W.A. simply never got very far.
 
'A Natural Marriage'
 That left Alitalia. The carrier flies daily nonstops to Rome and Milan from New York -- Perillo's most important gateway -- as well as less frequent nonstops from Miami, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles,
"It is a natural marriage," said Orazio Corallo, Alitalia's general manager for the United States and Mexico. "Perillo is the No. 1 tour operator to Italy, and we carry the most passengers from the U.S. to Italy." Both parties expect to expand Perillo tours to Naples, Venice and Palermo. And both have visions of those glory days a dozen years ago when Perillo Tours carried as many as 45,000 tourists a year to Italy.
But that was before terrorist attacks, war, a weak dollar and recession all played havoc with international tourism. "In the mid-80's there was shooting at the Rome airport, and nobody wanted to go to Italy," Mr. Perillo said.
This year, when the Persian Gulf war crippled international travel for more than three months, only about 15,000 tourists will visit Italy with Perillo, while another 20,000 will travel with Perillo to Hawaii and the Caribbean.
 
To Hawaii by Default
 At first, Hawaii and the Caribbean were merely fallbacks for Perillo Tours. "When nobody wanted to go to Italy in the mid-80's," Mr. Perillo said, "we had to do something. So in 100 days we sold 10,000 people on going to the Bahamas with us."
That was possible only with the support of travel agents, who, for the standard 10 percent commission, generate 95 percent of Perillo's business.
Mr. Perillo, a lawyer by training, worked alongside his father, Joseph, in the family's modest storefront travel agency until 1965, when he took over the business upon his father's retirement. Twenty-six years later, a third generation of Perillos is waiting in the wings -- his daughter, Linda, who isthe liason with the travel agencies and coordinates Perillo's representation at trade shows, and his son, Stephen, whom Mr. Perillo describes as "second in command."
But Mr. Perillo, who moved the company in 1986 from New York to Woodcliff Lake, N.J., is not ready to retire, nor has he ruled out packaging tours to other destinations -- if he is convinced they will produce at least 5,000 customers a year.
But his heart and his agency's future are inextricably linked to that boot-shaped peninsular nation between the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. "Italy," he said, "is our Verdi and our soul."

Xerox Net Dropped 9% In Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 28

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said today that third-quarter earnings fell 9 percent, with slow copier sales offsetting a slight gain in its financial-services division.
The company said net profit in the quarter ended Sept. 30 came to $121 million, or $1.06 a share, down from $132 million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 2.3 percent, to $4.3 billion from $4.4 billion. 
 Last year's third-quarter results included a $9 million gain from the sale of real estate and third-party financing operations. Excluding last year's one-time gain, earnings from continuing operations dropped 2 percent, the company said.
 
Jump in Service Income
 Third-quarter income from the document-processing business fell 11 percent, to $117 million, but earnings from insurance and other financial-services businesses jumped 59 percent, to $51 million.
Stuart B. Ross, executive vice president and chairman of Xerox Financial Services, said the improvement was primarily from capital gains, although slightly higher investment income helped offset poor property and casualty underwriting results.
Mr. Ross also said the Xerox Credit Corporation sold $600 million in assets during the third quarter to help reduce debt.
 
Further Decline Seen
 Paul A. Allaire, chairman and chief executive, said the company expected profits from document processing to continue to fall in the fourth quarter.
"Lower-end, less-expensive copiers and printers continued to show strong growth worldwide in both the latest quarter and year-to-date," Mr. Allaire said. "However, United States sales of higher-end equipment, which require greater customer investment and have a longer selling cycle, continue to be hurt by the current state of the U.S. economy."
Xerox shares closed at $61.625, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
