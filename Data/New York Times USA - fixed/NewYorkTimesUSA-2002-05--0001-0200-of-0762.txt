HEADLINE: To Close the Income Gap 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 An April 24 news article notes that growth in income inequality over the last several decades was particularly pronounced in New York State. 
 The 1990's were a boom time for the state on average, but the prosperity was not broadly shared, and New York's income gaps continued to grow. 
These findings should serve as a wake-up call for New York policy makers. Religious, labor, civic, government and business leaders should convene a series of summit meetings to address both the causes and the consequences of this situation and to develop a strategic plan for reducing child poverty, increasing job opportunities and ensuring that the incomes of working families do not continue to deteriorate.

HEADLINE: Japan's Central Bank Paints A Brighter Economic Picture 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 30 

 BODY:
Mirroring the growing view that Japan will emerge from recession later this year, the Bank of Japan upgraded its economic forecasts today in one of its twice-yearly reviews. But it gave no sign of abandoning its ultraloose monetary policy, with short-term interest rates effectively at zero.
 The central bank said today that it now expected Japan's $4.1 trillion economy, the second-largest after the United States, to contract by about 0.5 percent in the fiscal year that began April 1. It had previously predicted a 1 percent contraction. 
 The bank also saw chinks of light in the heavy overcast of deflation, which has plagued the country and undermined revival efforts in recent years. The bank's policy board said that even though wholesale and consumer prices would fall this year, they would do so more gradually. 
The policy board, which left monetary policy unchanged at its meeting today, said that Japanese exports and industrial production were picking up, and with them the outlook for corporate profits. But growing competition and the costs of writing off bad loans will continue to depress job creation, wages and prices, limiting consumer spending and any chance for a full-blown recovery.
Japan's economy is expected to stop deteriorating toward the latter half of the fiscal year and turn upward again, though it is not likely to gain much upward momentum, the bank said.
Delays in disposing of nonperforming loans will hamstring the economy, the central bank said. The country's commercial banks have been curtailing their lending despite vanishingly low interest rates because they are reluctant to take on new risks. This caution has stunted investment and growth, the bank said.
Still, with the economy now out of any immediate danger of collapse -- and with a few private economists even predicting modest growth this year -- the bank is unlikely to repeat its performance of the last year, when it eased monetary policy, one way or another, seven times. The central bank is more likely to take small incremental steps, like increasing the amount of money it leaves in the markets overnight, rather than turning to unconventional measures like huge purchases of foreign bonds, analysts said.
"Because of the cyclical recovery," said Mikihiro Matsuoka, an economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo, "the bank can make some excuse of not loosening policy like in the past." 
Signs of that recovery, driven largely by increasing demand overseas, were visible on Monday, when the government reported a 0.5 percent month-to-month gain in industrial output in March. Output also rose 1.2 percent in February. The economy had not posted consecutive monthly gains in almost two years.
But new statistics today showed that domestic demand remained anemic. Construction orders for March were 12.9 percent lower than in March 2001, and housing starts fell 6.3 percent from a year ago. And crude oil imports -- Japan must import nearly all of its energy -- were down 6.4 percent from a year before.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Downtown Dallas Project Mired in Disputes

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Thomas O. Hicks fiddles with a gold ring with a big star on it, smiling only when he can change the subject from the controversies over the proposed 20-acre development next to the arena used by one of the sports franchises he owns to the fortunes of the teams themselves.
 The Stars of hockey missed the playoffs for the first time in six seasons, and the Rangers have no pitching to speak of, but he would rather talk about them than about his development's critics in the Dallas City Council. 
 Mr. Hicks is a partner in a plan to develop a timeworn swath of land into an architecturally distinguished combination of upscale shops, office buildings and hotels between the new arena where his Stars play and the heart of downtown Dallas. The proposal is called Victory, but Mr. Hicks, a partner in the leveraged buyout firm of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, says he is losing his taste for the fight. To try to sink financing plans crucial to the mixed-use project, he says, the Victory development's opponents are using arguments that failed in a 1998 referendum that provided financing for the arena. 
"It's silly," he said. "You've got a $600 million development fully funded in a recession. We've got political opportunists trying to refight the 1998 election. It's over. We won."
Some opponents of his project are politicians, but others are fellow developers, property owners just across the highway in the central business district. The 1998 election he spoke of was a bond referendum in which the city took on $125 million in debt to finance the sports arena proposed by Mr. Hicks and by his partner in both the arena and the Victory project, H. Ross Perot Jr. Since then, the city has authorized other spending for the area around the Victory project, and critics of Mr. Hicks and his partners argue that the shovels should be in the ground.
"How much is enough?" asked Laura Miller, the new mayor of Dallas, in an interview at City Hall. "Is $167 million in taxes enough for the developer to go out and develop now? Baby needs to walk now."
The story of Victory begins, or rather picks up, after Dallas voters narrowly approved the bond sale to help finance the American Airlines Center as the new home for the hockey Stars and for the basketball Mavericks, which Mr. Perot owned at the time. To repay the debt, the city raised rental car and hotel taxes. 
That done, the city created a tax- increment-financing district to pay for roads and plazas around the new arena. The developers were to spend $24.9 million, and they were to be reimbursed, plus interest of about 6 percent compounded semiannually, from new city property tax revenues created by the escalating value of the land. So far, the property value has risen 135 percent, and by May 15 the city will have collected about $575,000 in new tax revenue to pay the developers.
The agreement also called for mixed-use development nearby, but it was not specific.
Mr. Perot, the son of the computing pioneer and former presidential candidate, then made a $155 million profit by selling the basketball team to the Internet entrepreneur Mark Cuban. But Mr. Perot had bigger plans. He was buying up the land between the arena and the central business district, where he spent about $12 million stripping out oil and carcinogenic ash. He won an award from the Environmental Protection Agency.
"We picked that area north of the West End because it was the last blighted area," Mr. Perot said in a telephone interview. "It was an area where you could have a big impact."
By 1999, Mr. Perot and some minority partners owned 60 acres, and they sold 43 percent of that to Mr. Hicks for about $30 million. They brought in the Palladium Company, a developer known for the 72-acre mixed-use complex called CityPlace in West Palm Beach, as well as for its partnership with Apollo Real Estate Advisers and the Related Companies in building the AOL Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle in Manhattan.
Mr. Hicks and Mr. Perot and their partners secured more than $100 million in equity financing from California Urban Investment Partners, a joint venture between MacFarlane Partners and the California Public Employees Retirement System.
And they asked the city to sell new bonds worth $83 million, creating debt service payments of about $175 million over 30 years. In return, the city would get an urban oasis that the partners likened to Rockefeller Center, built with the public funds and with $550 million in private money. The stroll from the American Airlines Center to the central business district would be a tree-lined affair, spotted with gathering spaces and lined with 500,000 square feet of retail space, a 40-story office tower, two hotels and hundreds of apartments.
There was an outcry. Downtown property owners with their own proposals for revitalization, including the Trammel Crow Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities, wrote to urge the City Council not to adopt the plan. 
So the land adjacent to American Airlines Center sits there, host to a half-demolished power plant and a small Victory marketing office. Palladium has presented a new plan, for $31 million to $33 million in bond financing. It has said it will pay for the streets upfront, and it has given up all manner of earlier financing proposals, including expanding the tax-increment-financing district and extending its life.
Mr. Hicks has announced that he will sell his stake in the project if doing so would clear the political opposition, but he quickly conceded in an interview that this proposal was, itself, little more than an attempt "to frame public debate about the issues." There is, after all, little reason for anyone to buy the land unless approval of the development project is assured.
Under the new proposal, Mr. Hicks and Mr. Perot would still sell their property to Palladium, retaining small equity stakes in the development. Mr. Perot said he would take a loss on the land. They would still own the 40 acres between the edge of the proposed development and downtown, inside the financing district where land values would be expected to rise markedly. The city has commissioned more studies and scheduled more public hearings.
"The issue is not whether you're for it or against it, it's how will it be funded," said Steven D. Wolens, who is involved in the Victory proposal every way but directly. Mr. Wolens is a Democratic state representative whose district includes part of downtown Dallas. He also sponsored the state legislation allowing cities to create tax-increment-financing districts. And he is married to the mayor.
So far, Dallas has embraced the notion that financing downtown development will increase property values, attract new business and increase tax revenue all over town. But the city benefited greatly from the 10-year national economic expansion, and office vacancy rates downtown never dropped below 20 percent.
Part of the controversy surrounding the Victory proposal is about the use of tax increment financing to promote the development of downtown.
With the Victory proposal, "we're rearranging economic activity within the metropolitan area," said Lori L. Taylor, a senior economic policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "If you're looking at the broader metro area, it's a bit of robbing Peter to pay Paul."
Beyond the competing development proposals, Mayor Miller's own plans indicate a broader shift for the city's financial priorities. The city has already identified $1 billion or more in roadway improvements it wants to make, and has scheduled a $200 million bond referendum based on a conservative estimate that includes not raising taxes. It has pledged to raise the pay of all public safety workers, not just the police.
"In terms of maintaining the city's triple-A rating, we want to see those kinds of projects addressed," said Alex Fraser, a municipal bond analyst for Standard & Poor's. "That's really more important than the Victory development. If anything, that project could provide some interference."
Mr. Perot remains energized.
"These things are always a challenge," he said. "But the City Council understands the challenge."

PERSON: Dr. Gordon Randolph Willey 

HEADLINE: Gordon R. Willey, 89, Archaeologist Who Broadened Studies 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Gordon Randolph Willey, a Harvard archaeologist who broadened the study of vanished societies from the examination of the tombs of the elite to include the economic and social lives of ordinary people, died on Sunday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 89. 
 A prolific scholar of pre-Columbian America, Dr. Willey pioneered what is known as settlement pattern studies, an approach he applied methodically in the Viru Valley on the northern coast of Peru in the 1940's. 
 He investigated the artifacts of households and public works to open a new window on a society of long ago. The remains of its ancient settlements, he found, reflected their inhabitants' use of their environment and their relations with their neighbors.
That, in turn, permitted the anthropologists of today to reconstruct the economic, political and social organization of ancient peoples.
Dr. Willey, who was at Harvard for 36 years, distinguished himself with meticulously documented research at Maya archaeological sites in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. He made substantive and theoretical contributions to the archaeology of the Americas and to comparative studies with the old civilizations of other continents.
Before setting his sights on the Viru Valley, he reported important findings about the history of the Southeastern United States, using innovative methods to analyze pottery and reconstruct ancient cultures.
Born in Chariton, Iowa, Gordon Willey graduated in 1935 from the University of Arizona and was selected for Phi Beta Kappa. He received a master's from Arizona the next year and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1942. 
Early in his career he worked for the Smithsonian.
His book "Archeology of the Florida Gulf Coast" (1949), became an instant classic and remains in the backpacks of archaeologists working there. A reprint edition is now available.
More than a dozen of Dr. Willey's books and monographs are still in print. Their topics include excavations at Seibal, Guatemala; the archaeology of Southern Mesoamerica; and the early classic period in the Maya Lowlands.
With Jeremy A. Sabloff he wrote "A History of American Archeology," which scholars consider a major work in the field, defending his settlement pattern approach to excavations. Its third edition was issued in 1993 and remains in print. Some of his writing was devoted to archaeological mystery novels, the first of which, "Selena," was republished by Harlequin Books in 1995.
Dr. Willey was named Harvard's first Charles P. Bowditch professor of Central American and Mexican archaeology in 1950. He served as department chairman later in the 1950's, became Bowditch professor emeritus in 1984 but continued as a senior professor of anthropology until 1987.
He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, and he was a past president of the American Archaeological Society.
Dr. Willey is survived by two daughters, Alexandra Gurelnick and Winston Adler, and five grandchildren. His wife, Katharine Whaley Willey, died last year after 63 years of marriage.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Slipped During April 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell during April, a private research group reported today, as higher energy prices and a declining stock market tempered optimism about economic growth.
 The Conference Board's gauge of sentiment dropped to 108.8 this month from 110.7 in March. 
The drop was less than expected. 
 Manufacturing in the Chicago region grew in April for a third consecutive month, according to a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago. While the group's factory index dropped to 54.7 from 55.7, any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The regional report supports economists' expectations that a survey Wednesday will show that manufacturing expanded nationwide in April for a third month.
While the confidence index fell this month, it has rebounded since late last year, when the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 brought the economy to a standstill. The outlook for six months from now remained at a level seen before the recession. And optimism about job prospects increased.

HEADLINE: Faraway School Close to Mount Vernon Woman 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: CHESTER, S.C. 

 BODY:
Vivian Ayers lives in Mount Vernon, N.Y., but closest to her heart is a boarding school nearly 700 miles away, here in South Carolina. 
 The Brainerd Institute, which opened in 1866 for the children of freed slaves, was the only high school for black students in Chester County, South Carolina, well into the 1920's. Ms. Ayers, who grew up in a house across the street from the school, was a member of its last graduating class. The school closed in 1939 as local government began providing more high schools for black students. 
 All that remains of the institute is a boarded-up brick building, once a dormitory known as Kumler Hall. But Ms. Ayers has been working for three years to restore the building, not only to preserve the history of a school that helped shape her but also to commemorate the long struggle of black Americans to provide their children with a good education. She and other supporters of the preservation effort are mindful that the school was a consequence of segregation, but they say the institute needs to be remembered because it rose above the mediocrity of many schools to produce doctors, ministers and schoolteachers. 
Ms. Ayers wants to establish a research and tourist center that would study and memorialize those achievements. She cites Stratford-upon-Avon as her model: an economic engine fueled by concentration on all things Shakespeare. "Brainerd can do even more if we can regenerate it," she said. 
Ms. Ayers, a stylish woman with a lively laugh, is in a distinctive position to make the project happen. She has enlisted her daughters, the actress Phylicia Rashad and the choreographer and director Debbie Allen, as well as architects, builders and the Chester Historical Society in the mission Ms. Ayers says she was born to lead. When it seemed a developer might build apartments on the school's land in 1998, Ms. Rashad -- who played Clair Huxtable, lawyer, to Bill Cosby's Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable on the landmark television show -- bought the 12-acre property for $115,000 and turned it over to her mother. "She wrote a check, just like that, and solved the crisis," Ms. Ayers said. 
Ms. Rashad, along with her sister, Ms. Allen, had performed in Chester in an earlier effort to raise money to restore Kumler Hall. Ms. Rashad bought the school property, she said, "because my mother wanted me to." 
"When you think of the things you could give a person, most of those would not mean much to her," Ms. Rashad said. "But this meant everything to her." 
For the first two years of Brainerd's existence -- part of the post-Civil War Freedmen's Bureau -- two women, E. E. Richmond from New York and Carolyn I. Kent from New Jersey, ran the school. In 1869 the school was taken over by the Presbyterian Church. 
Until 1928 the school's leadership was white but black teachers and administrators were the norm after that. J. D. Martin, the first black president of the school, had been born into slavery. Though the school began in a log cabin, as was typical of most schools in the region, Brainerd grew rapidly into a campus of several buildings and 400 students during its heyday in the 1920's. There were tennis and basketball courts as well as a girls' dormitory housed in a pre-Civil War mansion. The school became known for its standards and curriculum, which included Latin and other languages as well as music. 
"We were taxed academically and kept busy with extracurricular activities around the clock," Ms. Ayers said. "We recited 'Thanatopsis' and all of the catechism in the seventh grade, and we learned Milton. When I had children and looked for a school like Brainerd, I couldn't find one. There has never been another one like it." 
Tuition was $5 a month in Ms. Ayers's school days, and farm families who could not pay money, paid with produce to feed the student boarders. Ms. Ayers recalls the music teacher who nurtured her talent for the piano, as well as happy days spent learning Shakespeare and Irish songs that were the heritage of the white teachers. "Black militants today would be horrified," she said, "by what they would call a Eurocentric curriculum." 
Brainerd students, she added, were sheltered from racism by the school's family-like atmosphere. 
"It was like being in a capsule," she said. "There was no opportunity for negative experiences. The whites who came to sing, teach and pray were more than polite. I grew up without racial incidents." 
"We have to memorialize those whites," said Ms. Ayers who founded the Adept New American Museum in Mount Vernon, which is devoted to the achievements of black artists. "They taught you everything they knew and demanded that you learn it." 
Ms. Ayers's sister, Sarah Mildred Ayers Smith, who was valedictorian of the class of 1937 and retired in 1981 as chairwoman of the high school science department in Statesboro, Ga., said she could not recall being disciplined by her teachers, except by being made to memorize an extra chapter of catechism. But the school's expectations extended to social as well as academic life, she said. "Boys and girls had classes together, but there were no junior or senior proms, no dances. Instead there were banquets, with grand marches afterward. We would wait for the grand march so we could hold hands." 
Ms. Ayers, her sister and four other graduates, including a 95-year-old member of the class of 1925, were among 70 people, black and white, who gathered here recently for the dedication of the Brainerd Memorial Project. Guests from as far away as Los Angeles sipped iced tea in the warm sunshine outside Kumler Hall -- which had been stripped of an overgrowth of vines for the occasion -- and reminisced about a place they took for granted as children but have cherished ever since. 
They recalled the maple trees that turned majestic in the fall, the rows of pecan trees that lined a now-vanished walkway and the playing fields where Sara Brown Cordery, class of 1939, excelled in basketball and track. "No one could catch her," Ms. Ayers said, smiling at her classmate. "She could steal your boyfriends, too." 
They also recalled how Brainerd families sold chickens and eggs to help save the school, and the feeling, after it closed, that someone had died. 
After visiting the school, the reunion group gathered for speeches and a musical service in nearby Carmel Presbyterian Church, where generations of the Ayers family had held weddings, baptisms and funerals, and where a stained-glass window bore the family name. "I used to sit in these pews and misbehave terribly," said Ms. Rashad, who also lives in Mount Vernon and who visited Chester as a child. 
Guests held fans carrying the likeness of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as Ms. Ayers introduced the speakers. 
Robert Bainbridge, an architect in South Carolina, said restoring Kumler Hall, would cost $2 million to $3 million but would preserve the story of a people. 
"Many African-American schools have been neglected, and we're losing those stories," he said.

Diversity Comes to a Place With a Retail Pedigree

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding has agreed to lease 270,000 square feet at 100 West 33rd Street, completing the conversion of the century-old building from an unsuccessful vertical mall to one that will have a mix of office, retail and showroom tenants.
 "It will be three buildings," said Mark A. Teitelbaum, a principal in Argent Ventures, which owns the building, between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, near Herald Square. The building once housed Gimbels, then Abraham & Straus and then Stern's department store and along the way became known as the Manhattan Mall. 
 The top four floors of the 11-story building will continue to be occupied by showrooms for children's apparel, Mr. Teitelbaum said. The lowest two floors and two levels below ground will house retail space. The floors in between will be converted to offices for Foote, Cone & Belding and for Bank of America, which earlier this year leased 180,000 square feet for operations displaced from the World Trade Center and to consolidate from other sites. 
Having the three categories of tenants is attractive from a landlord's point of view, said Andrew S. Penson, another official of Argent. "We are diversified on cash flow and risk," he said.
Mitchell S. Steir, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage firm that represented Argent, said: "This is the repositioning of a major asset. The goal was to do one or two transactions to lease up the office space for a long term and to do it quickly."
He said the large 90,000-square-foot floors available in the building were attractive to office tenants even in a market in which the demand for offices has been soft because of a slack economy. Large floors, he said, permit the efficient placement of people, with proportionately less space lost to elevators and stairwells than in buildings with smaller floors.
The building, which was completed at the turn of the last century, underwent a gut rehabilitation in 1989 at a cost of more than $400 million, Mr. Teitelbaum said. The building became a vertical shopping mall anchored at first by Abraham & Straus and later by Stern's. The stores, perched on top of a confluence of subway lines and the PATH tubes, did well, but not well enough to support the debt incurred in the rehabilitation, Mr. Teitelbaum said.
Customers complained that the escalators linking the floors were poorly positioned, forcing them to make long detours to move between floors. Nevertheless, lunchtime crowds flocked to a food court that was on the seventh floor, Mr. Teitelbaum said, producing sales of $25 million annually. The food court will be moved to the second level below ground, where stores will be accessible to subway and PATH riders as well as workers from area buildings.
Although the location did not draw enough shoppers, the transportation links were essential for the office tenants, said I. Keith Ellis, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, a brokerage company that represented Foote, Cone & Belding. He said the ad agency, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies that has its flagship offices at 150 East 42nd Street, wanted a good location and a place that suggested creativity, in a building with floors big enough that units of the agency could be grouped together rather than spread among many floors.
He said the building, with a glass-enclosed interior atrium and views of a refurbished park on Greeley Square, fit those requirements. "Creativity is their product, and they wanted space that would energize their staff," Mr. Ellis said. "The atrium will bring light into two-acre floorplates that otherwise would be pretty dark."
The space has been vacant about a year and will now be completely reconstructed, delaying the agency's move until the second quarter of next year. But with a 20-year lease, the agency wants to take care in designing and building space it will be occupying a long time, Mr. Ellis said.
The main lobby on 33rd Street will be enlarged into space once occupied by Stern's and will have displays promoting the presence of the advertising agency. 
Executives involved in the transaction declined to give the rents involved. Asking rents for older buildings in that part of Manhattan have averaged in the low $40's per square foot annually, according to information published by the CoStar Group, a real estate reporting company.
Real estate executives said the advertising agency's decision to lease the space was important because it was not driven by an event, like the effects of Sept. 11 or the imminent expiration of a lease.
"This is a discretionary transaction, which is something the market has not seen in recent months," Mr. Steir said. "I think it says to the real estate community and the city that business is becoming stronger."

HEADLINE: China's Communists Try to Decide What They Stand For 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 28 

 BODY:
Over dinner at a crowded restaurant in central Beijing, a longstanding Communist Party member who works for the government spoke words that would have been unfit for public consumption just a few years ago.
 "What does the Communist Party stand for now?" he asked matter-of-factly. "Nothing. Stability maybe. But really no ideals at all." 
 Responding to a mounting identity crisis that has swept through its ranks in the last few years, China's ruling Communist Party has started searching aggressively for a new set of principles and policies to define its future, reforms intended to ensure its relevance and survival in this increasingly market-oriented, pluralistic society. 
Beginning last year, once closed party institutes have invited a large number of foreign political scientists, including harsh critics of the current government, to lecture and give their advice on China's future. 
Researchers have been sent to Europe and elsewhere to study social democratic parties and to see how former Communist parties weathered transitions to democracy.
Official party publications are sprinkled with calls for political reform, though they are still mostly muted. At some meetings, retired party members have wondered aloud why elections, now common in rural villages, are not being extended to higher levels.
Experts in and outside China say this is the first time they have seen such serious, widespread discussion in the party about the need to make changes in the political system.
In practice there is little these days that is Communist about China, a country where laid-off workers hunt for jobs, yuppies buy stocks and houses and, since last year, private businessmen have been recruited as party members.
Reform that would include direct challenges to the party's rule is not on the table. It is unclear where all the reformist churning will lead, especially since the primary motivation is self-preservation rather than any faith in the inherent good of ideals like democracy or judicial independence.
This fall Hu Jintao, China's vice president, who is now on his first visit to the United States, will take the helm of the Chinese Communist Party, still the world's largest by far.
 In Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Hu met with Congressional leaders and dined with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
The party he will inherit is is scrambling to find new relevance and new tools for governing into the future.
"There has been a lot more discussion of reform in the last two years," said one senior professor at the Central Party School, which trains mid- to high-level party members. "Previously there was little thought given to how to consolidate the party's ruling status or to promote its long-term rule. We never thought it was in question."
The need for reform is now "pretty much a universal sentiment," said Chi Fulin, president of the China Institute for Reform and Development in Hainan Province, a research group. He cautioned that proposals were still vague and members "are still reluctant to deal with specifics."
Current reformist impulses have their roots in speeches by President Jiang Zemin last year in which he warned that the party had to "stay in step with the times," and also his campaign for what he called the "Three Represents."
The basic message of that campaign, now trumpeted in slogans throughout the country, was that the Communist Party should no longer just represent workers but should represent "advanced productive forces, advanced Chinese culture and the fundamental interests of the majority." That is, the party can be all things to all people, promoting the interests not just of workers and farmers but of wealthy entrepreneurs as well.
Already within China, those words have helped broaden the limits of political discussion, emboldening liberals to put forward ideas that previously would not have been spoken aloud, since they would almost certainly have led to serious political trouble.
In a recent class for officials at the Central Party School, which is headed by Vice President Hu, one professor openly ridiculed the Central Committee's powerful propaganda department, which controls all Chinese media, as outdated and too conservative. He was criticized by school authorities but kept his job.
Cao Siyuan, a leading Beijing businessman, who used to keep his opinions to himself, has recently weighed in with lectures and essays proposing political reforms. He recommends that the party be renamed the China Socialist Party and suggests that members of party committees be selected in open elections.
"In China we're talking about industrial reforms, agricultural reforms, educational reforms, so it makes sense that the party needs reform too," Mr. Cao said in an interview. "We have to open the debate about how to reform politics and the party, although of course no domestic media dare raise this issue."
Although loyalty to the Communist Party and its ideals has been slipping for years now, members point to a series of recent events that have finally galvanized its leaders to action and opened the door to change.
A spate of increasingly high-level corruption cases has highlighted the shortcomings of a system in which Communist officials are subjected to few checks and balances.
Also, China's long-awaited entry into the World Trade Organization late last year has put intense pressure on the government to speed up economic and legal reforms so it can stay competitive -- reforms whose pace has been slowed by the stagnant political system. 
China's courts and banks are still primarily beholden to the party, for example, making it hard for them to respond to market needs.
"Unless the government effectively reforms itself, things like the reform of state-owned enterprises and attempts to end corruption are bound to fail," said Mr. Chi of the research institute, who favors greater judicial independence and more democratic methods for selecting officials.
These factors, combined with the end of welfare benefits like housing and health care, have left even many loyalists with attenuated allegiance to the party. Though membership continues to grow, many people are joining or retaining their membership mainly for its practical benefits.
"There is almost no one now who believes in the party for its ideals," said a high-level editor and party member. He added that these days most of the party's support derives from the pragmatic view that it is probably the only organization capable of holding this vast, complex country together, largely because no other political groups are allowed.
"If I walked into my former office and started praising the party, people would look at me like some weirdo," he said.
Suisheng Zhao, a Chinese-born political scientist at the University of Denver, said that in recent visits to government institutes in Beijing he had encountered a new breed of party members who were interested in change, often Western-educated and with little interest in Marxist theory.
For many people, "the collapse of ideology is complete," Professor Zhao said. "They have no use for the ideas of the founding fathers. They are clearly hungry for new ideas."
One idea is the promotion of greater accountability. Some cities, like Nanjing, are asking thousands of citizens to complete evaluations of government offices and officials. Those who score poorly may be dismissed.
The party is also experimenting with new programs concerning what it calls "inner party democracy." A certain number of seats on the nationwide Central Committee that were once appointive are now filled in secret balloting by provincial party officials, an effort to stem patronage. In February a reformist former head of the Party School, Zheng Bijian, traveled to Britain to meet with leaders of the Labor Party. This month the school was host to a lecture by Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a critic of authoritarian governments who studies how nations develop democracy.
By Western standards the changes may seem minor, but they are large and significant for China.
Some of the reforms under discussion were raised in the late 1980's, only to be set aside after the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. 
During that brief period, when liberals within the party held sway, political leaders were pushing reforms on a still thoroughly Communist society. Now the Communist Party is playing catch-up with a radically changed populace.
"The Communist Party is trying very hard to recast themselves," said a Western diplomat who has been involved in planning party study trips to Europe. "They are absolutely obsessed with finding a new way -- although there is always the caveat that they stay in power."

Yao Turns Heads Of Fans and Scouts

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 30 

 BODY:
Chad Reeser sneaked around his school like a member of the paparazzi, hiding out in vacant stairwells, peering through the small square glass of the gymnasium door. Reeser, a 20-year-old student at Moody Bible Institute, was like the rest of the curiosity seekers who lined the corridors of this downtown private college. On the day of Yao Ming's first audition with the N.B.A., Reeser wanted to catch of glimpse of the 7-foot-5 center from China.
 "I just want to see if he can dunk the ball without jumping," Reeser said. "He is so big. Not just his height; his calves are big. He's huge." 
 Earlier, hotel maids clamored for space in the lobby as he left for his clandestine workout with the Knicks this afternoon, walking beside him with mouths agape.
Yao had to duck in the elevator and contort himself into the passenger seat of a Lincoln Navigator.
He does not plan to speak with reporters during his workouts here, a trip set up to ensure Yao is considered among the first three selections in the June draft. But his size and skill have already spoken for him.
"We felt fortunate that we were able to spend time with him," Scott Layden, the Knicks' president and general manager, said after a brief 25-minute workout and an extended conversation with Yao through an interpreter. "I think Yao Ming has special potential. He really does. He is highly skilled and he's a guy that I think will work and improve. I think he'll be great for the league."
The Knicks are one of only two teams to be granted a private workout, along with the Chicago Bulls -- who are expected to conduct a workout with Yao on Thursday. Yao will have a 45-minute workout on Wednesday at Loyola University with 25 other teams. Jeff Van Gundy, the former Knicks coach, was going to be in charge of the workout but the Knicks, who still hold Van Gundy's contractual rights, protested Van Gundy being a part of a showcase for the rest of the N.B.A. P. J. Carlesimo will replace Van Gundy, and Yao will work out with Oregon's Chris Christoffersen.
Yao traveled from Shanghai with Li Yao Min, the general manager of the Shanghai Sharks, and Ye Li, a translator who works for the team's television station. He was met here by Eric Zhang, a distant cousin of Yao's who is his representative.
Li said not too much should be made of Yao granting the Knicks a private workout, given that the team has only a 4.4 percent chance of winning the draft lottery. "Yao Ming doesn't belong to any team," Li said. "He belongs to the world."
One of Yao's interpreters maintained that he has no distinct preference where he wants to play, saying, "Yao thinks the N.B.A. picks me, I don't pick them." But, the interpreter said, he would feel more comfortable in a major metropolitan area with Chinese influences than somewhere completely foreign to his homeland.
None of Yao's entourage seemed to think either economics or politics would hold Yao back from joining the league this season.
He is free to join any team after Sept. 8, when the world basketball championships end in Indianapolis.
His first day in Chicago was filled with commitments. In the morning, Yao paid a visit to the Chinese consulate. In the early afternoon, he met with Bill Walton, the Hall of Fame center who told the 22-year-old Yao what to expect in the N.B.A. after presenting him with tie-dyed apparel promoting Walton's 30-day tour of the league.
"You look very young in your T-shirt," Yao told Walton, who laughed. 
Yao finally made his way to Moody, where his rolling hooks fell softly through the net.
The stride had more grace and elan to it than awkwardness. In a bit of a sneak preview, Yao gave the Knicks and their 12-member contingent a brief glimpse of his skill and talent prior to working out for nearly every N.B.A. team today. 
The scene was a sight to behold. Gym personnel cleared the premises of students. No one was allowed to witness the workout, unless you peered through a door in the back of the gym. 
Outside, a fleet of black town cars lined the back of the gymnasium, idling as if they were about to whisk some diplomat to the airport for a world-altering decision. Yao's arrival may not be that significant, but he has already swung the pendulum of the N.B.A. draft.
The Knicks were coy in their assessment, but clearly believed he had a chance to be a bona fide center in the league very soon. Yao's supporters were even more encouraging.
Waiting for their country's beloved basketball star to emerge from the gymnasium and pose with the Sears Tower in the background, Li spoke of potential.
"Yao will be better than Shaquille O'Neal, especially now in the free throw," he said, smiling. "If they bet steak for free throw, Shaquille O'Neal will invite Yao Ming every time."
The Knicks have scouted Yao three times, with Layden making two trips. They even flew out Coach Don Chaney and Allan Houston to meet with him.
Houston said he was impressed with Yao's skills. At one point, Houston encouraged Yao to take a 3-pointer. Yao shot back in Chinese, laughing. The interpreter told Houston, "He said Patrick Ewing doesn't take threes."
The N.B.A. is concerned whether the Chinese government and the many support systems in Yao's career would hamper his arrival. Already, Yao must give back a significant portion of his salary in accordance with rules governing athletes supported by the state system. 
People surrounding Yao today were hopeful that he would clear the hurdles to play next year in the N.B.A.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
After Only A Month, 4 Managers Are Gone

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Major league managers probably will not want to pick the numbers 6, 15, 22 and 23 for the next Big Game lottery. Those were the numbers that turned out to be unlucky for four members of their clan, Tony Muser of Kansas City becoming the fourth yesterday.
 The Royals ended the managers' Appalling April by firing Muser 23 games into their season. Previously, Phil Garner of Detroit went down after 6 games, Davey Lopes of Milwaukee after 15 and Buddy Bell of Colorado after 22. 
 Never before had four major league managers been fired in April, and that is not counting Joe Kerrigan, who was dismissed by Boston's new owners during spring training.
"There won't be any more in April," Bob Rosen of the Elias Sports Bureau said yesterday, before being reminded that at that moment, the month had 10 1/2 hours remaining in the Pacific time zone.
Elias and the Baseball Hall of Fame Library confirmed that the Royals' move with Muser set a record. Only once before, in 1892, had as many as three managers been fired in April.
The managerial massacre, however, may not be over. May Mayhem could be on the horizon. Buck Martinez of Toronto and Jerry Narron of Texas are in peril, and although it is less likely that the Chicago Cubs would dismiss Don Baylor and Philadelphia would replace Larry Bowa, those teams are none too happy about their first month.
Muser was in his sixth season with the Royals. Their .348 winning percentage (8-15) this season was their worst under him, but even their best, .475, represented a losing season, 77-85 in 2000. The latest deposed manager took his demise philosophically.
"Everybody understands the circumstances, the mood of our fans," Muser said in Detroit, where the Royals won their last game under him Monday night. "They need a change. It's just a part of this business. Managers are hired to be fired. I understand it, and life goes on. The most important thing is the success of the organization."
But the Royals and the other teams that fired their managers in April have played many seasons without success. The Royals, with a $47 million payroll, are the top-paying team among the nine teams with payrolls of less than $50 million, but unlike Oakland and Minnesota, two others in their economic neighborhood, they do not have pitching good enough to compete. The team's earned run average, 5.58 entering last night's game, was 13th in the American League.
The Royals' batting average was also 13th, they were 12th in runs scored and they were last in home runs. Last year, the Royals traded two of their best hitters, Johnny Damon and Jermaine Dye, rather than sign them to multiyear contracts before they could become free agents.
Unlike Oakland and Minnesota, the Royals are down in attendance this season, off 50,000 from April 2001. The Royals evidently hope a change in managers will serve as a spark to the team, which could then win some games and attract more fans to Kauffman Stadium.
John Mizerock, in his first year as the Royals' bullpen coach after managing in their minor league system for nine years, was named interim manager. General Manager Allard Baird said Mizerock, a former major league catcher, will be a candidate for the job on a more permanent basis. Obviously, managing jobs are anything but permanent.
"He has a history with a lot of the guys on the major league level and throughout our organization," Baird said, explaining his decision. "As an organization, we felt that we were not succeeding. It was the right time."
Teams have come a long way from the days when George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was ridiculed for firing Bob Lemon after 14 games (1982) and Yogi Berra after 16 games (1985). The increased cost of payrolls has made it mandatory for managers -- and general managers -- to win.
That kind of pressure was not present in 1892, but three National League managers were nevertheless fired in April. Washington dismissed Billy Barnie after two games, St. Louis dropped the playing manager Jack Glasscock after four games and Baltimore relieved the playing manager George Van Haltren of his managing duties after 11 games.

HEADLINE: The Fall of a Telecom Gunslinger 

 BODY:
The ultimate deal maker has been dealt away. Under pressure from his board of directors, Bernard Ebbers, perhaps the most celebrated telecom entrepreneur of the last quarter century, has resigned as chief executive of WorldCom, the beleaguered communications empire he stitched together with more than 75 acquisitions. The abrupt departure of Mr. Ebbers, first reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, provides a fitting exclamation mark to the meltdown of the nation's telecom sector, which has cost shareholders a staggering $2 trillion. 
 Though born in Canada, Mr. Ebbers is a quintessentially American maverick entrepreneur who thrived by upsetting the establishment. While managing motels in Mississippi in 1983, Mr. Ebbers saw an opportunity in Ma Bell's impending breakup and decided to start a company called LDDS, or Long Distance Discount Service. 
 Through a series of frantic deals that leveraged its ever-rising stock price, that company evolved into WorldCom, the leading carrier of Internet traffic and the nation's second-largest long-distance phone company. WorldCom embodies the excesses of the 1990's stock market bubble and the unfulfilled aspirations of telecommunications deregulation. 
Unlike other populist capitalists who have acquired near folk-hero status in corporate America -- think of Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines and Sam Walton -- Mr. Ebbers was more interested in doing deals than in ensuring that his company was well managed. WorldCom now faces a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practices. At issue is whether the company fudged the books on its dizzying array of mergers or engaged in revenue-swap deals with others to exaggerate its profits. The S.E.C. is also seeking information about $366 million in low-interest loans and loan guarantees the company extended to Mr. Ebbers, an egregious case of executive compensation abuse that shareholders rightly deplore.
WorldCom's larger problem is the weakness of its core businesses. Much of the telecom slump is due to the fact that too many people emulating WorldCom rushed out to build excess capacity. In the phone arena, MCI, a unit of WorldCom, has been punished along with AT&T and other long-distance players by plummeting rates and an inability to compete on a level playing field with the regional Baby Bells. Having sacked its founder, WorldCom's own day of reckoning may be drawing near.

HEADLINE: Andersen Trial in Phoenix Opens With Views on Fraud 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, April 30 

 BODY:
The trial of Arthur Andersen's second-largest financial problem -- its audits of a Baptist foundation that collapsed and led to criminal prosecutions -- began today with a plaintiffs' lawyer maintaining that Andersen had ignored warnings that the charity was a Ponzi scheme years before the foundation fell apart.
 "This is a case about the terrible things that can happen when auditors do not do what we pay them to do," said John P. Coffey, a partner with Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann who is the lead attorney for the Arizona Baptist Foundation bankruptcy liquidation trust. Andersen, he said, went "from being a negligent auditor to being complicit in the fraud." 
 The Baptist foundation had borrowed money from investors and used it to invest in real estate, promising that its profits would go to pay for Baptist charitable projects. When the Arizona real estate market declined, Mr. Coffey said, the foundation's management found ways to avoid that reality, largely by setting up shell corporations to buy real estate from the foundation at inflated prices, with the foundation lending the money for the purchases. 
When the foundation collapsed in 1999, it owed $570 million, mostly to elderly investors who had been attracted by high interest rates. William Crotts, the foundation's former chief executive, has pleaded not guilty to criminal fraud charges and has told lawyers that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying in the civil case.
Andersen's lead lawyer, Don Martin, told the jury today that Andersen was a victim of fraud. "It was a fraud," he said. "It misled investors. It defrauded its own auditor, Arthur Andersen." He said that by Dec. 5, 1996, "every member of the board" of the foundation knew of the fraud, as did lawyers and accountants who worked for the foundation. "They knew about the fraud, and they kept quiet," he said.
In an opening statement that never mentioned the Enron Corporation, Mr. Coffey nevertheless managed to invoke echoes of the charges of obstruction of justice that Andersen will face in a federal trial that begins next week in Houston.
He told of memorandums reflecting warnings the firm had received as early as 1997 about the Baptist foundation's financial statements. Those memos did not show up in Andersen files, but still came to light.
One memo, found in Baptist foundation files, reports that Andersen planned in 1998 to check the finances of one of the shell corporations. That memo did not show up in Andersen files, he said, and the inspection was never done, even after a series of articles in the Phoenix newspaper New Times, which was based on interviews with disgruntled former employees of the foundation.
Mr. Coffey said that even though the newspaper identified its sources by name, Andersen auditors did not bother to call any of them before reassuring state officials that there was no cause for concern about the foundation's finances.
Mr. Martin, the Andersen lawyer, said all the warnings referred to by Mr. Coffey came after the board already knew of the fraud. He said Andersen acted properly in considering them and should not be blamed for not uncovering the fraud.
Mr. Martin pointed out to the jury that the plaintiff in the case was the bankruptcy trustee now overseeing the Baptist foundation, not investors who were hurt. He suggested that it was unfair that Andersen is being sued by the successor to the party that committed the fraud. An investor class-action lawsuit has not yet come to trial, but if money is recovered in this suit it will probably go to the creditors of the foundation, including the defrauded investors.
The small Maricopa County Superior Court courtroom was packed, with a number of elderly people who were victims among the spectators who stood in the aisles. Judge Edward Berke warned the spectators not to say things like "amen" or "yes" in response to statements by lawyers or witnesses. "I empathize with you," he said to the spectators, noting that many had lost money, "but we are going to have a fair trial here."
One spectator, Betty Shoup, 77, a retired secretary who said she and her husband had lost $250,000, said she had thought her money was safe. "We knew they were not federally insured, but they always said, 'We are Godly insured,' " she said in a brief interview.
She said the Baptist Foundation had promised interest rates of up to 15 percent. "They had easy-access accounts, just like checking, but with pretty good interest," she said.
Andersen agreed to settle the case nearly two months ago with a payment of $217 million. But that deal fell apart after Andersen said its insurance company, which is owned by Andersen and its foreign affiliates, could not pay the money because Andersen had not paid up on its premiums. Since then Andersen's ability to pay has been further undermined by client defections.
The trial that began today is expected to last more than a month. For the plaintiffs, who lost hundreds of millions of dollars they invested with the Baptist foundation, there is substantial doubt that they will be able to collect much money even if they do obtain a large verdict. 
"We certainly hope so," Mr. Coffey, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said after being asked if Andersen would be able to pay. "I believe Andersen will do everything they can to survive." If necessary, he said, "we will fight in bankruptcy court."
Asked if Andersen would be in any position to pay when the trial ended, Mr. Martin, the lead attorney for Andersen, responded, "That's a good question." He said he read the newspapers every day looking for answers.
Andersen's official position is that it is trying to reorganize as a smaller company that will be virtually an audit-only firm, as recommended by a panel headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman. But none of the conditions Mr. Volcker viewed as necessary for that to happen have occurred, and few in the accounting industry think Andersen can survive.

HEADLINE: WORLDCOM LEADER DEPARTS COMPANY IN TURBULENT TIME 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Bernard J. Ebbers, who spent 19 years building WorldCom into one of the biggest long-distance companies and Internet carriers in the world, has resigned as chief executive, president and director, the company said yesterday.
 If any executive represented the entrepreneurial epoch that was supposed to make telecommunications cheaper and the choices abundant in an era of deregulation, it was Mr. Ebbers. It was he who exploited the deregulation of the telecommunications industry more than anyone else during the last two decades. With ruthless cost-cutting and fervent deal-making, he showed for years that it was possible to undercut AT&T in the long-distance market and still make a lot of money. 
 But Mr. Ebbers was brought down by wounds that, to some measure, were self-inflicted. He personally owes the company more than $366 million for loans and loan guarantees to cover his potential losses on his WorldCom stock as the share price plummeted. And the company, under his watch, became the subject of a wide-ranging and continuing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is scrutinizing WorldCom's accounting practices and financial relations with Mr. Ebbers. 
Yet Mr. Ebbers was also undone by industry and economic forces beyond any one executive's or company's control. Page C1. 
While consumers enjoyed the long-distance price wars, the service eventually became a commodity from which few carriers could squeeze a profit, especially as e-mail and cellphones siphoned off traffic. And the glut of network capacity that was built by start-up companies fueled by easy financing during the stock market boom only further depressed network pricing. 
Finally, as the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 made it harder for telecommunications companies to raise money and make deals like WorldCom's acquisition of MCI for $30 billion in 1998, the company's growth-by-acquisition engine ran out of gas. 
Mr. Ebbers's departure, which was decided over the weekend, was reported on Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.
"This is the collapse of the single-most-successful telecom growth company ever," said Scott Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a telecommunications and media consulting firm in Washington. "It was a momentum story that ran out of momentum. Bernie was a genius at acquiring customers and cutting costs. His genius was not in operating the companies he bought."
WorldCom says that it has enough cash to continue operating indefinitely, despite being staggered by $30 billion in debt and limping along with a share price of about $2.50 -- down 82 percent so far this year. Its bonds are trading at prices normally reserved for companies on the brink of bankruptcy. 
With dozens of other telecommunications upstarts now bankrupt, WorldCom's mounting problems make it increasingly likely that the dominant players in the telecommunications industry may be the remaining offspring of that old antediluvian Bell System: the local telephone giants like BellSouth, SBC Communications and Verizon.
Worldcom's tribulations may have little direct or lasting impact on consumers and business customers because there are many other providers of long-distance and Internet services. But the strong possibility that the Bell companies may step into the breach -- even now, the Bells are slowly being allowed into the long-distance business -- may reveal the limits of the two-decade-old vision that deregulation would give communications customers a broad range of choices among providers. 
And yet, analysts note that the two decades of competitive ferment that Mr. Ebbers helped symbolize have radically changed the communications landscape. With affordable long-distance calls, Internet e-mail, wireless communications, and cable television systems that can also carry telephone calls, consumer communications options now vastly exceed the possibilities of the old Bell System days -- when choice mainly meant picking the color of a phone. 
"I think that the Bells are dominant, but in a world that is far more volatile and far more competitive than it was before," said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission who is now an analyst for the investment firm Legg Mason. 
Mr. Levin cited an historical analogy: "In the mid-1800's, the country went berserk building railroads and a lot of investors lost a lot of money. But those railroads created the economic engine that fueled the country's growth through the next century. WorldCom and MCI largely inspired the same thing."
Mr. Ebbers, who was not available for comment yesterday, did not set out to make WorldCom an inspiration. At its inception it was, instead, little more than a gamble.
In 1983, just months before the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company broke up its Bell System to settle a federal antitrust suit, four men gathered in a Hattiesburg, Miss., coffee shop. They knew that the breakup of Ma Bell would open the door for widespread competition in the long-distance telephone market and they met to sketch out plans for a cut-rate telephone company that they called LDDS. They could hardly have expected that their company, renamed WorldCom, would show more than $35 billion in revenue by 2001.
One of those at the coffee shop was Mr. Ebbers, a former junior high school basketball coach from Edmonton, Alberta, who was then running a string of Mississippi motels.
LDDS stood for Long-Distance Discount Service, so naturally, the company's business plan was to undercut AT&T. In the early 1980's, AT&T and even some long-distance upstarts were starting to sell wholesale time on their networks to other companies, time that the smaller companies could resell on the retail market at a profit.
Because of all of the required regulatory approvals and the search for customers, LDDS did not actually get into business until January 1985. Just a few months later, Mr. Ebbers became the company's president.
"The only experience Bernie had before operating a long-distance company was he used the phone," Carl J. Aycock, an original LDDS investor and WorldCom board member, recalled in 1997.
But Mr. Ebbers produced results. From the beginning, the company was distinguished by its aggressive salesmanship, its ruthless cost-cutting and its passion for corporate acquisitions.
Mr. Ebbers's focus on costs earned him garlands from Wall Street, but also prompted whispered concerns that the company might have been too aggressive in its accounting. That may be one issue that the S.E.C. is looking into as it conducts its investigation. Some analysts say the company may have improperly masked operating losses as one-time charges, enhancing its financial operating results.
But despite its revenue growth and cost controls, WorldCom has been built mostly through dozens of acquisitions. In the 1980's, Mr. Ebbers snapped up rafts of other small long-distance companies, companies that appeared much like LDDS itself. After the company became publicly traded in 1989, the deal-making rose to a new level. 
In one of its early breakthrough deals, in 1992, LDDS mounted a $720 million acquisition of the Advanced Telecommunications Corporation. As would be Mr. Ebbers's habit, his company used its own stock as a currency in the transaction, which made LDDS the nation's fourth-biggest telecommunications company, after AT&T, MCI and Sprint.
Perhaps as important, however, that deal brought Mr. Ebbers into contact with Scott D. Sullivan, a young finance executive at Advanced Telecommunications. Mr. Sullivan, now 40, became WorldCom's chief financial officer in 1994 and was hailed by Wall Street analysts and happy WorldCom investors for much of the 1990's as one of the industry's financial wunderkinds.
In yesterday's announcement, WorldCom said that Mr. Sullivan would continue as chief financial officer and would also be promoted to executive vice president. He will report to John Sidgmore, the former vice chairman, who became president and chief executive on Sunday.
As a team, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Ebbers blazed through the 1990's with a series of bigger and bigger acquisitions. When WorldCom acquired MFS Communications, an up- and-coming local communications provider, the deal brought along Mr. Sidgmore, who had recently persuaded MFS to buy his Internet company, UUNet. 
WorldCom's acquisition binge culminated in the $30 billion acquisition of MCI in 1998. MCI's longtime leader, William McGowan -- the man who had helped force the breakup of AT&T -- had died, and the company was adrift, ripe for Mr. Ebbers's acquisitive taste. At the time of the deal, MCI was more than three times WorldCom's size. 
But Mr. Ebbers's deal-making would find its limit in 2000, when antitrust authorities in Europe and the United States shot down WorldCom's proposed acquisition of Sprint for $129 billion. After that, the acquisitions were less bold, like last year's deal to acquire Intermedia Communications and its Digex Web services subsidiary for $4.1 billion.
During the height of his wheeling and dealing, though, Mr. Ebbers made no secret of the fact that his intentions were purely financial, and that he was less concerned about the fundamentals of his business. 
"Our goal is not to capture market share or be global," he was famously quoted as saying by Business Week in 1997. "Our goal is to be the No. 1 stock on Wall Street."
For many years, that focus made Mr. Ebbers a cult figure on Wall Street. And for good reason. A $100 investment in WorldCom stock at the beginning of 1990 would have been worth about $8,700 when the company's stock hit its peak of $64.50 in 1999. By yesterday, that investment would have been worth about $335.
For a time, even as Mr. Ebbers focused more on his company's stock rather than on his company's operations, investors were happy to go along for the ride.
"I attended many, many of his prayer meetings with the New York Society of Securities Analysts and they just said, 'Anything you want, Bernie, you got it,' " said Howard Anderson, founder of the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston. "They did not examine his finances and his books with anything resembling due diligence."
Mr. Ebbers, to be sure, was not cut from the same cloth as Gary Winnick, the chairman of the telecommunications upstart Global Crossing, who sold over $700 million of his company's stock before the shares collapsed and the company filed for bankruptcy protection.
In fact, Mr. Ebbers appears to be in dire personal financial straits precisely because instead of selling WorldCom shares, he kept buying, sometimes pledging the value of shares he already owned to buy still more. As WorldCom's shares fell over the last 18 months and as the margin calls came in, WorldCom extended those big loans to Mr. Ebbers. 
"Bernie was not Bill McGowan," Mr. Anderson said, referring to the late MCI leader. 
"McGowan understood the delicate balance between customers, network capacity, publicity and raising money," Mr. Anderson said. "Bernie viewed this as a series of financial-engineering maneuvers and never truly understood the business that he was in. In the end, that probably skewered him."

HEADLINE: Wide Racial Disparities Found in Costs of Mortgages 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
A far greater share of black and Hispanic homeowners with above-average incomes still have mortgages with higher interest rates than whites with comparable incomes, according to a study to be released today. The research suggests that conventional banks, despite recent progress, have failed to reach many minority borrowers who would qualify for good mortgages based on their salary and credit history, housing experts said.
 In its most surprising finding, the study said that the racial disparities increased as homeowners' salaries rose. Among households that made at least 120 percent of the typical income in their metropolitan area, 32 percent of blacks held high-interest, or subprime, loans while only 11 percent of whites did. Among households that made 80 percent or less of the typical local salary, 56 percent of blacks had subprime loans and 25 percent of whites did. 
 "The market isn't working as it should," said Allen J. Fishbein, general counsel at the Center for Community Change, a housing advocacy group in Washington that conducted the study. "It's pretty striking."
The study looked at federal records of refinancing loans made in 2000. Such loans are most popular among subprime lenders, many of which are more willing to lend money to people who already own a house that can be used as collateral.
The center is releasing the study in an effort to promote a bill that Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, plans to introduce today in an effort to crack down on so-called predatory lending. The measure would expand the government's definition of high-cost loans and curb some features of these loans, like penalties against borrowers who pay off their mortgages early.
A number of state legislatures, including New Jersey's, are considering other bills aimed at predatory lending. California and North Carolina recently passed such bills.
But many lenders -- including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which package billions of dollars worth of home mortgages -- oppose the state measures, arguing that they would prevent people who do not have low incomes or blemished credit histories from obtaining loans, or say the legislation should be modified.
Traditional banks have recently expanded their efforts to lend money in minority neighborhoods, partly in response to federal laws that give them incentives to do so and partly in an attempt to find new customers. But many of these neighborhoods are still dominated by mortgage brokers offering subprime loans.
The growth of subprime lending in recent years has helped many people who could not otherwise borrow money to buy homes, but it has also allowed predatory loans to become more common.
St. Louis had the biggest disparity between the percentage of upper-income blacks and upper-income whites who held subprime loans, according to the study. About one of every 20 affluent whites who took out a second mortgage in 2000 received a subprime loan. For blacks, the comparable figures were one in three.
Subprime loans typically have an annual interest rate one to four percentage points higher than a conventional loan. Over the life of a mortgage, the difference often translates into tens of thousands of dollars.
St. Louis was followed by Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans and Indianapolis. New York ranked 24th out of 331 metropolitan areas.
The disparity between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites was greatest in Western cities with large Spanish-speaking populations. These include Tucson, Ariz., and Salinas, San Francisco and San Jose in California. New York ranked 13th.
The study's authors acknowledged that their findings did not prove that minority borrowers unfairly pay high mortgage rates, because applicants' credit histories were not considered. But the authors said the gaps between subprime lending to whites and minority borrowers were probably too big to reflect only credit differences. Some other housing experts, told of the findings, agreed. "On the surface, it sounds right," said Jeffrey Zeltzer, executive director of the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents subprime lenders. For years, many banks denied credit to minority borrowers, Mr. Zeltzer said, and some people continue to borrow from subprime lenders, out of habit or fear that banks will reject them.
Housing experts said they could not fully explain why the gap between whites and minorities grew as income rose. One possibility is that banks discriminate against minorities, rejecting them for loans that whites with similar income and credit history receive. Bankers strongly deny that, and Mr. Fishbein, one of the study's authors, said researchers found no evidence to the contrary.
Mr. Fishbein said another possible explanation is that subprime lending is concentrated in minority neighborhoods. Minority applicants with high incomes who live in these neighborhoods might borrow from subprime lenders after seeing their ads and storefronts much more often than those of traditional banks.
Douglas Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said the significant rise in minority income in the last five years could also have played a role. Minorities' income may have effectively leaped ahead of their credit quality, which suffered during years when they made less money, giving banks a reason to reject their applications.

HEADLINE: An Abrupt Departure Is Seen as a Harbinger; 
Leadership Shake-Up Could Spread As WorldCom and Its Rivals Regroup

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The abrupt departure of Bernard J. Ebbers from WorldCom came sooner than Wall Street expected, but long after many investors and analysts began viewing it as inevitable. 
 Troubled WorldCom, the long-distance and Internet communications giant that Mr. Ebbers patched together through more than 75 acquisitions, named John W. Sidgmore, its 51-year-old vice chairman, as president and chief executive yesterday. 
 The move reflects both WorldCom's particular woes and the broader turmoil in the telecommunications sector, where earnings have been decimated by overinvestment in networks and business has yet to rebound from the recession. Many of the troubled companies had turbo-charged their growth in the 1990's with expensive acquisitions that have proved hard to blend together. 
"This change at WorldCom is a precursor to what will happen at a number of other companies," said Kenneth McGee, an analyst for the consulting firm Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Conn. "The common denominator is they all have acquisitions that should not have been made."
The chief executive currently viewed as most likely to follow Mr. Ebbers out the door is Joseph P. Nacchio, the embattled leader of Qwest Communications International. Qwest reached its present form two years ago by swallowing the far larger U S West, which was the dominant local phone company in 14 Western states. Qwest, which has lost money for eight consecutive quarters and like WorldCom is the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, reported yesterday that it lost $698 million in the first quarter on revenue of $4.37 billion. 
In WorldCom, Mr. Sidgmore inherits the challenge of leading an enterprise with one of the largest debt burdens in corporate America, a battered stock, huge morale problems and, as many analysts see it, poor growth prospects. The company's long-distance business, most of it acquired with the audacious 1998 takeover of MCI Communications, is steadily losing ground as consumers make more of their calls on cellphones or use e-mail instead. 
Internet and other modes of traffic are growing. But aside from the dedicated data networks that WorldCom builds and, in some cases, operates for business customers, competition makes it hard for WorldCom to command the prices needed to generate healthy profits. WorldCom last week reported net income of $130 million for the first quarter, but that was the seventh quarter in which earnings fell, and the $8.12 billion in revenue was down nearly 8 percent from a year earlier. 
"It's hard to win with a decelerating horse," said Scott C. Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a Washington-based adviser to telecommunications investors.
Mr. Sidgmore said yesterday that WorldCom's broad set of assets and huge customer base gave it the staying power to survive "anything that's happening in the economy." But Wall Street's biggest worry is whether WorldCom, the nation's seventh-largest issuer of corporate bonds, can actually grow enough to generate the cash needed to manage its $30 billion in debt. 
"The banking puzzle is how do you separate the good assets from the overwhelming liabilities," Mr. Cleland said. "Normally that's done with bankruptcy." 
Indeed, the company's bonds traded yesterday, as they have for the last few weeks, at prices suggesting that investors expect WorldCom to file for bankruptcy protection eventually. But Mr. Sidgmore, in his first conference call with analysts, repeated WorldCom's longstanding position that it had plenty of cash and cash-creating opportunities to cover all its needs.
Some cash, of course, can always be generated by cutting costs. But WorldCom recently announced just such a move, a layoff that will eliminate 3,700 jobs, and analysts say it is already the leanest of all of the major phone companies because of the devotion of Mr. Ebbers to cost controls. Another source of funds could be cuts in capital spending, which is budgeted to be $4.9 billion this year, or nearly $3 billion above what the company says is the bare minimum to sustain its current business. 
Mr. Sidgmore said that the company would immediately begin assessing opportunities to sell "noncore" operations. He said any sales would be to shed investments that are producing poor returns, not simply to raise cash. The company told analysts, though, that WorldCom could raise well over $1 billion from such deals.
But industry experts like Jim Andrew, vice president at the strategy consulting firm Adventis, are skeptical that WorldCom will be able to find other companies willing to pay much for any of its assets.
In addition to WorldCom's business challenges, Mr. Sidgmore must also deal with a wide-ranging investigation by the S.E.C. into WorldCom's accounting practices and its financial relations with Mr. Ebbers. Mr. Ebbers owes the company more than $366 million to repay loans and guarantees it gave him to shore up his personal finances as shares of WorldCom tumbled. The stock closed at $2.48 yesterday, up 13 cents. But it has fallen more than 82 percent this year and 96 percent from its peak of $64.50 in 1999.
The abruptness of the departure of Mr. Ebbers, which came over the weekend but was not disclosed until a report yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, is yet another challenge. "I'm not sure the company has convinced the market that this is a well-reasoned and organized response rather than a temporary stop-gap measure," said Jonathan Low, a senior fellow at the CAP Gemini Ernst & Young Center for Business Innovation in Cambridge, Mass.
Mr. Sidgmore's team consists entirely of executives brought into the company through the deals of Mr. Ebbers. WorldCom said yesterday that Scott D. Sullivan, the chief financial officer, would be given the added title of executive vice president. Ronald R. Beaumont, who had been chief operations officer for the non-MCI part of the business, will be WorldCom's chief operating officer. Bert C. Roberts Jr., the nonexecutive chairman, formerly chief executive of MCI, will remain in his current post. 
Mr. Ebbers could not be reached for comment yesterday but Mr. Sidgmore, who described him as "a good friend," said that the financial problems of Mr. Ebbers played a major role in his resignation. Unlike a number of other highly publicized executives at companies like Enron and Global Crossing, Mr. Ebbers had not generated a fortune by selling stock in his company before it crashed but had instead borrowed to buy even more of it on margin. 
WorldCom's loans to him were intended to make it unnecessary for him to cover his losses by selling large blocks of his shares. WorldCom's board feared that such sales would unnerve investors, according to the company's account of the loans. But the strategy backfired when the size of the loans became public and investors viewed the arrangement as imposing undue risk on WorldCom to protect Mr. Ebbers.
Mr. Sidgmore said that WorldCom's independent directors had been increasingly unhappy about WorldCom's performance and problems under Mr. Ebbers. That unhappiness reached its peak head during discussions on Friday, after which Mr. Ebbers began talking about his resignation. "He had to seriously work on his personal finance problem," Mr. Sidgmore said. "He couldn't do that as C.E.O."

HEADLINE: City's Tax Collections Weaken, but Bloomberg Says His Budget Can Handle It 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
New York City's tax collections came in weaker than expected for the month of April, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the problem did not appear to be so grave that it threatened to throw his budget plan seriously out of kilter.
 Neither the mayor nor his aides would say how far off the tax collections were. But several city officials said that preliminary figures suggested that the city collected about $200 million less in personal income taxes last month than it had expected to. 
 The city's Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan monitoring agency, said that based on the preliminary figures, the city's tax revenues could fall $200 million to $250 million short of the $22 billion it expects to collect in taxes this year. 
The city's problems do not appear to be as serious as those of the state's, whose budget process was thrown into chaos this week by the news that state tax collections fell at least $1.1 billion short of expectations in April. April is an important month for gauging personal income tax, as many tax returns flood in around the April 15 deadline.
Even if the city takes in $250 million less than anticipated, it could still finish the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, with a small surplus. The mayor's current plan projects a $322 million surplus; as long as the decline in revenues does not exceed that, the city will end the year in balance. But the smaller the surplus, the harder it will be to close the $4.9 billion budget deficit that is projected for the year beginning July 1.
Mayor Bloomberg said at a news conference in the Bronx that "tax revenues at the city level are starting to fall," but said that he expected that the city would still be able to carry out the executive budget proposal that he issued two weeks ago. 
"At the moment, I'm optimistic that we could continue on with the executive budget that I submitted," he said. "Three months, six months from now, we may not have to cut quite as much, or we may have to cut more. Nobody can predict."
Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the Independent Budget Office, said that the weaker-than-anticipated collections indicated how poorly the local economy did in 2001, between the recession and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. "This reflects the tremendous weakness of 2001," she said.
As New Yorkers filed their tax returns, she said, it became clear that refunds were higher than had been expected, and final payments lower than had been expected. And while revenues could continue to trickle in, she said that the drop-off appeared serious.
Ms. Lowenstein said that the data indicated that the city collected a little over $500 million in personal income tax this April, which is less than half what the city collected in April 2001, when taxpayers were still paying for the boom of 2000. Another city official said that the city had expected to collect about $710 million this April. 
Revenue forecasting is famously difficult, and it was made more difficult by the confluence of the recession and the terrorist attacks of 2001. The city was quick to revise its forecasts downward; since then, some taxes have come in stronger than expected and others weaker. While income tax appears to be down, property and property-related taxes, the biggest single source of tax revenue, have done better than expected. 
Until the most recent figures came in, it appeared that the city was doing a little better than expected. Two weeks ago Mr. Bloomberg's budget plan predicted that the city would take in $80 million more in taxes than had been anticipated. 
"I think if we gave an estimate today of the tax revenues as compared to two weeks ago when we presented the executive budget, we would give you a lower estimate," he said yesterday. "But we have to deal with that."

HEADLINE: Bush Uses Familiar Themes On Stump in Silicon Valley 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., April 30 

 BODY:
President Bush mixed policy and politics today in dot-com-busted Silicon Valley, delivering a speech that emphasized "compassionate conservatism" and raising $1.8 million for Bill Simon Jr., the Republican candidate for governor.
 Shifting his focus to domestic policy at a time when polls show Americans turning their attention to the economy and other domestic issues after more than six months dominated by the war on terrorism, Mr. Bush gathered his entire domestic agenda -- tax cuts as well as health care, education and welfare programs -- under the philosophy that was a refrain of his 2000 campaign. 
 He used the term "compassionate conservatism" more than a dozen times in a 30-minute speech before the Commonwealth and Churchill Clubs of California, calling it the solution for numerous domestic problems, including poverty and weak schools, and invoking some of the language he often used in his campaign speeches. 
"It is compassionate to actively help our fellow citizens in need," he said. "It is conservative to insist on responsibility and on results. And with this hopeful approach, we can make a real difference in people's lives."
This was the second day of Mr. Bush's two-day visit to the state -- he spent Monday in Southern California -- and his first visit to the Bay Area since his inauguration. Mr. Bush avoided the politically hostile ground of San Francisco, where he received just one in six votes in 2000, for the more moderate land of the nation's technology capital.
"I understand people are hurting here in the Silicon Valley," he said. "This vital region reminds us that a lot of work remains to be done."
That work, he said, included enacting his major economic policy objectives, including the continued reduction of taxes, expanding trade and freeing entrepreneurs from "pointless regulation and endless litigation."
Mr. Bush also used the speech to restate the major domestic themes of his presidency, including bolstering national security, holding schools accountable for teaching students, and encouraging "the commitments of family" in federal welfare programs.
He also emphasized the importance of activism, self-reliance and the work of charities, community groups and religion-based institutions in fighting poverty. He used similar themes on Monday, a day on which he marked the 10th anniversary of the race riots in Los Angeles by praising neighborhood and religious leaders for their rebuilding efforts.
The speech this morning also touched on the war on terrorism, urging tolerance and condemning anti-Semitism and bigotry toward Muslims. 
Mr. Bush also made a glancing reference to the Enron Corporation bankruptcy case, saying that "to restore trust in our economy, corporate leaders must be held to the highest ethical standards." 
But he was clearly paying the most attention to home-front issues, heeding polls in which the majority of respondents said they wanted him to focus more on domestic problems this year.
Democrats called Mr. Bush's speech an effort to find an agenda for the fall elections.
"Republicans can't run on Bush's 2000 campaign agenda because he's walked away from the promises he made to protect Social Security, provide a prescription drug benefit for all seniors, and protect our air and water," Terence R. McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said.
Stumping for Mr. Simon, the 50-year-old political neophyte who trails Gov. Gray Davis by 14 percentage points in the latest Field Poll, Mr. Bush told 1,400 Republicans at a fund-raising lunch in Santa Clara that he was proud to "support this new face in American politics." 
Mr. Bush had backed Mr. Simon's opponent, former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, in the Republican primary. Mr. Simon, a conservative who opposes abortion, was considered the weaker challenger to the moderate Governor Davis.
The president's visit to the state helped raise $4.5 million for Mr. Simon's campaign. A Republican win for governor would bolster Mr. Bush's own chances in 2004 to win the state, which he lost by 1.3 million votes to Al Gore.
Outside the Santa Clara Convention Center, Mr. Bush's motorcade was greeted by about 300 booing protesters. Demonstrators included those against the United States Mideast policy, those against his and Mr. Simon's stance on abortion and those against a military buildup and the continuing war on terrorism.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Criticizes Hospital BuyingGroups 

BYLINE:  By BARRY MEIER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
The business practices of the nation's two biggest groups that negotiate contracts for hospital products were sharply criticized today by lawmakers from both parties who threatened Congressional action if the companies did not reform themselves.
 At a hearing here before the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, lawmakers said they were deeply disturbed by reports in The New York Times that decisions made by the two groups in awarding contracts to manufacturers were entangled by conflicts of interest and self-dealing. 
 "We have heard startling allegations of scandal and conflicts of interest that have infected" these groups, said Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin. "These practices are appalling and cannot be tolerated." 
Top officials of the groups -- Premier Inc. and Novation -- were criticized on a variety of issues including stockholdings by the group's executives, and the groups themselves, in companies that received contracts. Lawmakers also expressed their concern over sole-source contracts awarded to manufacturers that paid large fees to the buying groups, saying the practice stifled product innovation and threatened patient safety.
Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, said he also thought that buying groups, in an apparent drive to reap profits for themselves, had strayed from their basic reason for being -- obtaining the best products at low prices for hospitals. 
"I am concerned about the extensive range of businesses and programs run" by these groups, he said.
Today's hearing was the first Congressional examination of hospital buying groups since 1986, when Congress granted them special exemptions from federal antikickback laws. That exemption permits the groups to accept money from manufacturers that sell products. 
The hearing comes after several articles this year in The Times that have examined the buying groups and their conflicts of interest. Many of the examples cited by lawmakers appeared in those articles.
At the hearing, Richard A. Norling, the chief executive of Premier, and Mark McKenna, the president of Novation, defended the groups' practices, saying that they saved money for hospitals and that hospitals were free to buy whatever products they wanted.
"We are committed to operating openly, honestly and transparently," Mr. Norling said.
Senator Kohl asked the buying groups to work with a small group of product makers and doctors "to create a code of conduct that will address these ethical problems and contracting issues." The groups agreed to the request. He gave them three months to report back to his committee with their ideas.
Senators Kohl and DeWine asked both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to open investigations into whether the buying groups had violated federal antitrust guidelines.
Elizabeth H. Weatherman, a managing director of Warburg Pincus, a venture capital firm in New York City, also testified, saying such firms were reluctant to finance new medical technology companies because of the "anticompetitive" business practices of the big buying groups. Ms. Weatherman said "collusion" between the buying groups and large manufacturers kept out the smaller, innovative manufacturers and kept prices high.
"There is no doubt that patients' health has suffered as a result" of these groups' activities, she said.
Premier and Novation negotiate contracts for at least half of the nation's nonprofit hospitals, which accounted last year for about $34 billion in sales. The groups deny that they hurt product innovation.
For her part, Ms. Weatherman said that the government would not allow such practices in any other business sector and she said she could see no reason it should do so in health care.
"There is no special reason why the health care system should be the only sector of the economy where such practices are tolerated," she said. 
Stockholdings by buying group executives in companies that hold contracts came under particular scrutiny by lawmakers.
"I am concerned about recent press reports that senior executives have received or obtained stock or stock options from product suppliers, creating serious conflicts of interest," Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in a statement released at today's hearing.
Under questioning from Senator Kohl, Mr. McKenna, the Novation official, acknowledged that he held stock in five "medically related" companies, some of which have contracts with his group. He said that while his holdings were small, Novation's guidelines allow officials to own up to 1 percent of a company's publicly traded stock, an amount that could represent millions of dollars.
Senator Kohl said he had serious concerns about buying group officials holding any stock in a company with which they do business. "Why not just say it's a bad idea?" he asked.
Mr. McKenna replied, "Certainly sir, it is worthy of review."
For his part, Mr. Norling, the Premier executive, said his group was already reviewing its policy on personal stockholdings in medical suppliers. Mr. Norling, who had previously held such stock, said that he personally favored barring such holdings.

HEADLINE: Ontario Fosters Cross-Border Electricity Trade 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 30 

 BODY:
The ties that bind the United States and Canada will become a little tighter this week when the province of Ontario, home to more than a third of all Canadians and 40 percent of Canada's economic activity, throws open its electricity market.
 The move, which is described as deregulation but in reality keeps the market tightly regulated under different rules, will make it easier for American and Canadian power companies to sell their electricity across the border. 
 The closer integration of the two countries' power grids will reinforce the growing trade and investment that have resulted from a 1988 bilateral free trade deal, which was bolstered six years later by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which also includes Mexico.
Several smaller Canadian provinces, including British Columbia and Quebec, are already allowing electricity imports from the United States. 
"It doesn't matter whether there's a maple leaf or the Stars and Stripes on an electron," said Michael Hobbs, director of marketing at the Mirant Corporation, an Atlanta-based energy trading and supply group. Mirant has set up an operation in Toronto to trade electricity both within Canada and across the border. It owns 2,500 megawatts of generating capacity in New York and Michigan, and it plans to sell any surplus electricity to Ontario. "It's a great fit for us," Mr. Hobbs said.
The Canadians see things much the same way. "Ontario sits snugly at the center of the Northeast and Midwest," said Graham Brown, chief operating officer at Ontario Power Generation, based in Toronto. "It's a natural place for electricity trade to take place." Ontario Power Generation's assets include two of the continent's biggest nuclear power plants.
Ontario's provincial government took the first step toward a more open marketplace three years ago by breaking up Ontario Hydro, a nonprofit power supply monopoly.
Ontario Hydro's plants went to the newly created Ontario Power Generation, known as O.P.G., while another new company, Hydro One, took over the transmission network. To help make the companies attractive to potential outside investors, the province took over more than half of Ontario Hydro's $24 billion in debt and pension liabilities.
Under the new rules, which take effect on May 1, other suppliers can sell electricity in Ontario on long-term contracts or on the spot market. On the buying side, utilities, big industrial users and a new group of electricity retailers will compete for supplies.
To grease the wheels of competition, Ontario Power Generation must give up control over at least 4,000 megawatts of price-setting generating capacity, out of a total of 24,700 megawatts, over the next three and a half years. By 2012, the company can control no more than 35 percent of the province's electricity supply.
Ontario Power Generation began the process in 2000 by announcing an 18-year lease of its Bruce nuclear station, on the shores of Lake Huron, to British Energy, based in Edinburgh, and the Cameco Corporation, Canada's biggest uranium producer.
Some consumer groups and trade unions have protested the move to open markets geared toward profit, saying that consumers will have to pay higher rates and local industries will be hurt.
The government has sought to allay such fears by capping the price at which Ontario Power Generation sells 70 percent of its power at 3.8 Canadian cents a kilowatt-hour, compared with the current market price of just over 4 Canadian cents. Distributors are also subject to price controls.
Still, the opponents successfully petitioned a court this month to stall the planned privatization of Hydro One. The company had scheduled an initial public offering, expected to raise about 5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.2 billion), for mid-June, but a judge ruled that the law setting up Hydro One did not give the province authority to sell it. The government has said it will appeal. In any case, it plans to amend the law so the privatization can proceed later in the year.
An Ontario Power Generation offering is likely at some point, but no timetable has been set.
As both companies gear up for competition on their home turf, they are casting their eyes southward. In its preliminary stock offering prospectus, Hydro One highlights the consolidation of the American power industry and Ontario's proximity to the most heavily populated and industrialized regions of the United States.
The company recently received approval from United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build an underwater cable across Lake Erie to link the Canadian and American power transmission grids. The project is expected to be completed in summer 2004.
FERC has also licensed Ontario Power Generation to sell power in the United States. "We're not just ready for interregional trade," Mr. Brown said. "We're positively hungry for it."
With low-cost hydroelectric power making up a sizable chunk of their generating capacity, Canadian utilities have a significant edge over their American rivals. "O.P.G. will make more money exporting electricity than selling it here," said Andrew J. Roman, a lawyer specializing in energy issues at Miller Thomson in Toronto.
To overcome that disadvantage, some American companies are building their own power plants north of the border. Sithe Energies of New York, for instance, is spending about $958 million to put up two natural gas plants in the Toronto area, with a combined generating capacity of 1,700 megawatts.
But the opportunities could be limited by an expected surplus of electricity over the next few years, resulting in part from Ontario Power Generation's putting one of its big nuclear plants back in service after a five-year shutdown
Political sensitivities are also an issue.
In a recent speech, Ronald Osborne, the chief executive of Ontario Power Generation, said that anyone advocating a smaller role for his company should ask whether there was "a value in having electricity decisions made in Ontario, rather than turning electricity generation into a branch-plant industry, with all major decisions made outside our borders."

HEADLINE: West Side Plan Envisions Jets And Olympics 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
While public attention is focused on rebuilding Lower Manhattan, and the city and state budgets are in crisis, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration is pressing forward with efforts to transform the far West Side of Manhattan with office towers, a new transit line and parks.
 At the same time, the Jets are quietly circulating a new plan for an imaginative $1 billion sports and entertainment complex over the rail yards in the same neighborhood that would be part of the city's Olympic bid. And the hotel industry and some state officials are renewing efforts to expand the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 The engine driving the redevelopment of the district, said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, would be the $1.5 billion extension of the No. 7 subway line west from Seventh Avenue and south to 34th Street. It would bring public transportation to a low-slung, semi-industrial neighborhood area that Mr. Doctoroff described as both "blighted" and "more or less virgin" and open the door to development. 
Although construction might not begin for years and would not be completed until perhaps 2040, the planning adds up to a lot of quiet but intense activity for a neighborhood that has resisted change for decades. The plans would be enormously expensive, and city officials are hoping to pay for it with rising property tax revenues and the sale of development rights.
"There's an awful lot going on here," said Simone Sindin, chairwoman of the neighborhood's community board. "Tied into this is the whole question of the 2012 Olympics and the whole discussion of the stadium."
Community activists and some city officials agree that the city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics -- led almost single-handedly by Mr. Doctoroff before he took office in January as the city's top economic development official -- brings urgency to the city's redevelopment plans. The United States Olympic Committee is expected to select one candidate city on Nov. 3, and New York's application is dependent on the extension of the No. 7 subway line and the creation of an Olympic-quality stadium on the West Side, which, coincidentally, could also be used by the National Football League's Jets. To get the Olympics, New York must also show some progress on its plans by 2005, when the International Olympic Committee makes the final decision on a host city for 2012.
Mr. Doctoroff was loath to talk about the Olympics, or the stadium, but he was expansive on the importance of extending mass transit. 
"There's been no development in that area for 75 years and it's because there's been no mass transit," Mr. Doctoroff said. "We're trying to look to the long term, recognizing the need for housing and commercial space. We want to create a plan that won't just respond to those needs, but will create a spectacular new part of the city. If we don't get started now, we'll never get there."
In recent weeks, the city started the process of hiring a real estate financing expert and an urban design consultant for a 59-block area on the West Side, from Eighth Avenue to the Hudson River, between 42nd and 28th Streets. Next month, the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are expected to hire consultants and begin a joint environmental impact review of the subway extension.
Last December, the City Planning Department issued a "Framework for Development" on the West Side, an area of garages, warehouses, parking lots, manufacturing buildings and some housing. The report envisioned zoning changes that would allow for the building of 20 million square feet of office space -- the equivalent of 10 Empire State Buildings -- along a commercial corridor extending from Pennsylvania Station west to the Hudson River. New office towers would also be developed across Eleventh Avenue from the newly expanded Javits Center, while new housing would be permitted between Ninth and 10th Avenues, north of 35th Street.
But the development plans face some community opposition, as well as questions about financing and how much demand there is for office space given the plethora of vacant space that has opened up.
"They want a carpet of high-rise office buildings along 10th and 11th Avenues," said Ms. Sindin of Community Board 4. "We would oppose that. We were hoping to use some of the land for affordable housing."
Ms. Sindin said that her board has fewer qualms about the expansion of the Javits Center. But she said they are adamantly opposed to a stadium.
Some landlords, downtown executives and East Side politicians are also concerned about whether the effort will divert scarce public resources from the reconstruction effort in Lower Manhattan or the long proposed Second Avenue subway.
But Mr. Doctoroff said, "It won't conflict with anything." 
The plan, he said, is to create a self-financing mechanism. The new subway line and zoning changes would spur development. The resulting projected increase in real estate values and taxes, in turn, would be used to repay bonds for the project in a process, rarely used in New York, known as tax increment financing. The real estate revenue consultant would help the city determine how much revenue it could expect for the subway, parks and platforms over the rail yards.
"You're extending mass transit to more or less unchartered territory," he said. "You generate substantial incremental revenues for the city and the state that can pay for the investment in infrastructure."
John Fisher, a member of a neighborhood coalition active in the area, expressed some skepticism about the funding, which he said, seemed predicated on a real estate market unchecked by recession and a rising demand for expensive office space. 
In recent weeks, L. Jay Cross, president of the Jets, has been showing off plans for a sports complex on the West Side to state and city officials that features a 75,000-seat stadium that could be converted to a 23,000-seat arena for basketball and hockey, rather than two separate structures. 
Last year, the Jets, who share a stadium with the Giants in the Meadowlands in New Jersey, unveiled a proposal for a new stadium over the rail yards on the West Side. The plans were designed to dovetail the convention center expansion and the Olympics bid. But state officials and neighborhood residents were not enthusiastic. 
Mr. Cross has come back with new plans that show a rectangular sports complex, with an exoskeleton of steel and glass. The Jets declined to discuss the new plans, but a set of presentation books, made available by a West Side official, depict a billion-dollar complex that could function as an Olympic stadium and a football stadium, on a block bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues, from 30th to 34th Streets. With the retractable roof closed, the bowl-like stadium could be transformed into Madison Square Garden, a home for the Knicks and the Rangers.
Under the plan, the old Garden on Seventh Avenue would be demolished for office towers. The Jets and Cablevision, which owns the Garden, would pay for and operate the new complex. That kind of financing would presumably satisfy Mayor Bloomberg, who has opposed investing public money in stadiums while the city is in fiscal straits.
Still, the sports complex would be built on a platform over the rail yards, which would cost the city and the state $250 million. 
"They're saying the stadium would be done without public money," said one public official, who has met with team officials. "The Jets are spending a fortune. They want this site like nothing I've ever seen."

HEADLINE: Broadcast Tower Is Urged for Governors I. 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
A 2,000-foot-tall tower with a restaurant and observation deck on top, modeled on the Space Needle in Seattle, is being pushed by television executives as a replacement for the broadcasting antenna that was lost when the World Trade Center towers fell, broadcasting executives say.
 Television executives who are concerned about the loss of millions of viewers and the advertising dollars they attract are pressing forward with a proposal to build such a tower on Governors Island, which returned to the list of potential sites for an antenna last month after President Bush promised to return it to New York for a nominal fee. Station executives have circulated drawings of a design by Kohn Pedersen Fox, an architectural firm in Manhattan. The plan is for a $200 million tower that would be considered an architectural asset and would include retail space at the bottom. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki have proposed turning Governors Island into a campus for the City University of New York, which would have to come up with a way to pay the annual cost of maintaining the buildings on the island, at an annual cost city officials have estimated at $20 million to $30 million. CUNY officials have expressed interest in the broadcasters' plan, which would include the stations' sharing the cost of the island's maintenance and starting a journalism or broadcasting school there.
The loss of the antenna knocked out reception of many channels to about one million households in the New York market, mostly in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Since the Sept. 11 attack, about 219,000 additional households have signed up for cable, while others have bought satellite dishes. Television executives had looked at other locations but were blocked by airline flight plans, bird migratory patterns and the need to avoid interfering with other cities' signals.
Governors Island had been taken off the table as a possible location because Congressional Republicans had said that they planned to sell it to the highest bidder. With President Bush's decision, the stations must now obtain support from Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg. 
The mayor's press secretary, Edward Skyler, said yesterday that the city was willing to work with the stations to find a suitable site but that the current proposal was "inconsistent with the mayor's vision for the island." The governor has said he supports the stations' efforts to build a tower quickly, but he has not committed to a site.
Still, a vice chancellor and spokesman at CUNY, Jay Hershenson, said the university was open to the idea. "There is just enormous potential for entrepreneurial thinking and almost anything is on the table," he said.
If they are unable to persuade Mr. Bloomberg, the stations said, they would turn to the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, a site some executives prefer. Science center officials have expressed interest in the tower -- but only if it makes an architectural statement, attracts tourists and generates revenue. 
Several city politicians who are expected to be involved in the development of Governors Island support the idea. 
"The bottom line is that if we go with the proposal for an educational institution, as the governor and mayor have suggested, we have to have some kind of revenue to pay for it and this could be it," said the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields. She added that she planned to bring the issue up this week with the deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, and said she was concerned about losing the antenna and the accompanying jobs to New Jersey. "My call to the mayor is to look at the issue and not dismiss it outright, " she added.
Executives at the parent companies of the stations most affected by the loss of the antenna have pressed federal officials to assure Mr. Bloomberg that the tower would fit within the president's definition of "public use." Walt Disney owns WABC (Channel 7); Viacom, WCBS (Channel 2); the Tribune Company, WPIX (Channel 11); the News Corporation, WWOR (Channel 9) and WNYW (Channel 5); and General Electric, WNBC (Channel 4) and WNJU (Channel 47).
In a recent conversation with Governor Pataki, Dennis Swanson, the president and general manager of WNBC, made a passionate argument that most of the 2.6 million people affected by the loss of the antenna were blacks, Hispanics, poor or elderly, according to an executive familiar with the conversation.
"Most dramatically affected are the elderly and the economically disadvantaged, who depend on free over-the-air signals for their television," Dr. William F. Baker, the president of WNET (Channel 13) and chairman of the alliance, said in a speech last month at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas. Despite the talk of public service, Dr. Baker did not ignore the financial implications, adding that, "with every day, the losses mount."

To the Editor:
Re "Change in Rules Barred Many From Sept. 11 Disaster Relief" (front page, April 26):
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency was not alone in imposing the "direct result" test, which limited benefits to those who could prove that their lost income was a "direct result" of the attacks. 
The Labor Department established the same criteria for eligibility for disaster unemployment insurance for the self-employed. Most artists, and we suspect most other self-employed people, were rejected when they filed for this insurance. 
 Our experience shows that nonprofits (with the possible exception of the large academic institutions and large health care facilities), small businesses and the self-employed have not been served well by the government relief efforts. We hope that your article compels a re-examination of these policies. If not, many will have no choice but to apply for welfare.

HEADLINE: Lessons Learned At Dot-Com U. 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
GO to Fathom.com and you will encounter a veritable trove of online courses about Shakespeare. You can enroll in "Modern Film Adaptations of Shakespeare," offered by the American Film Institute, or "Shakespeare and Management," taught by a member of the Columbia Business School faculty. 
 The site is by no means confined to courses on Shakespeare. You can also treat yourself to a seminar called "Bioacoustics: Cetaceans and Seeing Sounds," taught by a scientist from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
 Or if yours is a more public-policy-minded intellect, you can sign up for "Capital Punishment in the United States," a seminar with experts from Cambridge University Press, Columbia University and the University of Chicago. 
What's more, all are free. 
That part was not always the plan. Fathom, a start-up financed by Columbia, was founded two years ago with the goal of making a profit by offering online courses over the Internet. But after spending more than $25 million on the venture, Columbia has found decidedly little interest among prospective students in paying for the semester-length courses. 
Now Fathom is taking a new approach, one that its chief executive likens to giving away free samples to entice customers. 
Call it the Morning After phenomenon. In the last few years, prestigious universities rushed to start profit-seeking spinoffs, independent divisions that were going to develop online courses. The idea, fueled by the belief that students need not be physically present to receive a high-quality education, went beyond the mere introduction of online tools into traditional classes. 
The notion was that there were prospective students out there, far beyond the university's walls, for whom distance education was the answer. Whether they were 18-year-olds seeking college degrees or 50-year-olds longing to sound smart at cocktail parties, students would flock to the Web by the tens of thousands, paying tuitions comparable to those charged in the bricks-and-mortarboard world -- or so the thinking went. 
"University presidents got dollars in their eyes and figured the way the university was going to ride the dot-com wave was through distance learning," said Lev S. Gonick, vice president for information services and chief information officer at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "They got swept up." 
American universities have spent at least $100 million on Web-based course offerings, according to Eduventures, an education research firm in Boston. 
Now the groves of academe are littered with the detritus of failed e-learning start-ups as those same universities struggle with the question of how to embrace online education but not hemorrhage money in the process. 
New York University recently closed its Internet-based learning venture, NYUonline. The University of Maryland University College closed its profit-based online arm last October and folded it into the college. Temple University's company, Virtual Temple, closed last summer. Others have reinvented themselves. 
In the process, the universities have come to understand that there is more to online learning than simply transferring courses to the Web. 
"The truth is that e-learning technology itself, and those of us who represent the institutional and corporate agents of change in the e-learning environment, have thus far failed," Dr. Gonick said. "Across U.S. campuses today, e-learning technology investments are at risk, and many technology champions are in retreat." Since the mid-1990's, most of the purely virtual universities that sprang up -- from Hungry Minds to California Virtual University -- have been sold or scaled back or have disappeared altogether. The same is true for the lavish venture-capital financing for start-ups that designed online courses for colleges or put the technology for such courses in place, for a high fee. 
In 2000, some $482 million in venture capital was spent on companies building online tools aimed at the higher education market. So far this year, that amount has dropped to $17 million, according to Eduventures. 
Kenneth Green, founder of the Campus Computing Project, a research effort based in Los Angeles that studies information technology in American higher education, pointed to a combination of reasons that universities have stumbled in distance education. 
Mr. Green said that college campuses and dot-coms had looked at the numbers and anticipated a rising tide of enrollment based on baby boomers and their children as both traditional students and those seeking continuing education. In short, the colleges essentially assumed that if they built it, students would come. 
One conspicuous example is Fathom. Last week, Columbia's senate issued a report saying that the university should cut spending on the venture because it had little return to show for its investment. The report urges better coordination among the university's digital efforts, notably Columbia Interactive, a site aimed at scholars seeking academic content. 
Fathom started in 2000 by offering elaborate online courses replicating the Ivy League experience. The company has an impressive roster of a dozen partners, including the London School of Economics and Political Science, Cambridge University Press, the British Library, the University of Chicago and the New York Public Library. Many of Fathom's courses are provided by its member institutions, and many offer credit toward a degree. 
Although Fathom's courses were impressive from the start -- for example, "Introduction to Macroeconomics," taught by a University of Washington professor for $670 -- the idea that many students would pay $500 or more for them proved a miscalculation. 
"If you listened to some of the conversations going around on campuses, it was, 'Gee, this looks to be easy, inexpensive to develop and highly profitable -- throw it up on the Web and people will pay us,' " Mr. Green said. 
But business models were flawed, he said, and university administrators did not fully understand the cost of entering the market. "It's really, really expensive to do this stuff," he said. "It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a course well." 
There are substantial costs in designing the course, Mr. Green said, like creating video, securing content rights and paying the faculty member who teaches it. "This doesn't migrate painlessly from classroom onto the Web," he said. "It's more like making a Hollywood movie." 
Michael Crow, executive vice provost at Columbia, said that Fathom had yet to generate significant revenue, let alone turn a profit. 
"Right now we're trying to figure out how to make it work intellectually," he said, "and we have to figure out later how to make it work financially. If anyone had asked us how anyone was going to make the university work financially as the first question asked, it would never have been built." 
Now Fathom has decided that instead of students seeking degrees, it will focus on those looking for courses in professional development and continuing education. Fathom is also offering courses that are less expensive to produce and cost less for students, as well as several dozen others that are free. 
"We've broadened the kinds of courses in recognition of the fact that most people aren't familiar yet with online learning, so they need different price points," said Ann Kirschner, Fathom's president and chief executive. "We need to introduce learners to the concept before they will commit money." 
Part of the problem, distance learning experts say, has been an emphasis on technology -- streaming video, for example -- at the expense of more careful thinking about how remote learning might best be conducted. Some critics say that university administrators confused tools with education. 
"We figured a quick wave of the magic wand and we'd reinvent how people learned after 900 years of a traditional university mode of instruction," Dr. Gonick said. 
New York University has had a conspicuously difficult experience with distance education. The university started NYUonline in late 1998 to focus on corporate education and training, not degree programs. The company sold the courses as packages to corporate customers. 
By the time it opened its virtual doors to students in 2000, NYUonline employed 45 people and offered online courses with titles like "Train the Trainer," for human resource managers, and "Management Techniques," aimed at young managers. 
The NYUonline courses were not cheap. "Train the Trainer," which included live Webcasts as well as self-paced online courseware, cost around $1,600. The tuition for the management techniques course was close to $600. 
In two and a half years of operation, NYUonline received nearly $25 million from the university, but enrollment remained anemic at best: just 500 students at its peak. 
After closing NYUonline, the university moved some of the company's activities into its School of Continuing and Professional Studies, which was probably where it belonged in the first place, said Gordon Macomber, the former chief executive of NYUonline, who is now a consultant on electronic learning in New Canaan, Conn. 
"Along the way it became apparent that a major university that wants to get into online education can do it without forming a separate for-profit online company," Mr. Macomber said. "If you're going to invest money in anything, the university might as well invest it within the university instead of supporting a for-profit company." 
There are a few success stories. The technically oriented University of Phoenix has an online enrollment of more than 37,000, with four-year and post-graduate degree programs aimed at older students. The university's success, Mr. Green suggested, comes from its expertise in branding, marketing and infrastructure. 
That could be the combination for success in distance education. 
The trick now is finding a way for universities like Columbia, steeped in academic tradition, to make it work. 
"In a way, that is the crux of the matter," said Ms. Kirschner of Fathom. "Are universities going to grow smaller and marginalized in a world teeming with sources of information, or are they more important than ever, as people seek to separate fact from fiction, knowledge from data?" Ms. Kirschner said she hoped the answer would be the latter. 
In the meantime, you can brush up your Shakespeare. And they'll all kowtow.

HEADLINE: TURF; 
To Borrow, Must One Beg?

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
JOHN C. JORGENSEN, a Manhattan engineer who owns a weekend house in the Berkshires, was inching up the West Side Highway one day last month when he heard a compelling advertisement on the radio. It was promoting a home equity line of credit at 4 percent, about 10 points lower than it was when he bought his first apartment a decade ago. Stuck in traffic, he leaned forward when the announcer got to the best enticement of all: no closing costs.
 "It was like, 'Free money; come and get it,' " he said. "I don't even have a mortgage on my house in the country. I figured, why not?" 
 He soon found out why not. After their aggressive campaigns this winter, banks are beginning to have second thoughts. Borrowers who failed to move quickly can now expect to find that offers have suddenly become much harder to get, mortgage brokers say. 
"They're taking a lot of them away," said Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage, one of the country's largest mortgage brokers -- and after all the fanfare a few months ago, "they're doing it quietly."
The reason is simple, Ms. Cohn said. The low-interest lines "turned out to be money-losing propositions" -- for lenders.
With the prime rate sinking to its current 4 3/4 percent -- with 11 reductions in the last year alone -- demand for low-interest home equity lines has been mushrooming. Suzanne Bach, the executive vice president of the IPI Skyscraper Mortgage Company, another leading broker in the region, said that the number of loans written by her firm in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut rose 20 percent from the first quarter of 2001 to the first quarter of 2002. At the same time, the cost of a home equity line is rising. According to bankrate.com, a national reporting service, the average interest rate for a $30,000 home equity line has risen from 6.88 percent on March 15 to 7.35 percent on April 29. 
Other mortgage brokers said banks were put off by borrowers who used loans to fix up their houses to sell and, presto, paid back the loans only months later.
"The bank had eaten all the closing costs -- the appraisal fees and stuff like that," said John Senew, a partner in Concorde Funding Group, a mortgage broker with offices in Riverside, Conn., and Manhattan, explaining that banks make money on interest paid over a long time. "Sometimes, they actually lose money if you pay it off right away."
Many banks are countering by withdrawing so-called teaser rates -- extra-low rates offered during the loan's first six months. While penalties for prepayment (paying off a loan before it is due) remain rare, they are more common than they used to be, and many banks, including Webster Bank in Connecticut and J. P. Morgan Chase in Manhattan, are requiring that some borrowers keep their home equity credit line open for two years. Failure to do so means being hit with those closing costs. Webster has stopped writing home equity lines in New York City altogether, Ms. Cohn said, and now charges closing costs for lines over $1 million.
Banks are also making it harder for applicants to qualify, requiring long paper trails proving earnings and assets. And they are paying increased attention to computer-calculated credit ratings that knock out many who might have qualified under the less-mechanized evaluations previously made by bank employees.
Last year, the banks may have wanted 10 documents, Mr. Senew said. "Now they want the 12th and the 13th," he added. "The banks started getting a little attitude, getting a little tighter." And applicants who are self-employed may need more than last year's income tax statement. "They want something from the C.P.A.," he continued, stating that " 'Joe Jones' has been self-employed for X years." 
Banks are getting tougher in other ways, too, the experts say. Some lenders recently reduced the percentage of a house's value they will loan against, the so-called loan-to-value ratio. Ms. Cohn said banks that allowed a loan for 95 percent of a house's value (after deducting the amount of the first mortgage) had cut that to 90 percent -- or less. 
"On a co-op, some are only willing to go to 70 percent," she said.
Marcus Zavattaro, the president of Pinnacle Finance, a division of Patriot National Bank that handles mortgages averaging over $1 million, said that the banks are also not doing any special favors for the wealthy. "The banks in general have had to pull in their horns," he said. He named Astoria Federal Savings Bank in Queens and the North Fork Bank in Long Island as "two conservative banks that are only getting more conservative."
Mr. Zavattaro and several brokers said cheap money is still there. "You just have to work harder to qualify," he said. 
Ms. Bach of IPI said: "A couple of late payments on a credit card may not be too bad. But if it's a late payment on a mortgage, that could be a problem."
In New York City, co-op owners face additional hurdles because they are borrowing against shares in a corporation instead of square footage -- a concept home equity telemarketers from the Midwest or South may not understand, or want to deal with. Not only that; most co-op boards are notified if one of their shareholders is refinancing or running up additional home equity-type debt. In some cases, Ms. Bach said, the co-op boards are tougher than the banks.
A number of mortgage brokers said one of the biggest stumbling blocks can be the applicant's FICO credit score, a computer rating program developed by Fair, Isaac & Company. In the past, bank officers evaluated applications themselves or in committee, but with many applications now being taken over the telephone by a telemarketer, FICO scores have become more important. The top score is 800, and when one falls below 620, the application is in trouble, brokers say. 
Ms. Bach acknowledged some peculiarities. She said: "You can have five 30-day late payments on Visa but no debt and get a higher score than someone with no late payments and almost fully extended debt: that is, they owe $4,500 out of $5,000. It seems funny because you would think the person with all the late payments would be the one with the worse score, but it doesn't happen that way." (Consumers can obtain their FICO ratings for $12.95 at www.myfico.com.)
Mr. Jorgensen, who has the home in the Berkshires, said he found the lure of cheap money irresistible. "On the radio, they make it sound like you can just walk in and sign something and they give you the money," he said.
But after a brief discussion with a loan officer at a Fleet Bank branch near his office (where the home equity rate is now 5 percent -- still with no closing costs), Mr. Jorgensen decided to forget the whole thing. 
"I saw some things in my credit report that would take too long to explain." he said. "I decided to wait -- until the next time they start giving away free money."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about changes in the market for low-interest mortgages misstated the policy of one bank, J. P. Morgan Chase in Manhattan, on the early repayment of home equity credit lines. It does not penalize borrowers who pay off the loans within two years; in fact, the bank has no restrictions on early repayment.

HEADLINE: The New China Can Look Like the Old 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 1 

 BODY:
Frank Miu, the holder of the A&W franchise here, may have met his match early Monday morning, and it was not McDonald's or KFC. 
 After a decade of building up a chain of American-style root beer and sandwich stores, promoted here as "the father of American fast food," and surviving an onslaught of competition, Mr. Miu found himself staring in bewilderment and shock as a squadron of 30 officials from a local court swept into one of his outlets in a busy commercial district in northwest Beijing. 
 While police officers videotaped the small crowd of restaurant workers and passers-by gathered outside, the court officials seized the restaurant's tables, chairs and cooking equipment and sealed the doors. 
At the bottom of the case is a lease dispute, and those can turn thorny almost anywhere, of course. But Mr. Miu's predicament illustrates a larger danger facing Western companies here: crosscurrents developing in the traditionally vague, indirect and informal way business deals are often done here and the requirements of a more legalistic court system that sometimes intervenes precipitously in disputes. 
Mr. Miu, a Harvard-educated lawyer, said he and his Chinese partner, Lin Tao, tried to do business here in the "Beijing style," with private oral agreements overshadowing formal written ones. "As a lawyer here, I did incredible U.S.-style contracts that covered everything," Mr. Miu said. "But I always told clients that's not enough -- you need to work on relationships." 
Kenneth DeWoskin, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Beijing who advises foreign investors, said that these days, foreign investors who rely on informal understandings can be badly hurt. "Partners, providers or suppliers may not be operating from the same page," he said. "Particularly, businesses that make a soft contribution, such as restaurant formats and management experience, can find themselves challenged to protect their investments."
Investors and lawyers here said that the civil courts have become more effective and impartial arbiters in recent years. But "the fact is that courts can still be significantly influenced by local political and economic interests," Mr. DeWoskin said.
Mr. Miu and his partner, Mr. Lin, think that something like that may be at work in their case. The seizure of their restaurant came with only a day's warning, and without the Haidian District Court entering any formal judgment.
Mr. Lin said the nominal landlord for the property, the International Biological Products Institute, had links to a company once controlled by the city government, and he suggested that those links may have played a role in the court's issuing a prejudgment decree.
Judges from the Haidian District Court refused to comment on the case, citing court rules. The institute referred questions to its lawyer, Jiang Jingchuan, who said that nothing improper had gone on.
In hearings three weeks ago, the lawyer for the restaurant chain argued that the institute had never been given legal ownership of the Xingke Office Building, where the A&W restaurant had been situated. It still belonged to the Xingke Corporation, they argued, and an official of Xingke had promised the restaurant chain that its expiring lease would be extended by 5 or 10 years -- an example of a Beijing-style business plan.
In an interview, Mr. Jiang dismissed these arguments. "They're just trying to complicate a simple matter," he said. "The fact is, their lease expired, they were repeatedly told they had to vacate and repeatedly said they would, and oral promises don't have any weight in Chinese law."
Mr. Miu said the restaurant, opened since 1996 and with more than 50 employees, contributed a large part of his company's earnings. It paid what he called "top rent" for the site -- $189,00 a year -- and Mr. Miu said it was always paid on time. 
The court's sudden action threatened far more damage to his business than just the store's closing, Mr. Miu said. "We're a chain, and there could be a chain reaction from this," he said. "To use such unusual, drastic means makes it look like we're involved in a serious wrongdoing. The loss to our good will and image is unquantifiable."
Mr. Miu said he was told that a drugstore would replace his restaurant. But a businessman experienced with such disputes said the site, on a busy corner, would probably be rented to another fast-food outlet. "Otherwise," he said, "it doesn't make sense for them to get rid of a reliable renter."

HEADLINE: Germany Braces for Strikes As Union Takes Off Gloves 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 1 

 BODY:
Germany, which prides itself on a social consensus between workers and industry, is bracing for the most combative confrontation between unions and manufacturers in at least seven years.
 Germany's powerful metalworkers' union plans to start a wave of strikes on Monday that will move from factory to factory through this country's industrial heartland. The union represents 2.7 million workers at companies that include DaimlerChrysler, Porsche, Siemens and Bosch. 
 The strikes would be the first industrywide walkouts here since 1995 and could make it harder for Germany to bounce back from a severe economic slowdown. They may be even more important as an indicator of Germany's ability to break free from entrenched patterns that have made it the slowest-growing economy in Europe for much of the last decade. 
Rarely have industry and unions here been so openly hostile to each other. The metalworkers' union, IG Metall, is demanding wage increases of 6.5 percent, about three times the current inflation rate. Industry leaders, convinced that strikes are all but inevitable, are openly warning about factory lockouts that would keep nonstriking workers from reporting for duty at factories where supplies had been disrupted by strikes at other companies.
The conflict says much about the painful changes coursing through Germany. Though the German economy is by far the biggest in Europe, it has also become one of the weakest. Unemployment remains nearly 9 percent nationwide, and nearly twice that high in the formerly Communist east. Economic growth is stagnant, and it has been lower than in almost any other European nation since the mid-1990's.
Adjusted for inflation, government statistics indicate that average monthly take-home wages here dropped from 2,380 German marks in 1993 to about 2,220 marks in 2000.
The strikes also pose a serious political risk for Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who pleaded in vain last week for an agreement. Mr. Schroder's Social Democratic Party relies heavily on union support, but a debilitating strike could cost the party dearly in national elections this fall.
The difficulty is all the greater because of internal politics within IG Metall, once a major source of economic and political power.
The union's longtime president, Klaus Zwickel, will soon be retiring, and an intense battle is under way among those who want to succeed him. Both of the main rivals, Jurgen Peters and Berthold Huber, are under more pressure to court current members than to worry about future growth.
IG Metall has seen its power wane sharply. It has lost nearly one million members in the last decade as companies have shifted factories to Central Europe, Asia and the United States.
Many companies have bypassed national negotiations, hammering out individual deals with their own workers. And in eastern Germany, more than half of all companies do not even take part in what is supposed to be industrywide contract negotiations.
Now, union leaders are casting aside their caution.
"Neoliberalism has meant nothing more than a redistribution of wealth in favor of industry," said Mr. Huber, the head of IG Metall in the industrial state of Baden-Wurttemberg. "What people are saying now is that they want a fairer share."
Baden-Wurttemberg, which is home to companies like DaimlerChrysler as well as thousands of automobile parts suppliers and equipment manufacturers, will be one of three states where workers are expected to strike on Monday. The other states are Berlin and Brandenburg in eastern Germany.
Industry negotiators and many economists argue that any wage increases of more than 3 percent will delay Germany's economic recovery and lead to higher unemployment. 
"The effect on the German economy would definitely be negative," said Joachim Scheide, an economist with the Kiel Institute of World Economics. "It already seems like we are in some kind of new world. In recent years, we had the idea that wage increases had to be modest. Now that era seems to be at an end."
While the big metalworkers' union has always been among the most militant in its rhetoric, analysts are convinced that the union leaders have adopted a new hard line. 
German chemical workers reached an agreement earlier this month for wage increases of 3.3 percent plus a one-time payment.
That was more generous than many experts had been predicting just a few months earlier. But the much-bigger metalworkers' union dismissed the chemical workers' deal as far too modest.
"They want to get more, and I think they are going to get it," said Martin Werding, a labor economist at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich. "The unions have lost patience with wage moderation."

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Index Shows Slackening In Pace of Growth 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded less than expected in April, according to a report of purchasing managers released today, suggesting that the economy's rebound slowed after the strongest quarterly growth in two years.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its factory index slipped to 53.9 last month from 55.6 in March. 
The drop in the index reflected slowdowns in orders and employment. The index has been greater than 50, signaling growth, since February. Those gains came after an 18-month slump that began in August 2000. 
 "There has definitely been a shift of gears here from recovery to more moderate growth," said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C. "We are still producing, but the momentum has slowed."
The economy surged in the first quarter as businesses slowed the pace at which they reduced their inventories. That process is about at an end, and until consumer and business demand accelerates, growth will probably be slower, economists said. Analysts had expected a reading of 55 in the factory index, based on the median of 52 forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
A separate report from the Commerce Department today showed that construction spending fell a larger-than-expected 0.9 percent in March, reflecting less work on highways and other government projects. The decline, the first since November, came after a 0.7 percent increase in February and was larger than the expected drop of 0.2 percent.
The latest factory index, while lower in April than in March, is still higher than its 52.9 average over the period from 1996 through 2000, a time when the economy was expanding at a rate of 4 percent or more every year. The manufacturing rebound since February is also stronger than it was after the last recession.

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., May 1 

 BODY:
C. H. Butcher Jr., who was jailed for fraud after his regional banking empire collapsed in the 1980's, died Tuesday at a Georgia hospital. 
He was 62.
 Mr. Butcher was hospitalized after falling down the steps at his home in Canton, Ga., earlier in the day, according to The Knoxville News-Sentinel. 
 Mr. Butcher, former chairman of Southern Industrial Bank, and his brother Jake, together operated 27 banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, once valued at $3 billion.
The banks collapsed in 1983 under the weight of unsecured loans and paper corporations loaded with debt.
Survivors include his second wife, the former Sheryl Moreland; a son, C. H. Butcher III; his brother; his mother, Hazel; and one grandson.

HEADLINE: Britons Say They Work Longer Hours, but They Produce Less 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, May 1 

 BODY:
Britons are working longer hours than they did a decade ago, but are less productive than their counterparts in the United States and continental Europe, according to a survey released today.
 The research, conducted by the Economic and Social Research Council, a government-financed agency, debunks several work-force myths, including the notion that gold-watch employees who spend their entire careers with one company are a dying breed, and that the new economy has created a transient work force made up of professional freelancers who jump from job to job. 
 Policy makers in Britain have promoted the idea of a more flexible work force, in which people held more part-time or temporary jobs and often worked from home, as one benefit of the new economy. The new type of employee even got a new name -- the portfolio worker -- and was supposed to benefit from a more flexible schedule and shorter hours. 
But like so much of the new economy, that appears to be more wishful thinking than fact. A vast majority of the 2,500 people surveyed, 92 percent, held permanent jobs in 2000, up from 88 percent in 1992, the last time comparable research was conducted. People are also staying in their jobs longer and working more hours than they did a decade ago.
The all-work, all-the-time culture that appears to be taking hold sounded familiar to Simon Rostron, a partner in a public relations firm whose clients include some of London's large financial institutions. 
He said he longs for the days when a three-hour lunch over multiple bottles of claret was still the norm. "Today, people are actually arranging meetings at 2 p.m.," he added. "That is a cause for indigestion."
One of three British men and one of 10 women work more than 50 hours a week, said Prof. Peter Nolan, director of the Future of Work program at the Economic and Social Research Council. That is on average about 10 hours more than people work in most other European countries; Americans still work longer hours.
Yet Britain is two-thirds less productive than the United States and one-third less productive than Europe when it comes to manufacturing output, Professor Nolan continued.
The long hours are beginning to take a toll, it seems. Only 16 percent of those questioned said they would work longer hours than they do to help their organization, compared with 21 percent who said they would in 1992.
The findings have re-ignited a debate between business and labor groups. The Trades Union Congress, representing about 6.7 million workers, wants Britain to adhere to a European Union directive that limits people to a 48-hour workweek. The Confederation of British Industry is opposed to any limit.
"There is no need for a nanny state," Richard Dodd, a spokesman for the business federation, said today. 
John Monks, general secretary of the union group, countered, "People do not work long hours out of choice, but because of the pressures of the job."
Despite the government's effort to encourage investments in technology and breathe life into the digital economy, the fastest-growing jobs over the past decade were often menial, low-wage positions. The number of hairdressers grew the fastest, quadrupling 302 percent since 1992, Professor Nolan said. Stockers in stores ranked No. 8, behind nurses, housekeepers, call-center operators, welfare workers, education assistants and software engineers.

HEADLINE: Indonesian Official Urges U.S. to Resume Military Assistance 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, April 30 

 BODY:
A senior civilian official here has said that the United States should drop restrictions imposed almost three years ago on assistance to the Indonesian military and help restore what he called the "tarnished reputation" of this nation's army.
 Laksamana Sukardi, a close adviser to President Megawati Sukarnoputri, said in an interview that members of the United States Congress who wanted to continue curbs on military aid should come to Indonesia to understand why it was important to resume training and to send nonlethal equipment. Mr. Sukardi stopped short of advocating that the United States help supply the military with weapons. 
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Washington has repeatedly pressed Indonesia, where a shaky economic and democratic transition is under way, to take firmer action against groups and individuals suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden and his terrorism network, Al Qaeda.
The Bush administration, Mr. Sukardi said, expects Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, to "push the button on terror." But if the military remains discredited in the eyes of the public, he said, that will be an impossible task for a democratic government. 
Since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, the Bush administration has pondered how to deal with the Indonesian military, traditionally the institution that has kept this archipelago together as a nation. The Pentagon would like to resume military relations; the State Department is more reluctant. In Congress, backing for the restrictions remains, though Pentagon officials have said they believe that this Congressional support is eroding.
Mr. Sukardi said he originally supported the Congressional restrictions on American aid, imposed after the Indonesian military's involvement in killing civilians in East Timor as that region sought independence from Indonesia. The United Nations has helped administer East Timor since its residents voted for independence in August 1999, and the nation will officially gain independence on May 20. Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to attend a ceremony in East Timor on that day.
The events in East Timor are now in the past, Mr. Sukardi said.
Under a law authored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, Indonesia must bring the military officers thought to be responsible for the deaths in East Timor to account before it can again qualify for American military assistance. 
A trial of a handful of midlevel military officers on charges relating to East Timor is in progress but it appears unlikely that the trial will meet the Congressional test. Mr. Sukardi suggested that it was unreasonable to expect a free and fair trial when almost all the judges were holdovers from the authoritarian government of General Suharto, which ended with his ouster in 1998.
"I supported Leahy," said Mr. Sukardi, an economist, who was a prominent member of the democratic opposition during General Suharto's last years in power. "But Leahy has to change his mind. He has to come here and see common sense." In March, the Bush administration sent Congress proposals to help Indonesia form a domestic peacekeeping force and to provide the police with counterterrorism training. 
Both measures fall short of the kind of assistance that the government here seeks and that Pentagon officials would like to offer. In particular, the Indonesian government would like a resumption of military training in the United States for its officers.

HEADLINE: Arena Plan For Newark Is Said to Stall On Insurance 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 1 

 BODY:
The McGreevey administration and the YankeeNets organization were close to agreement today on the terms of the joint state and private financing of a sports arena in downtown Newark, some officials close to the negotiations said. But others said some last-minute clarifications and apparent differences over those items were blocking the signing and announcement of a memorandum of understanding on the $355 million arena.
 Neither the state officials nor the YankeeNets representatives participating in the nearly three months of talks on the deal would publicly describe the issues that stood in the way of a final announcement. 
 But some familiar with the negotiations said the state was pressing the YankeeNets, which owns the New Jersey Devils and the New Jersey Nets, to absorb any cost overruns in the construction of the 18,500-seat arena and insisting that the YankeeNets buy insurance for the part of the financing that would come from some $165 million or $170 million in state-issued bonds. 
The goal of having such insurance and having it paid for by the YankeeNets, one official close to the negotiations said, was to ensure that New Jersey taxpayers would not be held liable for paying off the bonds if the arena failed to generate the revenues to do that. But it is no by means clear that the arena bonds will be secure enough that anyone will want to insure them.
The word of a potential agreement came on the day that Gov. James E. McGreevey set some three months ago as a possible deadline. At that time, he rejected proposals for a Newark arena that had been championed by his predecessor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, saying that he wanted his own plan and would have one by May 1. It also comes as the Newark mayoral race is entering its final lap, and Governor McGreevey is seeking ways to aid the campaign of Mayor Sharpe James, an advocate of the arena.
Paul Aronsohn, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, conceded today that the governor had missed his own self-imposed deadline for a final deal. But Mr. Aronsohn insisted that it was because "he wants it done right" and was willing to wait.
Calls for comment to Len Coleman, the lead negotiator for the YankeeNets in the effort to get a replacement arena for the current Continental Airlines Arena at the Meadowlands, were not returned.
Even with a memorandum of understanding, any plan would have to be approved by the State Legislature, where hostility toward any new state spending, sports franchises in general and the shifting of a sports venue from one county to another is particularly intense.
Such hostility doomed the plan advanced by Mr. DiFrancesco last year, even as his Republican Party controlled both houses of the Legislature. Supporters added more and more pork-barrel projects for other areas of the state in an attempt to make the Newark arena more palatable, and the entire plan collapsed of its sheer weight.
The plan being developed is similar to the earlier one in that both call for the state to create a sports and entertainment district covering an area around the proposed arena in downtown Newark. Sales, income and hotel tax revenues generated by the increased economic activity in this district would be pledged to pay off bonds that the state agency would issue to help finance the arena. 
In the district, the sales tax would be 6 percent, compared with the much lower 3 percent allowed in the rest of Newark under the state's Urban Enterprise Zone program, intended to spur economic activity in struggling urban areas.
Under the McGreevey administration's plan, the state would issue only $165 million in bonds and not $190 million, as Mr. DiFrancesco had proposed. The YankeeNets would contribute $140 million to $150 million to the plan, up from the $115 million previously called for. The remaining $50 million is to come from the Newark and Essex County governments.
Getting insurance on municipal bonds is not unusual, said Michael Decker, senior vice president of the Bond Market Association, which represents underwriters and traders of such bonds.
Mr. Decker said that greater insulation against liability was rarely the motivation of other issuers. In most cases they seek insurance to lift the rating of the bonds in a way that will lower the interest rate they have to pay. Also, he said the insurance was sought only on the higher-rated investment-grade bonds, which would then rise to the highest rating.
In the case of the Newark arena bonds, it has never been clear whether the bond market would view them as a high investment-grade bond that could benefit from insurance or a speculative bond on which traditional insurance may not be obtainable.

HEADLINE: Greater Share Of Income Is Committed To College 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Poor and middle-class families have had to use a steadily larger portion of their income to attend the nation's public universities over the last two decades, as state spending on higher education and financial aid to students lagged behind steep rises in tuition, according to a study released yesterday by an independent research organization.
 The study found that, on average, poor families spent 25 percent of their annual income for their children to attend public four-year colleges in 2000, compared with 13 percent in 1980. For middle-class families, the percentage of annual income required to attend public colleges nearly doubled as well, to about 7 percent from 4 percent. For the wealthiest families, there was no increase from the 2 percent spent in 1980. 
 While the average amount each state spent on higher education per student rose by 13 percent over that period, to $6,747, state institutions raised their tuition and fees by 107 percent, to $3,512, the study found.
"All of these trends are unhealthy for the future of educational opportunity in this country," said Patrick M. Callan, the president of the National Center for Higher Education in San Jose, Calif., which commissioned the study with the support of the Ford Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts. "If we continue at this pace for the next 10 to 20 years, we'll choke off a lot of opportunity."
The study, overseen by an advisory committee that included David W. Breneman, a prominent education economist from the University of Virginia, is expected to add fuel to a growing national debate over the affordability of the nation's public universities, which were created to make higher education accessible to those who could least afford it. Another recent study, by the economists Michael S. McPherson and Morton Owen Schapiro, found that the percentage of high-achieving students who do not enroll in college is five times higher among those who are poor than those who are rich.
Dr. Breneman, who is the dean of the Curry School of Education, said he hoped the data in the report would help reverse the course of higher education financing in the 1990's, which he characterized as "an explosion of financial aid programs aimed at middle- and upper-income groups," including tuition tax credits supported by the Clinton administration and merit-based aid programs like the Hope Scholarships in Georgia.
"Where are the poor?" he asked. "The whole issue of access for low income folks got lost in the dust."
The study, titled "Losing Ground," found some fault with government. The authors criticized state lawmakers for not increasing aid at the same rate as college costs, and decreasing it in times of recession, and they lamented that the federal Pell Grant program, which is aimed at the neediest students, covered only 57 percent of tuition at public four-year colleges in 1999, compared with 98 percent in 1986.
But in an interview, Mr. Callan, the president of the organization that initiated the study, said the universities bore a great deal of responsibility. Among the factors that had sent public universities' costs spiraling upward, he said, were bidding wars for the best students and faculty members and ambitious plans to open research centers with marginal educational value.
"Everyone wants to be Harvard or Berkeley or Michigan," Mr. Callan said. "It's very expensive."
Among those states cited by the study as widening the gap in affordability over the last 10 years were Alabama, which raised tuition at public four-year universities by 41 percent (to $3,261 from $2,313) while decreasing state-awarded financial aid by 45 percent (to $46 per student from $84); Arizona, which raised tuition by 24 percent (to $2,486 from $2,007) while decreasing financial aid by 50 percent (to $14 per student from $28); and Hawaii, which increased tuition 79 percent (to $3,253 from $1,814) while decreasing financial aid grants to students by 44 percent (to $11 from $20).
Among the study's recommendations were that states take family income into account when cutting aid to higher education and encourage students to earn college credit in high school in some subjects, perhaps by testing out of entry-level college courses. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 6, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a finding that tuition at public universities was costing an increasing portion of income for poor and middle-class families misstated the name of the organization that helped commission the study. It is the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, not the National Center for Higher Education.

PERSON: Msgr. George G. Higgins 

HEADLINE: Msgr. George Higgins, Adviser To U.S. Bishops, Is Dead at 86 

BYLINE:  By PETER STEINFELS 

 BODY:
Msgr. George G. Higgins, for decades a major adviser to the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, an outspoken supporter of organized labor and an influential figure in improving ties between Catholics and Jews, died yesterday in LaGrange Park, Ill. He was 86 and lived much of his life in Washington.
 Ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1940, Monsignor Higgins completed a doctorate in labor economics at the Catholic University of America in 1944, then took a summer job in the social action department of the American Catholic bishops' Washington office. 
 The summer job stretched into 36 years on the bishops' conference staff, lobbying for generally liberal legislation in Washington, negotiating in California on behalf of newly unionized farm workers and traveling to Poland to cheer the Solidarity labor movement as it struggled with a Communist government. 
In August 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded Monsignor Higgins the Presidential Medal of Freedom for championing workers' rights, civil rights and religious tolerance.
At the Catholic Church's Second Vatican Council (1962-65), he was a consultant and spokesman for the American bishops. It was as an intellectual catalyst, however, that he influenced the passage of the council's landmark statements on religious liberty, the church in the modern world and the church's relations with other religions, especially Judaism.
A 1984 biography of Monsignor Higgins, by Gerald M. Costello, described his role at the council as constantly "encouraging and goading, convening and presiding, arguing and reconciling."
The description fit many of his other endeavors. Unlike religious leaders hailed for dramatic gestures or prophetic eloquence, Monsignor Higgins did much of his important work out of public sight, in small meetings, in judiciously worded speeches and articles, in statements drafted for others or in simply building personal relationships. 
He wrote extensively about Catholic-Jewish relations. But to consolidate the council's gains in that area, he also had a permanent office dealing with Catholic-Jewish relations created in the bishops' national bureaucracy. 
Last June, an international committee sponsored by the Vatican and Jewish groups honored him as one of eight great living pioneers of the Catholic-Jewish dialogue worldwide.
Having long protested the plight of migrant farm workers, Monsignor Higgins endorsed the nationwide grape boycott led by Cesar Chavez in the 1960 to gain recognition for the United Farm Workers.
But more significant were hundreds of long negotiating sessions that Monsignor Higgins, as consultant to a bishops' committee, held over four years with farm workers and growers up and down California's San Joaquin Valley.
His success at those meetings and in arbitrating other disputes was often attributed to his imperturbable temperament, his sense of when to break off talks for a drink and his judgment about what was essential and what could be compromised.
One point on which Monsignor Higgins never found room for compromise was the basic right of workers to unionize and bargain collectively. 
Although he sometimes accused the labor movement of complacency, corruption or racism, he constantly defended trade unions as indispensable to democracy and social welfare. He also insisted that Catholic institutions -- schools and hospitals in particular -- should welcome unionization and negotiate in good faith with their employees.
George Gilmary Higgins was born on Jan. 21, 1916, in Chicago and reared in a strongly pro-union family in nearby LaGrange. He is survived by two sisters, Bridget Doonan of La Grange Park, and Ann Maronic of Chicago.
He described his father, a night foreman at Chicago's central post office, as "a blue-collar intellectual" who implanted a love of reading and an appreciation of intellectual give-and-take.
Monsignor Higgins's flow of ideas filled 56 years of a weekly column, "The Yardstick," that appeared in many Catholic newspapers from 1945 until last year. He published one book, "Organized Labor and the Church" (Paulist, 1993), written with William Bole.
Monsignor Higgins's contacts with labor's higher leadership dated from 1940 when, as a graduate student in labor economics, he was invited to what he expected would be a discussion of labor-management relations at the Washington apartment of Philip Murray, a Catholic who was president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. 
"The only formal education I received that evening was an undergraduate course in poker," Monsignor Higgins recalled. "Mrs. Murray ended up with all the chips."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A model for evaluating the use of development dollars, south of the border.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
THE Bush administration is casting about for new ideas on how to use $5 billion of aid a year for poor countries to achieve accountability and results in economic development. It would do well to look south, to the Progresa program in Mexico, for a successful model that has reduced child labor, increased educational levels and improved health and nutrition for the poor.
The idea is simple: pay poor families to send their children to school and visit health care providers. Careful evaluations suggest the strategy is working. 
 In 1997, Mexico began Progresa, long advocated by economists like Santiago Levy, Mexico's director general of social security. Families are sent a check every other month if their children regularly attend school in grades 3 through 9; the amount varies from about $10 a month in the third grade to $35 for girls in the ninth grade. Girls in secondary school are paid 15 percent more than are boys because girls have a higher dropout rate in Mexico. 
 Families are also given grants to buy school supplies and monthly food subsidies if they get medical checkups, immunizations and health education lectures. The money goes directly from the central government to the mothers of the children. 
The education grants are substantial, about two-thirds of what secondary-school students would receive for full-time work. In 2000, some 2.5 million rural families received benefits, about a ninth of all families in Mexico. The total cost was around $1 billion, or 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua and other countries have started similar programs or are in the process of doing so. 
The Mexican government did something unusual: it phased in Progresa in a way that made it easier to evaluate its impact. Specifically, 320 villages were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received benefits beginning in May 1998, and 186 more to a control group that did not receive benefits until 20 months later. The experiences of the control group provide a natural benchmark against which to judge how the treatment group would have fared without Progresa.
The International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington has coordinated an extensive evaluation of Progresa. Some 24,000 households from the villages were surveyed on five occasions from 1997 to 1999. Several studies are available from www.ifpri.org. The effect on school enrollment is examined in studies by T. Paul Schultz of Yale and Jere Behrman and Petra Todd of the University of Pennsylvania.
While more than 90 percent of rural Mexican children attend primary school, 45 percent drop out after the sixth grade, when students advance to secondary school. Enrollment also falls steeply after the ninth grade, when 42 percent of students leave. Increasing secondary-school enrollment is a priority.
Progresa increased transitions to secondary school by nearly 20 percent. Educational attainment is estimated to increase by two-thirds of a year eventually because of Progresa. Larger effects would probably arise if benefits were extended beyond the ninth grade. 
Child labor decreased as enrollment increased. Eligibility for Progresa benefits led child employment to decline about 15 percent, according to research by Susan Parker of the Center for Research and Teaching of Economics in Mexico City and Emmanuel Skoufias, the Progresa project director for the food policy research institute. 
Paul Gertler, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, has found that Progresa has a positive impact on the health of participants, both young children and adults.
There have been few reports of corruption in Progresa, probably because benefits are centrally distributed without involvement of local officials. Administrative costs are around 9 percent of total costs. 
Professors Behrman and Todd estimated that by raising future earning power, the educational benefits of Progresa alone exceed the costs by 40 to 110 percent. The effects on health and nutrition raise the benefits even further. 
The fact that Progresa's benefits were delayed for the control group localities -- the feature that makes the evaluation results so persuasive -- has generated criticism in Mexico. Given limited budgets and administrative capacity, however, the program could not possibly have been phased in everywhere at once. Random assignment of localities was arguably the fairest way to run the program. It also provided a compelling method to measure results and ensure accountability.
Moreover, the evaluation has provided powerful ammunition for advocates of the program to press for its continuation under the new government of Vicente Fox, and in other countries. Indeed, the Fox government recently changed Progresa's name to Oportunidades but retained the program's main elements. The government plans to extend it to urban areas, with the help of a $1 billion loan -- the largest ever -- from the Inter-American Development Bank.
Progresa is effective because it addresses a root cause of low school attendance and child labor: low family income. The main determinant of whether children work or attend school -- both across countries and across families -- is family income. Most families in poor countries would prefer to send children to school instead of to work, but they cannot afford to forgo the income their children bring home. Progresa raises family income and reduces the cost of attending school. 
Although Progresa is not a panacea, it appears to increase education and reduce child labor more effectively than popular alternatives. A study by Professor Parker and David Coady of the food policy research institute suggests that at least in rural sections of Mexico, Progresa is a more cost-effective way to increase enrollment than is building more schools. 
Worldwide, some 120 million children age 5 to 14 work full time, according to the International Labor Organization. Virtually all live in poor countries. Nearly three billion people live on less than $2 a day.
The $5 billion in development aid the Bush administration has requested will not have much impact given the size of the problems, especially if it is spread over more than a handful of countries. But if the aid could be used to develop and rigorously test programs like Progresa, the knowledge garnered could stimulate more development aid and encourage poor countries to pursue more effective policies.

HEADLINE: Study Tracks Big Increase in Lobbying Money at Statehouses Around Nation 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
A new study documents a rising flood of lobbying money in state capitals around the nation, showing that the amount spent on lobbying state legislators and disclosed by states has nearly doubled in five years.
 The study, by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit Washington research group that monitors money in politics, shows that lobbyists spent $570 million in 2000 to influence legislators in 34 states, a rise of 91 percent from 1995, when fewer states reported such spending. Sixteen states still do not tabulate lobbyist spending, so the national total would be much higher. 
 The study documented nearly 37,000 businesses, associations and interest groups that are registered lobbyists in the 50 states, a ratio of about five lobbyists to every state legislator. The largest lobbying groups in nearly every capital city were the ones paid by the industries that were most closely regulated: insurance, education, local governments, and health care.
"It's become a huge business," said Diane Renzulli, a principal author of the study. "It takes money to access state lawmakers just as it does in Washington, but in the states there's far less attention to the givers and what they got."
The center, which compiled the lobbyist disclosure forms from each state that requires them, found that California lobbyists had by far the largest operation, spending $180 million in 2000, compared with $66 million spent in New York, the state with the next highest amount.
In part, that is because California's economy is so large and thus the stakes higher for groups affected by legislation. The authors also noted the penchant by a full-time legislature, like California's, for considering a great deal of legislation, which lobbyists are often paid to kill. 
But, the report said, lobbyists also wield outsized influence in states with only a part-time legislature and staff. In states like Indiana, which have only one legislative aide for every two legislators, lobbyists often write bills affecting their industries. 
State legislators themselves often have close ties to the industries and issues they vote on, the center found. 
The center found that one in five of the nation's 7,400 state legislators sat on a committee that regulated industries or issues in which they had a personal financial interest, and that 18 percent had a financial connection to a business or group that lobbied in their statehouse.
The report included several examples of insurance lawyers who sit on insurance committees or banking executives who write banking laws. In Arkansas, Ms. Renzulli said, one legislator was also a registered lobbyist. Though the center recommends disclosure laws, many large states do not tally lobbying totals, including Colorado, Michigan and North Carolina. Tennessee does not require expense reporting by lobbyists.
At the National Conference of State Legislatures, officials acknowledged the prevalence of lobbying but said the study did not show that it was necessarily an evil.
"The question is not so much how much money is spent, but what does the money get them?" said Peggy Kerns, director of the conference's Center for Ethics and Government. "They're suggesting it buys a special influence, but that's not necessarily so."

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls As Top Official Casts Doubts On Intervention 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
After saying his goal was to avoid upsetting the financial markets, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill did just that today by sparring with members of a Congressional committee about the nation's financial condition and leaving some investors with doubts about his willingness to defend the weakening dollar.
 In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. O'Neill stressed that nothing he said should be interpreted as any change in the longstanding position of the United States that a strong dollar is good for the economy. He expressed considerable annoyance that traders routinely read more into his statements about the dollar and the economy than he intends, simply to generate volatility in the markets. 
 But he said nothing to suggest that he would intervene to stem a continuing slide in the dollar's value, noting that government action to support the currency cannot be effective in the long run if it runs counter to the collective judgment of the financial markets.
"I'm saying I think there's a real doubt about the effectiveness of interventions or words about interventions," Mr. O'Neill said in response to a question about whether he might support an action like the coordinated effort by the seven big industrial democracies in 1985 to bring down the dollar's value.
On a day when the dollar was already losing ground against the euro and the Japanese yen, Mr. O'Neill's comments were taken as a green light by currency traders to keep pushing the dollar down.
By the end of the day, the dollar was trading at 127.45 yen, down from 128.57 on Tuesday and 134 yen in early February. The euro rose to 90.55 cents, up from 90.03 cents a day earlier and 85 cents in late January.
"I think there's concern on the part of traders that this represents a stealth move away from the strong dollar policy toward a more laissez-faire dollar policy," said Lara Rhame, senior currency economist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. "Markets now need to be sold on the dollar, and O'Neill has never been interested in doing that."
While Mr. O'Neill's comments were taken by currency markets to undermine the dollar, his testimony emphasized the fundamental strengths of the economy and signaled again his unwillingness to drive the dollar down deliberately to make American exports more competitive on international markets.
The Treasury Department controls whether and when the United States, through the Federal Reserve, buys and sells dollars and other currencies to raise or lower the value of the dollar. Mr. O'Neill's immediate predecessors, Lawrence H. Summers and Robert E. Rubin, both adhered almost slavishly to the same language in describing currency policy, saying a strong dollar was "in the interests of the United States." 
Since taking office 15 months ago, Mr. O'Neill has more or less stuck to that formulation, but often with an added emphasis that the dollar's value is the byproduct of a fundamentally strong economy and the perception that the United States offers the world's best opportunities for investment.
But to currency traders, his slight variance from the established formulation has been enough to justify testing Mr. O'Neill's commitment to the dollar's value almost every time he speaks about the subject.
The dollar has been weakening for several months in part because of a perception among international investors that the recovery from last year's recession might be tepid and that corporate profits and stock prices in the United States might therefore remain depressed.
But several members of the banking committee pointed to evidence that some countries, including Japan and China, were deliberately keeping their currencies undervalued to give their exporters an advantage in world markets.
After Mr. O'Neill's appearance, economists and representatives of business groups and organized labor told the committee that the dollar remains so overvalued that the United States is having trouble competing internationally, costing jobs and profits at home.
"The dollar is way out of whack and everybody knows it," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
But there is also growing concern that the United States is vulnerable because of its large current account deficit. The current account measures the balance between the inflow of goods, services and capital into the United States and the outflow. It has been running at a deficit of more than 4 percent of the economy's total output in recent years, and after falling slightly last year is expected to rise again this year, putting it at a level that in other nations has often presaged an economic crisis. 
Some economists say that if the flow of capital into the United States dries up, the dollar could fall sharply in value, reigniting the threat of inflation and putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates.
But other economists say the deficit merely reflects the relative attractiveness of investing in the United States and does not present any particular threat to the dollar. That was the position taken by Mr. O'Neill today -- and it led him into several sharp exchanges with the banking committee's chairman, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland.
"I am really taken aback that we have a secretary of the Treasury who doesn't perceive any problems associated with this large current account deficit," Mr. Sarbanes said.
Mr. O'Neill replied that most of the steps to reduce the deficit -- like limiting the inflow of foreign capital or of imports -- would be like cutting off an arm because it might someday become diseased.
"I just don't understand the thinking that creates what I consider to be an artificial, intellectually useful construct, and then take it to a policy conclusion that does damage," Mr. O'Neill said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Says U.S. Is Near Borrowing Limit 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
Faced with lower than expected tax revenues, the Treasury Department said today that the federal government would hit its legal borrowing limit in about two weeks, putting pressure on Congress to agree to increase the debt ceiling to avert a potential financial crisis.
 The department had previously said it expected to have enough cash on hand to carry the government into late June without bumping against the limit on borrowing. But after tallying most of April's tax receipts, it said today that it would face a cash crunch by the middle of this month and that resorting to financial gimmicks would extend the deadline only by a matter of weeks. 
 Without an increase in the ceiling, the government would be unable to borrow to cover some of its debts, leaving it in default for the first time and potentially ruining its reputation as the world's most credit-worthy borrower. 
The problem with the debt limit is largely a technical issue that has more to do with how the government accounts for its obligation to pay Social Security benefits in the future than with its current financial strength, but it has become a political hot potato in Congress.
Republicans, many of whom were elected on pledges to hold down the growth of government, are reluctant to cast an election-year vote to allow the government to borrow more than the current limit of $5.95 trillion.
At the same time, Democrats have seized on the need for an increase in the limit as evidence that the tax cut pushed through Congress last year by President Bush was fiscally ruinous.
"No one wants the government to default on its responsibilities," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. "But the people and their representatives have a right to know how the Bush administration plans to get the nation out of the fiscal mess before it authorizes a debt-ceiling increase."
In the House, Republican leaders have not settled on a plan to bring the debt limit increase to a vote. They have signaled that their most likely course is to attach the measure to another piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support, most likely a supplemental spending bill that would give the administration $27 billion for the military and domestic security.
In the Senate, Democratic leaders say that they will wait for the House to make the first move and that they may approve an increase in the limit of less than the $750 billion sought by the White House. But they have said they are willing to vote on the measure without attaching it to unrelated legislation.
Mr. Bush has repeatedly urged Congress not to play politics with the issue but has not offered Republicans enough political cover that they are willing to vote on it any sooner than they must.
The Treasury Department brushed up against the debt limit last month but averted an immediate crisis by borrowing money temporarily from government retirement accounts. It said today that it would probably use the same technique this month if Congress did not resolve the issue but that doing so would keep the government solvent only until the second half of June.
The government's finances have deteriorated in part because last year's recession, combined with the tax cut, cut more deeply into tax receipts than anticipated. Government and private budget analysts projected last week that the budget deficit for the current fiscal year is likely to be more than $100 billion, twice what they had expected.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Reconsider Applicants Rejected for Aid After Attack 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency promised members of the New York Congressional delegation yesterday that the agency would immediately reopen more than 7,000 applications for housing assistance that the agency denied after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 The director, Joseph M. Allbaugh, said he had ordered the review because of what he called "a perception that FEMA has denied assistance" to those who should have received it. He said that the thousands of rejected cases would be reviewed by "a select group of caseworkers," and that steps would be taken to avoid misunderstandings about exactly who is eligible and "to ensure that all eligible cases are assisted." 
 The announcement came after days of increasing criticism in Congress about the agency's performance in responding to the Sept. 11 attacks. To date, the agency has disbursed far less in individual assistance to people economically affected by the attacks than it has in most major disasters, in part because it has rejected 7 out of 10 applicants for housing aid. The problems with the agency's distribution of aid were detailed in The New York Times last week. 
Mr. Allbaugh's decision will affect applications to the agency's mortgage and rental assistance program, which covers up to 18 months of mortgage or rent payments for anyone in a major disaster area who lost at least 25 percent of his income "as a result" of the catastrophe.
Local relief officials at first expected that the FEMA housing aid program would offer just the sort of assistance needed to address the deep, widespread economic damage caused by the terrorist attacks. Government officials have estimated that about 75,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in income were lost to people in the New York disaster region.
But interviews and the agency's own records show that those who were rejected included hundreds of Chinatown seamstresses and Manhattan hotel workers, many of them with claims to aid that seemed legitimate. In one case raised with the agency by Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Nita M. Lowey, both New York Democrats, the agency denied help to a disabled veteran who sold hats and gloves on the sidewalks of lower Broadway, even though he provided sworn statements from shopkeepers confirming that he was a regular vendor in the area.
"This was uncharacteristic of FEMA," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. "I have a lot of faith that this will be corrected and corrected quickly."
In a letter to Mr. Nadler yesterday, Mr. Allbaugh encouraged him to forward to the agency "any specific cases that have not been approved but which appear, such as those mentioned in your letter, to be obvious cases for assistance."
The housing aid rejection rate, much higher than in previous disasters, is part of the reason that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided less than $65 million in individual assistance for families in the disaster area. By comparison, the agency ultimately spent more than $1.4 billion in similar direct financial help to families affected by the Northridge earthquake in California in 1994.
The agency has acknowledged that one reason the payouts have been low is that thousands of people were denied housing aid after the agency decided to limit benefits to those who could prove that their lost income was a "direct result" of the attacks. That new standard, which goes beyond the laws and regulations that have traditionally governed disaster relief efforts, substantially raised the burden of proof on jobless workers trying to qualify. 
In addition, some agency officials said their housing assistance efforts had been plagued by missteps. In one, some 15,000 people received faulty aid applications that increased the risk of rejection.
Mr. Allbaugh's announcement yesterday does not specifically address the new "direct result" requirement, which he defended in a recent interview as a fiscally responsible way of preventing unemployed workers far from the designated disaster areas from claiming assistance. But he did agree to meet with members of Congress from the region to discuss the criteria for qualifying for the program, said Senator Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat from New Jersey.
"FEMA's apparent decision to change the eligibility standard, without any basis in law to do so, could be depriving thousands of the assistance they need to keep their homes, pay their bills and feed their families," Mr. Corzine said in a letter to Mr. Allbaugh on Tuesday. 
Yesterday, Mr. Corzine said that Mr. Allbaugh indicated that the "direct result" standard is "how he is being told he has to interpret the statute." Both Mr. Corzine and Mr. Schumer said that they had volunteered to work with the federal agency on any statutory changes necessary to extend and improve the housing aid program, which is scheduled to expire this month.
Mr. Schumer said he had been assured by Mr. Allbaugh that New York would ultimately get all the aid it deserved. "But he is concerned that if we don't clarify the law, people in Cincinnati will claim eligibility for the program," Mr. Schumer said.
The agency's role in the continuing relief efforts for people in New York and northern Virginia -- including those thrown out of work when Reagan National Airport was temporarily closed -- is increasingly important. Major charities have for months been cutting back on their aid to economic victims of the attacks, whose unemployment benefits will soon expire.
Some officials at the agency, who opposed the tightened standard, said privately that the high rejection rate for the housing aid program demonstrated that thousands of needy families, facing eviction or foreclosure, were unable to meet the stricter standard.
On Sunday, a coalition of community organizations, including the Chinese Staff and Workers Association and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, will hold a town hall meeting in front of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's offices at 141 Worth Street in Lower Manhattan to focus attention on problems their members have had in dealing with the agency. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's reopening of more than 7,000 rejected applications for housing aid misstated the location for a meeting called by community groups with complaints about the agency. It will be 2 to 5 p.m. on Sunday at Public School 124, 40 Division Street, in Manhattan, not at 141 Worth Street.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
For the Best Thoroughbreds, It Quickly Pays to Not to Race

BYLINE:  By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 1 

 BODY:
A full field of 20 horses is expected to race in the 128th Kentucky Derby on Saturday, and about 6:07 p.m. one of them will walk into the most famous winner's circle in America and be draped with a blanket of roses. By outrunning the others at the mile-and-a-quarter distance, the 3-year-old will have earned a place in horse racing's history books.
 But if recent history is a guide, the winner of the Derby will not last in the nation's consciousness for long, and enthusiasm over the annual quest for a Triple Crown champion will give way to a familiar summertime lament: Where have all the great horses gone? 
 The answer is to the commercial breeding shed, where the prospect of millions of dollars has persuaded owners to take their potential superstar horses off the racetrack. This development has benefited the horse farms, especially those in Kentucky, but it is troubling for some in an industry trying to find a foothold in a sports market crowded with everything from the National Basketball Association to Nascar and all possessing a healthy concentration of stars. 
Two years ago, Fusaichi Pegasus caught the nation's fancy with an emphatic victory in the Kentucky Derby, but raced only three more times before being retired to the life of a stallion. His owner, Fusao Sekiguchi, sold him for more than $60 million in the weeks after the Derby. 
Could he have done better financially by continuing to run him? Not likely. The career leader in earnings is a horse named Cigar, who won $10 million in purses running through age 6 in the 1990's.
Today, Fusaichi Pegasus stands at Ashford Stud in Kentucky, where he is bred to more than 100 mares a season, commanding $135,000 a mare.
"There is much more economic incentive to stop on a horse early and breed rather than risk injury," said Dan Rosenberg, the president of Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Ky. "Just do the arithmetic."
Others in the industry worry that commercial breeders focus too much on pedigrees that produce precocious and fast, but not necessarily sound, runners.
These yearlings look like, and sometimes command, a million dollars in the sales ring, but often have fleeting racing careers.
Horses of all abilities are just not running as often. In 1970 each thoroughbred averaged 10.22 starts a year, according to the Jockey Club, which maintains a registry of all thoroughbreds foaled in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. In 2001 that number dwindled to 6.97 starts.
"I'm afraid unsoundness may be taking over the industry," said Cecil Seaman, a bloodstock consultant who for 30 years has studied the biomechanics of horses and has created a database of more than 60,000 horses. 
"Owners and breeders are looking at the millions that ring up on the auction tote board instead of the winner's circle at the racetrack. Our industry needs stars, and we don't have them because they are broken down in their 2- and 3-year-old seasons."
Last year's Derby winner, Monarchos, clocked the second-fastest winning time in the race's history, but subsequently finished sixth in the Preakness and third in the Belmont. He was retired after one start as a 4-year-old with torn ligaments in his left ankle. Point Given showed signs of being a superhorse by capturing four Grade I stakes in succession last summer: the Preakness, the Belmont, the Haskell and the Travers. But he was gone before Labor Day, sent into retirement as a result of a strained tendon in his foreleg, an injury that in years past might have been repaired so the colt could return to the racetrack.
Wayne McIlwraith, a surgeon and past president of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, said there was no definitive study on how breeding may or may not have weakened thoroughbreds, but acknowledged that he and his colleagues had recognized increasing fragility in racehorses.
"We are aware that certain stallions have defects in their progeny," McIlwraith said. "They may have great 2-year-olds, but often don't have many 3- or 4-year-olds racing. What will be interesting is, when we do have conclusive evidence, what will these big boys at the sales do? Will they go for the precocious runner at the expense of a sound horse?"
Only 11 horses have swept the Triple Crown, a series of three races for 3-year-olds contested in the span of five weeks that begins on the first Saturday in May in Louisville, moves on to the Preakness in Baltimore and concludes with the Belmont Stakes in New York. Sir Barton, in 1919, was the first, Affirmed, in 1978, was the last, and in between horses like Secretariat and Seattle Slew graced magazine covers, attracted fan clubs and gave the Sport of Kings some star power.
While horse racing is coming off a Triple Crown season last year that had increased television ratings and news media exposure, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association concedes it has had trouble maintaining the attention of the 19 million casual fans its research has identified after the spring classics.
Beyond remarkable speed, intelligence and heart, the Triple Crown horses of yore shared a vital quality: durability.
The 1941 Triple Crown champion, Whirlaway, made 60 starts in his career, and the 1946 champion, Assault, raced as a 7-year-old. In fact, the 11 Triple Crown winners together made 104 starts at age 4 or older, and won 57 of them.
"When those Triple Crown horses were running, horse racing was a game," said Rosenberg of Three Chimneys Farm. "Now it's a business."
The most recent Kentucky Derby winners have hinted at possessing their forerunners' brilliance, but have not come close to their longevity. Of the Derby's past 11 winners, four did not race beyond their 3-year-old year and the remaining seven combined for 50 starts as older horses, winning 15 of them.
Still, they are coveted and highly valued at stud. Silver Charm, the 1997 Derby and Preakness winner, came within a neck of sweeping the Triple Crown at Belmont Park. Silver Charm commands $25,000 a coupling. Besides Fusaichi Pegasus' stud fee of $135,000, other recent Derby winners receive stud fees from $5,000 (Grindstone, 1996) to $80,000 (Thunder Gulch, 1995).
Rosenberg likes to cite the example of War Chant to illustrate how big a business breeding is. The colt finished ninth in the 2000 Derby but capped a seven-race, five-victory career the following fall by winning the Grade I, $1 million Breeders Cup Mile at Churchill Downs. War Chant is a son of Danzig, one of the world's top sires. He commands $75,000 a coupling and averages 85 to 100 mares a season.
At 100 mares, War Chant returns $7.5 million a year, a figure that will possibly increase exponentially with age. "Even if he won all his races as a 4- or 5-year-old, he couldn't equal that money," Rosenberg said.
Breeding is more art than science, and the maxim "Breed the best to the best and hope for the best" remains operative in sheds across central Kentucky. Rosenberg acknowledges that the current market demand is for pedigrees that produce fast runners who perform early in their careers. There is no better example of that than Storm Cat, the highest-priced sire in the world at $500,000 a mare. Storm Cat ran eight times, never in a Triple Crown race, and won four of them, but he is valued because he sires for speed.
Rosenberg acknowledges there are dangers in this path.
"Speed and precociousness may be incongruous with soundness," he said.
It is also why an accomplished and durable racehorse like Silver Charm has what appears to be a bargain stud fee of $25,000. His racing career dwarfs the pricier War Chant and Fusaichi Pegasus. The gray is the fourth-richest racehorse in history with more than $6.9 million in earnings, finished in the money in 21 of 24 starts, traveled to and won the Dubai World Cup, and demonstrated his soundness by racing and winning a stakes race as a 5-year-old.
Still, until his first foals hit the racetrack, Silver Charm is penalized for a modest pedigree and the fact that he was a Florida-bred.
"In the sales rings, they sell the sizzle, not the steak," said Mike Pegram, owner of Real Quiet, the 1998 Derby and Preakness winner.
Like Silver Charm, Real Quiet was a nose away from sweeping the Triple Crown. He completed a hardy 20-race career but has attracted little attention as a stallion, commanding just $15,000 a mating. He cost Pegram $17,000 as a yearling, earned more than $3.2 million on the racetrack, but also possesses unfashionable breeding.
Even though Fusaichi Pegasus, who cost $4 million as a yearling, is the only Derby winner to cost more than $1 million, owners spent a record average price of $710,247 on potential big horses last year at the Keeneland July Selected Yearling Sale, the premier auction for blue-chip horses. In 2001, owners spent $473,044,553 on yearlings in North American sales rings, according to the Jockey Club.
Everything from year-round racing to souped-up racetracks and rich race purses for developing horses have contributed to the declining number of starts for racehorses. But John Nerud, the Hall of Fame trainer who campaigned Dr. Fager through 22 career starts, 18 of them victories, says the economics of commercial breeding has certainly changed the face of horse racing.
"There are a lot of horses who shouldn't be overraced at 2 years old, but when a guy pays a million dollars for a horse and there are races out there where he can start getting a return on his investment, owners want to run in them," Nerud said. "Yes, we're breeding pretty good horses, but the business is making it harder to keep them on the racetrack."

HEADLINE: Andersen Unable to Reach an Enron Deal 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Talks broke down yesterday between Arthur Andersen and the creditors and shareholders of Enron, who had sued the firm for signing off on Enron's erroneous financial statements. The parties were unable to agree on how to divide any payment by Andersen, people close to the negotiations said.
 The discussions between the Enron creditors and shareholders and Andersen had proceeded in fits and starts for several weeks. Last week, even as talks teetered on the brink of collapse, people close to them said that there was new hope for a deal. 
 But yesterday, after a round of conference calls involving the lawyers for Andersen and the various plaintiffs, it became clear that no agreement could be reached, people close to the talks said.
One person close to the negotiations said late yesterday that Eric D. Green, who was asked by a federal judge in Houston to mediate the talks, had already formally notified the court that they had failed to reach an agreement. Once the judge, Melinda Harmon, receives such notification, she may order the parties to try again or may allow the lawsuits against Andersen to go to trial.
In a statement released late yesterday afternoon, Andersen expressed regret over the failure of the talks but said that other parties were responsible for the lack of progress. "During these discussions, considerable progress was made, but unfortunately, the plaintiffs could not resolve several differences among themselves and with defendants other than Arthur Andersen," the firm said in its statement.
Mr. Green, the mediator, declined to comment on the status of negotiations.
"They'll go back to litigation, but in all likelihood at some point in the future there'll be a settlement," said Stephen P. Younger, a partner at Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler in New York, who is not involved in the negotiations. That trial might not be scheduled to begin for many months, he said, adding, "These cases, the vast majority of them, settle."
Lawyers for the plaintiffs have now made a risky gamble, because if Andersen loses at its criminal trial, a separate case that begins on Monday, there may not be much left of the firm to pay off the civil plaintiffs. Andersen proposed settling these lawsuits for $750 million several months ago, but the most recent settlement proposal was just $350 million, the result of the defection of clients. 
The shrinking -- and possibly now vanishing -- settlement will probably lead to lawsuits against other companies that could be liable for Enron's collapse, like banks and law firms.
"People are going to be firing at the banks to make up for what they couldn't get from Arthur Andersen," Mr. Younger said.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Increased 2.9% in April; Only Ford Lagged 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 1 

 BODY:
Every major automaker except Ford Motor reported sales increases last month, evidence of an economic recovery that helped propel the stock market today.
 Over all, automobile sales in the United States rose 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. 
 Ford's sales fell 7.4 percent last month, in spite of strength in the Land Rover and Jaguar division. 
Sales by General Motors rose 12.4 percent in April from a year earlier, a more robust performance than analysts expected. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, had a sales increase of 3 percent. Nissan's sales jumped nearly 15 percent, helped by a redesigned Altima sedan and a new luxury car, the G35, from its Infiniti division. United States sales by Toyota rose 0.3 percent, while sales by Honda increased 1.1 percent. 
"The shock is how strong it is," said Wendy B. Needham, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, referring to the industry's sales results. "That turned the whole market around today." 
Analysts had once expected the barrage of interest-free financing deals offered after the Sept. 11 attacks to cannibalize sales this year, but that has not happened. Some analysts are starting to believe that car demand has grown, whether the market is at a top or a bottom.
"We're in completely new territory now," Ms. Needham said.
Last month, sales were helped by the beginnings of a recovery in purchases by corporations and car rental companies, which have begun buying for their vehicle fleets after sharply cutting back following the terrorist attacks. 
"It was a clear depressant in the first quarter," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis, referring to sales to fleet customers. "Fleet deliveries for the industry were down about 20 percent, and we were actually worse than that in the first quarter." 
It did not help that one big G.M. customer, ANC Rental, the operator of Alamo and National, filed for bankruptcy protection in November. More recently, ANC has arranged financing and started to replenish its car fleet. That has helped. In April, fleet sales at G.M. rose by 4 percent from a month earlier. 
G.M. also stepped up its production today, adding 30,000 vehicles to the 1.5 million it said it would turn out in the second quarter. Looking ahead, however, there might be some slowing of production in the industry. After the free-financing deals last year, auto makers increased production early this year to rebuild inventories. That buildup accounted for a quarter of the growth in the nation's gross domestic product in the first quarter, according to Jarlath Costello, Ford's senior domestic economist.
"The contribution from inventories will likely ease over the next few quarters," he said, "suggesting the pace of G.D.P. growth will moderate also."
G.M. also announced a new incentive plan this week, 1-2-3, to replace its previous package. The cost of incentive plans has been high for the Big Three auto makers, eroding profits while foreign competitors have kept sales strong with lesser offers. 
G.M. officials said that the plan would bring an end to interest-free financing deals and replace them with rebates. But the plan will cost roughly the same, the company said. Auto makers often switch among rebates, interest-free financing and other offers as a way to provide a fresh coat of paint on their deals. 
G.M., which has been propelled almost exclusively by growth in sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles, also showed growth in car sales for the first time since last October. 
"The fundamentals are not as strong as they were back in 1999 or 2000 when we were at the peak of the expansion, but we have low inflation, relatively strong income growth, favorable interest rates, improvement in the employment front," Mr. Ballew of G.M. said. "All in all, not a bad backdrop as we try to gauge the direction of the industry."

HEADLINE: As WorldCom Struggles for Stability, Its MCI Phone Unit Underwhelms Wall St. 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
As the new president and chief executive of WorldCom, John W. Sidgmore, tries to restore Wall Street's faith in the company, one big question involves the future of MCI, WorldCom's most visible link to the typical phone user.
 With 20 million customers, 28,000 employees and revenue last year of $13.83 billion, MCI is the nation's second-largest long-distance phone company, after AT&T, and a leading provider of the networks that Internet service companies need to connect consumers and small businesses. 
 But MCI has come to be seen on Wall Street as a depressing example of the difference between a big business and a good business. Its revenue and profit have both declined as long-distance customers send e-mail and instant messages over the Internet instead of making phone calls, or use cellphones for the calls MCI once carried. 
To make matters worse, the giant local phone companies created by the breakup of the old Bell System have begun to win regulatory approval to sell long-distance services in their home markets. These companies -- Verizon, SBC Communications, BellSouth and Qwest -- are expected to take as much as 50 percent of the shrinking land-line long-distance business by 2005. And that market is projected to shrink in the United States in 2005 to $16.2 billion from $18.9 billion last year, according to Forrester Research. Forrester also expects the dial-up data market to slump to $5.4 billion in 2006 from $10.7 billion this year.
The man most responsible for making the best of MCI's tough situation is Wayne Huyard, an 18-year veteran of the company who carries the title of chief operating officer for the MCI unit. Mr. Huyard has put almost all his strategic bets on a new marketing program announced last month called the Neighborhood.
The Neighborhood offers a bundled local and long-distance phone service for a flat monthly rate, which ranges from $49.99 to $59.99 in different parts of the country, not including taxes. By taking MCI full bore into the competition for local phone business -- the company now provides such service to just 1.6 million households -- it expands the market MCI can compete for to $80 billion from $40 billion, Mr. Huyard said. Moreover, customers signing up for the plan generate three times the revenue and twice the earnings before taxes and other expenses as stand-alone long-distance customers.
"What we've launched is the second chapter of MCI's history of dismantling phone monopolies," Mr. Huyard said, likening MCI's thrust into local phone service to its early days as the first company to challenge AT&T's long-distance monopoly.
A crucial difference is that the current plan is also a counterattack on the regional Bell companies as they begin bundling their local service with long-distance plans. Regulators have allowed them to re-enter the long-distance market in 11 states, and the regional Bells are expected to enter most others by the end of the year. 
Mr. Huyard said the Neighborhood, now offered to about 55 percent of potential customers, or 55 million households, will be extended to 85 percent of the country by next year.
Going on the attack will be a morale booster for MCI, which is supporting the program with its first big advertising campaign in three years, Mr. Huyard said. More important, he is counting on it to allow MCI to report revenue growth by next year.
Few analysts are that optimistic. They say it is unclear which bundles of services will appeal most to consumers. MCI's, for example, does not cover nonvoice traffic like Internet connection or wireless service. Nor is it clear that price competition will not quickly eat into profits.
Charles Golvin of Forrester Research said that MCI's most valuable asset is probably its network and that the company should probably focus more resources on selling access to the network to other carriers rather than courting consumers.
One thing is clear. Many analysts would rather see Wall Street milking MCI than investing in it. Under Mr. Sidgmore's predecessor, Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's strategy had been to strip MCI of the big business customers, which represented its best prospects for growth, then distance the rest of WorldCom as much as possible from the remaining consumer operations.
Indeed, the MCI unit was set up last year as a heavily indebted subsidiary with one mission: generate enough profit from its business to pay down the enormous debts attributed to it on the company's books and cover a 60-cent-a-quarter dividend on the tracking stock carrying the MCI name.
But long before last weekend, when Mr. Ebbers was forced into retirement by disgruntled members of WorldCom's board, most of the assumptions behind the strategy had come unglued. The parts of WorldCom expected to grow rapidly did not, and MCI's business proved weaker than expected. The tracking stock, WorldCom-MCI Group, which initially traded at $17.85, fell 54 cents yesterday to $3.21, a record closing low. WorldCom dropped 27 cents to $2.21. 
As analysts see it, MCI has little if any remaining value to investors except its dividend. Jack B. Grubman, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst who had been one of Mr. Ebbers's biggest fans on Wall Street, yesterday estimated that MCI stock, without the dividend, is worth no more than 80 cents a share, or roughly $95 million. And with the dividend's yield almost 75 percent at yesterday's price, the question on Wall Street's mind is how quickly Mr. Sidgmore either sharply reduces it or eliminates it. But doing so while protecting both WorldCom and MCI shareholders will be tricky.
Mr. Sidgmore has shown little interest in MCI's businesses in the past, and on Tuesday, in a conference call with analysts, he said his inclination was to focus on increasing WorldCom's activities with big business customers. "The fastest way to get growth in a company like this," he said, "is to get big deals with big companies."

Blue-Chip Shares Rally as Investors Hunt for Bargains

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks staged a rally yesterday as investors hunted for bargains. Technology stocks pared losses but ended lower after Sun Microsystems announced yet another management shake-up.
 "We're still in a down trend, but right now people are coming in and buying stocks because they perceive them to be cheap," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading for SG Cowen Securities. 
 The broad market has gained for two days -- the first time that has happened in about five weeks. Reports of robust April car sales and a lull in the Middle East conflict after Israeli troops withdrew from the West Bank city of Hebron helped underpin the rally. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.41 points, or 1.14 percent, to 10,059.63. Coca-Cola helped support the Dow, rising $2.11, or 3.8 percent, to $57.62.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 9.54 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,086.46. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 10.70 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,677.53.
As the rally gained steam, analysts said, professional investors, who had bet on further declines, were forced to cover short positions, meaning they bought back shares they had borrowed and subsequently sold.
"You had a lot of guys on the technical side who wanted to crack the market and when it looked like they were not going to be able to do it, some of those guys covered their shorts," said John O'Donoghue, co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "You also had some new money coming in, including value investors looking at the higher-quality names in the telecommunications space."
Sun was down $1.21, or almost 15 percent, to a three-and-a-half year low of $6.97. Edward J. Zander, its president and chief operating officer, said yesterday that he planned to retire, leaving the founder and chief executive, Scott G. McNealy, without a No. 2 executive joining an exodus of top managers in recent months.
Car and truck buyers gave a boost to automakers in April, as most companies reported higher monthly sales yesterday amid a flurry of incentives and new models.
General Motors gained $1.36, to $65.51, after the company said incentives had helped fuel strong consumer demand for its pickups and sport utility vehicles. Ford Motor rose 44 cents, to $16.34; DaimlerChrysler shares, trading in New York, advanced 91 cents, to $46.55.
Some hard-hit telecommunications stocks cut earlier losses.
AT&T gained 84 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $13.96. The stock was the biggest percentage gainer in the Dow average.
Still, WorldCom closed down 27 cents, at $2.21, one day after it announced that its chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, had resigned. Investors fear it will cut the dividend of its MCI Group to ward off a cash shortage, analysts said.
Overture Services sank 35.7 percent, or $12.20, to $21.99, after ending its search-distribution relationship with the America Online of AOL Time Warner. AOL's shares were up 37 cents, to $19.39.
Hewlett-Packard dropped 24 cents, to $16.86, while Compaq Computer rose 50 cents, to $10.65. Hewlett's purchase of Compaq became more likely after a Delaware court ruled against the dissident shareholder Walter B. Hewlett in his moves to block the acquisition.
Peregrine Systems, which makes software that helps companies oversee their assets, fell $3.40, to $3.45, after it delayed the release of its quarterly results because its new auditors need more time to complete work taken over from Arthur Andersen. The stock was the biggest loser in percentage terms on the Nasdaq, tumbling almost 50 percent.
Treasuries rose yesterday. The 10-year note was up 8/32 , to a price of 98 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 5.05 percent from 5.09 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond climbed 11/32, to 97 9/32. Its yield fell to 5.57 percent from 5.59 percent.

HEADLINE: Yes, Bananas They Handle, But Steel . . . Is It Too Hot? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
What's bugging America's and Europe's top trade negotiators?
 Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, and Pascal Lamy, the trade commissioner for the European Union, recorded some impressive successes in their first year as counterparts. Yet the trans-Atlantic dispute over steel tariffs has turned these old friends into public adversaries who have traded barbs in advance of their one-on-one meetings this week in Washington. 
 Though the two remain at odds over some fundamental issues, outsiders say it appears they may be engaged in shadow boxing as each plays to domestic constituencies. 
"A lot of this is bluffing," said Claude E. Barfield, director of trade policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. If Mr. Barfield is right, the two sharp-witted trade negotiators may have found a clever way to accomplish their goals. If not, tensions could worsen between the world's two biggest trading powers.
Mr. Zoellick and Mr. Lamy became friends in the late 1980's, when Mr. Zoellick worked for James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, and Mr. Lamy, who is French, worked for Jacques Delors, the former president of the European Commission. Both take academic approaches to policy and have been avid distance runners. Since Mr. Zoellick assumed his position last February, he and Mr. Lamy have taken credit for resolving long-running disputes on bananas and wheat gluten and for starting a new round of trade talks at the World Trade Organization's meeting last fall in Doha, Qatar. Until recently, their friendship lent a warmer, more conciliatory cast to high-level trade negotiations.
But as the Bush administration moved closer to imposing tariffs on imported steel to help an industry struggling to reorganize -- and not coincidentally to help sway voters in battleground states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia -- Mr. Lamy put up a loud cry. In December, he called an American trade panel's recommendations for steel tariffs "a blatant call for protectionism" and "a clear violation of W.T.O. rules."
Mr. Lamy wrote to Mr. Zoellick in February, suggesting that in lieu of tariffs, the United States impose a levy on all steel sold in this country, wherever it was produced, to pay the pensions of retired steel workers and to speed the industry's consolidation.
In his reply, Mr. Zoellick shot back: "Given the E.U.'s past and present practices in the steel sector, I had hoped that you might show greater appreciation for the U.S. interest and need to consider safeguards as our industry restructures."
In early March, President Bush announced new tariffs of up to 30 percent on almost one-third of the nation's steel imports. Within three weeks, the European Union installed its own tariffs of up to 26 percent, ostensibly to block cheap steel originally intended for shipment to the United States. On April 19, the E.U. proposed retaliatory tariffs of up to 100 percent on American exports ranging from billiard tables to ballpoint pens.
But as some industry lobbyists see it, there is less here than meets the eye. The Europeans "seem to be creating more pressure rather than dampening it," said Alan W. Wolff, a former deputy United States trade representative who is now managing partner of the Washington law office of Dewey Ballantine, whose clients include several steel companies.
Mr. Lamy's espousal of retaliatory tariffs also seemed peculiar to Mr. Barfield. "I'm not suggesting he's totally false there, but it's an odd picture," he said.
Mr. Lamy's spokesman, Anthony Gooch, hinted that the tone of his boss's comments was at least partly pro forma.
"Sometimes one has to express positions firmly because that's what one is required to do," he said on Monday. "I think both gentlemen can take forward their relationship on its merits and not allow issues that are part of their job to become more than that."
Asked about the relationship between Mr. Lamy and Mr. Zoellick, a senior trade official in Washington said: "Are there tensions? Sure. Are there vast areas of cooperation and benefit? Absolutely."
Others contend that the trade negotiators have little choice but to play, at least publicly, to the influential political and economic interest groups at the heart of the dispute.
"Bob Zoellick and Pascal Lamy get along very well, and they're both very clever people," said Brigitte E. Granville, who heads the international economics program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. "Unfortunately both of them have received their orders from whatever lobby is dominant."
The European Union may indeed be saying one thing and doing another. The union is a crucial participant in talks among rich countries on cutting world steel-making capacity. Mr. Gooch said prospects for the talks were "severely impaired" while the American tariffs were in place. But another senior American trade official reported that the European Union's delegation was "surprisingly constructive" at the latest talks, two weeks ago in Paris.
"Part of what you see in the rhetoric is a twofold desire on the part of Lamy," said Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Zoellick's predecessor in the trade post, who is now a partner at the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering.
"One is to make clear that Europe is mighty unhappy about what the U.S. did," she said. "Second is the advantage he perceives Europe gains with other trading partners by maintaining a very strong stance against the United States."
Alternatively, both Mr. Zoellick and Mr. Lamy could be taking advantage of a bad situation to help their capacity-reduction cause. Michael Gambardella, who analyzes the steel industry for J. P. Morgan Chase, suggested that a rash of tariffs could make steel exporters like Japan and Russia nervous.
"Everyone puts up trade barriers, and then what happens is, the guys who are big net exporters of steel finally have to close capacity," he said. 
Still, Ms. Granville sees an underlying danger in all this gamesmanship. She fears that the European Union, in its haste to retaliate against the American tariffs before the W.T.O. has ruled on their legality, risks destroying the very organization set up to help settle such disputes.
"It's a failure of Europe," Ms. Granville said, "to play by the rules. If they are not so sure of the rules, they should say, 'Why don't we wait, and go to the W.T.O., and let them legislate?' "

HEADLINE: Independent Announces a Third Run for Governor 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 1 

 BODY:
B. Thomas Golisano, a billionaire in the mold of H. Ross Perot, announced his third run for governor as an independent this morning, promising New Yorkers that he would wrest Albany from the clutches of special interests. 
 Mr. Golisano, an entrepreneur whose Rochester-based payroll services company, Paychex, has earned him a place in Forbes's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, criticized Gov. George E. Pataki for failing to reform education and campaign finance, and doing nothing to stoke the economy upstate. 
 "There's a way to accomplish all of this," he said. "The first step is for the people of New York to vote for me and a new kind of government."
Many strategists, both Democrats and Republicans, expect Mr. Golisano's appeal to conservatives and independents to siphon votes from Governor Pataki, taking at least some of the fluff out of his currently comfortable lead.
Not only that, but Mr. Golisano will take on some of the Democrats' heavy lifting. He has proved to be more than willing to spend his fortune attacking the governor in television and radio ads. In 1998, he spent $13 million, and planned to spend more before he ran out of time. He won 8 percent of the vote.
Today he said that he did not know how much he was prepared to spend, but that he had turned down people who wanted to hold fund-raisers for him, choosing to finance his own campaign.
Mr. Golisano shrugged off the notion that Democrats would rejoice at his entering the fray. "I'm in this to be governor of New York State," he said. "There has been a number of independent governors elected in this country, so it is definitely, definitely possible. The fact that it may have an impact on their election results is of no interest to me." 
Some Democrats were skeptical that the Golisano campaign would give their candidate a boost. "Generally speaking, a third-party candidate does not take votes away from the incumbent, because people who vote for a third-party candidate are already inclined to vote against the incumbent," said Howard Wolfson, who was the communications director for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign and is now the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "So what you're doing, in effect, is splitting off votes from the major party challenger. And I think that that's something that we as Democrats need to be concerned about."
But, Mr. Wolfson conceded, Mr. Golisano's attacks could create a "helpful issues environment."
"To the extent that Tom Golisano focuses on the need to improve the upstate economy and the upstate economy as an issue, that might help a Democratic challenger, because that is an argument that the Democratic challenger would be making, as well," he said.
And press officers for the governor's would-be Democratic challengers, H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, seemed eager to chime in with the independent candidate's criticisms. "Tom Golisano's entering the race is one more indication that George Pataki has abandoned upstate New York," said Josh Isay, the campaign manager for Mr. Cuomo.
Hank Sheinkopf, a spokesman for Mr. McCall, said, "Tom Golisano is saying what Carl McCall's been saying about the upstate economy and education reform."
If the Pataki campaign was concerned, it did not betray it. "This is a democracy, and Tom Golisano has a right to be part of the process," said Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor.
Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Poll, said that in the past Mr. Golisano clearly drew votes from Governor Pataki. "In 1998, all the pre-election polling said that Golisano was draining more from Pataki's margin than from the Democrats," Mr. Miringoff said. "And that was more apparent in 1994. When his numbers slipped, Pataki's margin opened up."
But the Golisano campaign is not likely to pull the governor to the right, he said. "My guess is that Pataki is positioned in the middle right now and he'll stay right there," Mr. Miringoff said. "If Golisano for some reason started really climbing in the polls, then we might see a little more fiscal conservatism from the governor."
Mr. Golisano is the founder of the Independence Party, and ran on that party's line in 1994 and 1998. But this time around, the party's support is far from certain. Governor Pataki has aggressively courted party members, and has strongly supported one of their key issues: allowing voters to hold referendums.
The state chairman of the Independence Party, Frank M. MacKay, has indicated strong leanings toward Governor Pataki, and has said that 90 percent of the party's state committee supports the governor.
Still, Mr. Golisano said that he was confident he could win enough votes at the party convention to fight the governor in a primary, and that he would try to do the same in the Conservative Party. And, he said, if he does not get either nomination he will run on his own ballot line.

HEADLINE: Albany Strikes A Budget Deal Aiding Schools 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 1 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki reached a tentative agreement with legislative leaders tonight on a state budget that would add about $515 million to state aid for schools and restore cuts the governor had proposed to college scholarships.
 But the agreement did not settle the question of how to give Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg control over the New York City schools. Those decisions will be left to further negotiations between the mayor and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, who has opposed giving the mayor absolute power, lawmakers said. 
 The governor and legislative leaders refused to release any details about how they planned to make up for a shortfall in tax collections in April that has created a $1.1 billion hole in the state's finances. People with knowledge of the accord said the state would spend almost all of its savings and reserve funds this year as well as at least $500 million in unspent money earmarked for special purposes. And officials said there would be no layoffs of state employees, although they planned to reduce the state work force through attrition. 
The governor and legislative leaders were tight-lipped about most of the details of the agreement. They said they would not tell the public what they had agreed to until they had told their fellow lawmakers. And they maintained they did not know how much the agreement would add in overall spending to the governor's $89 billion proposal in January.
This is one of the earliest agreements on a state budget in the last 18 years, in which lawmakers have routinely missed the April 1 deadline. The governor and the Legislature were under increased pressure this year to forge a deal early, because all of them are up for re-election.
Still, they all claimed they had protected schools and provided seed money for economic development despite desperate financial straits. "It's a miracle, in my mind, that under the circumstances that we find ourselves in, that we are able to put together a package that is going to do a lot of good for a lot of people with limited resources," the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said.
Governor Pataki said it would take a week and a half to draft the new budget bills and refine the figures. "There's still a lot of work to be done, working out the details and doing the initial numbers, but we do have the framework to have the budget done," he said.
It remained unclear tonight what precisely the governor and legislative leaders had agreed to do for New York City. Mayor Bloomberg had asked lawmakers for $250 million in additional school aid.
He also wants the authority to raise revenues in a number of ways, including a steep cigarette tax and higher parking fines. The mayor has said he may be able to forestall cutting the city's school budget if the Legislature can provide him with about $850 million in new revenue.
Lawmakers said privately that the mayor would be allowed to raise the cigarette tax, though half the proceeds would go to the state. Mr. Silver also said tonight's agreement would provide the mayor with enough new revenue to avoid cutting the school district's budget. "I am confident that, when the details are worked on and reviewed in a cooperative fashion, the mayor will be comfortable and will not cut the schools," Mr. Silver said, declining to provide any details.
The tentative accord also includes several measures intended to spur the economy, among them a sweeping expansion of tax-free business zones, known as Empire Zones, and seed money for high-technology industries. It also includes a raise for tens of thousands of nurses and others who care for the sick at home.
The agreement was also notable for problems it left unresolved. Negotiators could not agree on an early retirement program. In addition, the governor had wanted to weaken cleanup standards for toxic waste sites and provide incentives for businesses to develop blighted areas. But he could not persuade the Assembly Democrats to accept either proposal.
Nor did the budget agreement resolve the long-standing dispute between the governor's office and the Assembly Democrats over how to lighten the state's penalties for drug offenses, even though some lawmakers had speculated that issue would be included in the budget.
The governor and legislative leaders returned to the bargaining table late in the afternoon after a morning session that ended in acrimony. Aides to all three negotiators thought an accord was so imminent they prepared Franklin Delano Roosevelt's old office in the Capitol for a news conference.
But Governor Pataki emerged from the meeting with a sour expression, and announced there were "a number of issues that aren't resolved."
Lawmakers with knowledge of the talks said later that the meeting had fallen apart over a disagreement on how to structure an early retirement program for state and local government employees. Mr. Pataki had advocated a single policy for all workers, but the Assembly Democrats preferred a buyout controlled by managers.
The speaker suggested the governor might consider layoffs if he did not like the idea of a targeted buyout. The governor asked why he should play the villain, and ended the meeting a short time later.
"The budget process in this state is dysfunctional," Senator Bruno said after the meeting.
The Republican governor and the Democratic speaker also butted heads over the proposal to expand Empire Zones. But they finally reached a compromise that would raise the number from 62 to 72.
The talks today took place against a dismal financial backdrop during the month of April, in which the governor's budget experts underestimated the amount the state would pay out as people filed their tax returns and settled up with the government.
Both the Assembly's ruling Democrats and the Senate's Republican majority had been pushing for at least $515 million more in state aid for schools above what the governor had proposed.
In his January budget proposal, Mr. Pataki froze school aid at last year's level, about $14.2 billion.
The legislative leaders succeeded in persuading the governor to restore several of the cuts he proposed in January, among them a proposal to make students at state universities forgo a third of their scholarships until they graduate. The proposal, billed as an incentive to encourage students to study harder, would have saved about $182 million.
In January, the governor had proposed an $89 billion budget that would have averted deep cuts by spending the state's savings and attempting to shift many costs usually borne by the state to the federal government. Most of that plan is intact.
Mr. Pataki's plan had also called for reducing the state work force through a hiring freeze and early retirement buy-outs of about 5,000 people, but he could not reach an agreement on the program with the Legislature.
He also proposed sweeping money out of several state bank accounts fed by special taxes and dedicated to specific purposes to get an extra infusion of $562 million in cash. He proposed, for instance, taking $100 million from the Environmental Protection Fund, which pays for land acquisition, and using it for general state spending. Most of those actions still stand, lawmakers said.
In his budget proposal, Mr. Pataki tried hard to find financing for programs that used to be paid for by state taxes outside of the budget.
In January, the governor proposed, and the Legislature passed, a massive expansion of the Health Care Reform Act, which uses tobacco taxes and hospital surcharges to pay for medical programs. The expansion not only provided raises for hospital workers but paid for several state initiatives, like $194 million to subsidize drugs for seniors and a $60 million cancer research program.
The budget is now a month late, though that is not unusual. This year, however, the governor and lawmakers had several incentives to conclude a deal. All face re-election in districts that have been redrawn, and they would prefer to campaign rather than to stay in Albany for a protracted budget battle.
Another late budget would not be good for Mr. Pataki's campaign either. Earlier today, B. Thomas Golisano, a Rochester billionaire, announced that he will run again for governor, as he did in 1994 and 1998. Mr. Golisano, who could play the role of a spoiler in a tight race between Mr. Pataki and a Democrat, has consistently attacked Mr. Pataki for late budgets, among other things.
Another spur for the talks was the fear that tax collections might worsen as the year wears on. Legislative leaders and the governor said they believe the economic turnaround the country saw in the first quarter of the year would eventually push incomes in New York up as well.
But in the uncertain environment after the terrorist attacks last September, few lawmakers were willing to play a waiting game and bet on that trend.

HEADLINE: U.N. Talks on Iraq Inspections Resume With Sides Far Apart 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 1 

 BODY:
Officials of Iraq and the United Nations began a second round of talks today on resuming international arms inspections in Iraq, but few diplomats believed that they would resolve the three-year stalemate over the issue.
 The talks opened in the morning with a meeting of Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri, and continued in the afternoon with teams of experts. The meetings were scheduled to continue through Friday. 
 Both sides have made clear that their intentions in the talks are different. Mr. Annan, supported by Washington, has insisted that the meetings should focus largely on getting arms inspectors back into Iraq. The inspectors were originally sent to Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, but the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, barred them from the country in 1998.
Mr. Hussein, for his part, has tried to focus the talks on lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council since Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990. A new system of sanctions is expected to come into effect on June 1, under which most restrictions would be lifted on civilian imports, while controls would be tightened against items on military-related materials included in a "goods review list."
"I would hope that we would spend a considerable amount of time on the return of inspectors," Mr. Annan said. "I know that the Council members are hoping that the talks will lead to the return of the inspectors and that talks will be successful."
Mr. Sabri said he hoped that the discussions would include the lifting of sanctions, the American threats against Mr. Hussein, and the American-British enforcement of no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.
The Bush administration, which has placed a high priority on eliminating Mr. Hussein, said it did not hold high expectations for the United Nations meetings.
"We're not holding our breath to hear the Iraqis say finally that they actually do accept to implement these obligations fully," the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said in Washington.
Iraq initially proposed in February to open a dialogue with Mr. Annan "without preconditions." The proposal came the week after President Bush proclaimed Iraq a partner in an "axis of evil" with North Korea and Iran, and Baghdad's offer was widely perceived as an effort to build international resistance to a possible American attack.
The first meeting was held in early March. A second one originally scheduled for April was delayed after Mr. Hussein said he did not want to take attention away from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

HEADLINE: China's Heir Apparent Wins Cordial Reception From Bush 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
The man expected to become China's next leader had friendly meetings with President Bush and other top officials today as he neared the end of his first visit to the United States.
 Both sides believe that the visit by China's heir apparent, Vice President Hu Jintao, can help set the tone for future Chinese-American relations, and most of the discussions did not move beyond pleasantries andpro forma statements of existing policies, officials said. 
 But Mr. Hu has been showered with top-level, if discreet, attention of the kind normally reserved for heads of state, and officials from both sides expressed satisfaction with the visit. Both sides sought to play down a festering disagreement over American military aid to Taiwan. 
"I have been deeply impressed by what I have seen and heard," Mr. Hu said in a speech tonight to 500 businessmen and scholars. Mr. Hu, who spoke directly with no jokes or aphorisms, gave a standard defense of China's economic gains and what he called a steady march toward more human rights and democracy. 
Answering questions at a banquet tonight, he sounded more like a policy expert than a politician. Asked about the challenge of unemployment, he gave a detailed 15 minute explanation of farming, urbanization and labor policies. 
But he warned that American arms sales to Taiwan could jeopardize relations. 
Earlier this week in New York, Mr. Hu was warmly embraced by many titans of American business and finance who hope to increase investment and trade with China.
Mr. Hu has been a consummate insider in China's Communist Party, avoiding flamboyant actions or much contact with Western officials and scholars in the past. This trip is widely seen as an important step in preparation for his ascension later this year to the leadership of the Communist Party.
In a 30-minute meeting with President Bush, and longer sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney and several cabinet members, Mr. Hu discussed the war on terror and China's economic opening, as well as Taiwan, weapons proliferation and freedom of religion. 
In the only concrete result announced today, Mr. Hu and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld agreed to restore military cooperation and exchanges that have been on ice since the dispute last year over a downed American spy plane, a Chinese spokeswoman said tonight. 
In keeping with the careful strategy that has taken him to the brink of power, Mr. Hu asked to keep press appearances during his trip to a minimum. After his meeting with President Bush today, Mr. Hu left the White House with a smile and wave, saying only, "The talks went well."
American officials were under orders not to discuss details of the visit. 
Chinese leaders are worried about recent statements and actions by the Bush administration that in their eyes amount to a more overt American alliance with Taiwan, which China considers an errant province that Beijing insists must be reunited with the motherland, by force if necessary.
Mr. Hu raised China's concerns about Taiwan in his meetings here, something he had to do to maintain his standing at home. But he did not press the issue, and American leaders reassured him about American fealty to the "one China" policy.
The Chinese seem prepared to sidestep the Taiwan dispute for now in the interest of better overall ties, said Bates Gill, a China expert at the Brookings Institution. 
"China's leaders need good relations with the United States to achieve their larger goals," he said. Those goals include gaining respectability as a major world power and and stable relations with Asia and the West to ensure access to capital, technology and markets. 
"I think a decision has been made to put up with a great deal from Washington in order to achieve those goals, " Mr. Gill said.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Stricken With Guilt (And Water)

 BODY:
"Warm Water Under a Red Bridge" was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Elvis Mitchell's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 29, 2001; the full text is available at nytimes.com/movies. The film, in Japanese with English subtitles, opens today in Manhattan at the Lincoln Plaza, Broadway at 62nd Street.
 "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge" is the Japanese filmmaker Shohei Imamura's tribute to the concept of release, and for Saeko (Misa Shimizu) that euphoria is an expulsion of water from her body. At this orgasmic eruption, fish gather at her feet, and during peak moments she lets loose a freshet with the pressure of a fire hydrant. 
 The sight leaves Yosuke (Koji Yakusho) in a state of simultaneous awe and desire and the local fishermen extremely pleased. When Yosuke first glimpses the clear puddles at Saeko's feet, his eyebrows lift at her unusual response when she compulsively steals cheese in a little fishing town. It's as if Yosuke, unemployed and at loose ends, who is searching for a stolen Buddha hidden near a red bridge, has been handpicked by Fate to become a part of her life.
Mr. Imamura's fascination with the physical representation of emotion, particularly guilt, cuts a wide swath through this film, though it could also be found in some of his previous work. He's trafficking heavily in visual metaphor, but the bridge in the title of this lurid and less than lucid work hobbles the film. 
It's as if he were trying to create a mythopoetic version of what some consider to be a pornographic classic, the Mitchell Brothers' insane "Grafenberg Spot," in which Niagara Falls was uncorked whenever Ginger Lynn found satisfaction. Saeko also demands satisfaction, and Yosuke, who's in the middle of a divorce, eagerly complies. 
There are complications that would never have occurred to the Mitchell Brothers, if only because they never found, um, actors. In "Bridge," Saeko's face is taut with shame. She steals cheese, an object of her obsession. (Her perpetual chanting of the word takes on a religious fervor.)
Many of the "Bridge" characters are stricken with guilt. Yosuke is hamstrung by it and is living with a group of other broke and desperate fishermen at the outset. Saeko's grandmother (Mitsuko Baisho) has been abandoned by her lover, and she pines for his return. Saeko's mother drowned, and Saeko is full of survivor's guilt, and water.
Mr. Imamura's pursuit of guilt as a glue that binds like-minded spirits could be seen in his unforgettable 1998 film, "The Eel," in which characters linked by a crime sought spiritual escape and succor. 
The talented Ms. Shimizu, the director's muse, was in "The Eel," which also featured Mr. Imamura's skill in creating a community of eccentrics. A recurring bit here with a marathoner in training is reminiscent of a scene in "The Eel" with athletes sprinting through a small fishing village.
Mr. Imamura sifts through a lot of history to develop explanations for his characters' emotional states. In this respect this masterly director is following the tradition of another master, Yasujiro Ozu, whose films are the ne plus ultra of lean, dry family drama (though dry literally isn't the word to apply to this film).
"Bridge" plays like a nutty psychological mystery; when the waters stop, anger and resentment cause the villagers' bliss to shrivel. The problem is that the unraveling of the root of Saeko's condition isn't nearly as interesting as the phenomenon itself. The silliness of the floods she unleashes washes away any attempt at narrative completion. You might think that the orgasmic device Mr. Imamura uses is so potent that it has given him a form of performance anxiety. In the end he doesn't come through.

Making a Pilgrimage To Utopia-by-the-Sea

BYLINE:  By ROB WALKER 

DATELINE: SEASIDE, Fla. 

 BODY:
SEASIDE is a disconcerting place. Driving toward it on Highway 98 from Pensacola, to the west, is like running a gantlet. Hit Fort Walton Beach, and you're nearing the heart of the Florida Panhandle. The traffic thickens. Huge chain hotels form a wall between road and beach to the right; sprawl stalwarts like TGI Friday's and a (shuttered) Kmart crowd each other to the left. Then, at the east end of Destin, just past a giant digital sign flashing the words "Hot Tub" in red letters, there's a respite.
 Minutes later, with little warning, a small sign for County Road 30A materializes, and if you follow that for 10 miles, you wind up in a place with no chain businesses of any kind, pristine brick streets with big pedestrian-friendly sidewalks, green spaces, multicolored houses and white picket fences. Welcome to Seaside. 
 If Seaside (www.seasidefl.com) is one reality removed from the flotsam of overdevelopment jostling for your attention on 98, well, that's the whole point. Plenty of visitors find their way here for the beautiful white-sand beaches. But others -- like me -- come specifically for a firsthand look at one of the best-known living laboratories of New Urbanism. (O.K., the beaches don't hurt.)
New Urbanism is a design movement that tries to envision cities, towns and neighborhoods as more fundamentally livable places, guided not by the raw pressures of the market (which always seems to deliver another chain restaurant), but by careful planning and a rigorous aesthetic sense. Like many theories, New Urbanism sounds wonderful, but hard to imagine in practice. This is Seaside's appeal: Practically anyone who has read about New Urbanism wants a chance to see it first-hand.
Back in 1981, when the first structures on these 80 acres were completed, 30A was largely untouched. Seaside's developer wanted to do something that broke with beachfront resort tradition, and imagined a little town built around a pre-automobile version of community. The upshot is not exactly a nostalgic recreation of small-town America, although as you stroll around, it's easy to see why it's described that way. The town center, facing 30A, is dominated by a village green of sorts, but also by a big, mixed-use building designed by the architect Steven Holl that's too striking and modern for, say, Mayberry.
The best part of Seaside is its houses. While the construction code laid down rules -- on window shape, roof pitch and so on -- it also left room for individuality. This was smart, because the project attracted a lot of talented architects. So while there's a consistency to the streetscapes of wooden houses, there's also a lot of candy-colored variety.
There are echoes of Charleston, Key West, even the French Quarter. There's also the occasional widow's walk of the sort seen in Nantucket. And many of the earlier Seaside bungalows show the closer-to-home influence of the clapboard cabins of Grayton Beach -- the oldest nearby town, right alongside the Grayton Beach State Recreation Area, which also has a gorgeous beach.
A few push the boundaries a bit more. The house that Walter Chatham designed for himself looks like two houses, but they're joined by an outdoor "dog trot." And some of the newer arrivals are considerably more ostentatious.
After a while, Seaside actually verges on a feeling of too much perfection. And as you wander, marveling at how everyone walks and bikes here, just as the planners intended, most of your fellow pedestrians are also tourists, marveling right back at you.
The houses all sparkle more than they would in a real town, because pretty much everything you see is available for seasonal rental. If it all seems a little like the set of "The Truman Show," that might be because it was filmed here.
While Seaside's population reaches into the thousands in peak season, only a handful of people -- maybe 30 -- really live here year-round. Holly Speight and her husband are among them. A few years ago they abandoned Nashville, where they worked in the health-care industry, reinvented themselves as artisan-entrepreneurs, and now run a Seaside shop called Albert F's, selling antiques, gifts and "garden art."
Ms. Speight's enthusiasm for the place bubbles through as she suggests that suddenly sociable visitors would act the same way back home if their neighborhoods had been guided by the principles of New Urbanism. Only in the heat of the summer, when the crowds are at their peak, does she get that "goldfish bowl" feeling.
"These people are here one week and gone the next," she said. "We kiddingly say: 'O.K., we're Truman-ed out. We need a break.' "
Enough visitors have come and gone over the years to inspire some Seaside-influenced developments nearby. To the east is Rosemary Beach (www.rosemarybeach.com), whose more modest downtown consists mostly of a mission-style town hall and matching post office, plus a few shops, a lemonade stand and a wine bar. 
The planners for both Seaside and Rosemary Beach were Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, who, with Jeff Speck, wrote an anti-sprawl book called "Suburban Nation" (North Point Press, 2000). Mr. Duany will lead a three-day bus tour in June from Seaside through several other New Urbanist communities around Florida, arriving in Miami Beach in time for this year's Congress for the New Urbanism conference.
It's sold out, but you can still join in if you're willing to drive yourself; for details: (850) 231-2421. 
Right next door to Seaside to the west is the bluntly named WaterColor (www.arvida.com/water color), which also offers brick streets and a big, landscaped park; its buildings are more imposing and the overall feel is more antiseptic, but the big central hotel, designed by David Rockwell, is worth a gawk.
A word about finding a place to stay along this strip: Seaside is the most fully realized of these projects and also the prettiest home base. But it's expensive, as is the whole area, and the emphasis is on weekly rentals.
Rates vary seasonally, but when I called Seaside Reservations, which functions as the central authority in such matters (800-277-8696), and asked for the cheapest thing I could get for two nights in April, I ended up in a "cottage." It was actually a sort of loft in the Holl-designed town center building, and figuring in all taxes and fees, ran $520 for the weekend.
I was surprised to find that right across the street is something called Seaside Motorcourt, an idealized motel with groovily appointed rooms. This would have cost $370 for two nights. If only I'd known to ask. Now you do.
That said, pets, smoking, and small children are pretty much verboten in all Seaside lodgings. Lots of rules in utopia, turns out.
When I got Trumaned-out, I headed for the beach, or for the road -- suddenly it was a happy thing to be a mere drive from some good Southern food see accompanying article and the more familiar attractions of Panhandle beach culture. But for all the traditional garishness, you'll see nothing as ambitiously out-of-the-ordinary as the planned towns of 30A. In a sense, maybe Seaside and its cousins (a simulacrum and its knockoffs) function as a postmodern roadside attraction. Think of it as a sort of Rock City for design fanatics.

GETTING THERE
A Weekend In Seaside, Fla.
By car, Seaside is located about six hours from Atlanta, four hours from Jacksonville and four hours from New Orleans. Some seven-day advance purchase airfares (departing on Friday, returning on Sunday) available yesterday through Expedia include:

New York to Atlanta: $276 (Delta)
Chicago to Atlanta: $258 (Delta)
Boston to Jacksonville: $170 (USAir)
Cleveland to Jacksonville: $258 (USAir)
Minneapolis to Jacksonville: $303 (Northwest)
Dallas to New Orleans: $174 (Delta)
For dinner, try Bud & Alley's. This somewhat pricey seafood restaurant has an upstairs, open-air bar called the Tarpon Club, a delightful place to watch the sun set. Bar snacks include plump cold shrimp at $9.50 for a quarter-pound (about 14 shrimp); 2236 East County Highway 30A, (850) 231-5900.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Renting It Out, Reluctantly

BYLINE:  By NANCY M. BETTER 

 BODY:
AS summer approaches, Terry Forrest, a schoolteacher from Westbury, N.Y., dreams about lounging on the sweeping porch of his spacious summer home overlooking Lake Placid, going for a bracing dip in the lake before breakfast and greeting the day's sunset with a refreshing gin-and-tonic.
 But during July, someone else will be occupying his favorite Adirondack chair. 
 Mr. Forrest is the fourth-generation owner of his family's landmark camp, Humdinger Hill, but he is the first who must rent out the property to make ends meet.
"I rent out of necessity," he said. "For three generations, my family spent the whole summer up there, but I can't do it. It drives me nuts to be hanging around Long Island knowing the lake is waiting for me and a stranger is in my house." 
Mr. Forrest is not alone. Like many baby boomers who bought, built or inherited second homes during the economy's expansion, he is faced with the choice of renting out -- or selling out -- his beloved getaway.
From Memorial Day through Labor Day, many people will reluctantly hand over their keys to strangers -- and pray that their refuge is not damaged or destroyed.
Real-estate brokers say that clients find themselves in this bind because they bought primary homes with cash and leveraged their second homes to the hilt with debt.
"These people want a special place to create those happy family memories, but they're just on the edge of being able to afford it," said Margie Papier, a rental manager at Merrill Thomas Realty, a Sotheby's affiliate in Lake Placid. "Lately I'm seeing a lot of people doing rentals that never would have considered it before. They need to cover their taxes. But they're anxious about it."
Between 1995 and 2000, ownership of second homes soared 27 percent, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors. Most of the buyers acquired properties for their own enjoyment, not intending to use them as income-producing or investment properties. But overspending on purchases and renovations -- coupled with a downturn in the economy -- has made renting, even for just a few weeks each summer, a necessity. 
On Martha's Vineyard, Tim Dennis, president of Century 21 Island-Wide Realty, said his company had added a substantial number of new rental listings to its inventory this spring. He has also noticed second-home shoppers perusing -- however warily -- the rental market.
"More and more buyers are asking in advance what the house can be rented for," he said. "Before, they didn't raise the question. It wasn't in their plans."
With rates running as high as $50,000 a week in some areas, handing over the keys -- at least temporarily -- is an attractive prospect for cash-strapped owners. The biggest expense is leasing. Brokers charge owners a 15 to 30 percent commission, depending on location and season. These fees are negotiable and tend to slide as prices rise.
Mr. Dennis said that while 20 percent is standard for his firm, a long-term lease on a high-end house -- like a two-month rental of a $30,000-a-week property -- might carry only a 10 or 15 percent fee.
Mr. Forrest began renting his eight-bedroom house in 1998. Built in 1910, the property features water views, stone fireplaces, original woodwork and a prime location; it commands $7,500 a week during the peak months of July and August. Before renting for the first time, Mr. Forrest said, he spent several weeks "sanitizing" the house.
"I went through every drawer and closet," he said. "In some ways, I depersonalized the house. I locked things up and I haven't bothered to put them back."
He did keep one bedroom suite off-limits; that is where he takes refuge.
"It helps me and my wife retain our sense of privacy," Mr. Forrest said. "It makes me feel like it's still my house, even if other people get to use it."
KEVIN McCARTHY, a sales associate with Lee Real Estate on Nantucket, said such off-limits "owners' rooms" -- rather than just owners' closets -- are a growing trend.
"The tenant probably won't appreciate a $20,000 desk, so you might as well put it away," he said. "If you're furnishing with a rental in mind, you use Crate & Barrel."
Some landlords disagree. Barbara and Carl DeSantis of Bolton Landing, N.Y., own two Adirondack homes that, when not being used by their five children and 11 grandchildren, are rented out.
"I think it's a mistake to lock everything up," Ms. DeSantis said. "Stripping a house is the wrong way to go. You won't get the best return if you cut corners and make your home look like a boring condo."
Instead, Ms. DeSantis did the opposite. She renovated her properties, adding rough-hewn stone fireplaces, hardwood floors and custom-designed carpeting. She filled the living rooms with oversized sofas and club chairs, and adorned the beds with Ralph Lauren linens and goose-down comforters. As a finishing touch, she mounted trophies from her husband's hunting trips, including moose, caribou and antelope heads. 
Ms. DeSantis estimates that renters are willing to pay a premium of 25 percent or more for her homes. Both houses are currently booked through 2003, and she steadfastly refuses to lower her rates. "If we compromise our prices, we have problems with our renters," she said.
Most of the problems that can arise have been minor, ranging from broken dishes to missing towels. While damage and theft are worrisome, the biggest concern to rural homeowners is fire, which can mean total devastation of a property if pumper trucks do not arrive in time.
Brokers tell first-time landlords to put candles away, leave strict instructions for fireplace use and install fire extinguishers throughout the house. They also urge the purchase of irons, coffee pots and other small appliances that have automatic shut-off features.
The most reluctant landlords, according to brokers, are owners of highly customized and lavishly appointed homes. Ms. Papier is currently attempting to rent a $10,000-a-week house on Lake George.
"This property is not rentable to 99 percent of the population," she said. "The dining room walls are covered in birch bark. If you had a 4-year-old stay there, he'd peel it right off. Who am I going to rent this house to?"
Owners of the priciest homes often seek to protect their privacy.
"We have a lot of owners that don't want their homes advertised," Mr. McCarthy said. "They only want to work by referral. They don't want their neighbors to see in the paper that they're trying to rent their house. It's a bit of a social thing."
There are landlords who test the waters -- and do not take the plunge again. Hoping to cover the cost of a guest-room addition, one New York couple, who asked that their names not be used, agreed to lease their Martha's Vineyard home at $3,500 a week. The renters had a toddler, and brought along a nanny. With a 3-to-1 adult-child ratio, the owners assumed little could go wrong. 
During the first week, the tenants spotted a mouse in the kitchen and frantically called the owner. "We didn't have an exterminator up there, and we didn't have a regular caretaker or handyman, so I had to spend the whole afternoon trying to track someone down," the owner, who asked not to be identified, said.
In the middle of the second week, the dishwasher stopped working.
"I had to call the repair service and arrange for them to get into the house, but I didn't know when the renters would be home," the owner said. "So I had to keep calling the broker and she had to keep calling the tenants, and again I was on the phone forever."
These inconveniences were insignificant compared with the final blow. Upon returning the keys to the broker, the tenants announced that their child had spilled a cup of juice on the living room's brand-new sisal rug and had also wet the mattress in the guest bedroom.
Although they readily agreed to forego a portion of the 10 percent security deposit for repairs, the nuisance of hiring a carpet cleaner and waiting around for a mattress delivery was too much for the owners.
"When we came up in August, we had to take care of all the problems they created," one said. "That wasn't how I wanted to spend my vacation."
After tallying up the expenses (including the broker's 20 percent commission, housekeeping, insurance and taxes) the owners pocketed less than half the $14,000 and never bothered to rent again. Not every homeowner can pick and choose so carefully. In some regions, like the Berkshires, one- or two-week tenants are hard to come by.
"There isn't a weekly rental market here," said Joseph Carini, president of Wheeler & Taylor Realty in Great Barrington, Mass. "People want to rent for a month, or the whole summer." 
As a result, landlords are on their own to find -- and screen -- short-term tenants.
Though renting out a home for the first time may be a fearful experience, most owners eventually become reconciled with their situation.
"People put their heart and soul into purchasing a second home," Ms. Papier said. "They bought it for love, they decorated it with a passion and now they're going to let strangers stay in their beds and bathe in their tubs."
"They're afraid," she said. "Will the renters break things? Steal things? Burn things? But once they take the plunge, they realize they can do it without hurting their property, and it takes away the financial burden. Their reluctance turns to relief."

THE BOTTOM LINE
Thinking About Being a Landlord? Consider Taxes and Fees First
ANYONE thinking about renting out their second home on a short-term basis should do the math first. Landlords must pay taxes, maintenance and insurance, plus fees for housekeepers and caretakers.
A $5,000-a-week rental handled through a real estate agency might require 20 percent for the broker, $200 in housekeeping and $600 for the recommended $1 million umbrella liability insurance policy. The net profit: about $3,000, before taxes.
Depending on how often you rent your second home, you fall into different tax categories. If you rent for fewer than 14 days a year, your home is considered a personal residence, so you do not need to declare the rental income. You just deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes on I.R.S. Schedule A, the same as you would for your primary residence. (The I.R.S. allows you to deduct mortgage interest on two personal residences; property taxes are always deductible, no matter how many homes you own.)
If you rent the home for 15 days or more, it is considered an investment property and you will have to account for rental income and operating expenses. This gets complicated, since you will have to divide these expenses -- including maintenance, utilities, insurance and depreciation -- into two categories: "personal" and "rental." You will have to keep careful track of expenses and file several tax forms.
Another concern is insurance. Insuring a second home almost always costs more than a primary home, since you are not there as much. And if you rent it out, your property becomes an even greater insurance risk.
But there are ways to trim the price. Installing a central alarm system for fire and burglary protection can shave 15 percent to 20 percent off your policy. Hiring a caretaker to check your house on a daily or weekly basis won't get you an immediate discount, but your insurer may factor it into the price.
You might also save with a "package policy" in which you combine your primary home insurance, second home insurance, car insurance and umbrella liability insurance. Using one company to handle all these policies can cut 5 percent to 10 percent of your costs. NANCY M. BETTER

HEADLINE: Students in Debt 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Bush administration's proposal to move the federal student loan consolidation program from a fixed to a variable interest rate would place an additional burden and expense on students (news article, April 28). 
 The $1.3 billion to be saved will be financed by higher loan payments from teachers, nurses, social workers, day-care providers and others who have sought to better their economic and intellectual life through higher education. 
The average student debt is now $16,928. Over the last two decades, the United States has shifted its means of helping students finance their education from 55 percent grants to 58 percent loans.
If our public policy is to use debt to finance education, we owe it to students to provide ways to help them manage that debt after graduation.

HEADLINE: Window Of Ignorance 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The latest budget news is worse than even the most dour pessimists had thought possible. But the unfolding fiscal disaster hasn't yet penetrated the public's consciousness -- and the administration is trying to exploit that window of ignorance.
 In fiscal 2000 the federal budget was in surplus by $236 billion. This year's deficit will be more than $100 billion, possibly more than $150 billion. Only the Treasury Department knows exactly how much money is coming in, but the renewed push to raise the debt limit, which will allow the government to borrow more money, suggests that the news is grim indeed. A year ago Treasury officials said they could stay within the current debt limit until 2008; in April they said they could make it into June; now they say they'll hit the wall in a couple of weeks. 
 And it's not a temporary shortfall. One insider told me to watch the plans for next week's auction of federal bonds: "If Treasury auctions five-year rather than one-year bonds, that could tip their hand that we have a chronic, long-term problem." Sure enough, most of the bonds auctioned next week will be five-year. 
How did a huge surplus turn into a huge deficit? The recession, the tax cut and terrorism -- in that order -- all played a role. Also, it now seems clear that the big surplus in 2000, almost twice as large as the surplus in the previous year, was an aberration -- that tax receipts were inflated by the technology bubble. In retrospect it's hard to believe that we locked in large, long-term tax cuts based on exactly one year in which the non-Social-Security budget was in significant surplus. (Thanks, Mr. Greenspan.) 
But anyway, "Who lost the surplus?" is the wrong question. The right question is whether the Bush administration has any plan to return to a balanced budget, let alone to honor George W. Bush's promise to use the Social Security surplus to pay down debt. And the answer is no.
Won't a rebounding economy help? Yes, but not nearly enough. Even a dramatic recovery probably wouldn't be enough to put us in the black. Furthermore, although terror-related spending is only a minor factor in this year's budget (the war in Afghanistan cost only $10 billion), the administration plans a huge defense buildup, which will swallow much of the gains from economic recovery.
Realistically, then, this budget deficit isn't going away on its own. It must be time for more tax cuts.
Actually, tax cuts will continue even without new legislation, because of the deliberately misleading way last year's bill was constructed. Most people got the bulk of their tax cuts in the first year; according to Citizens for Tax Justice, middle-income families can expect on average to see only about $200 in future tax reductions. But that was just a political loss leader. The real beneficiaries of the tax cut are the seriously rich, for whom the best is yet to come: families in the top 1 percent of the income distribution will on average get another $45,000 per year in tax breaks. And since the rich will get so much of the eventual total, that means that 60 percent of the tax cut has yet to take effect. 
Now that we're in fiscal trouble, you might think that it's time to reconsider tax cuts that haven't happened yet -- especially when more than half of those future cuts will go to only 1 percent of the population. After all, the administration is cutting funds for many domestic programs, citing the war on terror as a justification. Isn't war supposed to be a time for shared sacrifice? 
Oh, never mind. The administration and its allies in Congress failed to push through big tax cuts for corporations. But they still hope to lock in tax cuts for the rich, by eliminating the "sunset" provision in last year's tax bill -- the same provision that was used to help hide the tax cut's true cost. Failing that, they'll try to permanently repeal the estate tax. 
The alleged economic justification for these moves -- which is, of course, that they will promote economic recovery -- is so thin that I doubt anyone believes it. ("I was thinking of buying a new car, but I'm worried about my taxes in 2011.") What it's really about is exploiting a window of opportunity. Mr. Bush is still riding a wave of wartime popularity; the public still doesn't know how bad the budgetary situation is.
And if you think I'm being too cynical, you haven't been paying attention.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
RallyLoses Much of Its Steam as Technology Shares Fall

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street took an expected break yesterday after a two-day blue-chip buying spree, leaving prices narrowly mixed. The Dow industrials managed a moderate gain, but technology stocks continued to slide.
 "We needed a little bit of a breather here," said Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 32.24 points, or 0.3 percent, at 10,091.87. The Dow has rallied 272 points since Tuesday, claiming its first three-day winning streak since the period that ended March 12.
But the broader market was lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 32.71 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 1,644.82, after having lost 10.70 points on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.90 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,084.56.
Many analysts and portfolio managers say lower prices are the only compelling reason to buy stocks, because too few companies have issued positive outlooks and economic data has been mixed. Prices are lower as both the Dow and the Nasdaq have suffered weekly declines for five of the last six weeks.
The Commerce Department said orders to factories rose at a robust level of 0.4 percent in March.
"The market is still looking for some convincing evidence that the economic recovery is under way and that a profits recovery is likely to follow," said Bob Armknecht, portfolio manager of the Galaxy Equity Growth Fund in Boston. "I think we will work in a trading range until that takes place. People are still waiting."
Yesterday's buying again centered on blue chips, which because of their status as safer havens, indicated that investors are still being cautious.
H & R Block surged $3.81, to $43.81, after saying that earnings for fiscal 2002 should be at the higher end of its already raised expectations. The company also said results for 2003 should surpass Wall Street's forecast.
Procter & Gamble climbed $1.44, to $93.24, two days after releasing third-quarter profits that were a penny a share higher than expectations.
But Xerox fell $1.08, to $7.99, after Moody's Investors Service reduced its rating on about $9 billion of the company's senior unsecured debt.
The market's weakest sector continues to be technology, widely expected to be the last to recover from recession. Yesterday's technology losers included Microsoft, down $1.54 at $51.21, and Intel, which fell 76 cents, to $27.87.
In addition, shares in the Adelphia Communications Corporation, the cable TV operator, dropped 94 cents, to $6.01, after it said that it planned to restate financial results for 1999 and 2000 to account for more than $1 billion in off-the-books debt. Adelphia stock has plunged 70 percent since it first disclosed the debt on March 26.
Treasuries slipped yesterday as investors turned cautious ahead of today's release of the April jobs report, which many will use to gauge the health of the economic recovery.
The 10-year note fell 12/32, to a price of 98 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.10 percent from 5.05 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond declined 10/32, to 96 31/32. Its yield increased to 5.59 percent from 5.57 percent.

HEADLINE: No Easy Fixes Are Seen To Curb Sex-Site Access 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
One of the most thorough reports ever produced on protecting children from Internet pornography has concluded that neither tougher laws nor new technology alone can solve the problem. 
 "Though some might wish otherwise, no single approach -- technical, legal, economic or educational -- will be sufficient," wrote the authors of the report, "Youth, Pornography and the Internet," issued yesterday by the National Research Council. "Rather, an effective framework for protecting our children from inappropriate materials and experiences on the Internet will require a balanced composite of all of these elements." 
 What might seem a rather bland conclusion is actually a surprising stand, said Alan B. Davidson, associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a technology-policy organization in Washington. 
"The report dares to be unsexy," he said. "It does not call for legislation to solve this problem," despite a strong push in Congress to pass laws requiring technology tools like pornography filters in schools and libraries. One such law, the Children's Internet Protection Act, is being challenged in federal court by a coalition of librarians and civil liberties groups; a decision in that case is expected this month.
Richard L. Thornburgh, the former attorney general who led the project, predicted in a preface to the report that its conclusions "will disappoint those who expect a technological 'quick fix' to the challenge of pornography on the Internet."
The language of the report is meticulously balanced but wryly conclusive. Filters intended to block pornographic sites, the report explained, "can be highly effective in reducing the exposure of minors to inappropriate content if the inability to access large amounts of appropriate material is acceptable."
The report compared the problem of protecting children from online risks to dealing with a more mundane hazard of daily life. "Swimming pools can be dangerous for children," the authors wrote. "To protect them, one can install locks, put up fences and deploy pool alarms. All of these measures are helpful, but by far the most important thing that one can do for one's children is to teach them to swim."
Bruce A. Taylor, the president of the National Law Center for Children and Families, said the report would be the basic document for judges and lawmakers approaching these issues for the foreseeable future, but added that he was disappointed that the group did not make strong recommendations on "techno-gizmos of their own" that he said might be developed, like age identifiers that would follow minors through cyberspace. Such ideas have been criticized as impractical by Internet engineers, but Mr. Taylor said a strong push from the committee might have helped move things forward. "Parents can't create those protocols and protections," he said, "but how hard would it be for industry to do it?" 
Herbert Lin, the director of the study, said the process shook the preconceptions that each participant brought to the table. Many of them, he said, believed at the beginning "if only people would just do this -- whatever 'this' is -- the problem would be all over."
"Nobody," he said, "realized how complicated the process was."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Co-ops and Town Houses in Harlem

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
Another chapter in the transformation of Harlem is being written on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and the blocks that adjoin it on 120th and 121st Streets. A 73-apartment co-op building and nine town houses are under construction in a development called Harriet Tubman Gardens, with the first residents to move in during the fall.
 The eight-story middle-income co-op apartment building sits at 2235 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, the continuation of Central Park West, and it is flanked by the town houses on the side streets. The cluster was designed by John M. Ellis and is being developed and built by the Bluestone Organization, a real estate company based in Queens. 
 The project is being done under the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development's Cornerstone program, which was established in 1999 with a double mission: to increase home ownership opportunities and to eliminate the desolation of empty land.
The department conveyed the site, just less than an acre, to the New York City Housing Partnership, which acted as conduit to the developer and owns it until construction is complete. Bluestone paid $1 for the land in June. 
Financing for the co-ops came from the Housing Development Corporation's New Housing Opportunities Program, which provided a $5.9 million loan, and J. P. Morgan Chase, which lent $3.7 million for the town houses. The development's total cost is $23.7 million.
Although the Cornerstone program was not meant solely for Harlem, the 22 sites in various stages of development so far are all there. Ten of the 22 are on or near Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
"It is a main corridor though which people drive and enter the Harlem community," said Christopher Cirillo, director of large-scale development for H.P.D. "Even though there has been a lot of investment and rehabilitation on side streets, when you drive up the boulevard, you don't see that. Now there will be no more derelict lots but contextual, attractive new buildings."
Putting town houses next to apartments and penthouses with sweeping views atop more conventional units set the stage for an economically diversified population.
Co-op buyers cannot have an income that exceeds $97,515, which represents 165 percent of the area's median income for a family of four last year. More than 500 prospective buyers submitted their applications to a lottery, and so far contracts have been signed for 16 apartments. 
Four of the seven penthouse units, which are larger than the apartments below and have terraces, are exempt from income ceilings. They are priced at $260,000 to $310,000. Another penthouse has an income limit of $147,750, and the prices of the remaining two are comparable to apartments on lower floors. 
Two-bedroom units are listed at $128,000 to $140,000 and three bedrooms will go for $160,000 to $190,000. 
The building will also have a garage, about 9,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space and a community room and garden. 
The board that will govern the co-op will have considerably less power than boards normally possess. "If you want to sell, the board will have the right of first refusal, but if it doesn't buy, the owners will have the right to sell to whomever they wish," said Steven Bluestone, a partner who is overseeing construction.
Town houses, which have a duplex owner's unit and two two-bedroom rental units, are priced at $550,000. They were financed through private funds, primarily J. P. Morgan Chase. Of the 241 people in the lottery for the nine town houses, seven have signed sales contracts.
Each house will have two front entrances, one for owners and one for tenants. A rear door will lead to an individual private garden.
The office of C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, developed a plan in conjunction with Columbia University's Urban Technical Assistance Project for the redevelopment of Frederick Douglass Boulevard from 110th to 135th Streets, and she put $5 million from her budget into capital financing for the area.
"Now there will be a seamless transition from Central Park West, and not abandonment or neglect," she said.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Inner City Beset By Chronic Health Problems 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2 

 BODY:
Ten years after riots burned through the inner city here, Los Angeles is marking the occasion with a cascade of speeches, and to a remarkable degree, the talk is rosy.
 Community leaders have congratulated themselves for restoring the cityscape with dozens of new shopping complexes, and for conducting multiethnic forums. 
 But several experts argue that these assessments ignore what is a potentially more revealing, and troubling, window into the basic well-being of these still-blighted communities. The area has some of the most widespread and chronic health problems in this huge county, and it is facing these concerns as the Los Angeles County Health Department is preparing to reduce its budget sharply and possibly lay off staff members. 
Even by the poor standards of urban neighborhoods, experts say, the city's South-Central section and the surrounding areas stand out, with crippling levels of diabetes, lung cancer, asthma, obesity and heart disease. A largely Latino immigrant population is unable to find proper care for minor illnesses, much less for pregnancies.
The situation is aggravated by the area's having the highest number of uninsured people in Los Angeles County, which itself has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the United States, about double the national average. In the South-Central neighborhood and its environs, 47.4 percent of adults have no health insurance, according to 1999 data, the latest available.
The four days of violence in 1992 hopscotched from one block to another, leaving 55 dead, 2,300 injured and more than $1 billion in damage after a jury acquitted a group of white police officers for their roles in the beating of a black man, Rodney G. King. City leaders decided that the explosion had been caused largely by poor economic prospects and focused their efforts on creating jobs.
As a result, this week's speeches have generally been filled with economic statistics as the best measure of how far the area has come. But many experts are arguing that the health issues are far more telling indicators of how deep-rooted the fundamental problems are.
"I've been working on the health issues in this area for a long time, and I can tell you the issues have been getting worse for 10 years," said Loretta Jones, the executive director of Healthy African-American Families, a nonprofit organization founded with help from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of California at Los Angeles. "You have all these speeches these days, but the health problems are not even on the radar screen."
For instance, the South-Central area and its environs have the county's highest number of mothers who give birth with no prenatal care -- 17 percent, according to 1999 data -- and the lowest level of adults who get what experts regard as minimal levels of exercise.
Far more residents die from homicides, 56 per 100,000 residents in 1999, than any other area of Los Angeles County, which has nearly 10 million residents.
"We've known for a long time that the health of the community was linked closely to social conditions," said Dr. Paul Simon, Los Angeles County's Director of Health Assessment and Epidemiology, "and so these figures do tell you something about the overall conditions in the area. Sadly, this is a chronic situation. It goes beyond access to health care or simple issues like that. It goes right to the heart of this community."
After the riots, the organization Rebuild L.A. was formed to funnel private investment into the inner city to create jobs. While the group achieved modest successes before it was phased out in 1997, its president, Linda Griego, said focusing too heavily on economic issues might have allowed the more chronic and expensive health problems to fester.
"I put health at the very top of the list of issues that really need a focus now," Ms. Griego said. "I would say that this is going to be the largest problem we're going to have in terms of the cost to us. Remember, the population in these areas is young. If they have these kinds of problems in their 20's or at 30 or 35, imagine what the problems will be like when they're 55."
In other words, she said, providing jobs, difficult as it has been, may have been easy compared with addressing the area's health problems. "In a lot of ways there has been progress in Los Angeles since 1992," said Stewart Kwoh, the departing chairman of the California Endowment, a $3.4 billion health care philanthropy that has given millions of dollars for inner city programs here. "Has there been sufficient attention to health in these areas? Not at all. This is a crisis, there's no doubt about it."
The Health Department changed its approach a few years ago, in part to get at the causes of the health problems. Officials divided the county into eight districts, and in each they have begun organizations to collaborate with grass-roots community groups. The county also compiled comparative statistics on measures of health in the districts, with 1999 figures, the most recent available, and the results were troubling.
The residents of the area that includes the South-Central neighborhood have the highest numbers of deaths due to diabetes, heart disease and lung cancer in the county. The poverty rate, also the highest in the county, is 37 percent. More than 17 percent of mothers give birth with no prenatal care, 25 percent of adults have no regular source of medical care and 47.4 percent of adults and nearly 28 percent of children have no health insurance.
Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's director of public health who helped design the collaboration effort, said the approach had fundamentally shifted the department's focus toward preventive medicine and away from just treating illnesses.
But Dr. Fielding said the approach was being undermined by budget problems. The Health Department is expected to have a $344 million budget gap in the 2004 fiscal year and a $688 million one in the following year.
This is already forcing cutbacks. Dr. Erica Watson, a health officer, explained that, until recently, she had been in charge of community health services in a district just south of the South-Central one. But Dr. Watson was recently given responsibility over an adjacent district as well with no increase in staff or budget.
The South-Central district recently drew up a list of health priorities, and the top four were preventing teenage pregnancy, creating better access to health care, providing prenatal care and creating more opportunities for children to exercise.
"Not one of the four was disease-oriented," said Dr. Belinda Towns, the district's health officer. "They all get at root causes of disease. They may take a long time to provide results, but they have a better chance of long-range success."
Ms. Jones of Healthy African-American Families added, "For so long we just waited for everything to fall apart then we did something in crisis mode. Now, we're talking about prevention. It's a different paradigm. Our community has been researched to death without much actually happening. We want to do something now."

HEADLINE: Court Decision Raises Question Of Legality of New York Casinos 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 2 

 BODY:
An Indian casino in far northern New York State is operating under an invalid agreement with the state, an appeals court ruled today, in a decision that appears to call into question the legality of any casinos in New York State.
 The case deals only with the compact between the St. Regis Mohawk tribe and two successive New York governors, not with the broader question of whether casino gambling is allowable. Nor did the five-judge panel of the State Appellate Division in Albany address that question directly in its unanimous ruling today. 
 But Justice Thomas E. Mercure's decision said, "We conclude that the commercialized Las Vegas-style gambling authorized by the compact is the antithesis of the highly restricted and 'rigidly regulated' forms of gambling permitted by the New York Constitution."
People on both sides of the case said the court's reasoning could signal future trouble for New York's two existing Indian casinos and for the law the Legislature and the governor enacted in October, authorizing up to six new Indian casinos and video gambling machines at several race tracks.
But both sides also cautioned that this was a question for a future lawsuit, and that New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, had not yet weighed in on any of the issues involved.
"Even so, I think it's an important statement that this court is on record saying that commercial, Las Vegas-style gambling may violate the State Constitution," said Cornelius D. Murray, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, who include several antigambling groups, the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce and two state legislators.
Michael McKeon, Gov. George E. Pataki's communications director, said, "We're still reviewing it, but our preliminary view is we think the decision is wrong and we'll be appealing it."
The ruling leaves the existing casinos in a legal fog, and for now they can continue to operate. The court found that the Mohawk casino near Hogansburg, along the St. Lawrence River, was operating illegally, but the plaintiffs did not seek a particular remedy, and the court did not prescribe one.
Mr. Murray said his next move would be to ask the courts and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to order the video gambling machines, which are much like slot machines, removed from the casino.
At issue before the court was the 1993 compact between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Mohawk tribe to establish a casino on the tribe's Akwesasne reservation, along the St. Lawrence River. 
Governor Pataki and the tribe agreed in 1999 to amend the compact to allow the casino to have the electronic gambling machines. The amendment expired a year later, but the tribe has continued to operate the machines. Gambling opponents sued, claiming that such compacts must be approved by the Legislature. A trial judge in Albany agreed, and today the appellate court did as well.
"We hold that because the basic policy decisions underlying the governor's action have not been made by the State Legislature, the governor did not have the authority to bind the state by executing the compact or the amendment," Justice Mercure wrote.
The Legislature could easily fix that problem by passing a bill approving the existing compacts.
The other casino now operating is Turning Stone, near Utica in central New York, on the Oneida Nation reservation. It, too, operates under a compact signed by Mr. Cuomo, without legislative approval, so the same logic that says the Mohawk compact is illegal applies to the Oneida compact as well.
But the case before the court did not address Turning Stone, which is by far the more successful of the two casinos. 
"Turning Stone employs thousands of people, it's a major economic force, and we calculated that the courts would be much more reluctant to pull the rug out from under it," Mr. Murray said. "It was important to get the principles established first, and move from there."
Unlike the Mohawk casino, Turning Stone installed slot-type machines without explicit permission from the state. The state has sued the Oneidas in federal court, challenging that move.
New York's Constitution sharply restricts casino-style gambling, and several attempts to change that with an amendment have failed. But state officials have said that a 1988 federal law laying out guidelines for Indian gambling leaves the state no choice but to allow Las Vegas-style casinos on reservations. Gambling opponents argue that the federal law does not go nearly that far.
The state is now moving toward allowing casinos run by Indian tribes, away from their reservations. The law enacted in October allows for as many as three Indian casinos in the Catskills, one in Buffalo, one in Niagara Falls and one in an unspecified location in western New York. It gives approval in advance to any compact the governor signs with a tribe.
The plaintiffs have also sued to challenge several aspects of the October gambling law. They contend, among other things, that such prior approval of compacts by the Legislature is illegal, and that video gambling machines are prohibited by the State Constitution. That case is pending.

HEADLINE: Budget Deal Remains Fluid, With Key Details Unsettled 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 2 

 BODY:
A day after Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders shook hands on the framework of a budget deal, the agreement appeared to be about as solid as butter left out overnight, as staff members struggled today to shore up critical details and resolve outstanding disagreements.
 Under the tentative deal, the Legislature would add about $600 million in spending to the governor's proposed $89 billion budget, lawmakers and Pataki aides said. But they must also make up for a $1.4 billion shortfall in revenues caused largely by the blow terrorists dealt to the economy last year. 
 To pull off this trick, the leaders are relying on shifting hundreds of millions of dollars in funds dedicated to the environment and health care to the state's general coffers, spending more from reserve funds, borrowing more money for capital projects and raising taxes on tobacco. The plan also counts on raising $175 million from deadbeat taxpayers through an amnesty program. 
The budget is to cover the 2002 fiscal year, which began April 1.
But the agreement remained fluid today, with nothing committed to paper or signed. Even the details of what lawmakers have promised to do to help the city solve its $5 billion budget shortfall remained sketchy. That was evident when the governor was asked at a news conference with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg how much the state would send the city schools.
"I don't want to get into the specifics and the dollars, because though we have the framework of the budget, the leaders still have to sit down with their conferences in the Assembly and the Senate and make sure the membership are on board," the governor said.
Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the Republican majority in the upper house, said he expected the total package of aid the state would provide the city to be worth about $600 million, but he also hedged his comments. "Until everything is wrapped up, it's hard to get more specific," he said.
But Assembly Democrats with knowledge of the tentative agreement said the Legislature would give the city the ability to raise parking fines, impose new telephone taxes and refinance some of its debt to raise about $200 million. The state also intends to let the city raise the tax on cigarettes to $1.50 a pack from 8 cents, but the state would get half of the $250 million generated by the tax. A pack of cigarettes in the city now costs about $5, including taxes.
Beyond these measures, state leaders are undecided about what else to do for City Hall. "That hasn't been finalized," one senior legislative aid said. "I can't tell you what the city will get out of this budget."
The agreement does include some new tax cuts. Families of victims of the attack on the World Trade Center will not have to pay income tax for what they earned in the last two years. The state would also create three tax-free periods during the year in Lower Manhattan to attract shoppers to that devastated area, a proposal the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, championed.
The precise amount of aid the city schools will get also remained murky today. The agreement adds $515 million in education aid to the $14.2 billion the governor first proposed, but lawmakers have not decided how much of the increase will go to the city.
The state will also give the city schools an additional $200 million to cover old expenses from previous years that were never reimbursed because the city was late in requesting payment. That money is expected to be spent on higher salaries for teachers, Mr. Silver said.
Beyond the additional school aid, the Legislature persuaded Mr. Pataki to add about $240 million in spending to restore some cuts he proposed to the college scholarships and give raises for thousands of health-care workers, among them employees of nonprofit homes for the mentally ill, a Pataki administration official said.
The state would pay for these additions partly by taking money from bank accounts fed by special taxes and earmarked for particular purposes. The plan calls for taking $200 million out of the Environmental Protection Fund to help close the budget gap.
Another $200 million would be taken from a health care fund that usually provides insurance for the poor and used it to pay for emergency medical costs stemming from the Sept. 11 attack. The money would eventually be repaid, administration officials said. "We are doing a lot of cash snatching," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Governor Pataki has declined to raise taxes to deal with the financial crisis, but there are a few hidden tax increases in the plan. The state's cigarette tax would be expanded to include chewing tobacco and cigars, for instance.
The administration also plans to borrow about $300 million to pay for construction projects rather than using cash, officials said. Mr. Pataki has also agreed with legislative leaders to scale back $1 billion in borrowing he wanted to do to provide seed money for high-tech companies developing new products. Instead, the state would borrow $600 million for those projects this year, and $600 million more next year, but only if revenue from future Indian casinos becomes a reality.
Lobbying against some pieces of the tentative budget began in earnest today, even though state leaders committed none of their ideas to paper. Some environmentalists bemoaned taking money from the Environmental Protection Fund, which is supposed to be dedicated to buying parkland, recycling and similar programs. Hospital executives also complained about borrowing $200 million from the $1.9 billion in various pools for health care.
One thorny problem still unresolved is how to offer early retirement to state workers. Several plans were floated at the bargaining table, but legislative leaders and the governor could not agree. Union leaders have proposed several plans, but so far none has satisfied the demands of the Democratic speaker and the Republican governor.
Mr. Silver has advocated a program under which any employee who had reached 55 years of age and served 25 years would be eligible. The governor insists managers should be able to pick and choose who would be let go.
Some lawmakers said the unresolved issues like the early retirement incentives made it less likely the deal would hold together until a budget could be passed. "I do not think this deal will stick," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester County. "It seems to me fairly clear that you have a handshake deal on a big-picture agreement with many, many pieces unclear."
The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., also released a report today saying that the economic assumptions underlining the mayor's budget were too rosy. In particular, he said the city's economy was likely to grow far more slowly than the mayor predicted, expanding by just 2 percent rather than the 4.7 percent forecast by the mayor.
Mr. Thompson also predicted that the number of new jobs would rise by 30,000, or 5,300 fewer than the executive budget assumes. Mr. Bloomberg's plan assumes that Wall Street is likely to rebound next year, which "is heartening but may not be something that the city should count on," according to a statement released by Mr. Thompson's office.

HEADLINE: Mournful Task Ending, Forever Unfinished 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
It is nearly done.
 Through the blur of unnoticed seasons, in an effort without parallel, 1.6 million tons of material from the collapse of the World Trade Center have been dismantled, examined and carted off to be examined again. That fire-spitting, hellish mound -- crushed concrete and scorched metal and body parts -- has been reduced, one truckload at a time, to a few piles on a bedrock-bottomed pit. 
 Now, heavy machines called grapplers pick away at what little remains of a structural Colossus. Bulldozers lay the material out in patches that look like freshly tilled gray gardens. Firefighters rake through the gray, searching for pieces of people. Some mutter that the firefighters are moving too slow, but there is no overtime being paid. Besides, as one fire official put it: how long is too long to search for a finger?
The scene is both mesmerizing and macabre. "It's a little hypnotic when you watch it," said John T. Vigiano, a retired fire captain who has kept vigil there for nearly eight months, ever since his only children -- a police detective and a firefighter -- disappeared in a summer morning's roar. "It's like a ballet." 
The curtain is about to fall on this mournful ballet. The last of what was the trade center will be gone by the end of the month, creating profound physical and psychological shifts regarding a singular calamity. The recovery operation that began in Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11 will end -- only because there will be nothing left to dig out -- and a new phase, the rebuilding phase, will begin. 
It means that the Salvation Army's rest-and-relaxation tent, called the Taj Mahal, will be taken down. That the Sunday Masses, in front of a cross made of girders, will end. That the residents will no longer worry about the dust billowing from departing trucks. That the laborers and police officers and counselors will share awkward farewells. That the firefighters will finally leave.
On a more universal scale, the end of the recovery operation will expose its most painful truth: that no matter how extraordinary the effort has been, it will forever be incomplete. The remains of 1,008 of the 2,823 victims have been identified, with more to come through DNA matches, but hundreds of families will not fulfill their need to bury loved ones. Coffins are meant to carry more than air, they say, and the urns of ground zero dirt that the city distributed were just that: dirt. 
How, then, can private grief be balanced with public works? How can anyone tell Michael Pietronico, who lost his brother, that he is wrong in wanting the entire 16-acre site to be a memorial park? Or tell Monica Iken that she is mistaken to believe that her husband's heart -- his heart -- is in this spot?

Experiencing the Loss
The approaching end of the recovery is so emotionally freighted that government officials have been holding meeting after meeting to decide how best to mark the moment -- how to be dignified about an overwhelming indignity. In a recent letter that took weeks to compose -- the salutation reads "Dear Family Member" -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki explained that efforts to identify remains will continue at the medical examiner's office and at the Fresh Kills Landfill, where more than 105,000 truckloads of material have been brought. But they also gently noted that "in the next few weeks, the official recovery effort at ground zero will be completed." 
Mr. Vigiano knows that the moment is near. The remains of his younger son, Detective Joseph Vigiano, 34, were found in October. ("Imagine being happy when they find the remains of your dead son," he said.) But there has been no trace yet of his older boy, John, a 36-year-old firefighter, and this father without children can do nothing but watch the diminishing piles.
In the first few months he was there every day, from 7 in the morning until 11 at night. But then he broke his arm at the site, and something else snapped as well. Now, he drives in every Wednesday from Deer Park, on Long Island, with other retired firefighters who come to support a man so respected on the job that he was called "Monsignor." And on Sundays he escorts his wife, Jan; he gets her coffee, makes sure she wants for nothing as she stares into the abyss.
Mr. Vigiano is so much a part of the site that construction workers, police officers and firefighters have formed a protective cocoon around the slightly hunched man of 63. They shake his hand and are slow to let go, as though some of his grace might be transferred through touch. Mr. Vigiano says that he visits the disaster site for them and will remain here as long as they are here. But once the recovery is over, he is gone, and he has no plans to come back. "There is nothing here for me," he said, looking down into the pit. "My sons are in heaven."
John Vigiano claims no ownership of how one should feel about the end of recovery at the disaster site. The matter is so immense that people come to it from different points in the circles of grief and awe. 
There are those for whom the obliteration of the Borders book store symbolizes vulnerability and the loss of a way of life. And those who cannot forget leaving the site with the muck of death still on their clothes and taking the subway two stops to another world, another city. And, of course, there are those who lost loved ones: some who come to the site faithfully, some who never come, some whose inability to articulate feelings about the recovery's end can say so much.
"I don't judge any of them," said the Rev. Brian Jordan, a Franciscan who has said Mass at the site every Sunday. "I just listen and say, 'I hear you.' "
Giacinto (Jack) Mirto is one of the thousands of trades people who have been heralded as heroes for working a job that no apprenticeship could have prepared them for. He is 29, a broad-shouldered man from Toms River, N.J., and he declines to specify what he has witnessed in seven months of operating a grappler machine at the site.
"I've seen it all," he said, sounding like a soldier fresh from battle. "Everything was just there, right in front of you."
He remembers how his heart raced at his first sight of the destruction; how his 65-ton Hitachi excavator nearly fell through the debris floor; how time lost meaning, how Thursday could just as well be Tuesday or Sunday; how he forged a bond with the ironworkers, laborers and others working beside him. Now this part of his young life is nearly over. And while he did not know any of the victims, he said, he is ready to work a site that does not merge the emotional with the physical. "It'll be good to start spending time with family," he said. But that does not mean he will suddenly open up to his wife, Gina, about what he has been through. "I don't tell her nothing."
Bobby Gray, the supervising foreman for the site's operating engineers, said people like Mr. Mirto have not had time to sort out what they have been through, just as they are not prepared for the end. He said that laid-off union members constantly ask to come back. "They just keep calling and calling and calling: 'Get me a day. Get me a night,' " he said. "I think that it's out of some sense of duty that you want to see this thing through to the end. After everything they've done, they just want to be there for when the job is finished."
For many firefighters, the job will never be finished, the vow to recover the dead -- including their own -- not kept. For months now, the Fire Department's counseling unit has been dispatching teams to give firefighters at the site a chance to vent ("We assure them that picking up body parts isn't a normal thing," said Malachy P. Corrigan, the director of the counseling unit.)
What counselors hear from the firefighters in the pit -- who sift and wait, sift and wait -- is the anger rooted in the realization that more than 150 of the 343 firefighters killed have not been found or identified. "I think that the day the operation shuts down is going to be more critical than any other day for the Fire Department," Mr. Corrigan said. "Their mission is over, and what are they going to do now?"
Rich Denninger, a counselor and retired firefighter, agreed: "They know what's going to happen, and they don't like it. When it shuts down, a third of the guys are going to say, 'We aren't finished yet,' and the rest are just going to walk away."
Recovery workers feel this way because of people like Robert Kelly, a firefighter whose brother, Firefighter Thomas R. Kelly, has not been recovered.
Robert Kelly, a man who seems to sag in his coveralls, has spent a lot of time at the site, helping where he can, and knows that no whistle has sounded in recent days to signal the discovery of another body. He said he is almost looking forward to the end, to being a full-time father again, to not dedicating so much time to such an awful place. Of the dead, including his brother, he said: "They wouldn't want us to sit here and mope. They'd want us to go on."
Still, Mr. Kelly said, "I can tell you that when I'm here, I feel my brother."
That sense of a lingering presence, created in part by the reality that many victims were essentially vaporized, is not uncommon among families who lost loved ones, and has further complicated the planning for the site's future. The 16-acre property was once an economic center that many people argue must be recreated in some fashion. But the knowledge that the site may soon be transformed is "torture, pure torture" for many people, said Jonathan D. Greenspun, the commissioner of the city's Community Assistance Unit. "They're afraid of hearing that this is over."
Monica Iken is among those who think that everything is moving too fast, who fear that the dead will be forgotten in all the chatter about opportunity for a downtown renaissance, who are bracing for that difficult moment when the recovery ends. The remains of her husband, Michael P. Iken -- a bond trader for Maxcor/Euro Brokers -- have not been found or identified, and so all she has is that forsaken site where he spent his last moments.
"People need to understand," she said. "They're there. Their souls are there, and that is our graveyard. It would be very difficult to acknowledge that my husband went poof, and there is nothing of him."
In trying to give substance to the intangible, Ms. Iken said she has formed the organization, September's Mission, "to make sure that we have the most beautiful memorial that the world will ever see." 
"We need a place to go in the future," she said.
Michael Pietronico agrees. Growing up in Jersey City, he was called "Little Bernard," after the older brother he adored. Now he bristles at the blueprint traces of buildings and streets over the place where his brother, a bond trader for Cantor Fitzgerald, died. The recovery of his brother's remains has not lessened his anger.
"It just troubles me to think of buildings built on that site, and construction activity picking up, when there are a lot of people's remains effectively etched in the soil," he said. "It just seems cold to me to expect people to go about their lives around that site as if nothing ever happened."
Mr. Pietronico knows that he is in the distinct minority, but still, he believes that nothing should be built on the site except a memorial. "The world can move ahead without 16 acres more office space," he said.

Marching Ahead With Time
But among those who lost loved ones on Sept. 11, there are different degrees of passion for the disaster site -- and for a memorial. As Father Jordan said, "There are 3,000 families affected, and probably 3,000 opinions for a memorial."
Mae Mills acknowledges that she does not feel the same emotional grip that others have for the place that consumed her husband, Charles. He was an enforcement director for the State Department of Taxation and Finance who, at 61, was talking about retiring and losing weight for his daughter's coming wedding. Now, he is gone, never to be recovered, and Ms. Mills claims that she knew it the moment the second plane hit.
There needs to be a memorial somewhere on the site, she said, but rebuilding downtown would be the best memorial to the dead. She said that she visited the site for the first time in months a few weeks ago, and was struck by the transformation. West Street, for example, was about to reopen. 
"It was nice to see life going on," Ms. Mills said, adding that she did not know how much meaning to ascribe to the recovery's end. "I think we're going to be talking about this 10 years from now," she said, "and still be frozen in time by the enormity."
The late-afternoon sun glanced through a SoHo cafe's window to highlight the ruefulness in Nikki Stern's smile. She had just been asked what the end of the recovery work at the disaster site meant to her, and her mind was whirring with thoughts -- including the realization that so many dates are now markers. The Ides of March, for example: the day the police came to her Princeton home, signaling that the remains of her husband, James E. Potorti, had been identified.
Ms. Stern belongs to five committees related to Sept. 11, and prides herself on being able to recognize the myriad ways that people are trying to cope with the disaster. When asked for her own opinions about the site's future, she said she only knew that her husband liked the hustle and bustle of downtown -- its "life force," she said. "If Jim isn't here in my heart, he isn't anywhere," she said. "That makes him portable."
Her cellphone rang. It was a friend, calling to say that she had just been notified that her own husband's remains had been identified.
"Are you sure you're all right?" Ms. Stern asked, her voice quavering. "Are you sure? I'll call you later."
She hung up, and cried a little. Then she composed herself and returned to the question of what the end of recovery at a place in Lower Manhattan means to her.

HEADLINE: CYCLING; 
A Day for Sunday Drivers on Two Wheels

BYLINE:  By GRACE LICHTENSTEIN 

 BODY:
No sideswiping taxis, no fume-belching buses, no zigzagging skaters, no oblivious jaywalkers, no manic bike messengers. One day a year, bicyclists in New York City can negotiate the streets, highways and bridges of the five boroughs without many of the usual distractions. That day this year is Sunday, when 30,000 riders are expected to take part in Bike New York, the car-free, 42-mile pedal parade that is the nation's largest bicycle rally.
 "It's become a great event, like the New York City Marathon," said Martin Nichols, manager of Bicycle Habitat, a retail store in Manhattan. 
 Like the marathon, Bike New York attracts thousands of visitors from out of state and overseas. But because it is not a race, there is no prize money, no major television coverage, minimal policing, few spectators and, in the past, a casual atmosphere.
This year is the event's 25th anniversary, and there are a few tacks in the road, due mostly to security concerns and to economics.
In previous years, thousands of so-called bandits, participants who did not pay the entry fee ($30 to $35 for adults, $15 for children), sneaked into the pack, helped themselves at three food stops and enjoyed the thrill of cruising on the F.D.R. Drive and on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. But this year the military has told organizers to weed out any riders not wearing Bike New York vests before they cross the Verrazano, because the finish line is at a Coast Guard installation, Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island.
In response, Bike New York, a nonprofit organization formed by American Youth Hostels, the ride's original sponsor, has hired 20 private security officers to supplement its 600 marshals and 600 other volunteers.
"We want to do this in the most gentle way," said Pam Tice, the ride's executive director. "We're hoping it will work. The delays won't be long." (By comparison, the New York City Marathon, with about the same number of entrants, deploys about 12,000 race-day volunteers and is patrolled by 2,000 police officers.)
The police will play no role in checking for vests, said a department spokesman, Sgt. Kevin Hayes, although the department has assigned officers for crowd control, traffic and security. Tice said her organization was giving the police a list of entrants.
The tour begins just a few blocks from ground zero. Last year, this location was the site for the accompanying New York City Bicycle Show for consumers and the trade. It drew about 15,000 people over three days to its location on the mezzanine of the north tower of the World Trade Center. After Sept. 11, the show's promoter scrambled to find a site for this year's show, which ended yesterday at the Penn Plaza pavilion. Companies including Schwinn, Cannondale, Specialized, Trek, Giant and small custom bike builders displayed their latest models.
While the bulk of the Bike New York riders are from the five boroughs, New England and the mid-Atlantic states, the tour attracts several thousand cyclists from elsewhere.
Anne and Don O'Connor made plans to fly in from Britain to join the ride, to see their daughter, who moved to New York just before Sept. 11, and to "show some solidarity with the city."
The Tour de France it's not. Celebrities in attendance? "Um, Cousin Brucie," said Tice, referring to the longtime disc jockey. Iris Weinshall, commissioner of the city's Department of Transportation, is also expected. Bicycling advocates have given her credit her for improving the event.
For the first time, Transportation Alternatives, a watchdog group, gave the city an A on its annual report card for opening all five East River bridges to bicycles and for completing the Hudson River greenway, a paved trail from Battery Park to the George Washington Bridge, among other improvements.
"We're seeing a lot of enthusiasm and smart planning, and we're hoping this continues," said Noah Budnick, Transportation Alternatives project director.
The tour and related show kick off almost a month of bicycling events in New York. They supplement year-round efforts by Bike New York, the city, the police and Transportation Alternatives to promote safe cycling and to rehabilitate reckless riders. There are bike rodeos to teach safety skills, tours of bike lanes and greenways, and patrols to educate those who career on sidewalks, pedal against traffic or fail to yield to pedestrians.
Andrew Vesselinovitch, the transportation department's bicycle program director, said he hoped that with the release of the new edition of the official New York bike map this week, along with Bike New York and other guided tours, "people will learn that it's as comfortable out on the street as they would like it to be."
He added: "The more intrepid bikers there are out there, the better it is for those out only occasionally. Motorists become more aware."
Even without cars, Bike New York is not without mishaps. Tice said there were scores of minor accidents every year and a few major ones. "The most popular bone to break is the clavicle," she said.
Medics on Bikes, under the direction of Geoffrey Doughlin, of Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, will be on hand to attend to the fallen. Over the years there have been three deaths during the ride, two from heart attacks and one from a cyclist's speeding out of control.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a sports article yesterday about Bike New York misstated the dates of the three-day consumer trade show associated with it. The show started Thursday; it did not end on that day. It runs through today, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.

U.S. Announces Gathering To Seek Middle East Peace
The Bush administration will join Europe, Russia and the United Nations in convening an international conference on Middle East peace and economic reconstruction this summer.

Poll Finds U.S. Catholics Support Zero Tolerance
American Roman Catholics say priests who sexually abuse children and teenagers should be barred from participating in parish life, and any accusations of abuse should be investigated by local law enforcement rather than the church, a New York Times/CBS News Poll found. Seventy percent said Catholic lay people should be involved in decisions about cases of abuse by priests. A1

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Come hither: Abercrombie & Fitch invites other advertisers into its A&F Quarterly.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ABERCROMBIE & FITCH, the apparel retailer known for sexually provocative quarterly catalogs dressed -- or undressed -- to resemble magazines, is now taking a commercially provocative step.
 For the first time, the company, which regularly comes under fire for the nude photographs that appear in the catalog, known as the A&F Quarterly, is selling advertising space in the publication to other marketers seeking to reach consumers ages 18 to 24, the primary market for Abercrombie & Fitch. 
 The change, described as an experiment, begins with the summer issue of the A&F Quarterly, which has been mailed to subscribers and is on sale at Abercrombie & Fitch stores. Initially, the outside marketers are being limited to four in each issue, in a separate section, and each must buy a two-page ad, known as a spread. 
The eight ad pages in the summer issue were bought for SoBe beverages; the Sony Computer Entertainment division of Sony, for the Sony PlayStation 2 video game system; the Trek Bicycle Corporation; and the WB television network. Though neither Abercrombie & Fitch nor the advertisers would discuss the rates, the price per ad page is being estimated in the low five figures.
The decision is indicative of how the lines continue to blur between advertising and editorial content as media companies and marketers struggle to generate revenue to overcome difficulties caused by the soft economy. Several other retailers and apparel marketers have already opened their catalogs or magazines to outside advertisers, among them L. L. Bean, Louis Boston, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom.
As more advertisers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coca-Cola and the Ford Motor Company assume a more direct role in determining the editorial content of the media in which they advertise, media companies are moving to accommodate advertisers by increasing product placements in episodes of television series, introducing publications that celebrate shopping without critical coverage or changing the color of the staples at the center of magazines to match the hue desired by advertisers.
Indeed, in a coincidental confluence of interests between advertiser and publisher, the ad in the A&F Quarterly from WB, promoting its series "Smallville," features two of the show's stars, one of whom, Tom Welling, who portrays Superman as a teenager, formerly modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch. The issue also carries an interview with Eddie Kaye Thomas, a star of another WB series, "Off Centre."
"We found it very intriguing," Bob Bibb, co-president for advertising, marketing and promotion at WB in Burbank, Calif., said of the opportunity to advertise in the quarterly. He took the space after he was assured that WB "could be the exclusive network television advertiser."
The primary appeal, Mr. Bibb said, was the "uncluttered environment" in which to reach the college-age audience, referring to the limited number of marketers in each issue, because "if you put a spread in any other magazine, you're one of a thousand advertisers." WB is owned by AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company.
For SoBe, "it makes sense because their target market, 18-to-24-year-old kids, is our target market," said Kristine Hinck, a spokeswoman for the South Beach Beverage Company in Norwalk, Conn., part of the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of PepsiCo. "It's a good fit."
The A&F Quarterly, introduced in fall 1997, has a circulation of about 200,000. Abercrombie & Fitch, which is based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, also distributes a traditional catalog, without the articles or the photographs by Bruce Weber of scantily clad young men and women. The ads will not appear in the traditional catalog, which has a circulation of about a million.
The quarterly is produced by Abercrombie & Fitch along with its agency, Shahid & Company in New York.
Accepting outside advertising "was something we've thought about for a long time," said Sam Shahid, the president and creative director at the agency, who is also the creative director for Abercrombie & Fitch.
"We were worried about it being too commercial," Mr. Shahid added, "but with four advertisers, only spreads and a section to itself, we thought we'd try it."
"It looks great," he said -- or at least, readers "aren't complaining about it."
Each issue of the quarterly typically elicits vociferous complaints, usually from adults upset about barely dressed models. An editorial last week in The Wall Street Journal castigated the quarterly for looking "more like a 300-page soft-core porn magazine than the mail-order catalog it purports to be."
By carrying ads from other marketers, Abercrombie & Fitch may be causing more headaches for itself because protesters, rebuffed by the retailer, may instead exert pressure on the outside advertisers.
Mr. Shahid said that possibility did not trouble him because "it happens to every publication," adding that the advertisers "know what the magazine's about, and they feel fine."
Mr. Bibb at WB said that his network "did our due diligence on who gets the magazine" and was satisfied that the measures taken by Abercrombie & Fitch -- like asking buyers of the quarterly at stores for proof of age -- mean that "we wouldn't be doing a disservice to our parental and family viewers."
Still, he added, laughing, "I don't think you'll be seeing ads for 'Seventh Heaven' " in the quarterly, referring to the WB series favored by children and young families.
Ms. Hinck at South Beach Beverage said that although the editorial content of the quarterly "may be too much for some people, SoBe is all about freedom of expression."
Marketers have the freedom, of course, to consider advertising in whatever publications they want, and scores of regular magazines are also aimed at the youthful demographic. In fact, WB advertises in many of them, Mr. Bibb said, particularly those owned by its AOL Time Warner corporate sibling, Time Inc., like Entertainment Weekly, People and Teen People.
Rob Gregory, publisher of Rolling Stone in New York, another magazine with a large college-age readership, praised the executives behind the quarterly.
"Everything they do is edgy and sexy and delivers a demographic that is increasingly courted by marketers," said Mr. Gregory, whose magazine is owned by Wenner Media. "But true success with this for a retailer is very hard to come by."
"I would wish them well and say ad sales is harder than it looks these days," he added, "and they'll have to be accountable" for delivering the audience they promise.
At Jane in New York -- a magazine from the Fairchild Publications division of Advance Publications that is read by many college-age women -- Eva Dillon, vice president and publisher, said: "Who hasn't come after this demographic and advertising base? I'm confident what they're doing is so different, it won't really compete with what we do. My feeling is, bring it on."

HEADLINE: Paper Maker From Dublin Being Courted By U.S. Firm 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 2 

 BODY:
Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm based in Chicago, is in talks to acquire the Jefferson Smurfit Group, the large paper and packaging company in Ireland, people close to the companies said today.
 Jefferson Smurfit issued a statement confirming that it had been approached but declined to identify the bidder. Executives from Madison Dearborn did not return calls seeking comment. 
 The news sent the American depository receipts of Smurfit soaring $3.74, or 15 percent, to $28.03. The talks are likely to flush out other suitors, said analysts, who cited the International Paper Company and Mondi International, a unit of Anglo American, as potential bidders.
Paper and packaging companies have been consolidating to shield them from a global economic slowdown that has crimped demand for everything from magazine paper to cardboard boxes. The Weyerhaeuser Company recently paid $7.8 billion to acquire Willamette Industries.
Jefferson Smurfit, the world's largest producer of container board, the paper used to make cardboard boxes, has been on an acquisition spree lately, driven by its chief executive, Michael Smurfit, who is the founder's son. Mr. Smurfit has been criticized for his large salary and spending. Although the company is based in Dublin, Mr. Smurfit lives in Monaco and is a horse racing fan and golfer. Jefferson Smurfit owns the Kildare Hotel and Country Club, which will be host to the 2005 Ryder Cup.
Mr. Smurfit has said he will give up the chief executive post in October, although he is expected to remain chairman.
Some of Jefferson Smurfit's acquisitions have come with costly side effects. A 1998 purchase of 29 percent of the Stone Container Corporation, for instance, has depressed Jefferson Smurfit's share price.
Owning a minority stake means Jefferson Smurfit cannot consolidate Stone's cash flow in its financial statements, yet Stone contributes nearly half of Jefferson Smurfit's earnings. Investors have discounted the stock as a result of that awkward relationship, and few suitors would want the company as long as it retained its stake in Stone, said Liam Igoe, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers.
The current negotiations address that problem, although talks are still at an early stage, people close to the companies said. Jefferson Smurfit would spin off its stake in Stone Container to its own shareholders. For each Jefferson Smurfit share they own, investors would receive one share to reflect the value of their stake in Stone Container and one to reflect the value of their Jefferson Smurfit holding. Then, an acquirer could bid only for the Jefferson Smurfit shares.
An offer, excluding the value of Stone Container, could be worth about $2.5 billion, analysts said. An acquirer would also assume $1.3 billion in Jefferson Smurfit debt.
Madison Dearborn has been active in the paper and packaging industry before. Recent investments include the Bay State Paper Holding Company, a manufacturer of recycled paperboard products, and Riverwood Holdings, a producer of specialty paper products.

Increase in Subscribers Narrows EchoStar's Loss

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LITTLETON, Colo., May 2 

 BODY:
The EchoStar Communications Corporation, the satellite television broadcaster, said today that an increase in subscribers had helped it narrow its first-quarter loss to $38.6 million. 
 First-quarter revenue increased 22 percent, to $1.1 billion, from $862 million in the period last year. 
 The chief executive, Charles W. Ergen, said the company remained focused on its plans to acquire the Hughes Electronics Corporation, which owns DirecTV. 
"If we do only one thing right as a management team, we've got to focus on this merger," Mr. Ergen said. The deal requires regulatory approval, and Mr. Ergen said the Justice Department could rule before the Federal Communications Commission, which has indicated that September is the earliest it might decide.
EchoStar, the owner of the Dish Network satellite service, lost 20 cents a share in the January-March period compared with a loss of $169.9 million, or 36 cents a share, in the period last year. The loss reflects a $58 million accounting charge related to a move by Vivendi Universal to invest $1.5 billion in EchoStar.
The Dish Network had 7.16 million subscribers as of March 31, up 25 percent from last year, although the pace at which it added subscribers slowed. 
About 335,000 net new subscribers signed up in the first quarter, down from about 460,000 in the first quarter of 2001. EchoStar said a weak economy and more competition from digital cable and cable modems contributed to the slowdown. 
The company expected to have eight million subscribers by 2003. 
Mr. Ergen said that he was disappointed with EchoStar's earnings but that the company was working to add subscribers who are more likely to remain long-term customers.
The eight-year deal with Vivendi is expected to help EchoStar buy Hughes from General Motors. Under the deal with G.M., which was reached in October, G.M. would spin off Hughes and merge it with EchoStar.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 2 

 BODY:
Taddele Gebre, a refugee from southern Sudan by way of Ethiopia, had his most recent brush with fear last month in the Moscow metro. Returning home from church, he entered a subway car and found himself facing about 20 youths, some with shaved heads.
 "They were saying, 'You black, go home, or you'll be a corpse here,' " recalled Mr. Gebre, a diminutive man with a degree in agriculture from a university in Krasnodar, in southern Russia. "I was praying." 
 That time, Mr. Gebre got away with one punch in the face. Other times it was much worse. 
During a spring holiday last year, he took a shortcut home through a nearby schoolyard. A mob of youths beat him, shouting, "Take this for the holiday." In 1998 a large group of skinheads trapped him inside the metro and beat him with chains for 15 minutes until finally a passer-by -- an old woman -- got up the courage to tell them to stop, he said.
In all, he said, he has survived seven racial attacks in four years.
"I am not living in this country, I am surviving," said Mr. Gebre, 38, who stays in Russia because he is waiting for admission to a United Nations program that might allow him to settle in the United States or Western Europe. "And I tell you, surviving is very hard." 
Moscow's ethnic minorities, in particular Africans, Asians and people from the Caucasus, report that in the past five years, racial attacks have been on the rise. The problem has slowly gained national attention; in his address to the nation in April, President Vladimir V. Putin warned against the rise of fascist groups.
In January ambassadors from 37 African countries signed a highly unusual joint appeal to the Foreign Ministry asking for more protection after a spate of attacks on their families and embassy workers.
The attackers are young people, often between the ages of 14 and 20, and often those who feel cast adrift in the economic collapse and social upheaval that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. Like skinhead groups across Europe, these teenagers turn their anger on people of color.
"The rank and file are youths with very few opportunities," said Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies, a research group in Moscow. "They are working-class youths with low levels of education."
The attacks often appear to be organized; Mr. Gebre said many of his attackers were dressed in black with swastika insignias on their arms. And they have been common enough to hold many of Moscow's non-white communities in fear. In April two African-American marine guards from the American Embassy were attacked by skinheads in downtown Moscow.
Russian authorities have played down the problem, suggesting that the attacks are part of the growth in street crime, according to diplomats. 
"The authorities are shying away from accepting the situation," said Nigeria's ambassador, Abdullahi S. Mukhtar. "It has gone beyond the realm of threats -- it's a reality. People are being attacked; people are being killed. We made private appeals over the last couple of years and did not go public. But when you exhaust every avenue and hit a brick wall, what can you do?" 
The police often react slowly, if at all, according to 13 attack victims interviewed over a two-week period. 
One student from Cameroon, Ghislain Kokam, said two officers looked on while a crowd of at least 40 young people beat him for more than 10 minutes on a subway platform. 
In another case, an attack was even captured on film. Joseph Peters, a 29-year-old refugee from Sudan, was carrying a video camera when he was attacked last June. He gave his videotape of the attack to the police, but after almost a year, the police said the tape did not work, though Mr. Peters had shown it to several friends, and, he said, to three police officers sent to question him.
Paul Massa Mayoni died after young people beat him last autumn just outside a United Nations office in Moscow. His attackers face lesser charges of hooliganism after the state prosecutor's office, referring to a forensic report, found that death was caused when Mr. Mayoni's head hit the ground, and not by blows from the attackers sticks. 
The government does not keep statistics on hate crimes but the African ambassadors have counted 141 reported attacks since 2000.
President Putin's speech produced some interest in the issue, and extra police officers patrolled Moscow streets on April 20, the anniversary of Hitler's birth. The date has become a traditional day for racist attacks; on April 20, 2001, a mob killed a Chechen boy near the Kremlin.
But society as a whole has mustered little collective revulsion or sympathy. In part, this may be because life for many ordinary Russians is anything but easy. In addition, the war in Chechnya has engendered negative attitudes toward minorities, in particular Caucasians.
Coming on top of centuries of repression here, the police behavior sends a signal that harassment is permissible.
But there are bright spots. Anur Setelakhi, a 39-year-old Malagasy with a Russian wife and two children, said help from neighbors and quick reaction from the police may have saved his life when he was beaten unconscious on March 31 by youths shouting racial slurs. 
"I have some anxiety, but I am not afraid," Mr. Setelakhi said. "I have Russian friends. I still go out and play with my daughter in the courtyard. It's a shame for the country. Not all Russians are like this."

 BODY:
There's Talk About a Talk Show
 Remember, JERRY SPRINGER was once the mayor of Cincinnati. So what's up next on "The BILL CLINTON Show"? 
 Maybe Mr. Clinton is not really thinking about following in the footsteps of OPRAH WINFREY or SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL. But yesterday the prospect of Mr. Clinton's doing one-on-ones under bright lights was fueled by a report that he had talked with NBC executives in Los Angeles. 
His spokeswoman, JULIA PAYNE, played down the get-together, which was reported yesterday by The Los Angeles Times. In a statement, she called it an "informal meeting" and said that Mr. Clinton "did not demand a talk show." The Times had said he wanted $50 million a year and was not looking to do a political program for fear of conflicts of interest with his wife, SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
"He went to listen," Ms. Payne said, without saying what he heard. NBC had no comment.
ROBERT BARNETT, the Washington lawyer who represents the former president in negotiating his book contract and any other potential media deals, said, "The president has had an enormous number of inquiries and offers from broadcast networks, cable networks, syndicators and international networks. There are no ongoing negotiations and no immediate plans to have any negotiations."

Not a Topic Between Them
Fact: The Directors Guild of America has chosen JANE ALEXANDER, the former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, for one of the awards it will give out next month.
Fact: She is married to ED SHERIN, who is an officer with the union.
Fact: They gave separate interviews -- their idea.
"I never told her" about the award, Mr. Sherin said. "I never told her because I recused myself very early on, when she was mentioned as a possibility. I said, 'Fellas, I can't be involved in any of these decisions, in any of the voting.' I not only left the counsel room, I left the building and went home." He has a policy, he said, and he was just sticking to it: "I don't pass messages. Very often people say, 'Will you please tell Jane?' I say, 'No, you'll have to call her yourself.' "
Ms. Alexander said the person who called was JACK SHEA, the guild's former president. "It's really quite an honor," she said. Among the others scheduled to receive awards at the ceremony on June 9 are SPIKE LEE and the executive producer of "60 Minutes," DON HEWITT.

Mum About a Baby
Hours before the premiere on Wednesday of MATTHEW BARNEY'S film "Cremaster 3," his publicist e-mailed reporters a wire service story saying that the pop singer BJORK, who lives with Mr. Barney, was five months' pregnant. But the prospective parents dashed past reporters on their way to the premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater so quickly that it was impossible to see -- well, you know.
During intermission ("Cremaster 3" is so long it has one), she patted her stomach as they circled the barnlike Ziegfeld and thanked friends for attending the movie. Mr. Barney did not want to spend time talking to reporters. The publicist who had sent the pregnancy e-mail was heard using the word "divaesque."

Abloom in the Bronx
Let us now amend Dorothy Parker's wicked adage: The Bronx? Yes, thonks.
No one actually said that, of course, at the party on Wednesday for the opening of the New York Botanical Garden's $100 million library and herbarium. The first 1,500 guests trooped past displays of rare books and priceless original specimens collected by the likes of George Washington Carver and Charles Darwin. Then a select 350 of them -- including two City Council members, G. OLIVER KOPPELL and JOSE E. SERRANO; the Bronx district attorney, ROBERT T. JOHNSON; the Bronx borough president, ADOLFO CARRION JR.; and his predecessor, FERNANDO FERRER -- sat down to dinner.
As they polished off the rack of lamb, some expressed concern for the city's cultural institutions in tough fiscal times. One of the Garden's staunch supporters, DAVID ROCKEFELLER, called the city's economic situation worrisome but predicted: "Great institutions like the Botanical Garden will find a way of dealing with the problem."
The Garden's Tiffany-designed gold medal went to the sociobiologist EDWARD O. WILSON, who began his speech: "I will not be as brief as Salvador Dali, who once said, 'I shall be so brief I have already finished,' and sat down." There was more, but only about seven minutes' worth. Astonishingly, the crowd was so well mannered that not a single guest took home a centerpiece as a trophy.

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Says Revolt Hasn't Derailed His Plans 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, May 2 

 BODY:
Relaxing with a cigarette, wearing jeans, loafers and leisure jacket, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela hardly looked like he had been to the edge of the political abyss and back. But in an interview away from the presidential palace, Mr. Chavez said the experience of being ousted from office last month in a popular uprising, then restored to power two days later, had not fundamentally changed him.
 "It is the same Chavez, the same Chavez as always," the president, speaking in the third person as he often does, said late Wednesday. 
 Two weeks after retaking office in triumph, Mr. Chavez, 47, said his self-proclaimed peaceful revolution continued on the same path, with the goal of reforming Venezuela's oil-dependent "neo-liberal" economy and funneling revenues into social programs to bring social equality to a country he says has been pillaged by the rich for most of its history. 
"We have resumed the Bolivarian project," said Mr. Chavez, as he sat back in a comfortable chair at a palatial government house overlooking Caracas. 
Spicing his talk with quotes from his hero, Simon Bolivar, the 19th-century South American liberator, the president said that the "most perfect system of governments is one that gives its people the greatest quantity of political stability, the greatest quantity of social security, the greatest quantity of happiness.
"When you ask what we want with the revolution, well, that is what we want, brother," Mr. Chavez said. "The essence of a revolutionary process, peaceful and democratic, is to give our people, to all without exception, without exclusion of anyone because of class, skin color or religious beliefs, the greatest quantity of happiness possible."
Mr. Chavez's efforts to bring that happiness, though, comes as Venezuela emerges from its most serious political crisis in a decade, one that exposed the country's raw and angry divisions between the great masses of poor people who support the president and an antagonized middle and upper class that despises him. 
Though Mr. Chavez said that the economy would grow and that his government was firmly in place, Venezuela is in a precarious political and economic quandary. The International Monetary Fund said the economy would contract by nearly 1 percent this year, which economists attribute to capital flight and falling production at the state-owned oil company.
In the National Assembly, the president's allies, who once dominated the chamber, now have a bare majority. An opposition movement of labor leaders, business people and intellectuals -- many of whom helped mount protests against Mr. Chavez -- are promising a referendum seeking his recall within two years.
Venezuelans are also watching to see if the military, whose leaders opened the way to his downfall when they withdrew their support in the aftermath of protests that turned violent on April 11, will remain loyal to the president.
"He does find himself more constrained than he was," said Michael Shifter, who follows Venezuela for the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy analysis group. "The question is whether he recognizes the situation he's in and the choices that he faces and whether it's possible for him to respond in a much more moderate and pragmatic way."
Mr. Chavez has, since his return, seemed to acknowledge that the ground beneath him has shifted. He has asked the opposition, which he often denigrated in the past, to join his government in "a great debate" and he has promised to "sheathe" his sword, acknowledging that his harsh language has hurt people.
He has also taken tangible steps welcomed by the most influential sector among his opponents, the business class.
He appointed Ali Rodriguez, the well-respected secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and a new board of directors to head the state oil company, gestures that were accommodating to company executives whose rebellion against government interference helped set off protests. The president has also promised to shake up his cabinet with a new economic team, while allies in Congress say several economic laws that were bitterly opposed by businessmen may be reformed.
"I think he's learned from this," Representative William Delahunt, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an interview last weekend after he and two other members of Congress, Representative Cass Ballenger, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Lincoln Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, met with Mr. Chavez. "I think he understands that healing and reconciliation are the true qualities of leadership, not division." 
Some of Mr. Chavez's closest aides said he understood the need to change his style, if not the social policies the government had put in place to remake this country of 24 million.
Tarek William Saab, a congressman and foreign policy adviser to the president, said Mr. Chavez's jolting experience had strengthened his conviction that he was destined to play a role in history. But Mr. Saab said the president also believed that he had to find new ways of dealing with political opponents.
"He is a person who has been thinking profoundly, who recognizes his faults and errors," Mr. Saab said. "And as a human being, he is rectifying and asking for help. He knows he cannot do it alone, though."
Opponents said Mr. Chavez had offered to open the doors to his opponents in the past, only to revert to what critics say is an autocratic style, complete with insults and threats.
"His dialogues are really monologues," said Alberto Garrido, the author of several books on the president and his movement. "Chavez is a man with a thermometer in his hand, trying to see how far he has to go. There will not be profound changes."
In a wide-ranging talk, Mr. Chavez rattled off his government's achievements and calmly offered his views on a range of subjects, from his days as a young soldier to his rocky relationship with neighboring Colombia.
But when he spoke of his country's great political divide, Mr. Chavez gesticulated to make his points, sounding conciliatory one moment and dismissive the next.
He played down the strength of his opposition, even though he was removed from office in a popular uprising that had been in the making for months.
"There is no serious political opposition," he said. "I do not have here in the opposition someone I can call to sit here with me to talk about themes in depth, someone who is a serious, honest leader who has the leadership in the opposition."
Still, Mr. Chavez said he was "dedicating more time to listening to criticism and ideas" and working harder to consider the policy views of the "economic powers, political sectors, the opposition." 
He also said he was not opposed to a nascent movement by opponents to mount a referendum on his rule, explaining that such a measure was legal in 2004 under the Constitution.
Speaking of the United States, which receives most of Venezuela's oil exports, Mr. Chavez said his government had to do a better job to improve its image in Washington. Bush administration officials, irked by Mr. Chavez's dalliances with President Fidel Castro of Cuba and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, seemed pleased in the hours after Mr. Chavez was ousted. 
"There is a false perception in Washington of what Chavez and Venezuela is," said the president. "We have to work harder so they perceive us as we are: a democratic country, with a legitimate president, respectful of human rights, with liberty of expression."
Mr. Chavez, however, said relations with the United States were going "through a difficult moment" because of suggestions that American officials were involved in what the government here considers a coup. Bush administration officials have denied playing any role in Mr. Chavez's removal. 
Mr. Chavez said it would be "horrible" if the United States was involved. "What I have said is that I ask God that it turns out to be false."

HEADLINE: District Council 37 Leaders Offer Budget-Cutting Advice to the Mayor 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In an unusual move for labor, District Council 37, New York's largest municipal union, offered proposals yesterday to reduce the city's budget deficit by more than $600 million.
 The union's leaders gave Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg a long list of proposals, among them placing civilians in all Police Department desk jobs done by officers and hiring 100 more tow truck drivers, which the union said would increase revenues by $20 million. 
 Asserting that nobody knew the inner workings of city government better than its employees, union officials also proposed using lower-paid city engineers rather than higher-paid private consultants to do design work, at an estimated annual savings of $76 million.
Many of the proposals were self-serving -- they would use the union's lower-paid members to do work now performed by higher-paid members of other unions, like teachers and sanitation workers. Nonetheless, several lawmakers praised the district council's proposals, predicting that the City Council and the mayor would take them into account as they sought to narrow the city's estimated $5 billion budget deficit. 
Chris Policano, a spokesman for the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, said, "We should pay attention whenever the men and women of the municipal work force present ideas that save the city money."
In addition to its proposals for savings, District Council 37 called for the city and state to re-establish the commuter tax, which would produce more than $400 million in annual revenues. City Council members who support such a tax increase, which Mayor Bloomberg opposes, are counting on a major lobbying effort by District Council 37 and other unions.
City Hall officials said they welcomed the union's proposals, noting that Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly said that he would listen to anyone who has better ideas on the deficit. The mayor has also said that he needed the cooperation of the municipal unions to tackle the deficit.
"We will review their proposals," said Edward Skyler, the mayor's spokesman.
In presenting the proposals at a news conference on the City Hall steps, Lillian Roberts stepped into the center of a public debate for the first time since she was elected the district council's new executive director two months ago.
She said the union's proposals aimed to help the city save money in part to reduce the likelihood that Mr. Bloomberg will seek to lay off municipal workers, especially after the union's contract and its no-layoff clause expires on June 30.
"It is not the city work force that built the budget crisis, and we do not believe the budget should be balanced on the backs of our 125,000 members," Ms. Roberts said.
The union's proposals emphasized placing civilian workers in desk jobs done by uniformed workers in the police, fire and sanitation departments. While Mayor Bloomberg has proposed saving $44 million next year by moving 800 civilian workers into Police Department jobs now done by the police, District Council 37 proposed placing 3,500 civilians in the department. That, unions officials said, would save the city $127 million next year and would enable the city to move many police officers onto the street. With benefits, the compensation for many police officers comes to more than $60,000 a year, while for the average District Council 37 members, compensation including benefits comes to about $40,000.
The union, part of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, also made numerous proposals to reduce contracting out work to private companies. It said $20 million could be saved by having city workers deliver food and other commodities to schools rather than using many private delivery companies.
Claude Fort, president of the union representing city architects and engineers, insisted that contracting out often cost the city more than having municipal workers do the job, partly because of the profit margins demanded by private contractors. He also said it cost the city money to prepare contracts for bidding and to have city engineers and often a second group of consultants review the work done by the consultants that won the bid.

HEADLINE: Brazilians to Acquire a Stake in ArgentineBrewery 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, May 2 

 BODY:
Brazil's largest beverage company agreed to acquire a stake in Argentina's leading brewery and signaled that it wanted to take control of the company. The move represents a rare vote of confidence in the eventual recovery of Argentina's stalled economy.
 Under the deal, the Brazilian company, Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, known as Ambev, said it would transfer its existing businesses in four countries -- Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay -- to the Argentine company, Quilmes Industrial, known as Quinsa. Then, Ambev will pay $346 million to the Bemberg family, which controls Quinsa, for a 37.7 percent stake. 
 Ambev said it planned to take control of Quinsa gradually over the next seven years by allowing shareholders in the Argentine company to swap their stock for shares in Ambev. When the swap is completed, Ambev will have solidified its hold on its home market and taken a leading position in four other South American countries.
The deal is the first significant foreign investment in an Argentine company since the breakdown of the Argentine peso's peg to the United States dollar amid a worsening economic crisis at the beginning of the year. But beyond its symbolic importance, the deal is expected to have little impact in Argentina, several analysts said.
In fact, not much of the money Ambev is paying for its stake in Quinsa may even reach Argentina. The sellers, the Bemberg family, live mainly in Europe, said Francisco Chevez, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. Quinsa's corporate home is in Luxembourg, and its shares are listed there and on the New York Stock Exchange. Investment banking fees related to the deal will go to two large international firms: Goldman, Sachs, which advised Quinsa, and Lazard, which advised Ambev.
"Argentina doesn't benefit from this much at all," Mr. Chevez said.
More important, perhaps, than where the purchase money goes is where Ambev's attention is focused. With a few notable exceptions, Brazil's biggest companies have preferred to concentrate on the large internal market rather than seek opportunities in neighboring nations.
"This is a strategic move for a top Brazilian company that wants more influence not just in Argentina but in other South American countries," said Rafael Ber of Argentine Research, an economic analysis firm in Buenos Aires. "It's a natural facet of Brazil's evolution into a more important regional player."
The deal is expected to be welcomed by those betting on a recovery, even if a slow and modest one, in Argentina. One hope analysts hold out for the country is the development of an acquisition spree by profitable, well-financed Brazilian companies taking advantage of the sharp fall in the peso to pick up assets at bargain prices.
Before that can happen, however, Brazilian companies will need a clearer picture of the Argentine economy, which analysts predict will contract by 10 to 12 percent this year, and how individual industries and companies will be affected. For example, Quinsa has been able to honor its obligations throughout the crisis, while several other large Argentine companies have defaulted on their debts. Today, even as Ambev was announcing its plans to invest in Quinsa, another large Brazilian company, the food processor Sadia S.A., said it was pulling out of Argentina.
Luiz Murat, the chief financial officer, told reporters in Sao Paulo that Sadia was no longer being paid by its Argentine customers, and that it was laying off four-fifths of its workers there, retaining only a small sales staff. Analysts said Ambev had already been doing fairly well in Argentina, with a 17 percent share of the beer market there, accounting for about 3 percent of Ambev's total sales. The company has been slowly developing markets for its beer brands, including Brahma.

HEADLINE: Bush Drops Unpopular Plan To Raise Cost of Student Loans 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
In the face of strong Congressional opposition, the White House has abandoned a proposal that would raise the cost of federally backed loans for college students, administration officials said today.
 The proposal would have ended a program that allows undergraduate and graduate students to consolidate their loans at a federally subsidized fixed rate and take as long as 30 years to repay them. 
 The White House, which is trying to make up for a $1.3 billion shortfall in its Pell Grant program for low-income students, had said the money could be recouped by making the consolidated loans available at variable rates. 
Officials backed away from the proposal today without officially renouncing it. 
"Obviously, it's not going anywhere in Congress," one White House official said. "We will continue to work with Congress to make up for the shortfall created by Congress."
Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups had opposed the change. All 22 Democrats on the House education committee wrote to President Bush saying that keeping low interest rates for students was critical to making college affordable.
Representative George Miller of California, the senior Democrat on the committee, said raising the costs of higher education when many families were struggling to pay their bills was "completely wrongheaded."
"Clearly, these are not the actions of somebody who wants to be the education president," Mr. Miller said.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said that under a variable loan rate, students would have seen their education costs rise by thousands of dollars. Consumer groups estimated that losing the fixed-rate advantage would cost a borrower of $17,000 more than $6,000 over 20 years.
Administration officials said today that they would have to find a way to cover the shortfall in the Pell Grant program, which provides financial aid to 4.5 million low-income students. 
"Congress created a serious fiscal problem in 2002, when they underfunded the program by some $1.3 billion," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said this week. He added: "Education is a top priority for this president, and he will remain committed to it. But there is a shortfall in the funding formula as a result of Congressional action."
Democrats countered that President Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut was to blame for underfinanced programs.
The loan consolidation program, which began in 1986, allows a student to merge several variable-rate loans into one fixed-rate loan that is guaranteed by the government. Interest rates for education loans are at historic lows, about 4 percent, and are projected to rise over time.

PERSON: Roger V. Gould 

HEADLINE: Roger V. Gould, 39, an Influential Researcher of Social Upheavals 

BYLINE:  By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Roger V. Gould, an influential sociologist who sought explanations for social upheavals large and small in the subtle texture of interpersonal relationships, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 39 and made his home in New Haven.
 The cause was leukemia, his family said. 
 Colleagues said that despite his young age, Dr. Gould was an important figure in his field, especially in historical sociology.
Before taking a professorship at Yale, Dr. Gould taught for about 10 years at the University of Chicago. From 1997 to 2000, he was the editor of The American Journal of Sociology. Dr. Gould earned his graduate and undergraduate degrees at Harvard.
Where many sociologists traded mostly in the currency of theory, Dr. Gould believed it was important to conduct research on the ground. For his first book, "Insurgent Identities: Class, Community and Protest in Paris from 1848 to the Commune" (University of Chicago Press, 1995), he examined local archives before concluding that the traditional explanations for the turbulence of that period were wrong. It was not a class struggle, he argued, but a turf battle in which one's neighborhood and one's associates were more important than economic status.
His emphasis on hard research was not intended to reject theory but to strengthen it. He suggested that by closely studying enough different conflicts, whether in places like Corsica or in an American urban neighborhood, it might be possible to arrive at overarching theories to explain the violence.
Dr. Gould was born on Oct. 12, 1962, in Brookline, Mass., and raised in Manhattan. His father, Philip Benjamin, a reporter for The New York Times, died in 1966. His mother is the writer Lois Gould of Manhattan. His adoptive father, Dr. Robert E. Gould, died in 1998.
In addition to his mother, Mr. Gould is survived by his wife, Erin Graves Gould, and a brother, Anthony C. Gould of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
South Korea Finds Fortune By Shunning Japanese Ways

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
South Korea, long in Japan's shadow, is blazing a new trail for Asian economic development.
 By encouraging consumers to spend freely on credit, throwing its doors open to foreign investment, and introducing an American-style freedom to fail, South Korea has put itself back on track as one of Asia's fastest-growing and most diversified economies. 
 And while Japan's stagnation draws attention, South Korea's boom draws investors.
With Seoul's main stock market index nearly doubling since September, foreigners now account for 38 percent of share ownership and two-thirds of daily trades. Since 1998, South Korea has attracted $52 billion in new investment from overseas, more than double what it pulled in during the previous four decades. 
Several high-profile foreign takeover failures have given South Korea the image of a country that takes one step backward for every two steps forward. General Motors recently announced a $400 million deal to take over three auto plants from Daewoo Motor, and Lehman Brothers signed a tentative deal to invest $1 billion in Woori Finance Holding. At the same time, Micron Technology withdrew a $3 billion bid to take over much of Hynix Semiconductor after the Hynix board vetoed the deal.
But international rating agencies praise South Korea for bouncing back from a financial crisis five years ago, paying back a $20 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund in August and stacking up $108 billion in foreign currency reserves.
Next year, in fact, South Korea could enjoy higher credit ratings than its historic economic tutor, Japan.
"During the last four years, we have been dismantling the Japanese system," Han Duk Soo, economic adviser to President Kim Dae Jung, said in an interview. "Koreans are not like the Japanese. We are now more like the Americans."
For most of the first half of the 20th century, Korea was a Japanese colony. For most of the second half, it was in economic awe of Japan. Now, as Japan struggles to make Japan Inc. viable, South Korea is dismantling Korea Inc.
Only five years ago, South Korea's foreign exchange reserves were disappearing as though trapped in quicksand, and middle-class women were donating their gold jewelry in a national campaign to save the country from bankruptcy. The Japanese, meanwhile, are settling for a slow decline.
"Unlike Korea, the problem here has not really scared a lot of people," Gerald L. Curtis, an American political scientist with 37 years experience in Japan, said in Tokyo. "The Japanese public is nervous, but they are not really scared, not really mad."
Hank Morris, an investment adviser with a similar number of years in Seoul, said South Koreans did not have the luxury of delaying reform. "They had to bite the bullet," he said, "take the medicine."
With a $10,000 per capita income -- a third of Japan's -- South Koreans see themselves as still striving for the brass ring of development.
"Japan is handcuffed by their perpetual search for consensus, the Koreans could not care less for consensus," Donald P. Gregg, chairman of the Korea Society, said from New York. With years of experience in both countries, he concluded: "In Korea, if something isn't working, they move it, they break it, whatever. The Japanese go along in the hope that tweaking it will make it change."
In Japan, bankrupt companies and banks often receive generous bailouts, on the argument that they are "too big to fail." In South Korea, since 1997, about half of the 30 "chaebol," or family-owned conglomerates, have been allowed to fail, to be restructured or to change ownership.
"Korea has been more active than Japan in allowing companies to go bankrupt," said Jwa Sung Hee, president of the Korea Economic Research Institute, a business think tank here.
In a measure of Korea's economic dynamism, a study released in April of the top 30 exporting companies of 1980 found that only a quarter remained on the list in 2001. Some missing companies had gone bankrupt, but most, like textile makers, had been replaced by companies in more advanced industries, like electronics, cars and ships.
The payoff is clear: While Japan's economy, the world's second largest, is expected to contract this year, for the second consecutive year, economic growth in South Korea is expected to hit 6 percent, twice last year's rate.
While the board of Hynix, responsible for 3 percent of South Korea's exports, may refuse a buyout, the government appears determined. With state banks holding $2.3 billion in Hynix debt, South Korean officials have made it clear that even with 15,000 jobs at stake, they are stopping new government loans and will move to sell the company to the highest bidder, probably a foreign company.
At the end of May, the eyes of the world will swivel to South Korea and Japan, co-hosts of the World Cup soccer championship. Even without this, South Korea is increasingly recognized as a world economic player.
"Korea is approaching the home stretch: one more doubling of economic size and Korea will truly be a fully developed country," James P. Rooney, a vice chairman of Deloitte Consulting Korea, wrote recently in The Korea Times. "Somewhere over the next 10 to 15 years it will have a population of 53 million people and G.D.P. per capita of around $20,000."
In mid-April, shortly after Hyundai Motor announced its goal of becoming one of the world's top five automakers by 2010, it broke ground on a $1 billion plant in Alabama. Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest company, has reported record profits this quarter and now seems poised to surpass its Japanese rival, Sony, in market value.
Like Japan, South Korea has provided big infusions to troubled banks, spending about $120 billion. But in contrast to Japan, Korea has forced big changes. Korea's bad bank loans have been reduced to an internationally acceptable level of 3.4 percent, from around 10 percent three years ago, the level where Japan is stuck today.
The changes meant closing 16 banks and a quarter of bank branches, and firing 300,000 employees. In a sign of a moderating union militancy, the layoffs were met with walkouts, but no strikes. Some seized new career opportunities, starting some of the 9,000 businesses that opened in South Korea over the last five years.
About 4,000 former bank officials are under investigation for possible financial wrongdoing. As younger, American-trained bankers take over top jobs, government influence in lending decisions has been cut.
"If you compare Korea precrisis and Korea postcrisis, now bankers talk about shareholder value," said Jae Woo Lee, managing director of a Lehman Brothers Korea office that opened here in April. "Before it was, What does the chairman like? Cars? Ships? Now it is, What will the shareholders like?"
South Korea's banks turned $31 billion in losses in 2000 to $38 billion in profits last year. With the stock market soaring, officials hope to sell, over the next year, stakes in four banks and a life insurer that were taken over by the government during the financial crisis.
Abandoning self-sacrifice for the greater glory of the nation's trade surplus, Koreans snapped up millions of credit cards in recent years. Household indebtedness has jumped by 50 percent in four years.
South Koreans flocked to shopping districts last year, increasing retail sales by 11 percent. Last year, the average price of a Seoul condominium jumped by a third. In this year's first quarter, car sales jumped by a third.
As Korea increasingly looks west, to the economic transformation of China, attitudes about foreign investment are changing. President Kim has lifted foreign investment limits in banking, real estate and stocks. Most foreign exchange controls are to be lifted later this year.
Korea's politicians back a plan to make Seoul an international hub.
This summer, the government hopes to pass legislation that will create three foreign investment districts. In these districts, around Seoul and the new international airport at Inchon, companies that invest a minimum of $30 million to establish a regional headquarters are to be exempt from corporate taxes for 10 years. In a symbolic step for a country once known as the Hermit Kingdom, English is be granted official equal status alongside Korean for business inside the districts.
"We want to be more open to foreigners and to foreign investment," said Dr. Han, the presidential adviser. "We want more foreign schools, more English schools, a more lenient visa system, more international flights, and better conditions to bring business headquarters to Korea."
Still, certain developments could threaten the turnaround. A Mideast war could send oil prices skyrocketing. In a first step to reduce energy dependence, construction began in March on South Korea's first major natural gas project.
Another threat comes from North Korea, a hostile state that suffers from a deep inferiority complex as it increasingly relies on foreign aid.
But with unemployment in South Korea expected to fall to 2 percent in coming months, the North could become a manufacturing center for South Korea.
"The Koreans have studied the German reunification project pretty well," said Jeffrey D. Jones, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea. "The ideal scenario would be a federation, where each country controls its own military, but where there is an economic union, where you can send goods and people back and forth."
Separated by as little as 150 miles of ocean, car showrooms illustrate the difference between "Arthritic Japan," to borrow the title of a recent book, and South Korea. In April, domestic car sales in South Korea jumped 13 percent from a year earlier, to levels not seen since August 1997. In Japan, April car sales were down 2.7 percent, to the lowest level in 28 years.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE INCREASES TO 6%; HIGHEST IN 8 YEARS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate surged last month to 6 percent, its highest level in almost eight years, the government said yesterday in a sign that many companies are too worried about the economy to begin hiring again.
 The Labor Department's report raised the possibility that the current economic recovery could resemble the so-called jobless recovery of the early 1990's, when unemployment continued to rise for many months after a recession had ended. Economic analysis, Page C1. 
 In April, companies added a total of 41,000 jobs to their payrolls, but the hiring of temporary workers was responsible for the entire increase. With the help of technological advances, businesses have been able to increase their production in recent months without adding permanent employees. 
"We're wondering where the boom is," said Denise R. Sutton, president of A. J. O'Neal & Associates, an employment agency in Tampa, Fla., who said her clients were reluctant to hire people for more than a few weeks. "There's still a lot of skepticism out there."
Stocks and the dollar fell as investors seemed to concur that the recovery looks anemic at this point. The Dow Jones industrials fell almost 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index fell nearly 2 percent. The dollar had its biggest one-day fall against the euro since Sept. 11. 
Still, economists cautioned that the jump in the unemployment rate, from 5.7 percent, may have exaggerated the economy's problems. The government's extension of unemployment benefits in March has caused the number of people looking for a job to increase since they must be on the job market to qualify for the benefits. Only people looking for work count as unemployed. 
The job market also showed signs, albeit tentative ones, of turning around from the recession, which began in March and ended late last year, according to many economists. Last month, the private sector added jobs for the first time in more than a year, and manufacturers, which have been hardest hit by the downturn, cut just 19,000 jobs, their smallest reduction since late 2000.
"I don't think this report is as weak as it might seem on the surface," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson, an investment bank in Chicago. "The economy is still in a recovery, and the odds of a double-dip recession are near zero."
But the report also suggested that the labor market was unlikely to return soon to the rosy months of 2000, when the unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent and wages were rising for nearly every American worker.
"There just isn't enough momentum in the economy for a lot of hiring," said John E. Silvia, chief economist of Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "It's very expensive to bring on new people when you're uncertain about selling your product."
The weak job market increases the odds that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged when its policy-setting committee meets next week, analysts said. Fed officials, including Alan Greenspan, the chairman, have said recently that they expect the economy to grow only moderately this year, keeping inflation tame.
After almost every modern recession before 1990, the economy boomed. But in recent decades, downturns have become both less common and less severe, giving businesses and consumers less time to build the demand that can cause a sharp bounce back.
President Bush, well aware that the last weak recovery contributed significantly to his father's defeat in a bid for re-election, has avoided trumpeting the recent signs of recovery. Instead, Mr. Bush has said that too many people remain out of work and has called on Congress to stimulate the economy by passing bills he favors on energy, trade and insurance. 
In Washington yesterday, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said, "There are strong signs that the economy is poised to grow and unemployment will come down." But, he added, "the president worries about a jobless recovery." 
Democrats have struggled to turn this recession to their political advantage, in part because it has been mild. If unemployment does not fall in coming months, however, they are likely to increase their criticism of last year's tax cut, which has helped create a federal budget deficit.
Even as the economy was growing surprisingly quickly during the first three months of this year, the job market remained much weaker than economists had initially thought. As part of its normal revising of data, the Labor Department said yesterday that the economy had lost 25,000 jobs during February and March, rather than gaining about 60,000 jobs in each month, as the government first reported.
The cuts seem to have diminished workers' ability to negotiate for higher salaries. Among the three-quarters of the work force that is paid by the hour, the average wage has risen at an annual rate of about 3 percent in recent months, about the same as inflation. In 2000 and 2001, hourly wages were increasing about 4 percent a year.
In addition, companies reduced the workweek slightly last month, causing the average weekly paycheck for hourly employees to fall to $501 from $502.
While the private sector stopped cutting jobs in April, government agencies -- federal, state and local -- all but stopped adding them. Government payrolls grew by just 2,000 jobs, down from an average of 19,000 in the first three months of the year. With many states facing budget deficits -- and constitutions that require balanced budgets -- economists say the public sector might not grow in coming months. 
Across the economy, the biggest cuts last month came among construction companies, which have suffered from a slight drop in home building and a rapid decline of corporate investment in new buildings. The industry cut 79,000 jobs, the largest drop since 1991. 
Textile mills, apparel makers, automakers, supermarkets and hotels also eliminated jobs in April, according to the Labor Department's seasonally adjusted numbers. Restaurants, day care centers, banks, airlines and hospitals increased their employment.
The health care sector -- including hospitals, doctors' and nurses' offices and home care companies -- has added jobs every month since the summer of 1984, with the exception of January 1996, when snowstorms briefly stalled the economy.
The recent hiring wave by temporary-help agencies -- 66,000 in April -- may not make workers feel as secure as new permanent jobs would, but it could foreshadow broader economic improvement. In October 2000, before the downturn became apparent, temporary-help agencies began cutting jobs and did not stop until early this year. The recent growth in their payrolls suggests the job market is near another turning point, some economists say.
"We should begin to see much bigger gains in the summer," Mr. Wesbury said. "We are now in a transition. We just have to wait."

HEADLINE: Lenders Trying An Alternative To Foreclosure 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va. 

 BODY:
As the recession of the last year caused a sharp increase in the number of people falling behind on their mortgage payments, the nation's lenders decided to take a risk.
 Adopting an approach that economists say has led to one of the most important changes in the housing market in recent years, mortgage lenders significantly reduced the rate at which they repossessed homes. In place of foreclosure, many altered the schedule of loan payments in the hope that the drop in borrowers' income would turn out to be relatively brief. 
 Now, as the economy continues to show signs of recovery, the bet seems to be paying off. Mortgage delinquencies have begun to fall, suggesting that many homeowners are getting back on their feet. That should help lenders -- particularly, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the large government-created companies that have driven much of the change -- avoid the staggering losses that their newfound flexibility could have caused if the economy had deteriorated further. 
Despite a sharp rise in the number of homeowners who have fallen behind in payments, foreclosures nationwide have barely changed. As a result, the share of past-due loans that ended up in foreclosure has fallen from a peak of about 30 percent in 1998 to roughly 20 percent at the end of last year, one of the lowest levels on record and far below what has occurred in past recessions.
Perhaps most important, analysts say, the decline in the foreclosure rate has helped solidify the progress that many struggling urban neighborhoods have made in recent years. Here in Richmond, a four-block patch of the Swansboro neighborhood had only only one homeowner a decade ago, said James W. Middleton, the executive director of a nonprofit housing corporation active in the area.
It now has about 30, living on blocks where dozens of boarded-up homes once stood and that today are brightened by new yellow, beige or baby-blue houses with well-shorn, narrow front yards and even a few white picket fences.
As in many places around the country, the change in lenders' foreclosure policy, along with low mortgage rates, has helped keep the homeownership rate here climbing. Across the Richmond metropolitan area, it rose to 76.1 percent last year, from 62.1 percent just five years earlier. That represents one of the four largest increases in the country over that span, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa., that follows regional trends.
For many people, the policy shift has had intensely personal consequences and brought a happy end to a stressful time.
When Patricia M. Lane picked up the phone in the bedroom of her ranch-style home last month and heard from her mortgage company that it would approve her alternative repayment plan, she jumped in the air, she said, and yelled, "Thank you, Jesus!" Then she started to cry and, after hanging up, prayed for a full half-hour.
"I just said thanks for the opportunity to make good on my loan," said Ms. Lane, 47, who lives alone and, after losing her $15-an-hour job at United Parcel Service, had fallen four months behind on her payments.
The solution devised by her lender and a counselor at Housing Opportunities Made Equal, a community group here, is typical of the recent changes. Ms. Lane is about to resume her regular payment, and her lender, Countrywide Mortgage, will add the missed payments -- with interest, they come to about $3,000 -- to the end of her mortgage.
"Back in the old days, these programs didn't exist," said Steve Rotella, chief executive of Chase Manhattan Mortgage, one of the country's biggest lenders. "It was more of a pay-or-pack mentality."
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have caused most of the change, housing experts say. Believing that many delinquent mortgages can be saved, the three institutions have given banks, which service many of the loans, a variety of financial incentives to work out new terms and avoid foreclosure.
"It is good for everyone," said Eric Belsky, executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. "A foreclosure results in an even more tarnished credit history for the borrower and, for the lender, it results in much greater costs."
Last year, Freddie Mac foreclosed on only 9,600 loans out of its portfolio of 9.8 million. In 1997, when the economy was far stronger, the company foreclosed on 18,000 of its 6.7 million loans, it said.
In Virginia, even as the delinquency rate on all mortgages rose to 4.6 percent late last year, from 4.2 percent in 1997, the foreclosure rate dropped by half, to 0.5 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Across the country, the trend was similar.
Still, predatory loans -- those with high interest rates, confusing terms, or falsely based on inflated values -- continue to be a problem in many low-income neighborhoods, especially those with large minority populations. In some parts of Brooklyn and Queens, for example, foreclosures have risen sharply in recent months because of the city's slumping economy, its broad dependence on multifamily houses and widespread predatory lending. Some state legislatures are now considering bills to clamp down on lending abuses.
In Richmond and in many other cities, the new efforts to avoid foreclosure have helped prevent a vicious cycle, in which widespread foreclosures pull down the economy as laid-off workers lose their homes and banks sharply tighten lending standards. After a decade when banks became far more aggressive about lending to people with low incomes or little credit history, the new policy has come at an important time, economists say.
"If the recovery turns out like people expect, we'll have skirted a real serious housing problem," Mr. Belsky said.
To accomplish the changes, lenders have used software to analyze enormous sets of customer data and help them predict which delinquent borrowers are suffering only a temporary financial problem. They then conduct a kind of triage, deciding which homeowners are more likely to benefit from forebearance.
In the past, by contrast, "people had a short-term horizon," said Phillip E. Comeau, vice president for loss mitigation at Freddie Mac. "The industry stepped back and said, 'We're shooting ourselves in the foot.' "
This approach is not without risks. Ralph B. Karrigan, an executive vice president of SunTrust Mortgage, a division of one of the biggest banks in Richmond, estimates that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lose about $12,000 on a typical foreclosure here. They spend about $2,000 trying to coax late borrowers back to their payment schedules, Mr. Karrigan said.
If unemployment fails to improve by the end of this year, numerous delinquent loans might turn from a $2,000 cost into a $14,000 cost.
"Many of these tactics are stall tactics," Mr. Karrigan said. "If they can't make the payments, you're doing nothing more than deferring the inevitable foreclosure."
But Ms. Lane, like many others, already feels that the reprieve has largely solved her own housing problem.
When she took out a loan to buy the $61,000 tan-and-brown cinderblock house in the eastern part of Richmond, the first she ever owned, her job managing corporate accounts for U.P.S., the parcel delivery service, seemed safe. At the end of 2000, however, she was laid off after 13 years at the company, just as the unemployment rate in the United States was beginning to climb from a 30-year low.
For a year, temporary jobs and help from family and friends allowed Ms. Lane to meet her $560 monthly mortgage payment. But by the end of last year she could no longer keep the patchwork solution together, and she missed her first payment in November.
As other bills piled up this year, Ms. Lane said the pressure became so intense that she could not sleep. She lay awake worrying that she would lose her own home and again have to rent.
The call from Countrywide Mortgage calmed her down, and a recent promotion at a pipe-making company has increased her hourly wage to about $13. That is still a few thousand dollars less than U.P.S. paid her over the course of a year but enough to cover her bills, she said.
"Luckily, things are working out," she said.
Other homeowners have been helped by low interest rates that have allowed them to refinance their mortgage, lowering their monthly payments. And rising home prices in most parts of the country have enabled a small portion of people who had fallen behind on their payments to sell their homes at a profit, pay off their mortgage and find less expensive housing.
Compared with the Richmond region as a whole, relatively few people in long-struggling neighborhoods like Swansboro own their homes, but these are the places where change is most evident.
In Randolph, a neighborhood that was sliced in half by a highway a few decades ago, brick homes with nice-size yards are luring new residents. In Church Hill, home to the church where Patrick Henry declared "Give me liberty or give me death" in 1775, the number of boarded-up homes has decreased by about 60, to roughly 350, according to T. K. Somanath, who runs another nonprofit development company. Some blocks in Church Hill are now dotted with flags hanging above new doorways.
"You see houses filled in, you see new houses, and you see people coming into the community," said Mary White Thompson, who moved to the Fairmount part of Church Hill as a teenager in 1953.
Ten years ago, she said, about half of the 21 houses on her block sat empty. Today, the only empty houses are three new homes still being built and one dilapidated house on the corner. "We are replenishing the stock," she said.
In other neighborhoods, many of the new homes sit across the street from old ones that are still boarded up, and the drug dealers in some places have simply moved a few blocks. But most residents and housing experts here say the small number of foreclosures and the continued building of new homes, even during a year and a half of economic turmoil, have left them optimistic.
"There's been a lot of progress made," said Arthur N. Bowen III, director of public policy at the Virginia Housing Development Authority, which lends mostly to low- and moderate-income borrowers. "There's still certainly room to make a lot more progress."

HEADLINE: Enrolling Economic Diversity 

BYLINE:  By Robert M. Shireman; Robert M. Shireman, who served as an education advisor to former President Bill Clinton, is program director for higher education at the James Irvine Foundation.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Today poor and middle-class families must spend nearly twice as much of their income as their counterparts did a generation ago to send their children to four-year public colleges. Members of Congress and state legislators should take heed, for federal and state funding for financial aid has lagged behind college costs for years, contributing to a disturbing social stratification in our nation's colleges and universities -- both public and private.
 But while government must help by investing more in aid, we shouldn't let the colleges themselves off the hook. President Bush and Congress should also take steps to hold colleges -- particularly the elite institutions -- publicly accountable for actually enrolling students from poor and working-class families. 
 At four-year public colleges and universities, tuition was equal to 25 percent of the average annual income of a low-income family in 2000, according to the National Center for Public Policy in Higher Education. In 1980, the figure was 13 percent. And while financial aid has increased, it has failed to keep pace with the rise in tuition.
At the nation's most selective private colleges, meanwhile, the situation is not much better. Some of the best financial aid packages are offered at 31 selective colleges that generously promise to meet the full financial need of any admitted student, a policy known as need-blind admissions. But how many low-income students actually enroll at these colleges? Not many. On average, only 11 percent of their students are from the lower end of the economic spectrum.
At the same time, many prestigious institutions that don't pledge to cover full financial need actually do much better in enrolling the poor. At Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, the University of Southern California and the University of California campuses, a fourth or more of the students receive federal Pell grants, which are limited to students whose family income is roughly in the lower third nationally.
If top-ranked colleges, public and private, really want to encourage upward mobility rather than recycle prestige, they might learn from those schools that have been able to do a better job. Public institutions might learn some lessons as well.
They could begin by advertising their true price. When working-class kids see that a university's annual tuition rivals a family's total annual income, it is no wonder they don't consider an Ivy League education -- even with talk of big financial-aid awards. But the price isn't really that high for most students. At the need-blind colleges, it is actually a sliding scale, from no tuition (and better, with help for room and board) to $25,000 or more, depending on need. Why not say that up front?
Admissions offices should also pursue ethnic and economic diversity more aggressively. Predominantly white institutions need to make minority students feel they belong. Colleges that are successful at recruitment, in athletics or any other field, pay special attention to high schools with strong programs. They pursue students who are interested, befriending their parents and teachers. They should use these same strategies to recruit low-income students of all races.
Elite colleges are generally quite effective in ensuring that every student succeeds. But if they are going to enroll more students from low-income families, they need to remember that these students are often the first in their families to attend college and may need guidance and support.
This is the time of year when high school seniors are figuring out whether they can afford the colleges they want to attend. To help low-income students find out how well the colleges of their choice can meet their needs, the Department of Education should monitor economic diversity on college campuses. It should publish, on its Web site, the proportion of students at each college who receive federal Pell grants.
For their part, college lobbyists should press Congress and the Bush administration for a major increase in Pell grants. Public and private colleges should also accept responsibility for enrolling and supporting more lower-income students.

HEADLINE: Some Chinese See the Future, and It's Capitalist 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
In the 50 years since Mao Tse-Tung decreed that art and science must serve socialism, China has not had much of an ivory tower. Mao's brief romance of the nation's top minds while the Communist Party consolidated power gave way to repeated purges and persecutions that continued through his death in 1976. 
 His successor, Deng Xiaoping, liberalized the economy and decriminalized free thought, at least as expressed in private salons. But the ranks of American universities are filled with exiled Chinese scholars who clamored too loudly for democracy. Others have simply been marginalized by the nation's narrow focus on getting rich. Aside from a clutch of influential scholars devoted to finding pragmatic solutions to China's vast economic and social problems, intellectuals often have to choose between quiet irrelevance and public condemnation. 
 Despite the difficulties, some Chinese intellectuals are today engaging in a full-throated debate about the country's future. In academic conferences at home and abroad and in journals of scholarly opinion that are cloaked in the protective veil of academic jargon (and, often, English), political scientists, sociologists and economists are sparring openly about the state of the country's quasicapitalist, mostly antidemocratic government. 
The question that captivates leading minds there is the same one that engaged court intellectuals at the end of the Qing dynasty, when China first began opening itself to the West at the end of the 19th century: how to make the country modern. 
Many of China's leading scholars are not dissidents, and they see their task as constructive, not polemical. Just as China's economy has begun to resemble those of industrialized countries, intellectuals have focused on issues familiar to scholars in Europe and the United States. Their concern is not whether China should become capitalist, but what kind of capitalism it should have.
One camp, arguably the dominant one, is what the Chinese call neoliberal. Its proponents argue that China should complete its economic and social evolution that began under Mr. Deng by selling off state companies, shrinking the government, strictly enforcing property rights and letting the market work its magic. The neoliberals in some ways tend to echo Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, though some also share the antidemocratic tendencies of Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator who governed with an iron fist but also pushed the development of a vibrant market economy in the 1970's and 80's. They have enthusiastically embraced China's integration with the world economy.
On the other side are a loose-knit group of intellectuals who have begun to refer to themselves by a misleadingly similar name, the New Left. Many in this school want the government to reduce inequality, provide a social safety net and intervene more in the market to tame the economic cycle. They tend to reject the prevailing view among China's elite that popular democracy is a luxury the country can afford only after it becomes rich. Instead, they argue, China needs the dynamic energy of democracy to force change and combat corruption.
Xudong Zhang, an associate professor of comparative literature at New York University, has compiled a volume of essays, "Whither China?," that explores the conflict. Mr. Zhang and several of the scholars who contributed essays, including Cui Zhiyuan, Wang Hui, Wang Shaoguang and Gan Yang, consider themselves proponents of the New Left. They mostly attack neoliberals, though Mr. Gan and Wang Shaoguang were once considered pioneers in the rival camp.
If their battle seems a little removed from the China portrayed in the news media, that's because it is. Many Chinese can read and write only on a rudimentary level. Just 1 percent ever attend college. Moreover, while many Chinese intellectuals teach at universities in Beijing and Shanghai, others are as likely to take jobs in Hong Kong, Singapore or any number of American universities.
Discussion of China's current problems often hinges on classical, Western views of development, with scholars debating whether French radicals or British gradualists are better models for reform. Rousseau inspired thinkers during Mao's time; Burke's rejection of the French Revolution and his support for the aristocracy appeals to many today. There are postmodernists, feminists and libertarians in the mix.
Still, these scholars are not without influence. Some so-called neoliberals have become advisers to Chinese leaders, including Premier Zhu Rongji, who has supported a faster pace of reform and who steered the country into the World Trade Organization. The change of leadership that is expected to take place at the 16th Party Congress in the fall has also provided an opening for a more general review of future options, even the scope of political change.
Neoliberal thinking came into vogue in the 1990's. Not unlike Russia and much of Eastern Europe, China has an early vision of capitalism, informed partly by past Communist propaganda, as a system that works only in its crudest form. The state went from owning assets on behalf of the people to insisting that bureaucrats and well-connected entrepreneurs had a right to profit from those assets. That approach was reinforced by two events, the 1989 military suppression of dissent around Tiananmen Square and Mr. Deng's 1992 "southern tour," when he urged people to get rich. The state showed that it would enforce political unity but protect economic opportunism.
One central task was reconciling the need to protect the new wealth of the few from the demand for equality from the masses. To justify the Communist Party's intervention on behalf of elites, some neoliberals reached for historical precedent. They disavowed China's Francophilic past and embraced England's "Glorious Revolution," which led to parliamentary rule by the aristocracy, championed by Edmund Burke. Likewise, Isaiah Berlin's 1958 essay on freedom, "Two Concepts of Liberty," became a touchstone. Mr. Berlin's focus on "freedom from" instead of "freedom to" was treated as a guiding philosophy for a minimalist state that let the market work.
Partly inspired by these ideas, China's economy expanded at nearly a double-digit clip for much of the decade, and it attracted more foreign investment than any other developing country. But neoliberals have begun to encounter sustained opposition from fellow reformers. Like the neoliberals, many of those in the New Left are Western-educated, and they reject socialism. But this nascent opposition also questions the dogma of capitalism. There is no sure formula for development, they say, but surely it is not the bureaucratic capitalism that dominates the country today.
Mr. Cui, now a research fellow at Singapore's National University, argues that China doesn't understand the nuances of American and European economic policies. He cites, for example, China's attempts to inject life into moribund state-owned companies, still the backbone of the industrial economy, as an example of what has gone wrong. 
Similarly, Wang Shaoguang, a Yale-educated political scientist now at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, argues that China's leaders have allowed the central government to atrophy by placing blind faith in the market to provide public goods. In the 1990's, he says, the government's tax revenue as a share of the country's overall economic output fell below 10 percent, as the government failed to collect taxes. In only three other nations, Peru, Bangladesh and the former Yugoslavia, does the central government control such a small share of output. 
This forced even some seemingly essential institutions to generate revenue in other ways -- a phenomenon known as "chuang-shou." The military's efforts to make money created a fuzzy subeconomy of military-backed ventures that traded on connections and access to public goods, like the telecommunications spectrum and even missiles. The government has recently begun to restrain that practice, but the defense budget remains too low to stop it, Mr. Wang argues. Mr. Wang also bemoans the lack of a comprehensive safety net for the unemployed and uninsured. 
The New Left also seems to have rediscovered democracy, which many intellectuals abandoned as impractical (and politically dangerous) after the 1989 crackdown.
The prevailing view is that while democracy is fine in theory, in practice it risks shattering the stability that has allowed the country to prosper. But Mr. Gan, a research fellow at the Center for Asian Studies in Hong Kong, argues the opposite -- that China needs democracy to preserve social order.
After Mao's Cultural Revolution, which many in China view as a disastrous experiment in mass democracy akin to the Jacobin terror that roiled France, most Chinese became too alienated from politics, Mr. Gan argues. Too few people pay attention to public policy. It is that vacuum that allows local officials to steal state funds with impunity, or mass movements like Falun Gong, the exercise and meditation society, to enchant millions of people.
If the grandfather of China's neoliberals is Burke, it is Alexis de Tocqueville who guides many in the New Left. Tocqueville is quoted often, because as a French nobleman he rejected the excesses of the French revolution but also saw the British as futilely resisting the "universal spread of democracy throughout the world." And of course Tocqueville made clear that democracy, not capitalism alone, was the key to America's success, shaping not just its politics but its society, law, culture and economy.
China became politically quiescent in the 1990's, at least in part, because neoliberals endorsed the government's authoritarian agenda. More diverse views, even those expressed in China's wobbly ivory tower, could rattle the country's carefully managed political edifice.
"It still matters a great deal," Mr. Gan writes, "if a nation's intellectual mainstream considers democracy theoretically worth defending."

HEADLINE: A Skittish Recovery 

 BODY:
So, where's the rational exuberance? The economy posted an impressive 5.8 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, its best performance in two years. The recession is over, and the economy will likely grow at a healthy if less spectacular clip the rest of the year. 
 Even so, Wall Street remains in a funk, as wary investors find reasons to worry. They fret about the contrary trends in business and consumer spending that have made a clear reading on the economy so elusive, the trade deficit, debt of all kinds, lackluster profits and possible oil shocks. 
 Yesterday's jobless numbers are further cause for concern. The Federal Reserve Board and most economists predicted that unemployment would continue to rise during a tepid recovery, but news that the rate has inched up to 6 percent -- the highest level in eight years -- could shake investor confidence and consumer optimism. It could also pose problems for President Bush, who well remembers his father being attacked by Bill Clinton in 1992 for presiding over a "jobless recovery." 
Few people expect the economy to sustain the vigorous pace it set in the first quarter. The bulk of that frothy growth can be attributed to a replenishing of business inventories, a one-time affair unless across-the-board economic activity picks up. Alas, capital spending by businesses was down for the fourth straight quarter. Consumers, who account for two-thirds of economic activity, heroically continued to spend freely throughout the slowdown, but there are questions as to how long this can continue. Zero-interest financing can talk you into buying only so many cars. 
It is often said, however, that rebounds are built on a foundation of worry. And there are reasons to believe that despite all the negatives, the economy, remarkably resilient in the aftermath of the Nasdaq meltdown and the shock of Sept. 11, is back on track, though it may proceed at a cautious pace. Improving global prospects should provide a boost. Warnings about a sudden falloff in consumer spending overlook the significant increase in real wages in recent years and the power of low inflation to boost confidence. America's current-account deficit continues to grow, but there appear to be no credible threats to the nation's status as a magnet for foreign capital. 
The least-heralded bullish indicator, one that explains much of what is right about this economy, is the continued robust growth of the nation's productivity rate, the basic measure of its output per worker. This is what has Alan Greenspan convinced that he need not rush to reverse the 11 interest-rate cuts of last year, that the economy has more room to grow, and people to earn more, without inflation. 
The surprisingly steady growth in productivity is the one constant linking the exuberant late 1990's to the more anxious present. It suggests that despite the bursting of the Nasdaq financial bubble, there was something real to all that hype about the "new economy," and that perhaps all that investment in new information technologies is still paying off. 
None of this is to suggest that policy makers in Washington can assume that happy days are here again. Congress could hurt the economy if it fails to curb the administration's deficit-inducing tax cuts, fails to pass free-trade legislation and fails to strengthen the integrity of financial markets in the aftermath of the Enron scandal with meaningful corporate governance reforms.

HEADLINE: As a Recovery, NoSecretariat 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The early days of the current economic recovery are beginning to resemble the early days of the last one. That may mean that economic growth will be slower than many people have expected and that unemployment will keep rising for some time even while the economy is growing.
 "We are in the midst of a recovery, but uncertainty about its strength has increased," Nanette Abuhoff, a bond market strategist at J. P. Morgan Chase, said yesterday after the government reported that the April unemployment rate had climbed to 6 percent. 
 Worries about the strength of the recovery could yet provide the stimulus to help the economy grow faster, as the government reacts to fears that this will be a "jobless recovery," as Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, described it yesterday. 
The similarities between the recent recession and the last one are certainly substantial. Both were relatively mild in job losses and both featured an international shock that ended with a United States military success: the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the action in Afghanistan this year.
The two recessions were also unlike previous ones in that they were less likely to claim the blue-collar jobs of auto and construction workers, who were traditionally among the hardest hit in downturns. In 1990-91, the brunt seemed to fall on middle managers as companies tried to slim down. This time the hardest-hit industries were the stars of the previous boom, technology and telecommunications.
In normal recoveries, the industries that suffered the most are the ones that come back the strongest. But after 1991, many companies were determined to avoid returning to what they saw as bloated cost structures. And this time there is limited evidence of a resurgence of technology and almost none of an end to reductions in telecommunications spending. But demand will eventually come back for those businesses, so there is reason to hope that the period of slow growth will not be as long as it was after 1991.
Many people would welcome a repeat of the recovery from the 1990-91 recession. That recovery more than made up in duration what it lacked in initial vigor, going on to become the longest recovery in United States history. But it also cost the first President Bush his job, a loss that is no doubt remembered by the current President Bush. 
Some think that that memory will make the government more likely to do what is necessary to get the economy moving. "We have a ton of stimulus now," said James Glassman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, who noted that the first President Bush had been reluctant to push for stimulus measures like the extended unemployment benefits now in place. Mr. Glassman said he thought Congress and the current president would provide more stimulus, if needed. And Wall Street, Mr. Glassman notes, now thinks the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise interest rates soon.
If this recovery followed the normal path, set by the first eight recoveries after World War II, then the rise in unemployment would be about over. On average, the unemployment rate peaked within two months after the recession ended in those eight periods. The rate never rose more than 0.4 percentage point after the recession ended, and it never took more than four months to top out.
Then came the 1990-91 recession. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of such things, that downturn ended in March 1991 with the unemployment rate at 6.8 percent. But the rate took 15 more months to hit its eventual high of 7.8 percent.
The mildness of the last recession is one reason that the recovery this time may be slow.
"Housing did not go down very much this time, so there is not much scope for it to go up," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. In the past, construction employment often helped to lead the economy out of recession.
Although the date has not been officially set, many economists think this recession ended last December. If so, the unemployment rate is up 0.2 percentage point four months after the end of the economic downturn. That is in line with the pre-1991 averages.
The stock market has found it difficult to deal with the competing economic currents. It rallied sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, as confidence grew that the recession was ending, but it has stumbled this year amid concern that the recovery might not be vigorous.
Stock prices declined after the unemployment report yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 85.24 points, to 10,006.63. But the Dow was still up a bit for the week as investors migrated toward solid companies outside the weaker industries. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite was down 3.1 percent for the week and is now at its lowest level since October.
Over all, first-quarter corporate earnings reports were generally weak but not worse than expectations. But Wall Street seems to have been surprised and disappointed that corporate executives were unwilling to forecast quick gains in profits later in the year.
"The market looks out six months or so," said Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call, which tallies analysts' estimates, "and what the market is seeing is a lot of uncertainty."
Mr. Hill said that for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the first quarter was the fifth in a row in which profits came in lower than corresponding quarters the year before. Analysts say they think there will be a 1 percent gain in the second quarter, but that is a smaller gain than they had been forecasting. And they still think there will be large gains, of 21 percent and 32 percent, in the final two quarters of the year.
If corporate America comes to share those forecasts, then hiring could pick up, as could capital spending that would further spur growth. But for now, most companies appear to be hesitant to commit themselves to increased spending, whether for machines or workers.

HEADLINE: Pride in President May Have an Expiration Date 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WALLA WALLA, Wash., May 1 

 BODY:
It has been months since they took down the American flags that had been fastened to virtually every sign post on Main Street here. At least that long ago, Stone Creek Furniture stopped blasting "God Bless America" endlessly from speakers outside the shop.
 But residents of this town near fertile farms and vineyards in southeastern Washington have not forgotten Sept. 11. Nor have they forgotten how President Bush responded. 
 In three dozen interviews here over the last three days, almost everyone agreed: Even Democrats who might never have had a kind word for Mr. Bush recall with pride his handling of the terrorist attacks. One after another, voters cited the president's speech to Congress nearly two weeks after the attacks as a turning point in how they viewed him and how they still see him today. 
"I thought we were in for a terrible four years," said Scott Moore, 45, a recreational planner who backed Al Gore and took a break from shooting hoops to ponder the Bush presidency. "But I guess he has a little bit more charisma than I give him credit for. Especially his speech after Sept. 11. It was somewhat inspirational."
Yet among Democrats, independents and many Republicans -- who are dominant in this city of about 30,000 that voted heavily for Mr. Bush -- there are stirrings of discontent about other aspects of Mr. Bush's presidency, signs that he might not be able to continue to rely on the post-Sept. 11 good will. 
Many voters said they were alarmed by the bloodshed in the Middle East and distressed that the United States had not settled on a proper role. Others in this town of nature trails (Lewis and Clark made their way through the Walla Walla valley) and unspoiled forest accused Mr. Bush of sacrificing the environment for friends in the oil business. Still others worried that Mr. Bush had frittered away the budget surplus.
"I don't think the jury's in on Bush yet," said Lee White, 61, a retired civilian Air Force employee who voted for Mr. Bush. "I think 9/11 was tough all right, but I'm really worried about his Middle East policies. Colin Powell's recent trip there was a complete flop."
Such mixed sentiments may help explain why nationally, in the New York Times/CBS News poll completed this week, Mr. Bush still registered a lofty 73 percent job approval rating, even though it was down from an even loftier 82 percent in January.
Charles DeWitt, 70, a retired state transportation official who voted for Mr. Gore, said of Mr. Bush's handling of the terrorist attacks: "I applaud him for that. But I'm simply dismayed at the Bush foreign policy in the Middle East. I watch the news every night and there doesn't seem to be any real sense of direction."
For all the anguish over the Middle East here in the Fifth Congressional District, where Representative George Nethercutt, a Republican, toppled Speaker Tom Foley in 1994, not everyone pointed a finger at Mr. Bush. Many said the situation was so intractable that no American president could have a remedy.
"The only way this is going to be settled is if the Lord comes back and settles it," said William Schisler, 52, a retired school custodian who voted for Mr. Bush. "These people have been fighting since the start of the world." Turning to Mr. DeWitt, he added, "How can you provide leadership to a bunch of terrorists?"
Mr. Bush may never win over some Democrats, even those who liked his leadership after Sept. 11 and do not fault him on the Middle East.
"I don't have any complaints," Cindy McClure, 44, a college psychology instructor, said of Mr. Bush's handling of the terrorist attacks. But, she went on: "It's a lovely facade. I'm not convinced there's a lot of depth or sincerity. He says all the right things to appeal to the masses."
By contrast, Dale Schroeder, 60, a property manager, said he found Mr. Bush's personality one of his most appealing qualities. "He's a down-home, folksy kind of guy that people from Walla Walla can relate to," Mr. Schroeder said. "He's not impressed with the Hollywood scene or the big-city bureaucrats. I'm so thankful we have him as president."
Still, even Mr. Schroeder is not entirely pleased with Mr. Bush, for whom he voted. "I was disappointed at the connection with Enron," he said. "That those people were his main supporters surprised me."
Ned Shafer, 59, director of the Walla Walla YMCA, said he tended to vote Democratic but was "proud of Bush and proud of his response" after Sept. 11. But Mr. Shafer said he worried about Mr. Bush's nimbleness on complicated issues. 
"Sometimes he is too simplistic," he said. "He distills things down too simply." He also expressed qualms about Mr. Bush's leadership on the economy, saying: "I thought the tax rebate was a very flawed thing. Republicans gave away the surplus. I thought it was just ridiculous."
Gordon Venneri, 48, the co-owner of a winery who considers himself a fiscally conservative Democrat, said he, too, was wary of Mr. Bush's spending priorities, including efforts to improve security at airports.
"We're paying a huge amount of money for people to take your corkscrews at airports," Mr. Venneri said. "Does that just make us feel better?"
Many Democrats and Republicans here said they were nervous that Mr. Bush was not sufficiently concerned about the environment.
"He's done a good job on the war against terrorism," said Keola Whittaker, 23, a debate coach at Whitman College who calls himself a liberal Republican, "but his biggest downfall domestically is that he ignores the environment."
Many voters here said they were especially impressed that Mr. Bush had surrounded himself with capable people like Vice President Dick Cheney. But the name that came up again and again was the secretary of state, Colin L. Powell. Even while some questioned whether Secretary Powell had an adequate say in Middle East policy, many people sounded more enamored of him than of the man who appointed him.
"Colin Powell is cool, he's intelligent, he's the one I've always wanted to run but he's too smart to do it," said Mike Ellis, 63, a building superintendent who supported Mr. Bush.
The one person Mr. Ellis has no fondness for is John Ashcroft, the attorney general. Judging from the interviews, Mr. Ashcroft seemed to touch a decidedly negative nerve with many residents, particularly over the issue of civil liberties.
"He's the only one in there that I dislike," Mr. Ellis said. "He scares me when he talks."
One Democrat who did not fare well in the interviews was Al Gore. Almost all voters who said they backed him in 2000 said they were not ready to commit to him again, and most said they wanted a new face.
"Gore's time has passed," Mr. Moore said. "I don't think the election should have been close."
For now, at least, Mr. Bush can take heart that even many Democrats offered their grudging admiration. "Who am I to say if he's the right person to be in that position?" said Dov Friedman, 36, a drummer who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. "But I will say he's not as big a buffoon as I thought he would be."

A Sign of Concern Emerges As Jobless Rate Increases
The unemployment rate surged in March to 6 percent, its highest level in almost eight years, a sign that many companies are too worried about the economy to begin hiring again. The report raised the possibility that the current recovery could resemble the one in the early 1990's, when unemployment continued to rise for months after a recession had ended.
 The report also suggested that the labor market was unlikely to return soon to the rosy months of 2000, when the jobless rate fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent. Page A1. 

The Dow Jones industrials fell 85.24 points, to 10,006.63. The Nasdaq fell 31.79 points, to 1,613.03, and the Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 11.13 points, to 1,073.43. C4.

Lenders' Change Cuts Foreclosures
As the recession caused a sharp increase in the number of homeowners falling behind on their mortgage, lenders took a chance and significantly reduced the rate at which they repossessed homes. In place of foreclosure, many altered the schedule of loan payments, a move that appears to be paying off. A1.

HEADLINE: Senate Seeks Inquiry Into FEMA 9/11 Role 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
A Senate committee has asked the General Accounting Office to undertake a broad examination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to the Sept. 11 attacks, including a review of the way the agency has determined eligibility for its programs, the amount of money the government expects to spend on the recovery effort and the steps it is taking to safeguard public funds. 
 The committee's action came as another important element of the federal government's response to the attacks, the Federal Victim Compensation Fund, announced an interpretation of its rules that could substantially increase the money paid to the families of New York City police and fire department victims. 
 The request to the G.A.O., the research arm of Congress, was made Thursday evening by Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Democrat and chairman of the environment and public works committee, and three committee members, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat of New York; Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, the ranking Republican member and former chairman of the committee; and George V. Voinovich, an Ohio Republican.
In a letter to David M. Walker, the comptroller general, the senators said the study of FEMA's post-Sept. 11 role "can help the committee accurately assess the federal government's response and recovery efforts." 
FEMA has come under increasing congressional pressure in recent weeks, reflecting what one congressional aide called "a laundry list" of complaints about the agency's responsiveness to various economic and financial needs arising from the attacks. 
One focus of concern has been the agency's program for mortgage and rental assistance, which has so far rejected 7 out of 10 applications for aid. Earlier this week, in the face of congressional concern, FEMA announced that it would re-examine more than 7,000 rejected applications for its housing assistance program, to ensure that no one had been denied help unfairly. 
Members of Congress have also received complaints about the agency's disaster unemployment benefits program, which some critics say has unfairly denied help to many self-employed artists in Lower Manhattan, and about the level of aid to various public agencies, educational institutions and public utilities affected by the attacks. 
Yesterday, nine New York members of the House of Representatives -- led by John Sweeney, a Republican, and Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat -- introduced legislation directing federal authorities to help the New York City Board of Education cover the cost of make-up school days and other expenses related to the attacks. 
"FEMA's failure to address the needs of the school system and its students after Sept. 11 is totally wrong," Ms. Maloney said. "I know the president would want New York's school kids to get this help and I know he will tell FEMA to do the right thing."
At the Victim Compensation Fund, created last September as part of the bailout package for the airline industry, the new regulatory guidelines address concerns that widows or widowers of police officers and firefighters would get nothing from the fund because of the generous departmental pensions and other death benefits they already receive.
The fund is required by law to reduce awards by the amount of "collateral income," such as life insurance and pensions, received by victims' families. 
But Kenneth R. Feinberg, the fund's special master, said yesterday the fund has determined that it should not deduct from its awards the $250,000 in federal line-of-duty death benefits paid to the uniformed services' families because the law that awards those payments specifically provides it should not be deducted from any other benefits.
And while the fund will deduct today's value of the departmental pensions that families receive, as the law requires, it will also, in calculating lost income, give those families generous credit for future increases in pension income, from both the city and post-retirement jobs, that the uniformed victims would have received. The resulting equation, Mr. Feinberg said, would be overwhelmingly favorable to police and firefighter families. 
Families of civilian victims with private pension plans are not helped by this interpretation, but Mr. Feinberg said that he was not ruling out a similar approach for them once he has had an opportunity to examine the plans. "They vary so widely from individual to individual," he said, "that until we examine them, we cannot made a similar determination." 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a request by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works for a review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to the Sept. 11 attacks misstated the party affiliation of the committee chairman, James M. Jeffords of Vermont. He is an independent, not a Democrat.

HEADLINE: Blueprint for Ground Zero Begins to Take Shape 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
No 100-story office towers are likely to grace the former site of the World Trade Center. Nor is it probable that the entire 16-acre parcel will be set aside for a memorial to victims of the attack on Sept. 11.
 Commuter trains and subways will once again roll beneath ground many people consider hallowed, while pedestrians and, perhaps, buses and cars could flow through one or two streets that traverse the trade center's former plaza area. 
 Although public deliberations have only recently begun over the future of the site known as ground zero, crucial components of what will occur there -- the relative size of the memorial and the uses of much of the rest of the land, among them -- appear to have already been settled upon by city and state officials.
Most officials are careful to say publicly that the slate for Lower Manhattan is still blank, ready for the best and most creative ideas about how to fill the gaping hole in the financial district's heart. And they stress that any final decisions about rebuilding will be made jointly by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the offices of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
"I know that nothing will be done here unless it is in cooperation with everyone else who is a stakeholder," John C. Whitehead, chairman of the development corporation, said in an interview. But many of the officials involved in the rebuilding deliberations have indicated in speeches, public meetings and interviews that certain decisions, while subject to change, are, as one official put it, "made but not made."
On Jan. 3, for example, Mr. Whitehead stood next to Mr. Bloomberg at a City Hall news conference and said, "I think there is a developing consensus -- among everybody I've talked to -- that it is not either practical or appropriate to build another 100-story building."
Since then, few if any of the plans and principles put forth by civic groups or city and state agencies have mentioned either the idea of replicating the twin towers or of excluding commercial office buildings from the site. In addition, planners have gone ahead with plans for the revamping of Lower Manhattan's transportation system, complete with extensive underground concourses that will house retail stores.
The tacit acknowledgment by rebuilding officials that those priorities are all but settled is evident from dozens of interviews conducted over the last five months as well as from watching the proceedings of the development corporation and related city and state agencies. 
The public has, of course, been included in numerous discussions about the future of ground zero, which was described as "an inclusive and open public process" to decide the fate of the site and the surrounding areas in the development corporation's principles for action, released last month.
Officials have listened to comments at town hall sessions and advisory committee meetings, and solicited public input in advertisements and via the Internet. And that will continue. Last month, the development corporation agreed to support a public hearing with up to 5,000 participants in Manhattan in July.
While many of the conclusions reached so far have resulted from those discussions, some participants in the process, chief among them some family members of victims of the Sept. 11 attack, say they have felt bypassed in some decisions.
"There certainly are things I've seen indicating that decisions have been made without us," said Marian Fontana, president of the 9-11 Widows and Victims' Families' Association and a member of the development corporation's families advisory council. Communications between the planners and the families are improving, she said. But many family members were dismayed recently to learn that work on the PATH and subway lines had already begun in the crater left by the trade center.
That confluence of consultation and decisions already made stems in large part from the unusual nature of the site. It is owned by governments of New York and New Jersey, through their proxy, the Port Authority. Guiding many of the decisions about what will occur there is a very simple matter: money. 
The site generated substantial revenues for the states, more than $100 million per year from the lease of office and retail space. At a time when municipal and state budgets are being squeezed, public officials are loath to give up those revenues.
"This is one of the great planning and development challenges that New York has faced," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "The planners have to work within a complex series of constraints. There is a need for revenues to support the Port Authority, for activities to reinforce the surrounding community and for a memorial that reflects the loss of life that occurred there."
Last month, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation issued what it called a blueprint for the future of Lower Manhattan. Included in the plans were suggestions for a memorial, a mass transit hub, a cultural center and the restoration of at least some of the streets through the trade center site; those streets were obliterated when the big site for the center was assembled.
"These plans represent the best possible consensus we can find at the moment," Alexander Garvin, the corporation's vice president for planning, design and development, said in presenting the plan to the corporation's board. "Now we need to put some meat on these bones."
Below ground, the consensus reached over the transportation system is so strong that work has already begun on the building of a temporary PATH station and the reconstruction of the No. 1 and No. 9 subway lines. Rebuilding officials also have presented a detailed outline of transportation plans to Congress, with cost estimates.
While details about specific projects will have to be worked out as it becomes clear how much money is available, officials have begun to talk about a new transit hub and underground concourse connecting commuter rail and subway lines as a given.
Above ground, the decisions about a memorial, the street grid and whatever commercial development occurs on the site are so intertwined as to be essentially one decision, whose many parts will have to be made almost simultaneously.
And in interviews in recent weeks, several state officials have acknowledged that a single scenario would achieve all three goals. Under such a proposal, Greenwich Street could be extended to become a north-south corridor through the site, and Fulton Street could be similarly extended to become an east-west passage reaching nearly from river to river.
"You can be quite sure such a plan is being considered," said one senior government official involved in the rebuilding effort, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "It seems so logical and so good that people are considering it carefully."
The reinstallment of those two streets through the super-block created for the trade center -- either as pedestrian corridors or for buses or cars -- would carve out four quadrants, with the largest, in the southwest corner, conveniently containing the footprints of the twin towers.
By using that corner -- an area measuring approximately seven acres -- as the site for a memorial, planners would accomplish two goals.
First, they would set aside a significant part of the area as sacred ground and provide a way to incorporate some tangible reminder of the towers themselves into the memorial design. Second, they would physically separate the remaining nine acres from the memorial, allowing the other three quadrants to be used for commercial space. Three other streets that used to run through the site -- Dey, Cortlandt and Washington -- all cross the footprints of one or both of the towers. 
While some family members of victims have continued to push the idea that the entire 16-acre site should be devoted to a memorial -- an idea articulated early in the process by then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- most people involved in the rebuilding say that is not practical. 
Several government officials, including Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Whitehead, have said that commercial office space will almost certainly be rebuilt on at least some of the site, replacing much if not all of the 10 million square feet lost in the attack. Even though there may be a glut of office space now, there undoubtedly will be a need for offices in the future, the officials have said.
Already the Port Authority and the city and state have taken steps to allow a portion of the street grid to be restored. Last month, the Empire State Development Corporation, the parent agency of Lower Manhattan Development, condemned a strip of land on Vesey Street, north of the main trade center site, and turned it over to the Port Authority. 
That will allow Larry Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease to the site, to rebuild what was 7 World Trade Center with a slightly smaller amount of office space while also allowing Greenwich Street, which previously was cut off by the building, to go through.
At the meeting where that action was taken, Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and chairman of Empire State Development, said, "I've seen some plans that include street grids, so I guess that tells you something about the interest" in that feature. He added, "I believe the street grid has some advantages."
Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, has also publicly referred to the need to restore part of the street grid several times in recent months. "There's general agreement on the need to reconnect the World Trade Center site to the rest of Lower Manhattan, and connect Battery Park City more effectively with the rest of Lower Manhattan," Mr. Doctoroff said in a recent speech to a real estate group in Manhattan. In an interview, he said he did not believe a specific decision had been made about Greenwich and Fulton Streets.
Also driving the decision is the fact that the creation of commercial office buildings is the one of the few ways that the Port Authority can satisfy the conditions of its lease with Westfield America, operator of the World Trade Center shopping mall when the buildings were attacked, which holds the rights to develop retail space both below and above ground on the site. Only by restoring the street grid, officials have said, will planners be able to separate the memorial from that retail space -- the sacred from the profane.
Undoubtedly there will be an abundance of further public discussions about building plans in the coming months, and some of the outlines of what will take shape above ground at the site could change. One of the greatest fears haunting some public officials, in fact, is the idea that Mr. Giuliani might re-emerge as a supporter of turning the entire site over to a memorial. 
Barring such a development, many of the decisions that remain to be made about the future of the trade center site are, in effect, details -- important ones, certainly, but ones that are not likely to alter some settled principles.

HEADLINE: How Do West Virginians Spell Pork? It's B-Y-R-D 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., April 30 

 BODY:
A traveler curious about the unusual number of federal public works in this state that were not just procured by but prominently named after Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia should pause for reflection at the State Capitol rotunda.
 Here, halfway between the mammoth Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam project on the state's western border (where a bas-relief of the senator greets citizens) and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (considered the world's largest moving research instrument as it reaches toward the heavens from an eastern Appalachian pasture) stands a double-life-size statue of these projects' relentless patron, Senator Robert C. Byrd. 
 Gesturing grandly in the Statehouse, the senator, hailed by the Citizens Against Government Waste watchdog group as setting the "Alpha Porker" standard for "taxpayer funded narcissism," holds the Constitution in his left hand. He grasps it as firmly as if it were the next batch of projects funneling through his chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington's grand cornucopia of federal largesse. 
"State policy is to wait 50 years after a politician's death before a statue can be built for him in the Capitol," a Statehouse guide explained. "But for Senator Byrd, West Virginia figured it should make an exception."
No wonder. For, as the eight-term Democrat might say in his favorite role as the Senate's classicist orator, rarely since Caesar has a public official been so memorialized within his lifetime across his realm.
Between the sprawling locks and dam and the $75 million radio telescope, the state is dotted by at least 30 other federal projects with the Byrd preamble in their addresses. There are two Robert C. Byrd United States Courthouses, four Robert C. Byrd stretches of highway, freeway, expressway and drive, and a Robert C. Byrd Bridge. And two Robert C. Byrd Interchanges to reach these valuable amenities.
There is the Robert C. Byrd Lifelong Learning Center, the Robert C. Byrd Hardwood Technology Center, the Robert C. Byrd Health and Wellness Center, and the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing. This economically stressed state has advanced handsomely into the modern era of government infrastructure and employment as its favorite son has amassed 50 years of clout in Washington.
"I want to be West Virginia's billion-dollar industry," Senator Byrd happily admitted in 1990. 
In more than meeting that goal, he has been far from defensive. Giving as avidly as he gets, the senator has flicked away critics, calling them "a bunch of peckerwoods." He seems to relish being known here at home as the Prince of Pork. 
"West Virginia has always had four friends: God Almighty, Sears Roebuck, Carter's Liver Pills and Robert C. Byrd," the senator declared on re-election night 2000. He was exulting as voters offered what may be the ultimate Byrd memorial, a state record 78 percent majority in which he carried all 55 counties. 
"It has never been my expectation that any facility be named for me, although I am humbled that some have," the senator declared, disclaiming vainglory as the quid pro quo for bringing home the bacon. "It is a deep honor when West Virginians make the kind gesture to name a project for me in appreciation for my efforts in their behalf."
Not everyone believes the state's many Byrd name signs are happenstance. "What next -- West 'Byrdginia'?" Taxpayers for Common Sense, another watchdog lobby, asked last year in complaining. 
"I've been watching these egocentric public works for years and fully expect to see the Robert C. Byrd Traffic Light in some coal hollow," said a Democratic longtime state official. He was complaining but, like officials in both parties, loath to be identified publicly as a critic of Senator Byrd. "Can't slay our golden goose," the Democrat grumbled.
If anything, West Virginians display a shared pride at the senator's annual helpings from the federal pork barrel. The other day a newspaper headline about Senator Byrd's being honored by the Humane Society as a defender of animal rights fondly summarized: "The Prince of Pork Now Tries to Save the Hog."
Coursing through West Virginia's amiable cities and soothing backwoods, a visitor finds that the Byrd sightings roll on from high school to clinic to aerospace education center, with the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Composite Technology and more on the drawing boards.
Not all are grand. The Charleston Gazette recently attempted to make a master list, counting more than 30 projects named for Robert C. Byrd -- and thus far none for the state's other Democratic senator, John D. Rockefeller IV. The paper reported that the Robert C. Byrd Library at Wheeling Jesuit University was merely a conference room consisting of a table, two sofas and six chairs. It is in the Erma Ora Byrd Center for Education Technologies, named for the senator's wife.
If all the job-rich projects brought to the state by the senator were named after him, the list would be far longer. These include prime national centers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and other bureaucratic wheelhouses that he shepherded to the state. 
"If you're talking pork in the Senate, Senator Byrd is far and above the winner, absolutely," said Tom Schatz, president of the Government Waste watchdog group in Washington. This lobbying effort devotes a special "Byrd Droppings" section on its Web site to the senator, estimating that as Appropriations chairman he annually brings home 10 times the national average of legislative pork, or $236 per state resident last year.
Local critics are reduced to satire. One Web site essayist, scorning "The Ever Present Presence of the Master," imagined visiting one of the state's busier federal workplaces, the sign painting shop that keeps Senator Byrd's name pristine on all the projects named after him. The sign painter is found thinking ever more grandly, finally planning the ultimate West Virginia sign: "Robert C. Byrd System of Life As We Know It."
In its way, the State Legislature beat the sign painter to the punch last year when it voted to add one more distinction to the rotunda statue of Senator Robert C. Byrd, an additional sign announcing: "West Virginian of the 20th Century."

 HUNGERING
FOR AMERICA
Italian, Irish, and
Jewish Foodways
in the Age of Migration.
By Hasia R. Diner.
Illustrated. 292 pp.
Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $39.95.
 NOBODY is sure why some countries, like Italy and China, have well-developed and universally admired cuisines, while others can't cook their way out of a paper bag. Hasia R. Diner, a professor of American Jewish history at New York University, has a theory about why Irish food is so bad. Once the potato had been forcibly introduced to Ireland by English overlords -- who skimmed off the tastier meat and vegetables for themselves -- the peasants became contemptuous of their single, unpredictable source of nourishment. In America, Irish immigrants developed clubs and benevolent associations that pointedly ignored their own food. A tradition of culinary mediocrity was born.
This is one of several major insights in "Hungering for America." Another is the interesting suggestion that the very idea of Italian cuisine originated in the United States -- that prior to emigration, a farm laborer in Sicily, say, would have acknowledged no dietary commonality with a factory worker in Milan. Diner writes that many 19th-century Italian peasants virtually never ate pasta or sausages, subsisting mainly on bread, rubbed with a tomato or a sardine if they were lucky. "The spaghetti, cheeses, oils and tomato products which they opted for were the familiar but high-end food back home, and that was what these new Americans preferred." This newly created cuisine served as a cultural unifier; Italian-Americans ate differently from other Americans, and were proud of it.
Diner's research -- into historical accounts, novels and plays, economic studies, personal narratives and vintage demographic surveys -- has produced a book jampacked with fascinating bits of Italian, Irish and Jewish food lore. We learn, for example, from an 1836 household census in Donegal, Ireland, that the county's 4,000 souls owned only 10 forks among them, and that Irish peasants often grew their thumbnails long to peel boiled potatoes. 
More happily, we're told that food was so central to Eastern European Jewish rituals that it was incorporated into the yeshiva classroom routine: "Little boys, starting their first day of school, were given a slate of Hebrew letters written in honey to lick," which "brought to life the connection between good tastes and holy moments." But the pivotal role of food could be a problem for American Jews, as different ideas about what is kosher spawned intense conflicts, including a riot in Brownsville, Brooklyn, in 1894. 
The book suffers somewhat from its rigid structure, with a pair of chapters devoted to each cuisine and its practitioners, the first recalling deprivations in Europe, the second detailing their response to the dining wonderland that was found on these shores. Some of the book's most thrilling moments, however, occur when Diner breaks step, as when she describes the reciprocal food envy of the Italians and Jews in East Harlem or, in a lengthy digression, compares the eating styles of Ojibwa Indians, Mexicans, Jews and blacks. In proper academic fashion, the book also includes introductory and concluding chapters that rehash what will be obvious to the reader of the other six chapters. You can skip them, unless you expect to be tested.
This is not necessarily a book for foodies. Only in the Jewish chapters does the chow really come alive, and it made me wonder if the book would have been improved by a little field research in our country's wealth of ethnic restaurants, where many of the phenomena Diner describes are still clearly visible today. Nevertheless, this ostensible lack of interest in actually eating food is counterbalanced by Diner's bighearted attitude toward immigrants and their struggles that, along with the rich anecdotal material, may inspire a pang of regret when you're finished.

HEADLINE: I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor 

BYLINE:  By Sally Satel; Sally Satel, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of "PC, M.D.: How Political Correctness Is Corrupting Medicine."

 BODY:
In practicing medicine, I am not colorblind. I always take note of my patient's race. So do many of my colleagues. We do it because certain diseases and treatment responses cluster by ethnicity. Recognizing these patterns can help us diagnose disease more efficiently and prescribe medications more effectively. When it comes to practicing medicine, stereotyping often works.
 But to a growing number of critics, this statement is viewed as a shocking admission of prejudice. After all, shouldn't all patients be treated equally, regardless of the color of their skin? The controversy came to a boil last May in The New England Journal of Medicine. The journal published a study revealing that enalapril, a standard treatment for chronic heart failure, was less helpful to blacks than to whites. Researchers found that significantly more black patients treated with enalapril ended up hospitalized. A companion study examined carvedilol, a beta blocker; the results indicated that the drug was equally beneficial to both races. 
 These clinically important studies were accompanied, however, by an essay titled "Racial Profiling in Medical Research." Robert S. Schwartz, a deputy editor at the journal, wrote that prescribing medication by taking race into account was a form of "race-based medicine" that was both morally and scientifically wrong. "Race is not only imprecise but also of no proven value in treating an individual patient," Schwartz wrote. "Tax-supported trolling . . . to find racial distinctions in human biology must end." 
Responding to Schwartz's essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education, other doctors voiced their support. "It's not valid science," charged Richard S. Cooper, a hypertension expert at Loyola Medical School. "I challenge any member of our species to show where this kind of analysis has come up with something useful."
But the enalapril researchers were doing something useful. Their study informed thousands of doctors that, when it came to their black patients, one drug was more likely to be effective than another. The study may have saved some lives. What's more useful than that?
Almost every day at the Washington drug clinic where I work as a psychiatrist, race plays a useful diagnostic role. When I prescribe Prozac to a patient who is African-American, I start at a lower dose, 5 or 10 milligrams instead of the usual 10-to-20 milligram dose. I do this in part because clinical experience and pharmacological research show that blacks metabolize antidepressants more slowly than Caucasians and Asians. As a result, levels of the medication can build up and make side effects more likely. To be sure, not every African-American is a slow metabolizer of antidepressants; only 40 percent are. But the risk of provoking side effects like nausea, insomnia or fuzzy-headedness in a depressed person -- someone already terribly demoralized who may have been reluctant to take medication in the first place -- is to worsen the patient's distress and increase the chances that he will flush the pills down the toilet. So I start all black patients with a lower dose, then take it from there.
In my drug-treatment clinic, where almost all of the patients use heroin by injection, a substantial number of them have hepatitis C, an infectious blood-borne virus that now accounts for 40 percent of all chronic liver disease. The standard treatment for active hepatitis C is an antiviral-drug combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin. But for some as yet undiscovered reason, African-Americans do not respond as well as whites to this regimen. In white patients, the double therapy reduces the amount of virus in the blood by over 90 percent after six months of treatment. In blacks, the reduction is only 50 percent. As a result, my black patients with hepatitis C must be given a considerably less reassuring prognosis than my white patients. 
Without a doubt, there are many medical situations in which race is irrelevant. In an operation to repair a broken leg, for example, a patient's race doesn't matter. But there are countless situations in which the race factor should be considered. My colleague Ronald W. Dworkin, an anesthesiologist in a Baltimore-area hospital, takes race into account when performing one of his most important activities: intubation, the placement of a breathing tube down a patient's windpipe. During intubation, he says, black patients tend to salivate heavily, which can cause airway complications. As a precautionary measure, Dworkin gives many of his black patients a drying agent. "Not every black person fits this observation," he concedes, "but there is sufficient empirical evidence to make every anesthesiologist keep this danger in the back of his or her mind." The day I spoke with him, Dworkin attended a hysterectomy in a middle-aged Asian woman. "Asians tend to have a greater sensitivity to narcotics," he says, "so we always start with lower doses. They run the risk of apnea" -- the cessation of breathing -- if we do not."
Could doctors make a diagnosis for and treat a patient properly if they did not know his race? "Most of the time," says Jerome P. Kassirer, a professor of medicine at Yale and Tufts. "But knowing that detail early on helps me make educated guesses more efficiently." 
Kassirer, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, is a renowned diagnostician. He is legendary among trainees for what he can tell about a case from just a few facts. He gave an example from a recent morning report, the daily session in which young doctors describe to senior physicians the most vexing cases admitted to the hospital the previous night. During one report, the resident began: "The patient is a 45-year-old Asian male who came to the emergency room complaining of 'feeling weak and wobbly in my legs' after drinking two bottles of beer." Kassirer stopped her right there. "Here's what I infer from that information," he said. "First, we know that sudden weakness can be caused by a low concentration of potassium in the blood, and we know that Asian males have an unusual propensity for a rare condition in which low potassium causes temporary paralysis. We know that these paralytic attacks are sometimes brought on by alcohol." 
Of course, the patient could have been suffering from some other muscular or neurological disease, and Kassirer instructed the trainees to consider those as well. But in this case the patient's potassium was low, and the diagnosis was correct -- and confirmed within 24 hours by simply observing the patient. Thanks to racial profiling, the Asian patient was spared an uncomfortable and costly work-up -- not to mention the worry that he might have something like Lou Gehrig's disease. 
"Rather than casting our net broadly, doctors quickly focus on a problem by recognizing patterns that have clinical significance," Kassirer says. "Typically, the clinician generates an initial hypothesis merely from a patient's age, sex, appearance, presenting complaints -- and race." 
All of these examples fly in the face of what we are increasingly told about race and biology: namely, that the two have nothing to do with each other. When the preliminary sequence of the human genome was announced in June 2000, many felt the verdict was conclusive. Race, it was said, was an arbitrary, nefarious biological fiction. Scholars heralded the finding of the Human Genome Project that 99.9 percent of the human genetic complement is the same in everyone, regardless of race, as proof that race is biologically meaningless. Some prominent scientists said the same. J. Craig Venter, the geneticist whose company played a key role in mapping the human genome, proclaimed, "There is no basis in the genetic code for race."
What does it really mean, though, to say that 99.9 percent of our content is the same? In practical terms it means that the DNA of any two people will differ in one out of every 1,000 nucleotides, the building blocks of individual genes. With more than three billion nucleotides in the human genome, about three million nucleotides will differ among individuals. This is hardly a small change; after all, mutation of a single one can cause the gene within which it is embedded to produce an altered protein or enzyme. It may seem counterintuitive, but the 0.1 percent of human genetic variation is a medically meaningful fact. 
Not surprisingly, many human genetic variations tend to cluster by racial groups -- that is, by people whose ancestors came from a particular geographic region. Skin color itself is not what is at issue -- it's the evolutionary history indicated by skin color. In Africa, for example, the genetic variant for sickle cell anemia cropped up at some point in the gene pool and was passed on to descendants; as a result, the disease is more common among blacks than whites. Similarly, Caucasians are far more likely to carry the gene mutations that cause multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis. 
Admittedly, race is a rough marker. A black American may have dark skin -- but her genes may well be a complex mix of ancestors from West Africa, Europe and Asia. No serious scientist, in fact, believes that genetically pure populations exist. Yet an imprecise clue is better than no clue at all. 
Jay N. Cohn, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, explains that skin color and other physical features can be a diagnostic surrogate for the genetic differences that influence disease and response to treatment. "Physical appearance, including skin color, is now the only way to distinguish populations for study," he says. "You'd have to use a blindfold to keep a physician from paying attention to obvious differences that may and should influence diagnosis and treatment!" Lonnie Fuller, a professor emeritus at Morehouse School of Medicine, says: "Drugs can stay in the body longer when their metabolism in the liver is slower. We know this can vary by race, and doctors should keep it in mind."
Recognizing that our one-size-fits-all approach to medicine has serious flaws, some doctors are urging research into the development of racially targeted drugs. In March 2001, the Food and Drug Administration allowed the testing of a drug called BiDil in about 600 black subjects who will participate in the African-American Heart Failure Trial, the largest clinical trial ever to focus exclusively on African-Americans. 
In previous studies including both white and black patients, BiDil provided a selective benefit for the black subjects. White subjects did no better on average than those given a placebo. The leading explanation for this disparity revolves around the molecule nitric oxide, a chemical messenger that helps regulate the constriction of blood vessels, an important mechanical dynamic in the control of blood pressure. High blood pressure contributes to and worsens heart failure because it makes the heart pump harder to overcome peripheral resistance in the arteries. BiDil acts by dilating blood vessels and replenishing local stores of nitric oxide. For unexplained reasons, blacks are more likely than whites to have nitric oxide insufficiency. 
To be sure, a small percentage of blacks with high blood pressure do not have low nitric oxide activity. And the fact that BiDil's intended use relies on a crude predictor of drug response -- a poor man's clue" is how one scientist described race -- is something its developers at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine readily acknowledge. Nevertheless, in the sometimes cloudy world of medicine, a poor man's clue is all you've got. Perhaps that's why members of the Congressional Black Caucus voiced support for the clinical trial. So did the Association of Black Cardiologists, which is helping recruit patients for the trial. B. Waine Kong, the organization's head officer, put it simply: "It is in the name of science that we participate."
Doctors look forward to the day when they can, in good conscience, be colorblind. Researchers predict that it will eventually be common practice for doctors to generate a "genomic profile" of every patient -- a precise analysis of a person's genetic makeup -- so that decisions about therapies can be based on subtle characteristics of the patient's enzyme and receptor biology. At that point, racial profiling by doctors won't be necessary. Until then, however, group identity at least offers a starting point.
A high level of sensitivity about race is understandable in view of eugenics programs in early 20th-century America and ethnic cleansing abroad. The memory of the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which hundreds of rural blacks were never told they had the disease nor offered penicillin for it, still haunts the U.S. Public Health Service, the agency that conducted the study. Other scholars have expressed the worry that genetic differences among races could become the only explanation for the health disparities among them -- allowing interest in examining social and economic factors to dwindle. 
Indeed, the public seems to have embraced the idea of colorblind medicine. "In the last decade, many Americans have urged that the concept of race be abandoned, purged from our public discourse, rooted out of medicine and exiled from science," writes Troy Duster, a sociologist at N.Y.U.
But in this case, the public is wrong. As rough a biological classification as race may be, doctors must not be blind to its clinical implications. So much of medicine is a guessing game -- and race sometimes provides an invaluable clue. As citizens, we can celebrate our genetic similarity as evidence of our spiritual kinship. As doctors and patients, though, we must realize that it is not in patients' best interests to deny the reality of differences.

HEADLINE: The Seductress of Vanity 

BYLINE:  By Susan Dominus; Susan Dominus, a contributing editor at Glamour and New York, last wrote for The New York Times Magazine about Eve Ensler.

 BODY:
On any given workday, the waiting room of Pat Wexler, New York's best-known cosmetic dermatologist, is filled with well-preserved women flipping through magazines and eyeing one another discreetly. Wexler is known for her high-caliber clientele -- among them Barbra Streisand, Stephanie Seymour and Candace Bushnell - and on one memorable day, three different bodyguards arrived with three different charges. ("I thought, My mother would be really proud," Wexler recalls.) But the patients aren't checking one another out in hopes of celebrity sightings. They're looking for ideas: is she trying something I should know about? 
 Wexler, a petite woman with an impeccable manicure and neatly lined lips, is meanwhile speeding in and out of rooms like a character in a stage play, slamming the door on one story, opening the door onto another, and another, before circling back to the first to finish up, keeping track of the personal drama each contains. Today she leaves the room where she has just lasered one young woman's acne-damaged skin and heads into another where a tall, willowy beauty in her 40's -- a socialite whose divorce made news a few years back -- waits a bit anxiously for collagen shots to fill out the faint lines around her chin. 
 "People feel it differently," Wexler warns, as she starts the injections. Her patient's face grows red, and her brown suede loafer starts wagging up and down. Making her way across the woman's face, injecting, smoothing, injecting, Wexler begins the highly skilled procedure she calls "talkesthesia." She kibitzes about her husband, then moves on to the Olympics, while interjecting some coaching: "Try to relax -- do you do Yoga?" The effect is jarring: her patient is clearly in some distress, and yet with every shot, she looks less haggard, more relaxed -- younger. After a few minutes, Wexler wipes away a pinprick of blood, and the patient sits up a little straighter, breathing a sigh of relief. 
"What about my lips?" she asks. 
"Do you think you need it?" Wexler asks intently. The question sounds loaded.
"Do you think I need it?" she asks in reply. Wexler says she thinks the lips look fine and switches the agenda: "Let's talk about Botox for a minute." A look of panic registers on the woman's face: more shots, with another wrinkle-removing technique. Again, she asks if she needs it, but this time, it's clear that she's hoping the answer is no. 
"It's been seven months," Wexler says, gently. "Technically, and by looking at you, you do need it." 
To say that anyone actually "needs" Botox is obviously an overstatement, which is part of what Wexler likes about her job: nobody's life hangs in the balance. She has treated terminal illness, but at some point she realized she didn't have the temperament for it, and switched to dermatology. 
Wexler zips out of the room to check in on the laser patient, leaving me alone with the Botox candidate. I tell her, truthfully, that she looks great. "Apparently, I've got wrinkles here," she says nervously, pointing to the spot between her brows. Does she think she has wrinkles? "No," she says, "but I trust her judgment." I wonder aloud if, by that logic, I might need Botox, too. "Well, try to wrinkle your forehead," she says. "See, you've got wrinkles!" she says, pointing excitedly, and then she laughs, as if suddenly remembering the obvious. "Which is normal."
When Wexler returns, the two agree on a "baby dose" of Botox, which Wexler administers, warning her patient not to bend over for a couple of hours. (The procedure involves some risk, including the very rare case of temporary vocal-cord or eyeball paralysis.) As she zips off, she reminds her patient they'll see each other in a few days, at a black-tie benefit at the Rainbow Room.
Wexler's medical practice and her social life frequently overlap, with Wexler serving as a kind of court physician to the royal circles of fashion and celebrity. For models, actresses and trophy wives, she's not just a health-care provider but also an investment counselor in the twin currencies of beauty and youth. As an early adopter of new cosmetic treatments, she has managed to change not just the way many influential beauties look but also the way influential people think about beauty.
Botulinum toxin is "the most poisonous substance known," according to The Journal of the American Medical Association. A single gram, evenly dispersed, could kill more than one million people, causing "symmetric, descending, flaccid paralysis" and eventually cutting off its victims' power to breathe, swallow, communicate or see, while leaving their cognition all too intact. 
One day about 12 years ago, Pat Wexler propped up a hand mirror, filled a syringe with a highly diluted form of the stuff and injected it in her forehead. As she expected, her forehead smoothed out like a sheet pulled taut. The shot paralyzed the muscles that draw the brow into a furrow, leaving the opposing muscles free to lift the skin and brows up toward the hairline. 
Botox had already been approved for treatment of eye spasms. But Wexler, following the lead of dermatological innovators on the West Coast, started administering it off label, a common medical practice. She noted that Botox made such commonplace facial expressions as scowling and squinting a challenge (though Wexler says the urge to squint can be so strong, patients recruit muscles from elsewhere on the skull to persist in the habit). 
She also noted that Botox made her very popular. Wexler became the New York doctor best known for the procedure, which she dispenses starting at about $500 per treatment area, with boosters recommended every three to five months. If her first patients had any trepidations about filling their face with an off-label toxin, she didn't hear too much about it. "I have to be honest with you," she says. "Most of my patients are pretty trusting. Sometimes it concerns a doctor. You want them to be a little more aware." Last month, the F.D.A. approved Botox for cosmetic applications.
Botox is Wexler's killer app, but she also offers low-tech "acid peels" -- cotton balls soaked in glycolic acid that burn the surface of the skin, which cracks and peels off a few days later -- as well as laser treatments that vaporize the top layer of skin. (Until it regenerates, she says, "you look like Chernobyl.") In the newer Cool Touch process, she uses cryogen to chill the top layers of skin while lasers heat the layers below to stimulate new collagen growth. As do many dermatologists, Wexler also plumps wrinkles and sags, injecting various forms of what's known as filler: fat from her patients' own thighs, tissue from roosters' combs, collagen compiled from cattle skin. 
To most women outside New York and Los Angeles, Wexler's aggressive approach to skin care may amount to extreme vanity, the morally suspect purview of the idle rich. But just as outlandish runway fashions trickle down to mall stores -- in modified, economized ways -- the techniques propagated by Wexler and her upscale colleagues reach the masses pretty quickly. Already, mainstream magazines take their readers' interest in these procedures for granted: "Doctors Reveal How to Avoid Plastic Surgery," reads one recent cover line from Elle, as if without this secret loophole, its entire readership would find itself heading for the knife. Botox is, in fact, already being mainstreamed: it's now administered not just by doctors but by nurses (and even, it is rumored, dentists), not just in offices but in spas, strip-mall storefronts and at "Botox parties," where friends get together for cocktails and injections. Critics may bluster about the corrupting influence of such pursuits, but to Wexler, configuring the body according to one's wishes just makes sense. "It's fun," as she often says, sometimes while administering a shot. Over time, the rest of us may come to see rearrangeable beauty as just as logical, as inevitable, as harmless, as she does. 
At one point in "Gulliver's Travels," Gulliver finds himself in a land inhabited by giants. Up close, he says, "Their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously colored when I saw them near, with a Mole here and there as broad as a Trencher." For Wexler, her celebrity clientele are like those giants; where the rest of us see unattainable perfection, Wexler sees a squint wrinkle here, loose flesh there, sometimes even before the celebrity has seen it. At the movies, she tends to fixate on tiny flaws. "If I see bad cosmetic work, it's very distracting," she says. "I can't watch the movie." 
Shortly after Wexler met Donna Karan, she let the designer know -- nicely -- that she would benefit from some liposuction under her chin. "I hadn't even noticed it," says Karan, who not only took Wexler's advice but asked her to consult on the skin-care and cosmetics line she was starting.
Wexler's aesthetic perfectionism is not limited to clients' faces. While redecorating her Murray Hill office space, she had one wall painted nine different times, with nine different shades of off-white, before she felt satisfied she'd picked the shade most flattering to her patients' skin. The waiting room's Japanese-inspired minimalist chairs are bolted to one another because, Wexler says, she "couldn't stand it" when patients moved them here or there a few inches. If a patient who is a model mentions that she doesn't have an outfit for some big event, Wexler has been known to call Bergdorf's and have them set aside a few pieces she remembers from her last visit.
In addition, she offers Botox or collagen shots as a perk for her staff, as well as friends "or nice people who don't have money." Noticing a facial scar on a woman who helped cater a party at Wexler's apartment, she offered Cool Touch; she often dispenses acne medicine to her housekeepers. "Their skin clears up, they get married and they quit," she says mournfully. 
Sometimes Wexler can't help herself. One evening, as we were exchanging girlish pleasantries, Wexler told me she'd lost weight with a low-fat diet (and, she said later, breast-reduction surgery). 
"I need to start running again," I said, batting my hips. 
"You don't need to lose weight," Wexler told me flat out. "You need liposuction."
There. I had received a diagnosis. I might have found her candor refreshing, except I was having trouble breathing. I whined about her comment to everyone I knew. A few weeks later, I ask Wexler if I can sit in on a liposuction. "Yours, perhaps?" she quips. 
Having started performing liposuction in 1988, Wexler now does it so often that she has what she calls a liposuction arm. "Feel it," she encourages me, pulling up her sleeve and revealing a serious bicep. "It's hard work!" Hard but worth it: procedures start at $2,500 and can go up to $11,000.
The day I'm there to observe, her patient, a woman in her early 40's with a medium build, came to have her waist and hips whittled down -- follow-ups to the stomach liposuction she had a few years earlier. Wexler uses a light sedative and local anesthesia, as opposed to the general anesthesia most plastic surgeons use. "I like my patients to stand up for the contouring," she says. "It's like a seamstress draping fabric -- you can't do it on someone lying down." It occurs to me that fashions once conformed to women's bodies, with ample skirts for female curves; now, doctors design women's bodies to conform to fashion's straight lines, its unyielding sizing. When I told her I had trouble finding pants that fit, she responded, "Why should you have to shop for one body part?" She meant, Why should you have to do all your shopping to accommodate one difficult body part? Literally shopping for body parts -- newer, slimmer models of whatever nature gave you -- is precisely what she encourages people to do. 
For the first part of the liposuction, the patient lies on the surgical table. Wexler marks off topographical highlights of the patient's body, injects anesthetic, makes some incisions and inserts a slim plastic tube. She vigorously pokes it through the layer of fat beneath the skin, sometimes angling it in such a way that it is visible from the outside, poking up against the skin, appearing halfway across her waist and lower torso. That this does not induce a level of pain requiring more than local anesthesia suggests some serious flaw in the design of the human body. To keep her patients from fainting at the sight of it, Wexler blindfolds them and keeps her office cool. 
As she works, the instrument's clear canister is slowly filling up with a peachy pink liquid, the color of mechanically extruded femininity. In an hour or so, Wexler would wrap it up; a few days later, her client would be at work, a size or so smaller. At the close of the procedure, Wexler gives her patients hot chocolate, but she warns them not to put on any weight. The fat won't grow back where it's been surgically removed, but that just means it'll end up bulging out someplace else -- maybe someplace worse.
Even as I'm wincing my way through the procedure, I have to admit that there's something liberating about her advocacy of liposuction. It's so forgiving. There's nothing outside surgery you can do to achieve size 6 hips, she says with all the authority her degree bestows on her, and that's both the bad news and the good news: it's out of your hands; leave it to the professionals. "People think that exercise will give them the body they want," she says. "Exercise won't give you the body you want. It will give you a firm body you still don't want." Despite all the evidence about the benefits of exercise and the popularity of gym culture, Wexler boldly argues that it might be healthier to spend an hour getting liposuction than to spend many, many hours obsessively working out to change some intractable body part. "I talked to a psychiatrist about it; she agreed with me," says Wexler. "And all that yo-yo dieting isn't good for you; it changes your metabolism." 
It's suggested that there's a third possibility: self-acceptance. "You see, I never got that," she says flatly. "No one ever told me about that." It's the first time she seems anything less than lighthearted about the frivolous fun of a little smoothing and erasing. "When I was little I had this really curly, really curly red hair, and when I was 5, my mother was taking me to Kenneth, where Jackie O. went, to all these beauty salons all over the city," she says. "I think she thought I was going to come out with straight blond hair. I still think I'm going to come out with straight blond hair." 
Now 50, Wexler gives herself Botox shots every four or five months, facial peels "when the whim strikes" and collagen injections on "special occasions" like a birthday party or a presentation at a medical conference. She had her nose done at 16, and in addition to the recent breast reduction, had liposuction on her abdomen about 14 years back. She still has a "wish list" of cosmetic procedures she'd try if only her medical practice let up long enough. (She also gives one of her daughters Botox shots -- for migraines, though her daughter quite likes the smoothing effects.) 
Wexler thinks her own body is far from perfect, but says her dysmorphia -- the term for misperceptions about one's own body -- lies first and foremost with her once uncontrollable curls. That longstanding obsession has given her empathy for other women's selective self-loathing, however harsh or deluded their judgment. "I think I've taken something dysfunctional," she says, "and made it functional." 
She has not only made it functional; she's also made it profitable. After consulting on Donna Karan's skin-care and makeup line, Wexler negotiated a deal with Revlon to develop Almay's Kinetin skin-care line in exchange for a percentage of the profits. The business relationship eventually devolved into dueling lawsuits, with Revlon suing Wexler, claiming she hadn't done enough to help promote the product, and Wexler countersuing Revlon for the $20 million she had expected to earn. Revlon and Wexler settled in early April. Wexler still maintains another "very generous" six-figure annual consulting fee for her work on Calvin Klein's cosmetics line, and has discussed the possibility of promoting another skin-care line on television shopping networks. Meanwhile, her practice continues to grow (her husband, Gene, formerly a urologist, has recently joined), as does the number of different technologies available for in-office procedures. 
As those technologies change, so, eventually, does the aesthetic. Wexler once used filler to plump lines between the nose and the corners of the mouth; now she plumps the hollows of the cheeks, lifting the skin and pulling the lines smooth. Once she favored Greta Van Susteren-style eye tucks; now she tightens the skin with lasers and injects fat above the cheekbones. 
Over an egg-white omelet at Fred's, the restaurant at Barneys, Wexler details a few of the newest possibilities emerging from the beauty industry's research-and-development wing. She has high hopes for hair cloning, which is being studied in labs in the Netherlands, Toronto and North Carolina as a treatment for baldness. Recently, she started prescribing T.N.S., a lotion once used to facilitate the healing of wounds. It needs no F.D.A. approval, falling into the category of "cosmeceutical," one of those hybrid terms that automatically seems suspect by virtue of its failure to commit.
Wexler knows her procedures have their critics -- usually men, in her opinion, hypocrites who "think it's draconian for women to be doing these things, but leave their wives when they hit 50 for a woman who's younger and has breast implants. Half of them do," she adds authoritatively. Does Wexler regret the part she plays in that dynamic, the raising of the bar, at great cost and often physical pain? Well, no: she's not going for youthful, she explains, she's going for attractive. "If your skin looks unhealthy and draggy, it makes one think that your mind is sluggish as well," she says, her fork hovering in midair. "It's a presence. It's like wearing a wrinkled suit to an interview. It is!" No longer a fun indulgence, Botox starts to seem like a simple nicety, like combing your hair or making sure your bra strap isn't hanging out. It's one of the more menacing outgrowths of cosmetic innovation, this equation of youthful appearance with social rectitude.
"If your life expectancy has changed from the 40's to the 70's to now probably the 90's, you're going to have to change the way you look," says Wexler, going for the big picture. "As we enter our 90's, we don't want to walk around looking like the Dannon yogurt lady." 
Pat Wexler hanging out at Barneys on a Saturday afternoon is a bit like the queen dropping in on Harrods -- grateful patrons stop her regularly to pay homage. The jewelry designer Judith Ripka swings by her table to say hello and promises to send a few pieces. Salespeople greet Wexler by name. Two exquisitely dressed women, one in her 40's, the other her mother, pause to chat, getting in a quick cosmetic question or two before they all part. 
Wexler and one of her daughters, who has joined her for some shopping, finally extricate themselves from the fourth floor and head down to the sunny Madison Avenue sidewalk. "Bergdorf's?" she says to her daughter, who nods, at which point Wexler hails a cab to take them there -- three blocks away. If Wexler feels like springing for the cab instead of putting one mule-clad foot in front of the other and walking there like the rest of the world, she clearly sees no point in depriving herself. The technology is available, so why not take advantage? After all, she can afford it.

Niagara Falls, N.Y. Versus the Other Side

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
ON a recent visit to Niagara Falls, Nitin Dawda, of Hertfordshire, England, elected to stay overnight in Niagara Falls, N.Y., rather than Niagara Falls, Ontario, the bustling city on the Canadian side of the border, just a short stroll across the Rainbow Bridge. But like most visitors to either side, Mr. Dawda said that he, his sister and brother-in-law had spent most of their free time on the Canadian side, "because there's more to see and do."
 That is why Niagara Falls, Ontario, attracts 15 million visitors a year, 70 percent of them from the United States, according to Victor Ferraiuolo, a spokesman for the Niagara Falls Tourism Association in Canada. Niagara Falls, N.Y., meanwhile, draws about half that -- 8.4 million -- said John Percy, vice president of tourism development for the city. The average stay at a hotel on the American side of the falls is 1.2 nights, said Mr. Percy; on the Canadian side, it's 2.4 nights, according to Gary Hardy, tourism manager of the Niagara Economic and Tourism Corporation. 
 In the hope of blunting that exodus across the border, Gov. George E. Pataki said last summer that he had reached an agreement for the Seneca Indian Nation to build a casino at the Niagara Falls Convention Center, a second in Buffalo and a third on existing reservation land. The casinos will boost economic activity in the region, Governor Pataki said, "by allowing us to compete with our Canadian neighbors." 
The agreement, to be valid for 14 years with a seven-year renewal, requires approval of the State Legislature, the Seneca Nation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Tribal members are scheduled to vote on it May 14, but still to be resolved are questions of unions and how much revenue the state can examine. 
"Most people in Niagara Falls are excited by the opportunity to have gaming," said Bob Newman, president of Niagara USA, an organization formed by consolidating two chambers of commerce and the Niagara Business Alliance. "We see it as a possible catalyst to revitalize downtown development and to stem some of the migration to the casinos on the Canadian side."
The lure of the Canadian side of the falls includes not just Casino Niagara, with its 3,000 slot machines, but also its more numerous and newer hotels, trendy restaurants and other attractions. And sometime this June the World Wrestling Federation, with a loyal following of young and old fans, plans to open a ride on the Canadian side that will catapult riders 220 feet into the air before dropping back down to earth. About the same time, a 4,000-square-foot retail and exhibition space is scheduled to open featuring WWF merchandise and memorabilia.
In mid-March, Governor Pataki announced that the state would provide up to $10 million for a Niagara Experience Center in downtown Niagara Falls, to showcase the region's historical and cultural themes, including those of Indians. It would also have a panoramic screen theater, interactive exhibits, an amphitheater for lectures and seminars and a cafe. Finding the money faces some substantial hurdles, however.
Mr. Percy acknowledged that many visitors to the American side of the falls were attracted by the glitz on the Canadian side. "but we have wonderful family-oriented attractions," he said, citing the existing aquarium and a second, bigger and more modern aquarium under construction several blocks away, lovely parks and a tethered helium balloon that lifts visitors 400 feet above the falls.
"The problem is that our other attractions aren't right downtown near the falls," Mr. Percy added, "and if attractions aren't visible to the eye, visitors won't seek them out." 
Unfortunately for a city that was long glorified in magazines and movies, what is too often visible is the many boarded-up buildings downtown and the near-empty Rainbow Center mall, also downtown. Moreover, with the decline in manufacturing, the city has lost more than a third of its population in the past 30 years. Many visitors to Niagara Falls, Ontario, still walk across Rainbow Bridge, which joins the two cities, to see the falls from the other side. But relatively few visitors shop on the United States side, because of the paucity of retail stores and because the weak Canadian dollar makes Canadian purchases less expensive. 
Wedding kiosks and chapels, which did a big business years ago before Las Vegas and other cities got into the quick-marriage business, are now one of the few growth industries in the city, accounting for an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 marriages a year. The Rev. Gerard A. Fendell said that he and his colleague, the Rev. Barry L. Lillis, performed almost 800 marriages a year, most of them in their Falls Wedding Chapel, but others in the balloon, in helicopters or alongside the falls. (For a couple to be married in New York State a license must be issued at least 24 hours before the ceremony. A bill pending in the state legislature would eliminate that waiting period, but only in Niagara Falls.)

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 5-5-02: THE ETHICIST; 
When in France

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
I was recently in France with my wife, who forgot her oral contraceptives. I easily persuaded a pharmacist to supply her, and at the equivalent of $1.50 for a brand that costs $35 here. We bought a year's supply. Who acted unethically? Me, a physician not licensed in France? The pharmacist, who handed out drugs without a prescription? My wife, who takes them? The drug company, which excessively inflates its prices in America? Franz H. Messerli, M.D., New Orleans
 The pharmacist acted best. He may have broken the law by providing contraceptives without a prescription, but he showed courage and humanity in helping a traveler. In his defense, he provided them to a woman who had used them for years, and he was guided by a doctor, albeit an out-of-towner not licensed in France. Had he refused, he might have placed your wife at risk of an unwanted pregnancy with potentially unpleasant consequences. Finally, he doled out birth-control pills, not morphine. 
 By inducing the pharmacist to break the law, however benignly, your wife behaved imperfectly, putting someone at risk for her own convenience. And while you were not exactly practicing medicine without a license -- helping your wife refill a prescription falls below my threshold of practicing medicine -- you used your credentials in a way that jeopardized the pharmacist. You two might better have switched temporarily to a nonprescription contraceptive or found a French doctor to write a prescription (admittedly a hassle).
Where you and your wife did not err was in stocking up at that pharmacy as if it were a factory-outlet store. Those birth control pills are inexpensive because the French impose price controls. No manufacturer is forced to sell pills in Paris; presumably they do so profitably even at lower prices.
So is it unethical for a drug company to sell the same pills for $35 in the United States? It would take a mind more Greenspanian than mine to sort out the excessively inflated profits from the legitimate. Is a fair profit margin 5 percent? Ten? One hundred? Do these terms apply to wages or just prices? (Is the cast of "Friends" overpaid? Are physicians? And why did Ron Howard win best director? Maybe an economist would know; I'm baffled.) However, you seem to believe patients (or at least your wife) would be better served if drugs were more affordable, and thus you have a duty as a physician and a citizen to work toward that -- something that will require not a change of heart among pharmaceutical companies but a change of law in Washington.
For almost three years my cellphone number has been the same as a doctor's office, but with a different area code. I regularly get calls from patients and pharmacies. I informed the doctor, as I do callers when I pick up. When I don't pick up, my voice mail announces my name, but when someone leaves a message for the doctor, I just erase it. Is that wrong? 
What more should I do? A.Y., Chicago
Get your number changed. This not-too-onerous act can reduce the anxiety of patients, pharmacists and yourself, and it will save you a few bucks on all those wrong numbers. If you dread the nuisance of telling folks that you've got a new number, then at least put a more explicit announcement on your voice mail, giving the doctor's area code and number. Or learn to live with the nagging guilt that some sick person never got through to the doctor and died! The name of that person? Abraham Lincoln. O.K., probably not Lincoln. But the point is, a small effort could produce a continuing benefit for yourself and others. Why not do it?

HEADLINE: The 70's Are So 90's. The 80's Are The Thing Now. 

BYLINE:  By SIMON REYNOLDS; Simon Reynolds is the author of "Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture" (Little, Brown). He is writing a book about post- punk music of the 80's.

 BODY:
AND now, the 80's.
 It was probably inevitable. The pop music and fashion industries depend on recycling their own history, and the retro styles of the 1960's and 70's had been strip-mined to the point of exhaustion. Anyway, pop cult revivals tend to arrive punctually after roughly 20 years -- just long enough for a period to acquire the charm of remoteness. In the 80's themselves, rock groups like R.E.M. and Jesus and Mary Chain harked back to the Velvet Underground and the Byrds of the 60's. So, in the 00's, the 80's have returned, right on time. 
 Dance clubs devoted to 80's pop culture have been springing up from Chicago to London, from Berlin to Brooklyn, all of them echoing with the thumping sound of 80's synth-pop groups like Human League and Soft Cell. But the D.J.'s are not just spinning records culled from the bargain bins. They're also playing music by a raft of contemporary 80's-influenced groups like Fischerspooner, the Faint and Miss Kittin and the Hacker.
The clubgoers, too, are participating in the recycling. At nightspots like Berliniamsburg in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, they're adopting new wave fashion, with its asymmetrical haircuts, skinny ties worn over T-shirts, and studded belts and bracelets -- and they're doing so in a spirit that curiously mingles irony with admiration. 
Two tendencies tend to coalesce in revivals like this. In one, people who were young during the period being celebrated reach middle age and experience pangs for the styles of their youth. In the other, a new generation becomes fascinated by the pop culture that prevailed when the generation was in its infancy. So the 80's revival is driven in part by pure nostalgia and also by the more intriguing notion of nostalgia for something never lived through.
For the people fueling the trend, the artifice of 80's pop culture seems refreshing at a time when the "keep it real" ethos of hip-hop and nu metal bands like Linkin Park and P.O.D. dominates the mainstream.
Larry Tee, who founded Berliniamsburg and is its resident D.J., said of the revival, "It's happening now because all the formats of popular music are so abused that people are revolting."
The revival is not confined to music. Is it any wonder that "That 70's Show" of the late 90's has begotten "That 80's Show" in 2002? The sitcom's retro reference points are played strictly for self-mocking laughs -- a sort of "weren't we ludicrous back then?" kind of humor: yuppies with mobile phones the size of bricks. In the fashion world, young designers are rediscovering the early renegade work of Vivienne Westwood, whose collection drew inspiration from pirates, peasants and American Indians. 
But music is where the decade is being mined most enthusiastically, and that's no surprise. Music is almost invariably the prism for nostalgia. Even in "That 80's Show," one of the main characters works in a record store. And Michael Winterbottom's forthcoming film, "24-Hour Party People," is set in the milieu surrounding the Manchester record label Factory and its punk-rock bands Joy Division and Happy Mondays. Another coming film, "Cherish," and last year's "Donnie Darko," which for no apparent reason was set in 1988, feature soundtracks laden with 80's songs.
This suggests that the glossy pop from the early days of MTV is gradually displacing 60's Motown and 70's disco from their privileged places in popular memory, as a post-boomer generation makes its presence felt culturally. Indeed, "We Are the 80's," a show on VH1 Classic regularly features videoes by groups like Berlin and Men Without Hats. Stations like KXPK (96.5 FM) in Denver and KVMX (MIX 107.5) in Portland, Ore., have pioneered radio formats that target fans of 80's new wave music.
Nothing captures and communicates a sense of period better than the clothes and pop music associated with it. Other art forms, meanwhile, don't seem to succumb to these bouts of nostalgia. It's hard to imagine a sudden wave of films in the style of 80's youth movies like "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty in Pink," or an emerging school of novelists trying to imitate Jay McInerney and Brett Easton Ellis.
In pop music there are three distinct 80's revivals going on. The dominant one -- known variously as electro or nu-wave -- harks back to the plastic 80's of synthesizers and robotic voices. Then there is the 80's of glammed-up "hair metal," as resurrected by performers like Andrew W. K., whose MTV favorite "Party Hard" pays homage to the rabble-rousing anthems of Twisted Sister and Motley Crue. Finally there's the mid-80's wave of 60's-influenced noise-pop from groups like Jesus and Mary Chain, as revived by bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.
This last microtrend -- effectively a re-revival -- highlights one of the ironies of the 80's resurgence, for the 80's were the first era in pop in which recycling and retrospection became rife. There were vogues for ska, rockabilly, psychedelia and other musical antecedents.
"With 1980's retro, we have reached the point of second-order recycling," said Andrew Ross, a cultural critic who is the director of the American studies program at New York University. "It's the equivalent, God forbid, of double quotation marks."
What most people find alluring about the 80's, though, is its spirit of futurism. Groups like Adult and Fischerspooner look back to the early 80's, when synthesizers, sequencers and drum machines transformed the sound of both mainstream pop and underground dance music. The aesthetic can be summed up by the oxymoronic term "retro-futurist."
Modern digital technology is so sophisticated that producers make electronic music that sounds almost as if it were played by a live band, full of subtle rhythmic irregularities that create a humanlike feel and jazzy swing. But just as punk rockers embraced a raw, elemental music, rejecting the overproduced sound of 70's rock, today's electro groups use old-fashioned synthesizers and drum machines. They prefer cold tones and stiff beats because they evoke a period when electronic music seemed alien and forbiddingly novel. They are making machine-music and proud of it.
Lyrically, too, their songs often hark back to the robotic imagery and anxieties about dehumanization that characterized 80's synth-pop: the David Cronenberg-like scenarios in songs like Gary Numan's "Cars." The Normal's "Warm Leatherette," an 80's song inspired by "Crash," J. G. Ballard's novel about the eroticism of automobile accidents, is a key reference point for today's electro bands. It has been covered by the German trio Chicks on Speed.
A similar mood of decadence and anomie pervades songs like "Silent Property" and "Dispassionate Furniture" by Adult, an influential duo (Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus) from Detroit.
The modern electro scene's hollow-inside pose is filtered through a healthy amount of irony and camp humor, though. What groups like Fischerspooner and clubs like Berliniamsburg, Electro-Sweat in Chicago and Trash in London represent is a sort of 21st-century update of late-19th-century decadence, a la Oscar Wilde and J. K. Huysmans's novel "Against Nature."
This sensibility derides the authentic and wholesome while exalting the synthetic and artificial, whether it's a matter of hair color, sexuality or style of music. Or in the words of the Berliniamsburg anthem "Fake" by Sophia Lamarr: "No hearts for you to break/ we are the fake/ the fake machines/pretend to live on TV screens."
Electro prizes contrivance and superficiality. Its appreciation of artifice and the performative aspects of gender can be traced back in part to the gay New York vogueing scene of the 80's, as popularized by Madonna and the movie "Paris Is Burning." Indeed, Mr. Tee, the club founder and D.J. in Brooklyn, co-wrote the song "Supermodel" for the transvestite star RuPaul.
Where techno is all about instrumental tracks as anonymous and interchangeable as the D.J.'s who play them, the electro scene is full of flamboyant personalities who put on a show -- whether it's the outrageous sexual theatrics of the singer Peaches or the performance-art-influenced spectacles staged by Fischerspooner involving costume changes, choreography, props, backdrops and up to 30 people onstage. The group likes to present itself as the vanguard of a "new pretentiousness" movement.
For many clubgoers, the 80's were a time when rock and dance music were in lively conversation with each other. Club music then was full of punky attitude and personality, a stark contrast to the functional music and faceless D.J.'s who dominate today's post-rave dance culture.
"Techno is strangling itself with its own provincial rulebook," said Mr. Miller of Adult. "People have finally grown tired of this. Electro has no real sense of rules, and thus there is a lot of excitement, innovation and creativity."
Electro is a return to what clubs were like before house music and Ecstasy hit the scene, a rewind to a time when the goal was to stand out from the crowd. Take the scene anthem "Frank Sinatra" by Miss Kittin and the Hacker. With its references to champagne, cocaine and limousines, and the deadpan hauteur of Miss Kittin's spoken-not-sung vocals, the song both celebrates and satirizes the idea of a velvet-rope elite. "I am legendary, you are not," declaims the imperious chorus of "It's Over" by the Hungry Wives. All this transgresses the ideals of rave culture, which celebrates losing your ego in the music's hypnotic flow and the fervor of the crowd.
In a similar way, where house and techno tracks present themselves meekly as mere components for the D.J.'s seamless mix, the electro songs compete for your attention through domineering vocals, witty lyrics and extravagant amounts of trash talk and profanity.
Electro is already on the verge of taking over as the next big thing in dance music. But what are its prospects of becoming chart-topping pop like the music of the synth-pop artists Human League and Depeche Mode? For that to happen, the 80's revival must escape the irony-clad embrace of hipsterland and resonate more widely. Take the 70's revival that occurred about a decade ago. An interest in long hair and heavy rock had been bubbling for some time in the underground scene, albeit couched in irony. Dinosaur Jr. covered a Peter Frampton song, while the Butthole Surfers spoofed Black Sabbath. But the grunge groups that eventually took these 70's-influenced sounds onto the charts -- Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains -- were uniformly earnest. Indeed, this sincerity was probably a precondition of their connecting with a mass audience. Their gloom-and-doom heaviness also struck a chord with the life experiences of youth during the early-90's recession and were seen as a refreshing return to reality after the frivolous hair metal of groups like Poison. 
At the moment, it's not clear whether the 80's revival in music and fashion is just the fad that refuses to fade or an actual movement with cultural impact. Valerie Steele of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York cautions against overinterpreting these shifts in style and music.
"Much of the time, these things exist within the world of fashion images, disassociated from any larger social context," Ms. Steele said. "The impetus comes from individual designers, like Mark Jacobs, and from trends within the industry. Even if their ideas do catch on in the broader world, it may be for reasons that have nothing to do with why the trend initially started within that inner circle."
Nowadays, hipsters are able to rifle through a vast archive of pop culture, appropriating and recombining elements according to their own whims and impulses. The resulting vogues for various periods are not so much signs of the times as floating signifiers: sounds and images that circulate in an autonomous zone of cool that may be only tenuously related to "the real world."

HEADLINE: More Customers Switch Electric Service 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
ALL Connecticut utility customers have been able to choose where they buy their electric power for almost two years now, but few have exercised that option until this year. Now thousands of people are switching to another supplier, even as lawmakers put the finishing touches on a plan to get more consumers to make a choice.
 "We've had the benefit of working with the program for a couple of years, and have a few ideas that we think will help people make the decision to move off and pick a supplier," said Mary J. Healey, the state consumer counsel who serves as ex-officio chairman of a committee that is seeking to boost public awareness of utility deregulation. 
 Among the ideas being considered are rebates for those who choose an alternative supplier and new educational programs for consumers. 
State Rep. Demetrios S. Giannaros, a Democrat from Farmington and a professor of economics at the University of Hartford, is one of the architects of the energy legislation. He said even with more people switching electricity suppliers, the numbers are still low.
"With regard to residential customers in particular, the movement to alternative retailers has been almost nonexistent, and almost all of the movement has been to green power providers," Representative Giannaros said. "We have 1.4 million residential electric customers in Connecticut. To have a few thousand move is not going to affect the market." 
The slow acceptance of electric deregulation by consumers has been driven by the lack of competition in the marketplace, officials acknowledged. Three companies are actively soliciting residential customers, although a dozen are soliciting business customers.
Beryl M. Lyons, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Public Utility Control, noted that when telephone service was deregulated there was almost no competition at first, either.
"There was a time when 25 cents a minute sounded like a good deal, but now there are 300 companies out there who can offer intrastate toll calling, and if you shop around you can get rates of 5 or 10 cents a minute," Ms. Lyons said. "And competitive telephone service started out with most companies going after the business market, too, because there is a higher profit margin there." 
Energy deregulation was approved by the legislature in 1998, and implemented in 2000. As a result of deregulation, Connecticut Light and Power and United Illuminating, which provided power to most of the state as regulated utilities, now merely act as electric transmission and distribution companies. 
They still sell power to anyone who does not elect to switch companies, but the companies have sold their electrical generating plants and have to buy the power on the open market. And most people have stayed with those two utilities.
By January, 2,868 people had signed up for an alternative plan. That increased to 2,995 in February, 3,063 in March, and then to 5,606 in early April, Ms. Lyons said. The department has been told informally thousands of others have since signed up with a new electric service.
The first company to actively solicit residential electric companies was the Connecticut Energy Cooperative in Hartford. Robert A. Maddox, a spokesman for the cooperative, said almost half the 6,000 households signed up so far are buying the green energy option, from renewable sources, even though it is slightly more expensive.
The average household will pay about 25 cents more per day for the green energy, which he observed is less than the price of one cigarette.
Martin L. Heft, the first selectman of Chester, was one of the cooperative's first customers. He said it was a seamless transition and the only change was a notice on his monthly bills from C.L. & P. that said his power was provided by the cooperative.
"It worked so great," he said, that he offered a membership to the cooperative for his sister and parents as a gift. In addition, he persuaded the townspeople to use the cooperative for municipal accounts in a deal that also provides a discount on electric power to town residents.
"We weren't recommending that anyone use any particular service, but we presented it as another opportunity to purchase power," Mr. Heft said. 
A new partnership between Levco Inc. in Norwalk and Dominion, which owns the Millstone nuclear power plants in Waterford, is now signing up residential customers.
Edward R. Levene, a vice president at Levco, said the new service has signed up 10,000 new customers at rates 7.4 percent below the published C.L. & P. rates.
The savings would be only on the electricity portion of the bill, not on the distribution charge that regulators have authorized. Levco is charging 5.225 cents per kilowatt hour for its most common residential rate, while the authorized Connecticut Light and Power rate for the same customer is 5.643 cents. The savings for the average residential customer without electric heat would be $3.75 to $4 per month.
"I've been told we're the lowest priced provider in the state right now," said Mr. Levene, whose family has run an energy business since the 1920's, starting with coal, then oil, then natural gas, and now electricity.
Dan Donovan, a Dominion spokesman, said that the company is eyeing markets as far west as Chicago. 
"Most of these markets, we're finding that all of a sudden people decide it's the thing to do and start moving to a new company," Mr. Donovan said. "We went through the same process with telephone service, and hopefully when we get to that point with electric power, we'll be well established." 
Representative. Giannaros said he is encouraged some customers are switching their service, but worried not enough movement is taking place to create the competitive environment that will be required to keep costs low for consumers.
"When full deregulation arrives on Jan. 1, 2004, if 95 percent of customers are still with C.L. & P. and United Illuminating," he said, "that could lead to a price spike as the companies scramble to fill energy demand on the short-term market, similar to what happened in California."
A bill expected to pass the legislature this year would require C.L. & P. and United Illuminating to negotiate extended energy contracts for customers who do not elect to go to another company.
In addition, Mr. Giannaros said, a surcharge on power bills would raise money to provide a $100 energy reimbursement for anyone who switches to another power company for at least a year.
"As the state and national economies recover," he said, "it could send energy prices much higher. One advantage of a deregulated market is consumers can buy at the lowest price, which is now.
"The last seven months have been a great opportunity for people to lock in electric rates because oil and natural gas prices have been very low," Rep. Giannaros added. "There's a lower price available to them today than if they wait until 2004 or even if they wait until later this year."

Waxen Photographs
"Sugimoto: Portraits" at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through July 21, is a series of 11 photographs of Queen Victoria, Elizabeth I, William Shakespeare, Winston Churchill, Napoleon Bonaparte, Benjamin Franklin, Richard I, Richard III, Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. 
 Of course no one was snapping photographs in those distant times, but more recently the wax works at Madame Tussaud's in London had included these particular subjects among countless others. 
 Hiroshi Sugimoto, a 43-year-old conceptual artist from Tokyo was commissioned in 1999 by the Deutsche Guggenheim Museum in Berlin to expand on his previous series called "Wax Museums and Dioramas." Nancy Spector, curator of the Bruce exhibit notes in the catalog that Sugimoto has photographically resuscitated the wax corpses. 
The Bruce is off Exit 3 of I-95, open Tuesday through Saturday from 10-5, Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for people under 5 and over 64, free on Tuesdays. 

The Bronson Dogwoods
"For God and Country" is the Sept. 11 commemorative theme chosen for the 67th annual Dogwood Festival at the Greenfield Hill Congregational Church on Bronson Road in Fairfield. Tens of thousands of dogwood trees bloom each year around the Mother's Day weekend, attracting almost as many visitors. 
Viewing of the trees, propagated from a few dozen planted by the Bronson family on their estate and adjacent roads in the 18th century, is the highlight of an experience that includes walking tours of nearby pre-Revolutionary homes and gardens, a juried art exhibition and sale, a quilt raffle, baseball memorabilia, sale of perennials, annuals, culinary herbs and dogwood trees, tag sale of furniture, clothing, toys and sports equipment, a children's activities tent, a luncheon cafe, takeout picnics and a hot dog wagon, and 10 musical groups and family entertainers. 
Hours on Friday and Saturday are 10 to 5, Sunday noon to 5, and Monday, May 13, 10 to 3:30. Tickets for musical performances are $8 for adults, $5 for people under 19 and older than 64. Directions and information: (203) 259-5596, ext. 19.

Hats in Hat City
The hats to be featured today at a lecture-luncheon in Danbury are a far cry from the Stetsons and Dobbses and other name-brand headgear that once so dominated the local economy that Danbury was known as Hat City.
"Crowns: Portraits of Black Women in Church Hats," a book that went into a fourth printing within only five months of publication, is the subject of a joint talk by its author, Craig Marberry, former television reporter, and Michael Cunningham, commercial photographer. Fifty photographs are accompanied by the stories behind the hats, the women, and the cultural, historical and spiritual significance of their lives. 
The event takes place at the Ethan Allen Inn, off the Lake Avenue Exit of I-84, from noon to 2:30. Registration at $25 begins at 11:30. To check on availability of tickets: (203) 797-4568.

Beach Babies
No strollers are allowed, but children up to 4 years old who are ambulatory, and babies in carriers or backpacks, accompanied by a parent or two, are invited to sign up for one to four sessions of "Beach Babies" at the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center in Milford. 
Beginning on Tuesday from 10 to 11 a.m. and continuing into June the series of walks on the beach will introduce babies, toddlers and probably some dads and moms to the crabs, plovers, sea flowers and all manner of water and land creatures that emerge in the warm spring weather. 
Fees are $10 per class. Information: (203) 878-7440.

Tasting Russian Wines
Does Khvanchkara ring a bell? Tsinandali? Old Tbilisi Red? Red is a hint. The three barely pronounceable names are among 11 Russian wines produced in Georgia, a region of Russia that has been making wine the same old way for many centuries. 
Tastings of all 11 wines, with hors d'oeuvres and the telling of some unusual stories about the rich history of the region will be offered by Tasters Guild International, Southern Connecticut Chapter, Tuesday at 6:30 in the Sage American Grill, Howard Avenue, New Haven. Irakly Kaveladze, importer of Russian wines, will lead the program. Tickets are $37. Reservations: (203) 469-4218.

Promoting Restoration
Howard Mansfield, author of "The Same Ax Twice: Restoration and Renewal in a Throwaway Age," will be the keynote speaker at Friday's annual statewide conference organized by the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford. 
The book sets the tone for workshops focusing on downtown revitalization, restoration and maintenance of old houses, and the preservation of historic sacred places. An obligation to rescue downtowns and old homes is nothing new, but the need to preserve older churches and synagogues requiring massive repairs is a cause promoted by Partners for Sacred Places. 
Based in Philadelphia, the organization was formed around the concept that older houses of worship are a vital part of the living and past history of a community. Tuomi Joshua Forrest of Partners for Sacred Places will discuss the issue of helping congregations and communities cope with preservation problems and costs.
Conference workshop leaders and panel members include William Hosley, executive director of the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society; Warren Perry, associate professor of anthropology, Central Connecticut State University; John W. Shannahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission: Christopher Wigren, assistant director, Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, and several architectural historians, architects and restoration consultants.
Hours are 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the fee is $45. Reservations: (203) 562-6312.

Poetry Readings in Old Lyme
The prologue to Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" will be read in 14th-century English today at 3 p.m. as the opening volley in a program of poetry readings in Old Lyme. The poems will be read by four Old Lyme poetry enthusiasts. The programs sponsors are the First Congregational Church at 2 Ferry Road, where the event will be held; the Old Lyme Griffin Library, Lyme Public Library and East Lyme Library.
Included in the readings are Wordsworth's "Daffodils," Shakespeare's sonnet "From You I Have Been Absent in the Spring," Whitman's "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," Alan Seeger's "I Have a Rendezvous With Death," and works by Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost and Anne Sexton. Admission is free.

HEADLINE: Slave Policies 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
IN 1856, just five years before the outbreak of the Civil War, the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company printed a pamphlet offering slave owners in six Southern states the option of insuring the lives of their slaves.
 For just $2, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee residents, for example, could purchase a 12-month policy from the Hartford-based insurer on a 10-year-old domestic servant that would yield $100 if the slave died. Policies for older slaves, like a 45-year-old, were more expensive, costing the slave owner $5.50 a year. 
 Though the company no longer exists, these policies are drawing increasing attention nearly 150 years later because of a lawsuit that was filed in United States District Court in Brooklyn, in late March against Aetna Inc. and two other companies, claiming that they profited from the slave trade.
In Connecticut, where insurance has long been a principal industry, the documents exhibit a painful reminder of the past, especially in a Northern state that is proud of its abolitionist ancestors like John Brown. 
"It's not pleasant to talk about it today, to put it mildly, but slaves were insured just like any other thing that the farmers owned, that the slave owners owned," said Tom Baker, director of the Insurance Law Center at the University of Connecticut School of Law. "If you were selling insurance in slave states to people who had plantations, that was one of the things that you sold.
"It was very common," he added. "Basically, insurance and slavery go all the way back as far as American history."
Aetna, which in 2000 apologized for its involvement in slavery, is the only insurance company to be named in the slave reparations lawsuit, though one of the plaintiff's lawyers, Roger S. Wareham, said he expected that other insurance companies would be sued. 
A brief examination of documents demonstrates that Aetna was hardly the only company that engaged in the practice. 
"It wasn't just the Aetna company," said Charles L. Blockson, curator of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University. "A lot of the old insurance companies, especially the ones that handled shipping in the Newport, R.I., area and New London."
The problem for the plaintiffs, experts said, is that many firms are defunct, have changed names, destroyed old records, or have been absorbed by other companies. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to document ties to the slave trade.
In the case of slave ships, for example, 19th-century marine insurance policies often didn't identify the cargo on board. Instead, the policy simply stated that it insured "goods" on board.
"What strikes me from what I know already is that the records do not say clearly that slaves were insured," said Ugo Nwokeji, assistant professor of history at UConn. "We cannot say that we know it was widespread, although it is well possible that it would have been widespread."
The insurance industry's connection to slavery is not a new revelation. It has been written about in publications like Mr. Blockson's 1977 book, "Black Genealogy." Even on eBay, the Internet auction site, copies of slave life insurance polices are for sale. And the tale of the slave ship Zong, in which 133 sick slaves were thrown overboard in 1781 so the ship's owners could collect insurance, has been studied for years.
The connection has gained greater attention in recent years because of the research of Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, the lead plaintiff in the federal lawsuit that was filed on March 26 against Aetna, the FleetBoston Financial Corporation and the CSX Corporation. Ms. Farmer-Paellmann first stumbled across slave insurance policies in 1997 while researching a slave reparations paper for a law school class. After reviewing different courses of action, she decided to focus on corporations and private estates that had been involved in slavery. 
"And that's how I came into Aetna," she said.
Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, who said she is a descendant of slaves, continued to pursue the issue long after her class ended. In 2000, she called Aetna and requested that they send her copies of their policies. She said she received two.
"I was really moved when I saw the policies," she said. "It's one thing to read about it and it's another thing to actually see a copy of the policy, and it really caused me to pause. I have to say it was a very emotional experience." 
So, she decided, it would be appropriate if Aetna apologized and paid retributions. 
In March 2000, Aetna expressed "deep regret" that for a few years after its founding in 1853, Aetna Life Insurance insured the lives of slaves. Calling it a "sad" and "disappointing chapter" in the company's history, Aetna has said it only issued a "small number" of such policies. To date, the company has records of five policies on 16 lives and is aware of two policies that appeared in books, according to a company spokesman, who, because of the pending litigation, referred additional questions to a statement on the company's Web site. 
In one policy, a woman named Mary Raby purchased a 12-month policy for $17.25 from Aetna's New Orleans office in October 1853. If the insured slave or slaves died, Ms. Raby would receive $600, according to a copy of the policy that appears in Dee Parmer Woodtor's book "Finding a Place Called Home: A Guide to African-American Genealogy and Historical Identity" (Random House, 1999).
Shortly after Aetna issued its apology, the California State Legislature passed a bill requiring all insurance companies that do business in the state to submit records of any slaveholder insurance policies.
To date, eight companies have submitted information, said Nancy Cramer, deputy press secretary for the California Department of Insurance. Five sent policies and the other three sent information on ships they may have insured, she said. The documents were released to the public last Wednesday.
The California law has prompted companies like Ace Ltd., a Bermuda-based insurance company, to search through archives looking for connections to the slave trade. The company hired a law firm to review its archives, including the records of Aetna Fire and Insurance Company and the Insurance Company of North America. Those companies later became part of Cigna's property and casualty holdings that Ace acquired in 1999. Ace did not find any evidence of slave life insurance policies written by Aetna Fire or the Insurance Company of North America, according to Lisa Fleishman-Hicks, a spokeswoman for Ace.
And though the Insurance Company of North America is one of the oldest insurance companies in the country, Ace compared its marine insurance records against those of known slave vessels and did not find that it had written or carried any policies on known slave vessels, Ms. Fleishman-Hicks said.
For companies that engaged in the practice, it was not necessarily a profitable business. In fact, the Hartford Life Insurance Company went out of business, in part, because of its practice of insuring slaves, according to P. Henry Woodward's 1897 book, "Insurance in Connecticut." The business, which is not related to the current company of the same name, "tried the experiment" with insuring slaves "by shiploads," according to the book.
"Although premiums were very high, they were still far from remunerative," he wrote. "As a rule, the worst masters took out policies. Negroes were described as Caesar or Cato, Jim or Tom, and identification was so difficult that if any of a gang died, names in the proofs of loss were easily fitted to them."
In addition, he wrote, the shippers knew the average percentage of loss "and hence had every advantage in arranging terms."
And even though Charter Oak Life Insurance offered policies on slaves, it was not necessarily a business it wanted to encourage, according to the 1856 pamphlet. 
"The company is by no means solicitous of securing a large Negro insurance business unless the owners are careful and judicial men," Matthew Magill, a Kentucky-based general agent for Charter Oak Life Insurance, wrote in the 1856 pamphlet. 
With documents showing that other companies engaged in the practice, is it right that Aetna, which said it has spent $36.5 million in the past 20 years on health initiatives and scholarships, among other things, for African-Americans , bear the burden of the insurance industry's involvement in the slave trade? 
Mr. Baker of UConn, for one, doesn't think so.
"I just have a sense that it's unfair that a few companies have been singled out when the slave economy was something that the whole society bears some responsibility for," Mr. Baker said.
"My concern," he added, "is more that to the extent that there is some moral responsibility, it should not be targeted to just a few people."
Ms. Farmer-Paellmann said companies like Aetna are being held accountable for their past practices. Other businesses, she said, will be singled out in the future.
"This is, like I said, the first step," Ms. Farmer-Paellmann said. "They have played a role and they should be held responsible, and later on down the road there will be more companies."

HEADLINE: A Man Once Called 'Hero' Just Wants a Job 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON 

 BODY:
A SMALL statue of Michael the Archangel is set atop Ed Smith's television, testament to what the people of Farmington think of him. The angel Michael was known as God's warrior, a mighty angel often portrayed in armor who cast Satan from the heavens. A family from Farmington made the statue as a gift to Mr. Smith. "For you," it reads, "who is the guardian and protector of all people."
 Ed Smith is no angel, he'll be the first to admit that. He has no armor either, which he could use about now. In March, he gave up trying to save his career as a 13-year employee of the Southbury Training School, an institution for mentally retarded people. Then a few weeks later the IGA in Wolcott laid him off, saying the store just wasn't doing enough business. His unemployment benefits ran out long ago. 
 Now he spends much of his time filling out job applications or pondering his fate in his home overlooking Lake Winnemaug in Watertown. Wherever he goes in the Waterbury area, whether it is to the Home Depot or the local temporary agency, people stop him and ask, "Aren't you the guy? . . ." 
Mr. Smith said he doesn't want to be that guy anymore, but admits he wouldn't act differently today. Three years ago he alerted a neighborhood in Farmington that a Southbury patient, who had been labeled by the state as a "same-sex opportunistic pedophile," was being moved to a group home there. Neighbors stopped the move and hailed Mr. Smith as a hero, but he was arrested for illegally removing patient records. His life has been in turmoil since, and the letters and checks that crammed the post office box of Citizens for Ed Smith have dwindled.
"Here today," he said without bitterness, "history tomorrow."
Mr. Smith's tale started in May 1999, when he heard at work that the man the state called a pedophile, who came to be known only as E. G., was to be moved to the group home from Southbury. Despite protests from staff members, the administration at Southbury, Mr. Smith said, continued to plan the move, which had been ordered by the State Department of Mental Retardation.
Several months later, Mr. Smith drove to Farmington with his fiancee, Michelle Rasmussen, who also worked at Southbury. They ostensibly were going out to dinner, although Mr. Smith wanted to see for himself if the group home was far from other houses, and particularly from children, as he had come to believe.
But when he stopped at the house, he saw it was part of a neighborhood. An older woman was in a yard next door, separated only by a chain-link fence, watching the children in her care play.
Whenever he tells this story, his face reddens so fully one fears he will burst a blood vessel. His eyes fill with tears. But the words keep coming, flowing from his mouth as effortlessly as water from a spout. "I'm no Paul Revere," he said, "no whistle-blower. I just saw this woman, the kids. And I got a knot in my stomach."
Mr. Smith walked over to the woman and began to chat. Had she heard about the new residents? Oh, yes, the woman, Rosemary Carpenter, the children's aunt, said. She had heard an elderly couple were moving in. Why, she and the children were going to bake muffins and take them over once the couple moved in. Mr. Smith cautioned her against any such generosity. He told her, he said, the truth, and she became upset.
He left, and saw a police officer in the neighborhood. Mr. Smith advised the officer that Mrs. Carpenter may need some reassurance about the neighborhood's safety now that she knew who was moving in. With that second conversation, the word was out, and Farmington's ire was up.
After that day, just about every move Mr. Smith had made became news. Farmington residents praised him. But to the administration at Southbury, he was a man who leaked confidential information. To state prosecutors, he was a lawbreaker. The police arrested him. His trial attracted the attention of news media outlets throughout the country. " 'Dateline' came out to the house," he said. "They got lost."
As word spread, the facts changed to suit the telling, Mr. Smith said. He said he never stole any records and never distributed anything to residents' mailboxes, as had initially been reported. He talked to Mrs. Carpenter and gave her his copy of minutes to a meeting documenting E. G.'s attempts to lure a 7-year-old boy to his bedroom window while he was in Southbury. Then he talked to the police officer and left. He said that is all he did.
He was acquitted by a jury in January. After the trial, several Democratic state legislators asked for his help. They wanted to draft a bill creating an oversight board authorized to investigate concerns regarding sex offenders in state care. But that was a volunteer effort -- no job there. His numerous supporters held three fund-raisers to help pay the fees for his lawyer, Stephen McEleney of Hartford. Still, "I haven't even scratched the surface to get this gentleman paid," Mr. Smith said. He still owes Mr. McEleney $48,000.
He collected unemployment for the first 26 weeks, then installed wallboard and painted when he could find the work. He landed a job at a furniture store, but business slowed after Sept. 11 and he was let go. Mr. Smith has applied to various agencies that care for the elderly and for special-needs children, but no one has offered him a job.
Mr. Smith wanted his old, steady job back, the one he felt certain he did well, and the one for which he was justly compensated. Who else would hire him for $25 an hour, a guy without a college degree and little experience when he first started out? But for his fiancee to regain her job at Southbury, he had to agree to resign his own, which he did in March. He also had to sign off on an apology to E. G., who has remained at Southbury.
Southbury referred all questions to the State Department of Mental Retardation. Martin Zito, chief of staff at the department, refused to answer questions about the case over the telephone. In response to questions submitted to him in an e-mail message, he wrote that Mr. Smith was fired for "a violation of D.M.R. work rules."
Mr. Zito did not answer submitted questions about Mr. Smith's work record while at Southbury and whether the department would consider hiring him back. In response to those questions, Mr. Zito instead wrote:
"The Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation has reached a full and final resolution of the grievance regarding the dismissal of the grievant, Edward Smith with New England Healthcare District 1199, which was negotiated through the Connecticut Office of Labor Relations. As is evident by the signed agreement, all parties have agreed to the details set forth and D.M.R. officials believe this negotiated resolution is an appropriate end to an unfortunate incident."
Mr. Smith still shares a house with Ms. Rasmussen, who grew up in it. His two sons, from his first marriage, visit every other weekend. 
His supporters are distressed at the outcome.
"It's terrible," Mrs. Carpenter said. "He's nothing but a hero to me. That's how I look at it and that's how this town looks at it." She and several other Farmington residents call Mr. Smith regularly.
Sometimes he looks at the statue of Michael the archangel and sighs.
"That's not me, I'm not a hero," he said. "But what was I going to do that day, turn the car around and say, 'It's the Department of Mental Retardation's problem'? I'm not that kind of person, so I got out of the car. And I don't regret what I did."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Long Island; 
U.S. Open Leads to Makeover of an Aging Clubhouse

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
WHEN the United States Golf Association announced that Bethpage State Park would be the site of the 102nd annual U.S. Open in June 2002, one immediate concern was the condition of the 80-year-old clubhouse, a rambling structure that serves all five courses at the public facility.
 Now, five years after the choice of the park's Black Course -- which straddles the Nassau-Suffolk border -- as the site of the four-day tournament that begins on June 13, the clubhouse has had a $10 million makeover, including construction of a 7,000-square-foot grand ballroom. 
 Seventy-eight corporate tents, which will include food and television sets, will be erected at three sites for the tournament.
Local businesses will also benefit. Some 225 hotels, from Nassau to Riverhead in Suffolk, have been fully booked for the entire week of the Open. 
In addition to making history -- it will be the first time the tournament is held at a public facility, and the 7,214-yard Black Course is the longest in Open history -- the event is expected to give a boost to Long Island's tourism and hotel industry. 
The tournament's overall impact on the island's economy is expected to be $70 million, according to Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau and Sports Commission. "After 9/11, tourism went down by about 40 percent," he said. "It had been a $5 billion a year industry on Long Island. With the U.S. Open here, people will see us all over the world and make decisions to come here."
The tournament involves 156 golfers and their entourages, and more than 42,000 ticket holders a day are expected, according to Marty Parks, senior director of communications for the Golf Association, which invested more than $3 million to modernize and repair the course. "The Black Course was chosen on its merit as a world-class golf course," he said. "Then the outside-the-ropes issues were considered," including hotels and transportation.
"Because it is a public golf course, we negotiated with the state that it be part of the contract that the green fees at Bethpage Black be guaranteed not to increase more than the cost of inflation for the next three years following the Open," Mr. Parks said. The daily fee for the Black Course is $31 during the week and $39 on weekends; the other four courses cost $24 and $29. 
The clubhouse, which is on the state's Register of Historic Places, was also a factor in bringing the Open to Bethpage, said Bernadette Castro, state commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. "The U.S.G.A. was concerned about the clubhouse, if we'd look good and how we could serve everyone," she said. 
Steven Carl, owner of Carlyle on the Green, the park's food and beverage concessionaire since 1998, had a key role in the renovation of the building. Mr. Carl, who renovated the historic Oheka Castle catering hall in Cold Spring Hills in the early 1990's, worked with the Port Washington interior designer Beth Donner and the Hempstead architect Michael Russo in designing the renovation and the addition. 
Mr. Carl, who has a 20-year contract to run the concessions, invested $10 million in the project, which included constructing the grand ballroom and tripling the size of the pro shop to approximately 1,000 square feet. Global Golf, the pro shop concessionaire, invested $3 million in its renovation. 
The clubhouse was built in the 1920's for what was then the Lenox Hills Country Club, owned by Benjamin Franklin Yoakum, a railroad executive. The original course is now known as the Green Course.
After Mr. Yoakum's death, the state purchased the 1,500-acre property in 1932 and renamed it the Bethpage Golf Club. In the early 1940's it was redesigned with four additional 18-hole courses, including the Black, by a renowned golf course architect, A. W. Tillinghast.
By the time Mr. Carl came on the scene, the rambling 63,000-square-foot brick and cedar-shake clubhouse had begun to show its age. "The building had great bones," Mr. Carl said. "It had been left in disrepair all these years, but was in the style of an English manor house. I had to find a way to reposition all the spaces."
IN doing so, the pro shop and registration area, which had been in the central section of the building, were relocated to the north wing near Mr. Carl's new full-service 150-seat Oak Room Restaurant, which had been the site of a breakfast cafeteria. 
A reception area and lounge were created in the central section, where the original wide pegged-wood floors were polished and left intact, as were the 30-foot vaulted, beamed ceilings. The conservatory-style ballroom, with seating for more than 550 and a 2,000-square-foot dance floor, was constructed to the rear of the lounge, overlooking the first hole of the Black Course. 
The ballroom is surrounded on three sides by 24 sets of twin floor-length multipaned windows framed by cream-colored swagged drapes. Eight alabaster chandeliers hang from a coffered ceiling designed to provide excellent acoustics. The floor is of variegated Brazilian wood with a custom inlaid trim.
Two brick outdoor patios, which seat 300 people, border one side of the ballroom and the Oak Room, facing the Black Course.
The renovation also added a cocktail lounge and small dining areas. The clubhouse's long hallways have ornately framed prints with early 1900's themes and burgundy and green floral carpets on polished wood floors.
On the grounds, the 78 corporate tents, either 30 by 30 feet or 40 by 40, have been erected in three places on the Red or Green Courses, which are adjacent to the Black. Prices for the tents, which include 60 to 125 weekly tickets, are from $75,000 to $175,000 depending on tent size and location. 
In addition, there are 67 tables in two locations, which include meals and 12 tickets each. Tables are $40,000 for the week in the clubhouse and $30,000 in the 24,000-square-foot "champion's tent" adjacent to the 18th hole. 
According to Mimi S. Griffin, owner of MSG Productions of Bethlehem, Pa., which is running the corporate tents and tables, about 65 percent of the companies that are renting them are from the New York City area. Most of the remaining renters are from Texas, California, Britain and Japan. 
Including tickets that go to the corporations renting tents and tables, there are 42,500 tickets for the event. They sell for $275 for a weekly ticket and $35 a day for the three practice rounds and $65 a day for the tournament rounds.
Hotel occupancy for western Long Island's 10,000 hotel rooms should be at 100 percent for the week of the Open, said Robert Lipper, president of Island-Metro Publications, which publishes the Long Island Lodging Guide quarterly and tracks the Long Island hotel industry.
Last June, that region, extending from the Queens line to Riverhead in Suffolk County, had a 77 percent occupancy rate. "The week of the Open should bump us up to 85 percent for this June," he said. "There are very few rooms left on Long Island for that week and now they are pushing into Queens."
The golf event could be a positive catalyst for the industry, which has had a decline in occupancy rates over the past year. 
Last year, one hotel with 130 rooms was added to the Western Long Island region, and 306 rooms have become available so far this year in two new hotels. The first quarter occupancy rate for western Long Island was only 63 percent, down from 68 percent a year earlier. An additional 416 rooms are expected to open in May and another 50 this summer, Mr. Lipper said.
Up to 1,500 rooms have been booked by the golf association for its staff, players and members of the media, Mr. Parks said. 
Marie J. Kupfer, owner of the Hilton Huntington, which is about one mile from Bethpage State Park, said 75 percent of the Hilton's 300 rooms have been booked by the group and the remaining by local corporations. The rooms, which average $200 a night, have been booked for the Open's four-day period for three years, she said.
"This will be a huge boost" to the hotel industry, Ms. Kupfer said. "This is not just a matter of a week of filled rooms. There is a huge amount of energy connected to this."
The Garden City Hotel, which is 10 miles from the golf course, has been fully booked for the Open since last June, according to Brian Rosenberg, a vice president. The 372 rooms range from $375 a night for a single room to $2,700 for a penthouse suite.
While the majority of out-of-towners attending the Open are expected to stay at hotels, others had been expected to rent private homes. Long Island residents willing to rent their house for the event were asked to contact the Open management and provide information about their houses that could be forwarded to those who requested house rentals.
"A few players prefer to stay in private houses, but there is not the demand that people expected," said Jon Barker, manager of the Open. "Most of the ticket holders are day-trippers and of those who stay longer, 99 percent are at the hotels," he said.
Teri Catapano Black, owner of Century 21 Metro Realty in Bethpage, said: "We have received a tremendous amount of calls from people willing to rent their houses. But until now we have not placed anyone that was interested."

Media-Savvy Campaign Promotes Living in 2 Towns

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
WHY does the value of real estate in one community rise much faster than the value of property in a nearby town?
 Certainly, there are very literal answers to the question, as South Orange and Maplewood -- two towns that market themselves as one -- discovered six years ago when the Midtown Direct train line to Manhattan was installed. Cutting about 30 minutes off a commute is a direct route to improving property values, and they have risen more than 10 percent a year in the last three years. 
 But the more ethereal factor of reputation -- the "buzz" a town generates -- also figures into property values. A town like Montclair, which is home to a remarkable number of people who work for media companies, has long had the buzz factor in its favor; South Orange/Maplewood, right next door to Newark, which was a racial battleground in the 1960's, traditionally has not. 
But now a group of committed and sophisticated citizens has coalesced in South Orange/Maplewood -- many of whom arrived with the advent of the Midtown Direct -- and a campaign is under way to change all that.
A grassroots organization, called the South Orange/Maplewood Community Coalition, was set up in 1996, financed by grants and private donations. While the organization was new, a number of its members had been active in other community groups over the years, including one established after the Newark riots whose main focus was in preventing white flight and promoting diversity. In 1997, the new group adopted the strategy of making the two communities -- which were once literally one and which currently share a school system -- become one for marketing purposes. Over the years, coalition members have developed all sorts of strategies to improve buildings and neighborhoods; now they are mounting a concerted effort to get their two-town hometown some good press. 
"We are looking to make people who could be potential move-ins aware of the lifestyle our community offers," said Ellen Greenfield, chairwoman of the coalition's Marketing and Public Relations Committee. "One of the ways we do that is by giving personal tours to people who are thinking of moving here. Another way is by advertising in newspapers around the tristate region.
"Another way is by trying to place stories about the beautiful homes here and various projects going on with the media."
Several weeks ago, Jacqueline Herships of South Orange, who is paid by the coalition to do part-time media relations work, set up a daylong media tour. A handful of writers and journalists were furnished with prefab article ideas, introductions to the people involved and even suggestions as to which publications might be interested.
Early indications are the effort will pay off: This Old House magazine is interested in an article about a battered, renovation-corrupted Victorian home -- and its barn near collapse -- that are being fully restored by new owners in Maplewood, Ms. Herships said. "It's the kind of exposure that could raise interest all around the country in the unique homes and village feeling that are available here," she said. 
On the tour, writers were also introduced to Cynthia and William Marshall, Maplewood residents who are 18th century art and antiques experts and offer themselves as quotable authorities. Les Saisons, a lone exception to the rule against bed-and-breakfasts in Maplewood, was shown and suggested as a vehicle for reporting on the issue of whether such establishments strengthen or hurt a community's cohesiveness. A South Orange architect discussed deck, landing, porch and renovation projects he has built in both towns. And two homes and gardens in the Montrose Park Historic District of South Orange were on display.
Ms. Herships had met with some "placement" successes even before the tour. Articles written in response to her suggestions or with her help as a source of information include a piece in the February issue of Victorian Homes magazine about Montrose Park and another previously in Victorian Decorating Ideas; articles in The New York Times and The Star-Ledger about the influx of artists in the community and the new performing arts center going up in South Orange; and an article in New Jersey Business News on how promoting the arts in the two towns has helped spur economic development.
But why are coalition members convinced such press notices are tied to property values? "We have seen how it works so far," Ms. Herships said, "with artists moving in from New York, and so many people from Brooklyn -- it seems like every other person is from Brooklyn -- and then they tell their friends about our community, and then they move in, and tell their friends. Word of mouth has helped change neighborhoods that were rundown and totally undervalued for 30 years after the Newark riots into lovely, thriving neighborhoods.
"Getting stories published is just a stronger, more effective form of word of mouth."
Several years ago, the coalition decided it needed a reading on what the trend is in property values in South Orange/Maplewood compared with other towns. So one coalition member, George Robinson, a retired telephone company manager, conducted a study. He did not take just an average of sales prices, figuring the sale of a single mansion can set that number askew. Instead, he took the assessed value of properties for tax purposes -- which remains unchanged for about 10 years in most towns -- and compared that with sales prices, coming up with a ratio that tells if market value is rising or falling.
"Maplewood and South Orange have done extremely well over the last few years," Mr. Robinson concluded.
Last year, according to his findings for 12 towns in the area, Maplewood's values rose 15.5 percent from the year before, more than any other town studied, and South Orange's property values increased 11.7 percent. In 2000, South Orange topped the list with a 22.7 percent rise, followed closely by Montclair's 22.4 percent increase, and Maplewood came in third with a 19.4 percent increase. Ms. Herships noted that there are a variety of types of neighborhoods in South Orange/Maplewood, and so she pitches stories to all sorts of publications.
Right now, Ms. Herships said the Hilton neighborhood in Maplewood, a niche for smaller homes and bungalows, is popular with single home buyers and younger couples. Those who yearn for a grand Victorian or a historic home that needs work are attracted to South Orange, she said.
David Gassman, who said he is in semiretirement after teaching European and medieval history at the Hudson Valley Center of Empire State College in Hartsdale, N.Y., has lived in an 1869 home on Irving Avenue for 18 years and has been refurbishing it all that time. Chairman of the South Orange Historical and Preservation Society, he spoke of an "unbelievably rich architectural heritage" in his town -- and noted that restoration of its public buildings contributes to the value of its neighborhoods.
THE historic Village Hall has been written about in several architecture publications, Mr. Gassman said. The castlelike fire house has become a well-maintained favorite as well, he said, and the town Community Center was recently repainted in appropriate Victorian colors.
Mr. Gassman was part of a group of residents who helped save the Old Stone House five years ago. Currently a ramshackle-looking place, the structure near the South Orange train station contains within it a pre-1680 Dutch home that is the second-oldest building in New Jersey. A group of residents are now pursuing grants to restore the building and locate a furniture museum there. 
"This might sound funny," said Jason Marshall -- the son of the antiques experts on the media tour and the one who conceived the museum idea -- "but we need the right kind of people to move here, people who will be excited about such things. Referring to Ms. Herships, he added: "That's why promoting the towns the way Jackie does works out so well. It brings in people who can respond to the true value of the buildings and homes that have been here all along."

HEADLINE: Milford Academy Hopes for a Comeback 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH BEST 

 BODY:
LIKE the students who seek its help in overcoming missed opportunities, Milford Academy just wants another chance to succeed.
 Founded in 1916 to help students prepare for their entrance to Yale University, Milford Academy has become a finishing school of sorts for talented athletes trying to win college scholarships in football and basketball at Division I schools, the highest level of competition in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The academy's students, most of whom are from outside of Connecticut, have completed high school but need to work on fulfilling basic courses required under N.C.A.A. eligibility rules. They also try to improve their test scores for the two standardized college entrance tests, the SAT or ACT. 
 In recent years Milford Academy has struggled to keep its doors open. 
On Thursday, Mayor James L. Richetelli Jr. of Milford announced that the city would buy the 20-acre Milford Academy campus for $2.2 million, which would be raised through a bond issue. Under the proposed terms of the agreement, the school would have a two-year grace period to complete scheduled repairs and to reorganize its finances before beginning to pay an annual rent of about $135,000. The lease could be renewed in five-year increments, the mayor said.
The proposal is subject to approval by the city's Board of Aldermen, but several aldermen seemed to indicate support for the plan. In 1999 the city paid $2.8 million for other Milford Academy property, including an indoor swimming pool, a soccer field and another two acres of land.
The mayor said the city should acquire the property to prevent development of the land, a concern for residents in the adjacent neighborhood. "This agreement is very important for the city," Mr. Richetelli said. "It will ensure that the land remains as it is." 
The mayor also said the continued existence of the school would ensure that the economic impact of Milford Academy would expand. Much of the school's $750,000 annual budget is spent locally, using vendors and other services. The school has struggled through a publicized battle between its board of trustees and its former headmaster of 10 years, Dino F. Ciaburri, who recently filed a breach of contract suit against the board seeking about $250,000 in back pay and damage to his reputation.
The administrators trying to repair the school's finances and image point to the 310 municipal code violations, poor housing conditions, neglected repairs and other difficulties that led to Mr. Ciaburri's resignation last July. The school plans to repay a previous $800,000 loan made by one of its trustees, Joseph Kelly, as well as to make repairs on the campus and to pay off other debts, he added. Mr. Kelly had earlier asked for repayment of the loan.
Administrators at Milford Academy are trying to look ahead even as they try to put their problems in the past. A hearing on the suit by Mr. Ciaburri is scheduled for tomorrow in Derby Superior Court, postponed from last week after Milford Academy filed a countersuit against the former headmaster claiming that he improperly managed the school and its finances. The former headmaster's lawyer, David Pite, said he would show that Mr. Ciaburri did an excellent job of running the school under a very difficult situation. 
Southern Connecticut Gas Company is also seeking payment from the school for a disputed gas bill. The company claims it is owed $60,000, while the school says it owes only about half that amount. A hearing is set for tomorrow on that claim, Mr. Coffey said.
William Chaplick, the Milford Academy football coach who replaced Mr. Ciaburri as the school's chief administrator, said he is determined to keep the school open to keep giving a second chance to talented athletes. He said he is optimistic that Milford Academy will overcome its most difficult battle.
"When I took over, everything was closed off except for the electricity," Mr. Chaplick said. "We're better this year than we were last year. We stopped the free fall. I think we're alive and kicking." 
A recent visit to Milford Academy's campus found work under way for renovations to the gymnasium, a library room filled with reference and textbooks, and a small, tidy cafeteria for student meals. This contrasts sharply with reports from the parents of former students about conditions at the school only last year that were described as a mother's nightmare. 
"It went beyond what you would consider code violations," said Joanne Heslin Lavery, a Hartford lawyer whose son, John, is now playing football at Northeastern University. "There were trash and debris all over the floors in the halls. The shower stalls were black with mold and there was broken furniture. It was as disgusting as you can imagine." 
Despite its problems, Milford Academy has managed to move its students toward college scholarships. Playing a schedule against college junior varsity squads like those from the Naval Academy and Bucknell University, the football team this year won eight of 10 games, and the basketball team finished with a 37-5 record. 
Football players at Milford Academy typically spend one semester at the school, taking classes and playing against other teams before heading off to college. Because their season crosses both semesters, basketball players spend a full academic year in school. Football players pay $13,500 for room, board and tuition, while basketball players pay $19,500. 
Milford Academy students spend classroom time completing any missing core course requirements to become eligible for the N.C.A.A.. Those requirements include four years of English, two years of mathematics, two years of science, two years of social studies, two additional core units and one additional year of English, math or science. Students also work to meet the minimum standardized test requirements of a total SAT score of 820 or a total ACT score of 68.
During the current school year, Milford Academy's football and basketball players won $2.5 million in athletic scholarships to colleges and universities, including Syracuse, Brown, Purdue, Tulane, Vanderbilt and Boston College, said William Chaplick, the Milford Academy football coach who replaced Mr. Ciaburri as the school's chief administrator.
There are 55 football players and 15 basketball players committed to attending Milford Academy in the fall, said Mr. Chaplick. His goal is to recruit 10 to 15 more football players for the coming year.
"Nobody comes to Milford Academy if they did what they were supposed to do in high school," Mr. Chaplick said. "The glue that brings them together is they all had problems. There's some reason they're here." 
In some cases, the students need to mature both academically and athletically. Instead of using two years of N.C.A.A. eligibility at a junior college, they can attend Milford Academy and still play for up to four years in college. 
"It gave me a year to get physically stronger, which a lot of coaches who were recruiting me told me," said Kason Mims, a basketball player who graduated from Christ the King High School in Queens, N.Y., (the same school attended by University of Connecticut star Sue Bird) before enrolling at Milford Academy for a year. Now a sophomore guard for Quinnipiac University, which played for the Northeast Conference championship this year, he improved his SAT scores while in Milford and is on schedule to graduate with a degree in mass communications.
Milford Academy's football players have gone on to great success, according to the school's promotional materials. During the last year, 13 former Falcons appeared in college bowl games. Nine graduates played in the National Football League last year, including the defensive end Frank Ferrara of the New York Giants. Those successes continue to draw athletes like the linebacker Cleophus Harbison of Nashville to Milford. Scheduled to go to Hofstra University to play football, he said Milford Academy had helped him to focus on his studies; something he admits he did not do in high school.
"I went to school every day, but I just wasn't paying attention," Mr. Harbison said. "It's one-on-one here. It's a chance to start over."

HEADLINE: Truckers Warn State On Fees 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
AS the state treasurer continues to nibble around the edges of the state budget, the trucking companies in New Jersey are getting indigestion.
 What had Gail Toth, executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, so riled last week was a plan for an incremental increase in truck registration fees, among other things, causing truckers to warn that the added cost could hurt businesses still reeling from last year's economic downturn. 
 "We recognize that we are dealing with a budget deficit, but the trucking industry has been hit so severely from several different angles," said Ms. Toth, whose organization represents about 1,000 trucking companies that operate in New Jersey. 
The changes being proposed by John E. McCormac, the state treasurer and one of the people who has Governor McGreevey's ear as the state wrestles with a $5.3 billion deficit, would add another cost for companies already contending with sharp increases in insurance rates and fuel costs.
The state plans to increase the annual registration fee for big trucks to an average of $1,260 from the current rate of $1,100, Ms. Toth said. The increase might not seem like much, but Ms. Toth said most trucking firms were operating on razor-thin profit margins and were ill-positioned to accept any extra costs.
Matthew Wright, chief executive of Apgar Bros. Inc., a midsized trucking company in Bound Brook, said businesses like his had been hit with steep increases in insurance premiums in the last year.
The increase in registration fees, Mr. Wright said, "would be one more brick on the pile."
"The trucking industry is a tough business, and it is especially tough now," said Mr. Wright, whose 90 tractors carry construction material throughout the state. "In the last 24 months, we have absorbed some astronomical fuel hikes and we have absorbed some enormous toll increases from the Port Authority."
Martin M. Robins, director of the Transportation Policy Institute at the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, agreed that business had been tough for truckersin the last year.
"There has been a serious cost squeeze in the industry relating to insurance and fuel," Mr Robins said.
He said that the cargo industry -- including trucking and warehouse companies -- had become a crucial part of the state's economy and that New Jersey's ports and rail yards, coupled with the state's proximity to New York, had made the state a major "distribution and logistics center for the Northeast and the entire country."
For their part, state budget officials say they are trying to raise money to make up the budget gap by raising fees in areas that can bear the costs. 
"The rationale is that heavy damage to New Jersey roadways are attributable to heavy trucks," said Tom Vincz, a spokesman for the Treasury Department. "This is a way to offset costs of road upkeep and maintenance."
Mr. Vincz said that even with an increase, the registration fee would still be lower than in most surrounding states. The average fee for trucks in Pennsylvania trucks is $1,867 and in Delaware it is $1,280. New York State is slightly lower, at $1,198.
"Obviously, the increase would raise New Jersey's average as well, but we are still in competitive status with neighboring states," he said.
Trucking companies are also concerned about proposals to change the corporate tax to reflect total sales -- known as gross receipts -- rather than profits. Because trucking companies operate high-volume, low-profit businesses, they fear that the change could pose a serious problem.
"We are making two cents on the dollar," said Ms. Toth. "If we were taxed on gross receipts we would be out of business."
Mr. Vincz said the treasury department was aware that a gross receipts tax could hurt low-profit businesses and that Mr. McCormac was trying to tailor the proposal "in a way that recognizes the economic realities of narrow-margin, high-volume companies such as retailers and supermarkets."
Still, truckers insisted that the immediate costs would be borne by the freight haulers and warehouse companies that operate in New Jersey, but that in the long run they would be passed along to consumers.
"We are all going to be paying for it at the cash register," Ms. Toth said.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Apartment Building at 101 West End Ave.; 
A REIT Buys In Manhattan

 BODY:
The twin-towered 506-apartment building at 101 West End Avenue has been purchased by the Archstone-Smith real estate investment trust in what the purchaser said was the first acquisition of a Manhattan residential building by a REIT. The Denver-based REIT announced last week that it had bought the building, completed in May 2000, between 64th and 65th Streets, from Tishman Speyer Properties of Manhattan for $209 million. 
 Monthly rents for the studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments range from $2,350 to $8,590 a month, according to Archstone-Smith. 
 Although the Manhattan market is difficult to penetrate, said R. Scot Sellers, the REIT's chief executive, New York City has a high proportion of renters "due to extremely high housing costs, which makes the market even more attractive to apartment owners." 
Although such REIT's as AvalonBay Communities and Post Properties have built in New York in recent years, investment by REIT's in the city remains unusual. "The reason we do not see more residential REIT's in New York," said Michael Schill, director of the Furman Center of Real Estate and Urban Policy at N.Y.U., "is because our apartments tend to be either family owned or owned for the long haul as investments, not as a commodity to be bought and sold in response to market opportunities."

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
THIS is the renaissance?
 Pockmarked row houses. Sneering drug dealers. Trash that seems to sit by the curb for who knows how long. Then there was the matter of the people who chose to use the vacant lot next to H. David Archer's house as a bathroom. 
 "It was really bad," said Mr. Archer, 42, recalling the day four years ago when he moved to a beleaguered stretch of this city's South Ward. "But I heard -- not saw, heard -- so much about the renaissance, that Newark is on its way back up, that I said I can kind of suffer through whatever until it gets better. But it didn't get better."
This is the renaissance. A world-class performing arts center. A new minor-league baseball stadium, long-overdue downtown improvements and the sense that Ike Thomas's beloved city is moving away from being the punch line of bad jokes about urban America. 
"People who've just come here don't see what it was; they just see what it is now," said Mr. Thomas, 70, a wily veteran of the ward politics and grass-roots skirmishes of another time. "People don't see the progress we've made, they don't see how far we've come."
The question of how far Newark has come is at the heart of the most spirited mayoral race here in decades: the down-to-the-wire contest between the four-term incumbent, Mayor Sharpe James, and the thirtysomething challenger, City Councilman Cory Booker. In short, it is the classic political paradigm of the old guard versus the new wave.
Still, in this campaign, political experts say, there is a significant difference. The outcome of the nonpartisan election on May 14 hinges, of course, on how voters view the candidates when it comes to matters of money, education, personal style and home address. But this race -- between two black men whose styles both take up a lot of space -- will just as likely turn on the prickly dynamics of intraracial politics.
And amid -- or despite -- the swirl of charges being unleashed by the two camps, a telling glimpse is emerging of the evolution of black political power and the changing face of a Newark, a city of 274,000 residents that is about 53 percent black.
To be sure, the ethnic and generational issues that have emerged are not entirely new. A similar scenario unfolded in 1994 in the unsuccessful effort by Adam Clayton Powell 4th to unseat Representative Charles B. Rangel, more than 30 years his senior. And more recently in Detroit, 31-year-old Kwame Kilpatrick defeated Gill Hill, 69, in last year's election. Still, the personalities here bring their own sharp differences to the table.
There is Mr. James, 66, a product of the segregated South who became a political power broker in his adopted city amid the tumult of a new and in many ways overwhelming era for poor blacks trying to survive in a burned-out, depopulated and cash-starved Newark. And there is Mr. Booker, who at 32 -- with a Bergen County background, Ivy League pedigree and a campaign well financed by blacks and whites from within Newark and outside the state -- represents the fulfillment of much that Mr. James's generation fought for.
"What we have here is an old scenario that has played out over the last century in ethnic politics," said Clement A. Price, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Newark who is a longtime observer of city politics. "But there is an interesting twist to it. In many ways, it's the incumbent versus the fair-haired boy, writ black, if you will."
And it is rife with the complexities of an internal ethnic dynamic that scholars say both candidates have tried to exploit.
Mayor James, a foot soldier in Newark's civil rights movement, is very much a product of the ethnic-based politics of his era. "Sharpe James grew up in a time defined by racial tension," Professor Price said. "He came up in an era when ethnic politics pervaded Newark politics, which means that Sharpe James and his generation cohorts speak directly and almost exclusively to the black community."
For his part, Mr. Booker was reared in the aftermath of the early civil rights struggle -- the beneficiary of a generation that took to heart Dr. King's exhortation to judge people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin -- largely forsaking the old African-American guard and instead building a broad base of multiracial support.
"He's taking advantage of the new realities of Newark," Professor Price said. "There's less emphasis on race, greater reliance on government, less reliance on black political power, more reliance on cobbling together a coalition of the disgruntled."
Considering this city's shifting demographics, such a strategy does not seem unwise on its face. Although Newark, like most large, old industrial cities, saw an overall decline in population in the 1990's, figures from the 2000 Census show that the most drastic gains were among those who described themselves as Hispanic or some other race. However, it is not clear whether this will help Mr. Booker.
In recent years, Latino voters have tended the follow the lead of established community leaders, and so far, most of them are backing Mr. James.
If recent census trends are any indication, their numbers may continue to grow. Indeed, residents here who described themselves as Hispanic rose from just over a quarter of the city's population in 1990 to nearly a third in 2000. At the same time, the percentage of blacks who live in Newark decreased by about 5 percentage points. While the city's political power structure is still overwhelmingly black, observers question how much the old ethnic political rules will apply in an evolving Newark.
"This election will see to what extent the multiplicity of ethnicities in Newark respond to a Sharpe James, who still stands largely as a black leader, versus a Cory Booker, who speaks to a multiracial completion of the renaissance in Newark," Professor Price said.

Waiting for More Changes
Seeing that renaissance come to fruition is not lost on residents like Mr. Archer, who has owned a house in the Weequahic section of the South Ward for four years. He views the election as pivotal in attracting and keeping new residents.
"Newark is losing good people because of all this nonsense we've had all these years," said Mr. Archer, who with his wife, Nicole, was drawn here from nearby Belleville because of its reasonable housing prices. Besides, he remembers the real estate agent telling him that he would be living only a few blocks from the mayor.
Mr. Archer, an account administrator for a medical device company, was impressed with the changes he saw in downtown Newark, and he foresaw the promise of more progress in the South Ward. He jumped at the chance to be part of a resurgent Newark, and waited patiently during those first couple of years for change.
He is still waiting -- although no longer so patiently. "It's still a slum," he said, the sadness and regret in his voice tinged with the soft lilt of his native Barbados. "Any way you describe that, I live in a slum. I live as a prisoner in my own home. And it's just not fair to us."
Mr. Archer could not care less about the questions of race and class that the campaign has unleashed. He just wants to be able to walk to the corner store without being hassled by drug dealers.
It would be bad enough if it were just the dealers. Or the car thieves who kept breaking into a neighbor's Nissan Maxima, pushing up her insurance premiums and pushing her off the block. Or the lack of adequate trash pickup. Or what he considers slow response times by the police.
Most galling, however, are the small, everyday upheavals in Mr. Archer's quality of life -- like the people who took to using an overgrown lot next door as their own open-air outhouse.
"There were people defecating in that lot," Mr. Archer said. "It was disgusting."
After years of complaining, Mr. Archer went to Home Depot, picked up a few lawn and cleaning supplies and quietly went about reclaiming the lot. "I just bought a sickle and went to work," Mr. Archer said."
He sees Mr. Booker as a like-minded agent of change, and was so moved by the candidate that he has been a campaign volunteer for several weeks. Mr. Archer's participation in the campaign is all the more striking because as a non-citizen, he is not allowed to vote.
"That's part of the reason I'm working so hard," said Mr. Archer, who explained that he was motivated to begin filing citizenship papers by Mr. Booker's campaign. For now, his wife carries political conviction enough for both of them to the ballot box.
"I firmly believe Cory Booker will make serious changes," Mr. Archer said. "He is young, he is sharp, he is aggressive."
And if he does not follow through? "I'll be out in the streets handing out fliers for another guy," Mr. Archer said.
For now, the question remains: Will Mr. Booker's perceived message -- and his courting of a variegated constituency -- be viewed as an attempt to distance himself from black Newark?
By his own estimate, Mr. Booker has raised about half of his $3 million campaign war chest -- almost unheard of in Newark politics -- from far away as Arkansas and California. He has been praised by the likes of George F. Will and Barbra Streisand. The Economist, a weekly British magazine read widely by this country's intelligentsia, called him "Al Gore with personality."
If nothing else, the councilman's media-friendly image and high-profile supporters may prove especially beneficial in a city where residents still seem stung about having been the butt of jokes by late-night talk show hosts 20 years ago.
"This may really work to Booker's favor," said David Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University. "If voters see Booker as something of a celebrity and being supported by social notables, they might say, 'This guy is a big-time player and that's what Newark needs.' "
Just as easily, however, Mr. Booker's affiliation with those outside Newark -- especially white supporters -- may backfire when black voters head to the polls.
"Some people see him as a tool of outside influence, and Sharpe James has played that card," Professor Price said. "James is trying to say that Cory Booker is trying to take advantage of the hard work he and his generation have done."
As a product of suburban Bergen County, Mr. Booker also has to win over those residents here who are dubious about how much he can identify with the black experience in urban America, a world of poverty, crime, drugs and untreated disease.
"As black people, we have our own notions of racial authenticity," said Professor Price. "Cory Booker, because he has pedigree, because he came from the suburbs and because he's generating white support, he's being portrayed as if not nonblack, he's unblack."
That message, the professor said, might even be not so subtly reflected in campaign advertisements -- and even in Mr. James's slogan, in which the mayor proclaims that he is "The Real Deal."
Perhaps sensitive to his suburban background and elite education, Mr. Booker has made several well-publicized, attempts to interact with residents at ground level since he arrived on the city's political scene six years ago. He has staged hunger strikes for increased police patrols, lived in a trailer on some of the city's most notorious street corners and now lives at Brick Towers, a public housing development.
While seen as an example of Mr. Booker's common touch by those outside the city, the moves have drawn a mixed reaction from Newark residents and are viewed alternately as either well-intentioned gestures by the councilman or contrived media stunts.

Some Say Booker Must Wait
Mr. Thomas, the 74-year-old longtime ward politician, chooses the latter. He has worked in the trenches of the city's civil rights movement with the likes of Kenneth Gibson and a gap-toothed, fast-talking community organizer from the South Ward, by way of Florida, named Sharpe James.
Mr. Thomas's generation, using a combination of sheer will, high energy and personal charisma, roused a sometimes passive electorate and built the foundation for today's black political power structure.
It was leaders like Mr. Gibson and Mr. James who aggressively fought the white establishment and seized the city's political reins when whites fled the city after the searing riots of 1967. After watching Mr. Gibson become Newark's first black mayor in 1970 and Mr. James ascend to the same post 16 years later, Mr. Thomas enjoyed a political career with his own share of firsts -- first black to lead the parking authority, first black to help lead a local sewer commission. Indeed, today he himself is something of an eminence gris among the city's political establishment.
Yes, Mr. Thomas concedes, Mr. Booker is in many ways the political progeny of the movement he and his peers helped begin. And, yes, he said, someday, somewhere, Mr. Booker may make a fine civic leader.
But, Mr. Thomas said, that day is not now and that place is not Newark. Mr. Thomas said that he did not support Mr. Booker because he feared that the councilman was an opportunist. Like many voters, Mr. Thomas was concerned that if elected, Mr. Booker would look to make his political mark in Newark before moving on to greater heights.
Besides that, Mr. Thomas said, Mr. Booker simply has not put enough time into working in the modern-day political trenches that the Kenneth Gibsons toiled in during the 1960's.
"If it was someone who has gone through some of the trials we've had over the years, I would be supportive of them," Mr. Thomas said. "But he hasn't paid his dues."
He is also suspicious of the intense support that Mr. Booker has drawn from whites, as well as those outside the city.
"When you make an investment," Mr. Thomas said, "you want a return on that investment. And if Caucasians can come up with these kinds of funds to support the campaign, they're going to come look for a return on that investment."
What might that return be? Gentrification of the city that displaces longtime residents after a long struggle to regain respectability? The installation of a more Republican agenda in City Hall? A reversal of the political gains blacks have made over the past 30 years?
Mr. Thomas is not sure, but he is certain that a Mayor Booker would not auger well for residents here. "People are suspicious that he doesn't have the best interests, not only of the black community, but of the full constituency at heart," Mr. Thomas said.
And while he acknowledges that there is still much more to be done, and that there are pockets of the city where urban ills persist, Mr. Thomas believes that the rebirth of Newark is real.
"And a lot of that starts with Sharpe James," he said.

Newark's Rebound Is Questioned
To be sure, Mayor James has to overcome his own chorus of skeptics. The 32-year veteran of local politics must convince voters that he has not become the kind of complacent figurehead of the political establishment that he railed against as a community activist.
Many voters here question the viability of the city's rebound and wonder whether the outlying neighborhoods will become as vibrant as the reborn downtown. Mr. Booker has emphasized "a renaissance for the rest of us" in his campaign and argues that Mr. James should have moved the city further during his 16 years in office.
The mayor's critics point out that many residents remain mired in stunning poverty, that not enough progress has been made reducing crime and that problems with the city's woeful public schools are as intractable as ever.
Not only that, but Mr. James is also seen by many here as the gloved hand turning the wheel of this city's vast political machine, which has been working double time to try to turn back the most serious threat to the city's entrenched powers in a generation.
And all that does not begin to address the accusations leveled at Mr. James by Mr. Booker -- that the mayor's supporters have been behind a spate of pre-election dirty tricks: campaign office break-ins, the mass removal of pro-Booker posters -- charges the mayor vehemently denies.
Then there was the dust-up over the Sights social club, which was closed in March for what the police said was promoting prostitution. An aide to Mr. Booker who was waiting outside the club had been singled out in a police department press release, even though he had not been arrested or charged.
Mayor James noted that he would have fired any aide who engaged in similar conduct, only to face statements by the club's manager that the mayor had himself been to the club twice. After initially refusing to say whether he had visited to the club, the mayor acknowledged that he had been there during a police raid, acting as "the closing-down official, observing wrongdoing and closing down."
To Wil R. Sherman, there is something more than a little familiar about the Newark mayor's race, 2002 edition.
"Newark is on its way back, Newark is on its way back," Mr. Sherman, a 70-year-old South Ward resident, said recently. "I've been hearing the same thing every four years. When is it going to get back?"
With the election little more than a week away, Mr. Sherman has not decided for whom he's going to vote.
His neighbors are fond of extolling the pros and cons of each candidate, he said.
Of Mr. Booker, Mr. Sherman said: "He's good. A lot of people say, 'Let's give it to the young man and see what he can do.' "
Of Mr. James, Mr. Sherman said: "What James has going for him is that he has been in this mess. People know what he's about."
But still, Mr. Sherman said, his question remains unanswered: When is Newark going to get back?
"I honestly think the best man for the city hasn't run yet," Mr. Sherman said. "Either that, or he hasn't been born."

The Family Business

BYLINE:  By WENDY GINSBERG 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
STANDING in front of a heap of reporters, Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman didn't say a word.
 Instead, she simply stood behind various department commissioners who were detailing Governor McGreevey's new early retirement program as her eyes searched the room. 
 Her glance locked with those of people she recognized, and with innate political know-how she would offer an earnest smile and mouth, "Hi." It was enough to make the recipients of the intimate, low-key greeting feel a little more important than the person standing next to them.
Since her childhood, the 57-year-old Ms. Watson Coleman has been steeped in New Jersey's haphazard political culture. Her father, Assemblyman John S. Watson, a former six-term lawmaker, would lead political discussions at the dinner table. 
Earlier this year, Ms. Watson Coleman went on to try to fill her father's shoes -- and then some -- when she was selected by Democratic colleagues to head the Assembly Budget Committee and then take the reins of the State Democratic Committee.
"It was a natural evolution for me," Ms. Watson Coleman said. "I'm used to being a woman in a male-dominated world."
As head of the Democratic Committee, Ms. Watson Coleman is charged with increasing interest in the Democratic Party, and with finding people to contribute time and money. She is especially interested in attracting young people, minority members and women.
"I'm like the cheerleader for the Democrats," Ms. Watson Coleman said. "I have to be the most vociferous, the most active and the loudest in the party. It's my job to keep the party healthy and to reach out to new communities."
A Ewing resident, Ms. Watson Coleman has represented the 15th District in South Jersey since 1998. Born in Camden, she has lived in Moorestown, Trenton, East Orange, Orange, Newark and Nutley.
She began public service in 1966 with the Department of Public Safety's division of civil rights. In 1974, she started the transportation department's office of civil rights. Later she served as an assistant commissioner of community affairs under Gov. James Florio.
When Shirley K. Turner, an assemblywoman at the time, decided to run for State Senate, Ms. Watson Coleman ran to replace her.
During her years as an assemblywoman, Ms. Watson Coleman has pushed to extend urban enterprise zones and lower the sales tax in inner cities to rejuvenate struggling local economies.
"Bonnie cut her eyeteeth in politics," said Ms. Turner, who still holds the Senate seat from the 15th District. "Her father was a pioneer and a trailblazer. She's following in his footsteps."
While Ms. Watson Coleman's public career was on the ascendancy, however, her private life was suffering.
A first marriage to Jim Carter in 1972 -- they had a son -- ended in divorce in the early 1980's. She later married William Coleman, who had two sons from a previous marriage, in 1995. 
Then last November, two of Ms. Watson Coleman's sons -- William Carter-Watson, 21, and Jared C. Coleman, 19 -- pleaded guilty to first-degree armed robbery in the heist of a Kids "R" Us clothing store in the Mercer Mall last March, and now face up to seven years in prison.
"It's tough to learn such a lesson," said Ms. Watson Coleman, who has one other son, as her eyes filled with tears. 
Ms. Watson Coleman spent much of last year campaigning for Mr. McGreevey, who played a crucial role in her current appointments.
"Assemblywoman Watson Coleman has worked assiduously to provide clear direction for the party," Mr. McGreevey said in an interview. "She possesses a strong understanding of the legislative process and the issues of concern for New Jersey families."
Although the Democrats are currently enjoying their reign in Trenton, the Republican State Committee chairman, State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., said heading up any party is a lot of responsibility.
"Assemblywoman Watson Coleman is a good choice for that position," Mr. Kyrillos said. "But with success comes a lot of responsibility and expectation."
During her two-year term, which Ms. Watson Coleman began in February, she said, she hopes to convene discussions and local meetings as well as reach out on the Internet.
"At the end of my term I want there to be a demonstrable difference from when I began," Ms. Watson Coleman said. "I want people to see that I brought more people from more communities into active support of the party."
Ms. Watson Coleman is of average height, and her close-cropped haircut draws focus on the full cheeks that envelop her broad smile. It is rare when she is not wearing a fashionable business suit.
Her demeanor remains relaxed until she talks about the Democratic Party. Then she leans forward on her chair, talking intently of ways to increase the party's influence. It is a sample of what her brother noticed when he was her partner in a childhood card game called bid whist, which resembles bridge.
"She's very competitive," said her brother, Bill Watson. "You need to have a good relationship with your partner in that game, and, boy, can she intimidate her partner if they make the wrong move."
Despite her intensity, it was a shock when she told the family she wanted to run for the State Assembly.
"We all understood clearly from my father what you had to give up with a public life," her brother said. "It was a family decision for her to run. We knew she'd have to give up a lot of privacy."
Ms. Watson Coleman was not always so sure about entering public life.
"My father always wanted one of the four of us to go into politics," she said. "And I was the one who traveled with him and wrote his speeches when he was a legislator."
To be sure, she and her brothers were already serving the public. One brother is an administrator of the Green Acres program for the state Department of Environmental Protection, and another just moved from New Jersey Transit to head community relations for the transportation department.
A third brother, Bill Watson, three years younger than his sister, is director of the John S. Watson Institute for Public Policy at Edison State College. It was named for their father, who died in 1996 at age 72.
Despite her apprehension, Ms. Watson Coleman began campaigning in 1997, with her brother Bill as a top adviser. She won handily in a year when every incumbent remained in office and Republicans maintained the majority in both houses.
The tide turned last November when Jim McGreevey was elected governor. Ms. Watson Coleman, who had aggressively campaigned on Mr. McGreevey's behalf, had her named tossed about for various high-level positions, including secretary of state. By February, she was selected to head the New Jersey Democratic State Committee.
She already knew the neighborhood. After all, she met her current husband, William Watson, on the sidewalk in front of the State House at a traveling exhibition on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
She also maintains other offices on West State Street -- the one from which she heads the state committee, her Assembly office and her office for the Budget Committee.
So while she will always to some extent be linked to Trenton, her new title has forced her to focus beyond the capital.
"She's a tireless worker and very knowledgable about New Jersey," said the Assembly speaker, Albio Sires. "She is someone that can cross any line, and make people feel like they want to be in the Democratic Party."
Ms. Watson Coleman's legacy will rest on whether Mr. Sires is right.

HEADLINE: DOWN THE SHORE; 
Not the Hamptons

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

 BODY:
IT has been a busy spring for Toby Fontaine.
 Despite the economic fluctuations of the past year, business has been brisk at her Bayberry Inn in Cape May. 
 And since Sept. 11, many of her newer customers have been escaping from a fall and winter of worry in New York and northern North Jersey.
"From what they tell me, it's because it is such a fight to get to the Hamptons," said Ms. Fontaine. "They say it's not as accessible. The traffic is bad. And they just find it friendlier here in South Jersey." 
Chatter among the Abercrombie set has it that the Hamptons is becoming so in that it's out, though most would be hard-pressed to find the statistics to back up that assertion. Still it is clear from conversations with real estate brokers and hotel and motel operators that there is movement in that direction.
"Price may be one thing, sure, but I think even rich people are getting tired of having to do the scene," said Jackie Kennedy, the rental manager at Diane Turton Realty in Spring Lake. "It's a pressure scene. You can't go out without getting dressed up.
Given the chance, Ms. Kennedy was only too happy to go on: "It's certainly gotten more expensive here, but the scene isn't like that. I mean, you don't dress up to go to Seaside Heights, certainly, or even Bay Head. And I think that is what a lot of people who used to go to the Hamptons are finding more comfortable here."
In Beach Haven, Pat Sepanak, the owner of Coldwell Banker Sand Dollar Real Estate, said that she too had noticed more and more New York license plates on Long Beach Island about three summers ago. This spring, however, she said that the calls and drop-ins had been coming from people who lived even farther away.
"Southern Connecticut, would you believe it?" said Ms. Sepanak. "That had never been a market for us before. You talk to these people and they say it's more of a hassle for them to go to the Hamptons than to cut down to the Garden State Parkway and come here."
"Then, she added, "those Connecticut people find they like the Jersey Shore better."
Ms. Sepanak put it this way.
"For one thing, it's beachier here, if you can use that term," she said, noting that no place on Long Beach Island, or most Jersey Shore communities, is more than a long walk to the beach -- forget about the considerable trek from the boardwalk to the surf in Wildwood. "At many places on Long Island, where the Hamptons are located, it is necessary to drive even from the tonier houses to the beach. If you have kids, you end up liking the idea that you can walk to the ocean."
But for every tale about a bigger and bigger and bigger crowd converging on the Jersey Shore, there are others to splash cold water on the theory.
For instance, Rich Donnelly, the owner of Donnelly Real Estate in Bay Head, said that he had not noticed high-end buyers changing their Hamptons view for Bay Head or Mantoloking.
"They are used to sprawling estates, and we just don't have that here, Mr. Donnelly said. "We may have things that rent for $40,000 or $50,000 a month, but they are just nice big houses on the beach, not many acres."
For her part, Ms. Kennedy of Spring Lake concurred.
"I get guys calling demanding, 'I make $4 million a year and I want this and that,' " she said in a mock New York accent. "But we don't have swimming pools and tennis courts and lots and lots of lawn. It's a different lifestyle. On the other hand, I think more and more people from New York are finding their way down here."
Certainly, New York money, which real estate agents say started making its way to the Jersey Shore more and more late 1990's, is reflected in prices all along the 127-mile coastline. In Stone Harbor, for instance, there were only two sales of more than $700,000 in 1995. During the past 18 months, however, the median sale in the town that shares a seven-mile island with Avalon -- usually the summer hangout of wealthy vacationers from Montgomery County outside Philadelphia -- is $807,500.
"Even now, though, it is far less expensive down here than in northern New Jersey and less expensive there than in the Hamptons," said Mark Grimes of Ocean City Realty, a few miles north of Stone Harbor. "I also think New Yorkers have trickled in because they can be both at a family resort and near Atlantic City. It is a different attraction than the Hamptons, but they seem to like the variety."
Another skeptic is Michele Caprio, the innkeeper at Conovers Bay Head Inn.
"If you are from Manhattan, you probably like the scene at the Hamptons and you will drive there no matter what," said Ms. Caprio. "The Jersey Shore isn't going to do it for you. I lived in Manhattan for 10 years and those people seem to want that action. But then, if you live on Staten Island, say, maybe this is more your scene. I like it, but it would be an odd change for people who love it out there to come to our little hamlet."
Still, Ms. Sepanak sees other evidence of the Hamptons coming to Long Beach Island -- particularly Loveladies and Harvey Cedars.
"There are certainly more fancy restaurants," she said. "And I do see a bit more dressing up than I used to. That has to be a New York influence."
For their part, Philadelphians and South Jerseyans are trying to hold on to what they believe is rightly theirs.
"There are still cheese steaks and miniature golf here," she said. "We convert those people, and they end up liking those things, too."

IT has been so long since most New Yorkers have had to worry about inflation that the whole idea seems kind of retro, even quaint. After all, the last time inflation was a really big deal, Americans were eating quiche in fern bars, watching "Dallas" on network television, and being driven demented by "The Pina Colada Song."
 Not only is inflation no longer in the double digits, as it was in the late 1970's, it hasn't topped 4 percent in more than a decade. And in the last 12 months, the consumer price index has edged up just 1.5 percent. 
 So why are some economists so focused on inflation right now? There are a couple of reasons. Most of them have to do with events occurring far away, but at least one is a strictly local concern.
First of all, Alan Greenspan always worries about inflation, and so would you if you were the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Inflation was the economic scourge of the 1970's (it zoomed from about 6 percent in 1970 to more than 14 percent in early 1980).
The Fed finally managed to get inflation under control by raising interest rates, but not without provoking two recessions. 
Right now, the United States economy appears (most of the time) to be emerging from a recession, though you wouldn't know it in New York City. Increasing economic activity can bring price pressures and inflation. 
If national inflation continues to rise as fast as it did in the first three months of 2002, the consumer price index will increase by 3 percent this year, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which adjusts the data for seasonal factors. That may not sound like much, but it is almost twice the 1.6 percent increase in all of 2001.
Nationally, the biggest problem today is the same one that plagued the 1970's: high energy prices. (Of course, you're too young to remember gas lines, but you've seen pictures, right?) 
After falling sharply last year, oil prices shot up in March and have remained high; if petroleum costs keep rising at the same speed, they will be up 50 percent by the end of the year.
Of course, energy prices are volatile, and despite the recent run-up, they are still down more than 10 percent compared to this time last year. But with the continuing crisis in the Middle East, economists are not alone in worrying that there could be a significant spike in oil prices, which could trip up the national economic rebound.
The good news, for those who live in and around New York City, is that this area tends to fare relatively well in an energy crisis because of the extensive public transportation system, said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Indeed, during the late 1970's, the inflation rate for this area -- New York City and its suburbs, Long Island and northern New Jersey -- was about 2 percentage points lower than the national average.
But right now, the local inflation rate is actually a percentage point higher than the national average, noted Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist of The New York Stat, a newsletter about the regional economy. In what she calls "a disturbing trend," the local consumer price index has suddenly started climbing faster than the national index, after two years of lower increases. 
So while the national rate was 1.5 percent in the 12 months ending in March, the local rate was 2.5 percent.
The culprit appears to be housing costs, especially for people who own their own homes. It's hard to know how much to make of this, because federal inflation watchers have an odd way of measuring the costs of home ownership: they take a survey and ask people how much they could get if they rented out their homes.
In real life, in New York City, unregulated rents have been falling, not rising. And while housing prices here are astronomical, they have not been rising as fast as in, say, Modesto, Calif., according to a recent government study.
If economists are concerned about the sudden uptick in local inflation, it's mostly because they fear it will discourage people and businesses from moving here. But for locals who already own their own places, it may actually be reassuring to think that housing values are still rising, despite everything.
"We really don't want to get as far out of line with the rest of the country as we did in the 1980's," said Rae Rosen, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "But all things being equal, it's nice if you live here."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
In Long Run, Residential Real Estate May Beat Stocks

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR all our diversity, most American investors share a common financial religion. We believe in stocks for the long run. We've taken to heart historical data showing that, over a great many years, stocks outperform other investments and beat inflation by several percentage points.
 But in investing, heresy can also pay, and I think that residential real estate will pay best in the next decade or two. Sure, home values have risen considerably, but they've done so for reasons that will continue to power prices upward for years. Eventually, home prices may fall, but America is unlikely to produce enough housing to meet all the demand. Housing continues to be tax-advantaged, and unlike stocks it can be safely leveraged with the cheapest possible capital, thanks to low mortgage rates. Housing markets, moreover, are much less efficient than the stock market, so buyers can probably get good deals if they try. 
 Perhaps the biggest factor that will drive housing prices upward is immigration. The influx of immigrants is not likely to be stopped anytime soon because there are too many reasons for it to continue, including low native birth rates, the aging of the population and the lobbying of businesses hungry for cheap and technically trained labor. In the decades ahead, immigrants will account for most of the population growth and they will drive up demand for housing. Albert Saiz, an immigrant from Spain who just received a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, has examined the effects of immigrants on rental housing in the United States. His unpublished study found that for each 1 percent of a city's population that consists of newly arrived immigrants, rents can be expected to rise 1.5 percent.
Another factor will be the anti-sprawl backlash that limits residential development. Developers are running into increasing resistance in communities around the country, often in the form of zoning laws requiring large lot sizes, which reduce the number of new homes it is possible to build. That keeps existing homes expensive.
There is every sign that our love of second homes will persist and even deepen. Second-home sales have soared in recent years, with an estimated 415,000 homes sold in 2000, up from 296,000 in 1995. Lenders have dropped the more onerous requirements they once imposed on buyers in this category. People with expensive first homes have the equity to buy a second home, and for many Americans, retirement beckons. But many of the places they will want to retire to are either fully developed or increasingly subject to building restrictions (that is why they're still so nice, after all). In desirable coastal communities like Cape Cod, higher prices are the only possible outcome. Experience so far in Florida and Colorado, two popular states for affluent retirees, bears out this prediction. I would expect a similar phenomenon in college communities like Charlottesville, Va., which are attractive to affluent retirees.
Dennis R. Capozza, a finance professor at the University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor, said the relationship of rents to prices in a community can tell you a lot about whether to anticipate rising home prices. He says a low rent-to-price ratio implies appreciation ahead, whereas a high ratio of rents to prices would mean a better income investment. Since rising land values account for most or all of the capital gain on a residential property, single-family houses appreciate most. Condos appreciate less but offer the best income payout.
This sort of thing matters because taxes are a big reason for investing in residential real estate. For starters, the government lets you deduct from your income the interest on up to $1 million in mortgage debt every year on two homes for your own use. Buy an income property and everything associated with it is deductible, including an annual depreciation charge. 
There are downsides. Being a landlord is a pain, and since land is the main thing that appreciates, you might consider buying vacant lots if you don't mind forgoing the income and tying up your capital. Nor is real estate all that liquid, although technology will eventually help streamline the medieval paperwork associated with buying and selling. If it all seems like too much trouble, you can always buy real estate on Wall Street. People do it every day by buying stock in a real estate investment trust.

HEADLINE: A Doctor's Last Resort 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Patients, Not Numbers," by Marc Siegel (Op-Ed, May 1): 
 It's insulting to suggest that physicians who restrict Medicare patients are betraying the ideals of their profession. 
Many do so as a last resort and after much agonizing so they can keep their medical practices economically viable. 
 Medicare reimbursement could ultimately be cut by almost 20 percent over four years. It is naive to believe that physicians can endure such cuts and keep up with rising costs for employee wages and benefits, office overhead, medical equipment and liability premiums.
It is time to stop faulting the physicians and instead join the American Medical Association in urging Congress and the Bush administration to stop the excessive Medicare payment cuts before patient access to care deteriorates further.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH; 
Gary L. Bergstrom and Brian Wolahan

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
EMERGING markets might have been more accurately called "submerging markets" over the last eight years or so, say Gary L. Bergstrom and Brian Wolahan, the managers of the $41 million UAM Acadian Emerging Markets Portfolio.
 In the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained an average 11 percent annually from 1994 to 2001, while the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Free index fell an average 6.8 percent each year, Mr. Bergstrom said. 
 But they are compelling investments today, the managers said. 
First, emerging markets are cheap by just about any measure, Mr. Bergstrom said. According to the managers' calculations, as of April 30, the S.& P. 500 companies traded for 20.7 times estimated 2002 earnings compared with 14.1 times for companies in the emerging markets index. The price-to-book multiple for United States companies was 3.3 compared with 1.6 for emerging markets companies, they said.
Furthermore, emerging markets tend to rise faster than developed markets during periods of economic growth, Mr. Wolahan said, adding, "We do think that in the next year or two, there will be a pickup in global economic growth."
The fund returned 6.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 2.1 percent for diversified emerging markets funds, according to Morningstar Inc. It returned 27 percent in the 12 months through Thursday versus 8.7 percent for its group, Morningstar said.
Mr. Bergstrom, 61, and Mr. Wolahan, 43, work for Acadian Asset Management, the fund's adviser. Acadian, an affiliate of Old Mutual, a financial services group in Britain, also manages about $2.5 billion, mostly for institutions. The fund's $100,000 minimum investment is reduced to $2,500 for shares purchased through the Charles Schwab, Fidelity and TD Waterhouse mutual fund marketplaces.
Investing in emerging markets is inherently risky: macroeconomic and accounting data may be misleading, political and banking systems are not always stable, and exchange rates may fluctuate. As a result, the managers said, the fund should not be used as a core investment but to diversify a portfolio.
To pick 150 or so stocks, the managers evaluate more than 5,000 stocks in 30 markets each day. They rank stocks based on projected stock price appreciation in the next one to three months in United States dollar terms.
The country allocation is based on such factors as interest rates, stock market volatility and aggregate earnings forecasts. Their biggest bet is China, which represents about 10 percent of the fund's assets. Mr. Wolahan said that Chinese companies were priced cheaply, about 13 times estimated 2002 earnings.
The managers are also bullish on Russia, which is moving toward a market economy. The fund has a 9 percent stake in Russia compared with 5 percent for the diversified emerging markets funds. "Russia had a difficult time during the 90's," Mr. Wolahan said, "but they're starting to reap the benefits in the form of lower interest rates and higher G.D.P. growth."
The Brazilian market is also well priced, the managers say. "Brazil was popular in the early- to mid-90's, when they stabilized inflation," Mr. Bergstrom said, "but since then, many people are disappointed at the rate of progress." He said Brazil's drive to privatize state-owned oil and telephone companies, among others, was a strong indicator of a free-market approach.
"IN March, the managers bought shares of China Mobile for 22.95 Hong Kong dollars, or $2.94. On Friday, they closed at 26.55 Hong Kong dollars, or $3.40. The company, a leader in the Chinese mobile telecommunications market, increased its subscriber base 65 percent in the four years ending 2001, Mr. Wolahan said. Shares trade for 15 times 2002 earnings compared with 38 times earnings for ATT Wireless, he said, "so you get a good growth company at a pretty reasonable price."
In February they bought shares in Yukos, a large Russian oil company, as American depository receipts for $98. They closed Friday at $154. The company's annual oil production is expected to grow 24 percent in 2002, Mr. Bergstrom said, among the strongest forecasts for global oil companies.
Last May, they bought shares in Banco do Brasil, a Brazilian financial services company. The bank has Brazil's largest deposit base. They paid 8.51 reals for shares or $3.65. Shares closed at 13.25 reals on Friday, or $5.55.

Tariffs Won, Steel Sings New Tune

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

 BODY:
LISTENERS to the Webcasts and conference calls held by steel companies in recent weeks may be excused for wondering whether this is the same industry that a few months ago was warning that its very survival was at risk.
 Richard M. Wardrop Jr., chairman and chief executive of AK Steel, based in Middletown, Ohio, told people tuned in to his company's presentation, "We may be moving closer to being in the driver's seat than at any time since 1995." John Mayberry, chief executive of Dofasco Inc., a Canadian producer that does business in the United States, observed that "market conditions have improved much more quickly than we had anticipated." 
The main event between the dire warnings of a few months ago and the first-quarter conference calls of recent weeks has been the Bush administration's decision to impose tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on most steel imports. Though those tariffs did not go as far as some steelmakers would have liked, they have lifted the mood of industry executives and their shareholders. 
Steel prices have climbed steeply. According to surveys of steel buyers by Purchasing magazine, the average spot, or market, price of hot-rolled steel sheet, the type used for motor vehicle bodies and domestic appliances, has climbed from $215 a ton in November to $290 in April. Prices for May are expected to top $300 a ton, and some producers have announced additional increases for the summer. Prices of other types of steel are also moving up.
Investors appear to be shrugging off some unpleasant facts: more than two dozen steel companies are in some form of forced restructuring, others are still posting losses, and demand remains soft.
Steel stocks have performed better than many other sectors in recent months. The Dow Jones American steel index has climbed more than 40 percent since September. Among individual stocks, the Nucor Corporation, based in Charlotte, N.C., almost doubled in this period, reaching a peak of $66.35 in late March. The stock closed at $59.12 on Friday.
The investment climate is sufficiently encouraging that the United States Steel Corporation, based in Pittsburgh, one of the biggest producers, said last week that it planned a public offering of eight million common shares. The issue is to be priced in mid-May. The stock closed on Friday at $18.34. At the current price, the issue would raise close to $150 million, some of which may be used for acquisitions, the company said. 
"Everybody is looking up from the bottom of the hole," said Warren Isabelle, chief investment officer at Ironwood Capital Management in Boston. "Those who can climb the best have got some good things in store." Ironwood is a sizable holder of AK Steel stock, and Mr. Isabelle said he was considering buying more shares in that company and in United States Steel.
Daniel Roling, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch, has also strongly recommended AK Steel, based on rising prices and higher sales, especially to the automotive industry, which produces more than half of AK Steel's revenues.
The good news for steel producers and investors has come mostly from the supply side. Prices were starting to rise several months before President Bush approved the import tariffs in early March.
The spate of bankruptcies and reorganizations over the last year has curtailed capacity. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group, production of raw steel in 2001 was 11.5 percent lower than the previous year. One of the biggest casualties, the LTV Corporation, was a big producer of sheet steel. LTV, which shut down its mills in December and was bought by an investor group, accounted for 8 percent of North American output.
The tariffs, which Mr. Isabelle described as "a little bit of gravy," have had the effect of choking off low-priced foreign supplies, making it easier for domestic producers to raise prices.
According to the institute, steel imports fell to 2,034,000 tons in March, down 39.4 percent from February. Meanwhile, the domestic industry's capacity utilization has risen from 77.8 percent in early January to 87.5 percent in the week ended April 27. In addition, steel distributors' inventories are low.
If spot prices stay at current levels, steelmakers are sure to start pressing for better terms in long-term contracts with their customers. Referring to contract negotiations for 2003, Mr. Wardrop at AK Steel told analysts that talk in the industry was of a 6 to 8 percent increase in contract prices.
Christopher Olin, analyst at Midwest Research in Cleveland, forecast that contract prices for the coming year will rise 5 percent. "We're pretty bullish on steel," Mr. Olin said.
Rising prices have helped not only the steel industry in the United States, but also producers in Canada and Mexico, which are exempt from the new duties and rely heavily on trade and investments in the United States. For instance, Ipsco, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, produces about two-thirds of its steel at plants in Iowa and Alabama. Other Canadian producers are big suppliers to the auto industry. "The North American steel industry is very much integrated," said Anna Sorbo, an analyst at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
The Canadian and Mexican authorities are also taking steps to protect their producers from offshore competition, creating what Randolph Cousins, an analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto, calls "fortress North America."
Several countries have complained to the World Trade Organization about the American tariffs. The European Union is threatening to retaliate by imposing additional duties on imports from the United States worth about $300 million a year.
The brighter mood in the industry does not mean its troubles are over. The problem of legacy costs -- health care and other benefits for retirees, which are estimated at more than $10 billion -- continues to hamper industry restructuring. Mr. Wardrop complained that delays in completing bankruptcy proceedings were holding up his company's plans to bolster profitability by acquiring more capacity to produce coated steel, which has a protective layer.
While Canadian and Mexican companies are typically burdened by lower legacy costs than American producers, analysts say that American companies are restructuring or finding other ways to lighten their legacy cost burdens. 
PLANT closures and tariffs have reined in supply and tighter cost controls have brought down operating costs, but few would dare pronounce the industry firmly on the road to recovery until there is a sustained increase in demand. That has yet to happen.
James Alfano, chief executive of Stelco Inc., the biggest Canadian producer, said, "We expect to see steel demand increase as the North American economy strengthens." 
Executives at United States Steel told analysts last week that second-quarter orders for sheet steel were strong, with stable demand from the automotive and appliance sectors. General Motors has said that it plans to raise new car and truck production by 4 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year ago.
But, according to United States Steel, demand for steel plate, widely used in construction and shipbuilding, remained flat. In addition, the market for specialty steel pipes, used for oil and gas drilling and transportation, was soft, bridge-building was threatened by cuts in government spending and the rail-car market was about half its normal level.
Mr. Cousins at BMO Nesbitt Burns said he was "steering away" from steel-sheet producers, like Nucor, which depend heavily on the automotive and housing sectors. Sheet made up 46 percent of Nucor's first-quarter output. "It can't get any better" for these companies, Mr. Cousins said. "Those are stocks that have had huge runs."

A Handicapper's Guide to the Trial of Andersen

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
NO defendant will be visible in the courtroom. The white-collar prosecution will be presented to the down-home Texas jury by a couple of East Coast organized-crime busters. The chief witness will admit to committing a crime, while the defense will say he is an innocent man who's lying. At stake is the survival of the once-powerful accounting firm, Arthur Andersen.
 The criminal trial of Andersen on a single charge of obstruction of justice in the Enron case opens in a Houston courtroom tomorrow with jury selection. The case is expected to last just weeks -- a blink of an eye by the standard of white-collar criminal trials. While some 40 members of the media are expected in the courtroom, there is unlikely to be live Court TV commentary or spectators camping out overnight to get seats. But it promises to be one of the more unusual and important confrontations in years. 
The issues are simple: Were thousands of documents related to Enron's finances shredded last fall for the corrupt intent of impeding an official inquiry? If so, should Andersen be held accountable for the actions of employees who committed a crime? 
On paper, at least, the answers to those questions appear to be a slam-dunk for the prosecution. The government has a guilty plea in its back pocket from David B. Duncan, the Andersen partner who orchestrated the destruction, and he has told federal investigators that the shredding was the outgrowth of months of discussions among members of the firm. 
Criminal trials are not won on paper, but in the jury room. That wild card offers opportunities for both sides in a trial that is about little more than shredded paper.
Still, for Andersen, the outcome could mean life or death. And for the government, the credibility of the investigation into potential fraud at Enron could be hugely damaged by a defeat on such a simple case. With victory for both sides so shallow and defeat such a calamity, legal experts still marvel that this case is even going to trial.
"The crystal clear issue here is that both sides have overplayed their hands," said James Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who has brought numerous white-collar civil cases. "Now both sides are backed into a position that neither one should want to be in."
In many ways, the Andersen trial will be like the final game of a tough World Series, with strategies playing out in a manner that is obvious only to aficionados of the game and with the winner taking all. So, like any good sports fan, those wanting to handicap this trial need a program to study. Understanding the players and their strategies means understanding where this case is likely to end.

The Prosecutors
The government lawyers are Samuel W. Buell and Andrew Weissmann, assistant United States attorneys from the East Coast who were assigned this year by the Justice Department to the Enron task force. Both are reputed to be hard-bitten prosecutors willing to push aggressively on tough cases.
Both are best known for their prosecutions of organized crime figures. Two years ago, for example, Mr. Buell helped bring an indictment against James J. Bulger, a powerful gangster known as Whitey from the Irish enclave in South Boston. Mr. Bulger was a long-time informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but maintained a strong hand in criminal activities, including accusations of killing more than a dozen people. The case was a scandal in Boston, and Mr. Buell was at the forefront of setting things right. But Mr. Bulger became a fugitive before he could be put on trial.
Mr. Weissmann, formerly the head of the criminal division for the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, also specialized in organized crime prosecutions. He worked with Salvatore Gravano -- the gangland hitman-turned-informant better known as Sammy the Bull -- in taking on prominent organized crime figures in New York City. 
The prosecutors' backgrounds have served as something of an undercurrent in the case. Repeatedly, Andersen partners have grumbled that the prosecutors seemed intent on treating the firm like a mob enterprise, and were unable to recognize that it was much more than a potential crime incubator. At trial, some legal experts said, the prosecutors will deftly have to attack the crime but not alienate the jury by treating Andersen like a criminal organization.

The Defense
Andersen's team is led by Rusty Hardin, a former prosecutor who served as chief trial counsel in the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration. Mr. Hardin is perhaps best known for his celebrity cases, including his star turn going up against Anna Nicole Smith, the former Playboy model, in a battle over the estate of her late husband, J. Howard Marshall II. Mr. Hardin represented a son of Mr. Marshall, and won the case.
Mr. Hardin, a fixture in Houston legal circles, is widely viewed as the lawyer who might just pull off a miracle in the Andersen case. His rapport with juries is legendary, as is his skill at cross-examination, and both are expected to play critical roles. "Rusty Hardin is a genius," said Mr. Moriarty. "If there is anybody in the world who can grab victory out of jaws of defeat, it's him."

The Judge
Throughout Houston, Judge Melinda F. Harmon of the United States District Court has the reputation as a tough, law-and-order judge who is decidedly fair. She has served on the bench for nearly 13 years.
"The judge is going to be a real factor in this case, because she is the kind of judge who makes her presence felt," said Dick DeGuerin, a criminal defense lawyer in Houston. "She is a hands-on, take-charge kind of judge who will take over a slow cross-examination or slow direct exam."
That may serve Mr. Hardin to some degree because he already has a working familiarity with her. "Rusty Hardin is of a temperament to handle that better than some out-of-town lawyers who don't know her," Mr. DeGuerin said.

The Star Witness
Until the debacle at Enron, Mr. Duncan was an Andersen lifer, having joined the firm out of Texas A & M in 1981, where he had earned a degree in accounting. From then on, he was a man on the move, hustling up the ranks until he became the lead partner serving Enron, one of Andersen's biggest and most prestigious clients.
Last October, Mr. Duncan made the decision that transformed him from a numbers cruncher to a national symbol of Enron's collapse. One day after learning that the Securities and Exchange Commission was about to seek Enron's auditing records as part of a preliminary inquiry into its financial problems, Mr. Duncan orchestrated a massive campaign to destroy records. For months, he maintained that he only did so in response to an Oct. 12 e-mail message from a company lawyer telling members of the Enron team to insure that they were in compliance with Andersen's policies on document retention and destruction.
Then, last month, Mr. Duncan pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, agreeing to become the government's chief witness in the Andersen case. In his statement to the court then, he said the documents were destroyed "so that they would be unavailable to the S.E.C. and others."
With that admission, Mr. Duncan provided prosecutors with their most important evidence of intent to impede an investigation -- a critical element of proof necessary for a conviction. Now, his statements will serve as the primary evidence of criminal intent within Andersen.

The Strategies
One of the most important moments in the Andersen case, legal experts said, would likely occur on the first day -- and could pass by almost unnoticed. For the selection of a jury, Judge Harmon has often allowed the lawyers to conduct individual questioning of prospective members, a process known as voir dire. Usually in federal trials on the East Coast, lawyers said, such interviews are handled by the judge, who questions large pools of possible jurors.
As a result, legal experts said, if Judge Harmon holds to form and allows for individual voir dire by the lawyers in this case, Mr. Hardin may start with a leg up.
"Individual voir dire will be a huge advantage to Rusty," said David H. Berg, a prominent Houston trial lawyer. "It is a fading art and there aren't many who can do it well. But Rusty is one who can."
The voir dire not only allows lawyers to detect bias, but also gives them a free opportunity to begin stressing the themes of their cases during questioning, essentially priming the witnesses for the arguments they are about to hear at trial.
"There are subtle ways to condition jurors in voir dire, there are subtle ways to persuade jurors to vote your way," Mr. Berg said. But unlike most white-collar trials, where the crime can seem distant and vague, the inextricable links between this case and the Enron investigation will likely serve as a plus for the government. 
"The underlying economic disaster here has harmed thousands of Houstonians and will be one of the most memorable financial disasters in this city's history," Mr. Moriarty said. "The problem of jury selection is to find 12 people who will admit or claim that they haven't made up their minds."
After opening statements, the government will begin presenting its case. Several legal experts said that they expected the case to move quickly, with Mr. Duncan being brought to the stand as soon as possible so that the jurors can see a live witness testifying that a crime did indeed occur.
During that testimony, one important responsibility for the prosecutors is to address Mr. Duncan's apparent contradictions over time, with his shift from an insistence that he had done nothing wrong to an admission that he committed a crime.
The most important element of Mr. Duncan's direct examination will be how well the government succeeds in portraying his actions as part of a concerted effort within Andersen. To demonstrate that, there will be much discussion of the conversations among Andersen partners that began as far back as August about possible problems at Enron, and the likelihood of a federal inquiry. They will also rely on the Oct. 12 e-mail message from the Andersen lawyer reminding its Enron team about the firm's policies on document retention.
The high point of the trial, when the case could either be won or lost, will be during Mr. Hardin's cross-examination of Mr. Duncan, legal experts said. Mr. Hardin will try to persuade the jury that Mr. Duncan pleaded guilty not because he thought he had committed a crime, but because he feared a lengthy prison sentence if he went to trial. 
"The most telling thing, the thing that a jury can understand the best, is why Duncan is doing what he is doing, which is to save his own rear end," Mr. DeGuerin said.
Mr. Hardin will also try to demonstrate during his cross-examination that Mr. Duncan intentionally had tried to mislead his partners about the actions he was taking, evidence that could help Andersen in making its case that he was a rogue employee who acted outside of the firm's rules. 
During the defense's presentation, Mr. Hardin will try to humanize the firm, to portray it not as some monolithic, conniving organization, but as a collection of people trying to do the right thing. 
One enormous challenge for Mr. Hardin, however, is how to portray Andersen as a reputable organization without opening the door to rebuttal evidence from the government. If Mr. Hardin goes too far, by eliciting general testimony about the firm's good character, under what is known as Rule 404(b), prosecutors would then be able to introduce evidence of other "bad acts" by the firm. Those would include its role in the accounting fraud at Waste Management, which resulted in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in other high-profile accounting embarrassments, including those at the Baptist Foundation of Arizona and at Sunbeam. The danger of such information being trotted out to the jury is particularly high in Judge Harmon's court, legal experts said, because she tends to allow the admission of a lot of 404(b) evidence if the defense opens the door.
The challenges to both sides are so large that, even as lawyers handicap the outcome, many insist that a settlement may well be possible. After all, both sides have little to gain in a victory, and much to lose in defeat. But a settlement would come at the last minute, when the inevitability of trial and the last long walk to court will be putting pressure on both sides.
"That," said Mr. Berg, the Houston lawyer, "Is what they invented courthouse steps for."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Despite Appearances, Economy Is Still Shaky

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
HOW comes the hard part.
 Put aside the recession, and the marvelous surge in the first quarter. That certainly did wonders for appearances. But in fact the American economy is like a brightly painted pier without enough piles to support it. Step too hard in the wrong place and the pier sags into the water. The hard part is putting enough piles in place before reality overwhelms appearance. 
 Just two piles sustained appearances in the first quarter, making the economy seem sturdy. They were stepped-up government spending, for defense at the federal level and public works at the state and local levels, and stepped-up business spending to maintain stockpiles of merchandise after they were depleted during the recession. Take away these supports and the economic growth rate, instead of being a robust 5.8 percent at an annual rate, as announced, would have been a meager 1.3 percent. 
"When you see a number like 5.8 percent, 'Well,' you say, 'the recession is over,' but that is not what the Commerce Department told us in the latest G.D.P. report," said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
The G.D.P., or gross domestic product, is the total value of all the goods and services produced each year in the United States. The Commerce Department calculates the G.D.P. quarterly and these calculations have become the most popular measure of the economy's ups and downs. A 3 percent annual growth rate is generally considered the minimum necessary to give people the feel of prosperity. Less than 3 percent is insufficient to generate enough jobs to keep down the unemployment rate or enough tax revenue to maintain public spending at the state and local levels -- among other ills.
Less than 3 percent appears to lie ahead for most, if not all, of this year. Government spending and inventory maintenance, for example, are unlikely to be as supportive as they were in the recent past. 
The G.D.P. report for the first quarter -- once the piles were counted -- was the first clear signal that the quick recovery that everyone yearns for, and that many forecasters still promise, is unlikely. In case anyone missed the signal, the employment report on Friday amplified it. With job creation almost nonexistent, the unemployment rate jumped to 6 percent in April from 5.7 percent in March. It goes almost without saying that the Federal Reserve's policy makers, when they meet on Tuesday to discuss interest rates, will not raise them. Just a couple of months ago, many forecasters had expected rates to be rising by now, in anticipation of a potentially inflationary growth rate.
"We are compiling a picture of an economy that is going to struggle," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. 
Economic growth is a tricky concept. Even without growth, the dynamic American economy churns out more than $10 trillion a year in goods and services. That number has to rise continuously, however, by at least $300 billion a year to generate enough incomes and jobs. Each additional $100 billion increase adds a percentage point to the G.D.P.'s growth rate. 
In these metrics, inventory replenishment contributed a very hefty 3.1 percentage points to the first quarter's 5.8 percent growth rate. That sort of replenishment is not likely to be topped this quarter, with its sudden signals of weak growth. Why replenish only to be stuck with unsold goods? 
Government spending shows similar stress, after contributing 1.4 percentage points to first-quarter growth, half of it at the federal level and half at the state and local levels. Federal spending went up because of rising outlays for defense. That could happen again. But many states and cities have begun to slash spending in response to less-than-expected tax revenue.
THERE are the usual standbys, of course. Residential construction added 0.7 percentage point. House building, already at a record level, rose more. Can it go even higher in the second quarter, making another contribution to growth? Most experts are doubtful. Consumer spending is the other heavy hitter. But consumer spending at home cannot be separated in the G.D.P. from net exports, which are what we sell to foreign consumers minus the greater amount we import. Together, consumer spending, globally defined, contributed only 1.3 percentage points in the first quarter, and is in danger of falling in the second.
That leaves hope. The expectation of Kathleen Cooper, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for economic affairs, is that profits will revive, encouraging business to step up investment in machinery and software, lifting growth. Maybe. There is already stirring in this quarter. But not enough to qualify as piles supporting the glossily painted, but shaky pier.

HEADLINE: Energy Decisions, State by State 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The energy plan being debated in Washington (editorial, April 28) fails to provide for our energy and environmental needs. Its billion-dollar subsidies to the fossil fuel and nuclear industries will result in damaging the environment and endangering millions, as with the Indian Point nuclear plant (letters, April 29). 
 With national policy so clearly heading down the wrong tracks, the most important energy decisions now fall to state decision makers, who should move to increase renewable energy. California especially has a prime opportunity to do just that. 
California decision makers should commit to doubling our use of clean, renewable energy to 20 percent of power generation by 2010. This would help the state's economy by adding thousands of new jobs. More important, it would provide power without sacrificing our health or our environment.

HEADLINE: Public Colleges, Broken Promises 

 BODY:
The United States set out nearly 30 years ago to ensure that Americans who qualified academically would not be turned away from college for financial reasons. The bedrock of the program was a dual system: state legislatures subsidized public universities to keep tuition low, while the poorest students could get federal Pell Grants that largely covered the remaining costs. Within a few years of setting that goal, the attempt to secure the broadest possible access to college seemed secure. Since then, spiraling tuition and declining support for poor and working-class students have combined to roll back one of the more farsighted policies of the 20th century. 
 The problem was laid out yet again last week in two reports, one entitled "Losing Ground," from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, and a second, from Congress, called "Slamming Shut the Doors to College." A national policy once based primarily on need-based grants is now dominated by loan programs that often require Americans to assume unmanageable debts. Once seen as a benefit to society as a whole, a college education is now viewed as a boon to an individual, who should be forced to pay for it. 
 The data in the new reports shows that public colleges, which educate more than three-quarters of America's students, are becoming unaffordable for many American families, that federal and state financial aid to students has failed to keep pace with tuition increases and that low-income families in particular are borrowing larger amounts than ever to pay for college. Both Republicans and Democrats participated in the destructive process of shifting aid that was once dispensed on the basis of need toward more politically powerful middle- and upper-income families.
The dearth of student aid for lower-income families is discouraging the neediest from applying to college at all and driving them toward low-paying jobs that keep them at the very margins of society. These are ominous developments at a time when a college diploma has become the ticket for admission into the new economy and a basic requirement for a middle-class life. The most alarming figures show that the college attendance gap between high-income and low-income Americans has widened and that about a quarter of high-achieving low-income students fail to go to college at all.
"Losing Ground" appears just as public universities have responded to recession-driven budget cuts with steep tuition increases. Public colleges must absorb a reasonable share of pain, but the states are killing their own futures by pricing the poorest students out of college and into dead-end jobs. The states also need to re-examine their approaches to university building, which, in the name of economic development, situates costly campuses in remote areas where they are not needed.
Failing to finance the federal Pell Grant program at a realistic level has a truly corrosive effect. In 1986, Pell Grants covered 98 percent of the tuition at a public four-year college. Today, that figure is 57 percent. The erosion of aid has been aggravated by the fact that federal and state governments are moving away from need-based aid to politically popular tax credits and other programs that shift a huge share of public education dollars toward the more affluent. Unless the country renews its commitment to helping poor and working-class students get to and through college, upward mobility for tens of millions of Americans will effectively cease.

Remodeling? Consider the Resale Value.

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
With the economy improving and temperatures warming, more Americans may be considering home improvements. While the costs for projects vary, so does the payoff after a home is sold. 
 Remodeled kitchens and bathrooms netted the highest return when houses were sold. But converting a room into a home office was estimated to return only 55 percent of its costs, on average, according to Remodeling magazine. Returns for that project can be greater in certain parts of the country, like Atlanta, where commutes can be long, or in cities like San Francisco, where there are many jobs in high-technology fields. Real estate agents ranked the return on home offices at more than 100 percent in those cities, according to the magazine.

HEADLINE: Different Lives, One Goal: Finding the Key to College 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
The race begins at different times and in different ways. 
 Jed Resnick roars from the gate like a performance car, motor humming, pit crew of parents and guidance counselor all focused on a single shining goal: Yale. 
 Reuben Quansah ambles warily but purposefully, learning the terrain as he goes. He discovers that an African-American teenager from a low-income family can play the college admission game as well as the children of privilege who once considered it their own. 
Gerta Xhelo, the daughter of Albanian immigrants, ignores the starter's pistol, misses cues, dawdles lazily. But at the very last minute she wakes up and rushes to the finish line. 
In most ways, Jed Resnick, son of a doctor and a social worker who attends the exclusive Collegiate School in Manhattan; Reuben Quansah, whose mother scrimped to send him to Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx; and Gerta Xhelo, whose parents' long journey in search of a better life has taken her to Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, inhabit separate universes. 
Their dissimilar expectations, resources and sophistication define how they approach America's coming-of-age obsession: applying to college. This game confers distinct advantages and disadvantages on each of these three young people. In the end, there are enough opportunities and obstacles to go around. 
The New York Times followed Jed, Reuben and Gerta through the college admission process from spring of junior year until spring of senior year, from the evolution of their list of schools to the anxiety of SAT's, from the scramble to churn out applications to the agonizing wait for acceptance letters and financial aid packages. 
Once this rite of passage, which ended on May 1, the deadline for students to decide which college to attend, was like a secret handshake, with insider information the preserve of families with old money and long pedigrees. Only after World War II did a college education become an upper-middle-class expectation. A generation later, it had become an obsession for well-to-do baby boomers and their children, particularly in the Northeast. 
Now the game is open to all comers, thanks to the expansion of minority recruiting, democratic access to information on the Internet and scholarships and remedial programs that make higher education more widely available than ever before. A result is a growing number of students vying for a static number of slots at the nation's 3,500 colleges and universities, perhaps 50 the focus of feverish interest. 
Harvard had 19,605 applications this year for 1,650 spots, versus 13,029 a decade ago. At Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., the most recent applicant pool was 4,229 for 390 spaces, contrasted with 2,883 in 1992. And at Washington University in St. Louis, 19,512 applicants competed for 1,280 places in the freshman class, up from 8,329 a decade ago.
This crushing competition has intensified anxiety for those at the top, who over three decades have seen the game shift from one where they competed mostly against one another to one with many new players. And it has thrown those lower on the economic ladder into an arcane contest that offers them a good deal if they figure out how to navigate the system.
One thing that transcends class lines is the phenomenon of packaging, with students shrewdly massaging their resumes and counselors, playing the role of political spin doctors, relentlessly marketing them. Everyone finds the process off-putting and everyone knows it is essential. 
Beyond the packaging, there are other shared experiences. All three students have averages close to 90 and are considered accomplished but not superstars. All have veteran counselors and caring, involved parents anxious about the outcome. All have weathered family crises this year, from divorce to unemployment. 
All have obsessed over test scores, worried whether their extracurricular activities were sufficient, pulled too many all-nighters. All have expressed what Gerta did in an e-mail message in November:
"The college office is full of students now, crazy seniors like myself that are SOOOO scared and SOOOO worried they'll miss deadlines that they ask the same question two thousand times. The applications are SOOOO long and there's SOOOO much I have to write. I think I am going to die soon. I never thought it would be this hard."

Jed Resnick
Usual Advantages May Not Work
When Jed and his parents sat down with his guidance counselor, Bruce Breimer, at 7:15 on a blustery May morning last year, they already knew the rules of the admissions game. 
His parents knew which set of schools were the be-all and end-all in their social circle. They knew an early-decision application raised the odds of acceptance for upper-middle-class achievers who were not minority students, second-generation Ivy Leaguers, recruited athletes or favorites of trustees. 
They knew they could pay tuition for Jed and his twin brother, Micah, who had all the advantages of an elementary and secondary education at Collegiate. They knew that Mr. Breimer was the best in the business, part strategist and part family therapist. They knew they would survive because they had twice before, sending two older boys to Williams College, Josh in 1992 and Seth in 1995. 
They knew that Jed, a gifted singer and actor and a Greek scholar, had already set his heart on Yale, for reasons both rational and emotional. And they also knew, intellectually but not viscerally, that Jed would have a tough time getting accepted. Or at least they should have, because Mr. Breimer had told them so.
"You're a white upper-middle-class generalist; I don't think you'll get in," the counselor said repeatedly. In the lingo of the trade, Jed had no hook, unless they could parlay his theatrical talent. 
Mr. Breimer, a graduate of Collegiate ('63) and Yale ('67) in simpler times, arrived at the family conference first, rumpled as always, toting paperwork in shopping bags. He lumbered past the bulletin board, with its postings for tutors and beach houses. He stopped to soothe an agitated mother, whose son, a senior, had been rejected. "Did he take the wrong classes?" she wailed. 
Jed's parents, Terri Dancik and Jack Resnick, in the midst of a bitter divorce, arrived separately, never spoke to each other and avoided eye contact. Mr. Breimer insists on one conference that includes both parents. Divorce is common, and he needs an early reading of whether the adults will "bond" or "chew the kid up." 
The conference began with the assumption that Jed would apply to the same colleges as his classmates, despite Mr. Breimer's efforts to get them all to think beyond the "right sweatshirt to wear on Park Avenue." It is a lost cause. Between 1997 and 2001, half of Collegiate's 249 graduates went to just eight schools: Harvard (23), Yale (21), Columbia (17), Williams (16), the University of Pennsylvania (13), Brown (12), Wesleyan (12) and Vassar (10). 
Jed understands, dimly, how foolish this is. "My dad went to Brooklyn College and he's a perfectly happy, successful doctor," he said. But Ivy League aspirations are part of the air he breathes. So Jed is compelled by the destinations of his friends. The Yale list rolls easily off his tongue: Andy Sandberg from Browning; Elizabeth Kelly, his Chapin co-star in a production of "Godspell"; Quin Krovatin from Collegiate. 
Jed's parents also know that Mr. Breimer takes a dim view of early decision, in which a student applies to only one college and promises to attend if accepted. Calling it a rush to judgment, he sets the bar high, requiring visits to five campuses and then an explanation why one is a compelling match. A result is a far lower percentage of early-decision applications than at comparable schools: 30 percent in 2002, for instance, versus 75 percent at Trinity.
Dr. Resnick had reservations about Jed as an early-decision candidate because of more B's than A's in sophomore year, when his son was "stressed out" by the marital separation and shuttling between his mother's apartment on Roosevelt Island and his father's on West End Avenue. 
Mr. Breimer was noncommittal about whether early decision was right for Jed. "At some schools, there's a decided advantage," he said. "Is Yale one?" Dr. Resnick asked. "Not necessarily," the counselor replied. In 2000, 5 of 5 Collegiate early applicants got in to Yale. In 2001 the school went 0-for-3. 
As for the dip in grades, Mr. Breimer did not share Dr. Resnick's concern. If Jed "closed strongly," he would be able to "plausibly posture himself anywhere." 
Jed's mother's big worry was the boy's recent SAT scores, 680 on the verbal test and 750 in math, for a total of 1,430. Mr. Breimer agreed that the verbal score was "slightly suppressed in the context of upper-middle-class New York," where children begin learning the tricks of standardized testing in the first grade. Jed would not be a credible candidate at Yale, Mr. Breimer said, unless he nudged himself up to 1,500. 
"But we're talking about two or three more right answers, period," Mr. Breimer said. "You don't have to blow the top off the test." He was hoping this concrete nugget would quiet the clamor for a private SAT tutor, ubiquitous in this set. But "Ask Jed about tutor" remained on his mother's to-do list for months to come. 
"I'm telling you, Terri, don't do it," the counselor said. Mr. Breimer turned to Jed: "If you're as good as we think you are, you'll take care of business. And scores don't place you in; they just place you out." 
Mr. Breimer had his own concern: Jed's tendency to overextend himself because of his hectic performing schedule, at four theaters beside Collegiate's. The week before, he tried to wiggle out of the junior class rafting trip on the Delaware River because of the last two rehearsals for "Pippin" on Roosevelt Island. He wound up going to one rehearsal and then joining the class, only to return exhausted and hoarse.
Talk turned to how Mr. Breimer would put the best spin on elements of Jed's resume. A semester in Normandy as an exchange student and another at an alternative school in Vermont? These "play nicely" as a demonstration of adventurous spirit. A childhood on Roosevelt Island? Proof the Resnicks had avoided Manhattan "provincialism." 
Between them, Jed and Mr. Breimer considered 20 possible schools. For each the counselor offered a capsule review.
Brown? "The most successful urban renewal in the Northeast. A good theater town." Middlebury? "Too remote." Wesleyan? "A meshuga school, but good writing and theater." Penn? "Kids that used to waltz in aren't anymore." Swarthmore? "You're too intense already." 
"He's a master," Ms. Dancik said of Mr. Breimer as the meeting ended. "That's why I can sit back and relax. Sort of."
But for Jed, relaxing was not an option. He spent his summer at the Stagedoor Manor theatrical camp in the Catskills, taking on demanding productions like Stephen Sondheim's dark "Assassins" -- a huge jump from frothy musicals that are standards for school-age actors. The role convinced Jed that he wanted two things -- great theater and a challenging liberal arts education. Throw in the designer label, and more than ever his heart was set on Yale.
Mr. Breimer thought Jed, although a long shot, was a perfect fit. So he said he dissuaded other early applicants from the 46-member senior class, clearing the field for Jed.
Now came the breathless juggling of schoolwork, campus visits and applications. During 10 days in October, Jed had exams in Advanced Placement biology and European history, trips to the University of Michigan, Northwestern and Vassar and the SAT's. 
After the make-it-or-break-it tests, Ms. Dancik found herself voicing the persistent complaint of the privileged classes: that scores mattered so much for boys like Jed, while minority applicants had slack. "You have had every privilege," she said, "and in a way it's a disadvantage."
The next day, twitchy with strain, Jed went to Brown. He was rehearsing three plays, designing his yearbook page, writing his newspaper column -- and falling behind in his studies.
Jed's interview at Yale was Oct. 18, a rushed encounter with a bored senior who was 15 minutes late. But he spent the night at Davenport residential college with a Collegiate alumnus, went to a class in Greek tragedy with a second New York City friend and took a campus tour led by a third.
"Everyone says, 'Jed, you belong here,' " he said. "They're my kind of people. I fit in." 
Jed worked on his essays on the trip from New Haven but did not meet Mr. Breimer's standards. The counselor ripped the essays to shreds, saying they focused too much on theater and not enough on academics. 
Their editing session stopped at the moment when Jed could get expedited SAT scores by phone, for a $15 fee, a luxury neither Reuben nor Gerta could consider but a necessity in Jed's crowd.
Jed dialed his cellphone, punched in a Visa card number, waited and then waited some more. Finally, slamming his fist on the table, he shouted, each time louder, "Yes, YES. YES!!!"
His math score had nudged up to 760; his verbal jumped to 740. Mr. Breimer was particularly pleased because, in the admissions competition, which pits colleges against colleges, as well as applicants against applicants, 1,500 is "exponentially better" than 1490. 
The difference matters, Mr. Breimer said, because U.S. News & World Report says it does, tallying SAT scores in bands of 100.
The magazine's numerical rankings of colleges have added stress to the process, both for students who may prefer No. 11 to No. 21, however arbitrary the distinction may be, and for college administrators with a stake in their standing. So by hitting 1,500, Jed could play his own small part in boosting Yale's status.
Now he raced the deadline for early applications. Jed's package made the last FedEx pickup on Oct. 31.
"I'm free," he said.

Reuben Quansah
'It All Depends On Money'
Reuben's official introduction to the college admissions game came last spring at the weekly junior class assembly at Cardinal Hayes High School, which is conducted by Bill Lessa, the college counselor, who briskly presents the intricacies of the process to teenagers who, for the most part, have not given it a moment's thought. 
Reuben was ahead of the pack. His older brother, Rickie, had just been accepted at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston and Reuben had shared the yearlong ordeal. He had already been to two college fairs, had visited two upstate campuses and was cramming for his approaching SAT's. 
Still he filed quietly with his classmates across marble floors and Oriental rugs and into the school's dim auditorium, on Grand Concourse a few blocks from Yankee Stadium. From 8:13 to 8:37, not counting the opening Hail Mary, Mr. Lessa discussed the standardized test schedule, the local college fairs, the Web sites and the guidebooks.
This is no boutique like Collegiate, where Mr. Breimer says "the clock is not an issue." Mr. Lessa, along with a 200-plus caseload, works a second job, supervising custodians at an East Bronx school. Still, Reuben knew he was welcome in the counselor's office anytime, and he went almost every day. 
Reuben began his search with less social pressure than Jed. Cardinal Hayes, like Collegiate, is for boys only, but there the similarity ends. At the Bronx school, a few each year go to the Ivy League, but many more choose Roman Catholic colleges and affordable SUNY or CUNY campuses. 
But Reuben was No. 15 in a class of 230, a star in a demanding Cisco Systems computer course. He had already been singled out for membership in the select Archbishop's Leadership Program, which teaches critical thinking, interpersonal skills and black history. At weekly meetings at a Harlem church, these motivated teenagers organize trips to college campuses, raising the money and preparing questions for admissions officers. With them, Reuben had already visited Colgate and the State University at Binghamton. 
That put him ahead of the curve at the first junior class assembly, where Mr. Lessa laid out the criteria for choosing schools. Big or small? Public or private? Urban or rural? Home or away? Going out of town raises issues for inner-city students. Boys from the Grand Concourse are rarely moved by the bright foliage at Amherst or the snowy landscape at Bates when it means giving up the D train and the corner bodega. 
Part of the presentation was geography. "A guy who wants to go to Buffalo needs to know that Buffalo is far away and it's cold there," Mr. Lessa said. "These young men do not know what it means when I say 'rural' or 'suburban.' They may have been to New Roc City and think that's a suburb." 
Reuben was on the fence about going away. He was drawn to the idea of a "real" college experience. But he worried about his mother, Maureen Dowouna-Nortey, a nurse-technician who had taken on burdensome loans when Rickie's financial aid package fell $9,000 short of the mark.
Mr. Lessa had failed to persuade Rickie to chose a state college. Ms. Dowouna-Nortey was already working double shifts at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx, struggling to pay $3,750 parochial school tuitions and send money to relatives in Africa. The boys' father had abandoned the family a dozen years before, Ms. Dowouna-Nortey said, adding that their stepfather, moving in and out of the house as the marriage foundered, did not help with household expenses.
"It all depends on money," Reuben said.
Financial aid would be the topic of the next assembly. Mr. Lessa warned them that he needed to know family income, information that "parents don't readily share with children" but that would be essential. Then he turned the microphone over to Brother Christopher Keogan, the dean of discipline, who read off the day's detention list. 
Students at Cardinal Hayes must sit up straight, keep their lockers tidy and use honorifics when addressing adults. Dreadlocks are forbidden and shirttails must be tucked in. The Rev. James Byrnes, the academic dean, said students put on "a certain persona on the street" but are "glad when they get here to leave it at the door." Heading home each day, parochial school boys on the Grand Concourse shed their ties and yank out their shirttails. 
For Reuben, there is no costume change.
With hundreds of other teenagers in puffy jackets and low-slung jeans, Reuben's blazer, tie and briefcase drew admiring stares at a college fair in October at the Westchester County Center in White Plains.
In his briefcase Reuben carried an alphabetical list of representatives he wanted to meet -- from Bucknell, Clarkson, Manhattan College, New York Institute of Technology -- and questions to ask them.
Is the curriculum heavier on computer networking or programming? Is there a campus chapter of the Society of Black Engineers? Are students involved in faculty research? Can he earn a combined bachelor's and master's degree in five years?
"This is a level of maturity one rarely sees," said Mr. Lessa, as he watched him work the cavernous room. "What you hope is that someone recognizes that.""
People already had.
There was Beryl S. Jeffers, a SUNY admissions official, who conducted an assembly at Hayes a year ago about the state's 64-campus system. Reuben solemnly introduced himself before asking a question, as he had been taught at his weekend retreats with the Archbishop's Leadership Program. "It struck me right away," Ms. Jeffers said. Such polished manners were rare.
Then came Gloria Walker, the office manager in the information technology department at Bellevue Hospital Center, where Reuben had had a summer internship. "That lady from Bellevue, she kept saying to me, 'How did you raise this kid?' " said Reuben's mother. Reuben is the youngest of her four children, but the one she calls an old soul.
At the fair, Reuben kept his distance from classmates with less serious agendas. One tried to distract him with the suggestion that they "look for girls." Reuben declined politely. But there was ice in his stare.
Working his way up the aisles, Reuben found the Bucknell table. The school was an unlikely choice, deep in rural Pennsylvania, and Reuben had only recently added it to his list because of the engineering department and the new focus on minority students. 
Bucknell is highly selective but rated a notch below the top tier of schools lusted after by upper-middle-class teenagers, as much for their status as their academic worth. But Reuben was not impressed by brand names. He wanted a school that would propel him toward a career in computer engineering and help him pay for it. 
Reuben struck up an easy conversation with Kate Peltz, Bucknell's representative. Ms. Peltz described the various engineering curriculums. She gave him a brochure intended for black and Hispanic students. Bucknell had 12 percent minority enrollment and was pushing hard to do better.
She registered Reuben's fastidious dress, behavior and preparation. Afterward, Ms. Peltz sent Reuben a complimentary note, rare after a cattle call of 340 colleges. Later, she invited him to an all-expense-paid minority admissions weekend on campus.
Reuben did not think twice.

Gerta Xhelo
A New Future Versus an Attitude
Gerta was in the Grover Cleveland college office, Room 118A, on the day in April 2001 when seniors streamed in with their financial aid offers. Among these impoverished immigrant students, an invitation to their No. 1 school is meaningless unless somebody pays the bills. They don't choose a college. They choose a financial aid package. 
Yena Huang got into Middlebury, with grants of $27,690 and a $4,000 loan. That left her shy $2,610 of the full cost of $34,300. She also got into Cornell under a special program for disadvantaged students. It required she complete six weeks of remedial studies over the summer. But her education would be free. Choosing the free ride at Cornell was a no-brainer for Roz Sternlieb, the college counselor. It was exactly how she hoped to get Gerta into a college a year later. 
In many ways, Gerta Xhelo (pronounced JEL-o) was under the most intense pressure of the three students. Her parents, Zegir and Shpresa Xhelo, had given up successful careers in Albania four years ago to bring their children from the chaotic aftermath of Communism to America. Mr. Xhelo, 66, had been a Ph.D. economist, chief financial officer in the seaside city of Vlora, where the family lived. Mrs. Xhelo had been a laboratory technician.
In New York, Gerta's father stuffed circulars into plastic sacks, and had a second job as a building guard. Mrs. Xhelo, 52 and in poor health, had a seasonal job in a sweater factory, where she complained that "the managers have to count on their fingers."
Gerta's parents hounded her to study and set limits on television and boyfriends. Gerta is their future. Her future is college. 
Ms. Sternlieb began advising the junior class in the spring, calling the top 150 of 464 students, one by one, to her cramped cubicle. The office is a sanctuary. Outside the door, police officers break up fights in the noisy corridors. The bathrooms are locked and patrolled by monitors. The rules for when you can use them are so complicated they require a manual, Gerta said. 
Ms. Sternlieb must micromanage everything for immigrant teenagers like Gerta, seeing that each deadline is met and that no piece of paper leaves her office stained with soda. An intact loving family is a blessing. But the Xhelos and others like them are helpless during college admissions season because they speak no English and know nothing of the American education system. 
"They throw their trust here because they don't know," Ms. Sternlieb said. "I'm God to them."
Gerta, unlike many of the top immigrant students at Grover Cleveland -- the school's valedictorians and prizewinners -- wanted to be popular and veered between "the kids who are street-smart and the kids who are brain-smart." She missed appointments with Ms. Sternlieb and scholarship deadlines as often as she changed her hair color. 
The counselor had the sense to go slowly. She did not argue when Gerta said she had to go to school locally to look after her family, who "came all the way to America for me." She complimented her for moving from "English as a second language" classes in just over a year. She noted her Advanced Placement classes, her membership in the honor society and her class rank of 37. 
There was nothing exceptional in Gerta's file, no way to see her sophistication about world events, her keen sense of justice, her lively mind. Ms. Sternlieb was playing a hunch that this girl might stumble through high school, then find herself in college. 
Ms. Sternlieb was modest in her suggestions: Pace, St. John's, Fordham, SUNY and CUNY campuses. She knew the girl wanted New York University, mostly because of "Felicity" on television. It might be possible under the Higher Education Opportunity Program that got Yena Huang into Cornell.
"Is it for retards?" Gerta asked. Ms. Sternlieb would worry about her misguided objection later. 
Gerta had to jump through hoops unheard of at Collegiate. She would have to apply for fee waivers for SAT's, which cost $24, and college applications, which cost up to $75. She would later file a Fafsa, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid. And then there were scholarships, like those offered by the United Federation of Teachers or Coca-Cola -- each with its own set of essays.
Gerta hated essays.
"I'm the bum in the family," Gerta said in July from her regular perch on the living room couch. Her summer job search had led nowhere, so she watched soap operas, painted her nails, tried to ignore the weary faces of her parents and fretted about the fall. 
She had reason to worry. She had skipped the first session of an SAT class to go to New Jersey with her 20-year-old cousin, Eneida Licaj, and some Albanian friends, where they listened to Metallica and drank beer. She missed the second for a trip to Canada. 
Gerta insisted that Ms. Licaj was helping her study. But by August, work had stopped "because of the hot weather." Gerta knew the pretense was weak. "It seems like a good excuse, don't you think?" she said in an e-mail message. "Hahahahahaha!" 
The counselor, also on holiday, did not mask her concern over Gerta's wayward summer or her academic slide: a 91 average as a freshman, 86 as a sophomore and 78 as a junior. "This is a critical year," Ms. Sternlieb said. "It will make her or break her."
Gerta dreaded her first encounter of senior year with Ms. Sternlieb. "I know she's going to be really upset," the girl said. "I see her in that office nudging everybody. A lot of people in this school go to college because of her. They may not know that, but it's true." 
As September approached, the girl took stock. "I hung out with the wrong people," she confided. "They pulled me down to their level." Fall brought some changes in Gerta's approach to the college application process, but not a complete makeover.
Ms. Sternlieb begged seniors to keep all their college papers together. "I'm human, I could misplace something," she said. Gerta often couldn't find a form when Ms. Sternlieb needed it. But Ms. Sternlieb was patient. Maybe the girl was just a late starter.
Gerta's strengths became more apparent in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, which she watched from the upper floors of Grover Cleveland in Ridgewood, Queens, overlooking Lower Manhattan. She had a wide-ranging interest in world affairs, rare among self-absorbed adolescents. She spoke knowledgeably about Islam, earlier bombings of American embassies in Africa and the destroyer Cole. She visited ground zero, read the Albanian and Italian newspapers online and translated CNN each night for her parents.
She and Ms. Sternlieb began a debate about staying at home or going away to college that lasted from fall to spring. She could go to St. John's as a commuter, like Ms. Licaj, who lives with the Xhelos. Or she could commute to Pace and still be home at night. 
Throughout junior year, Gerta would not even consider going away. What about the day when her mother, who has a bad heart, struggled to breathe until her lips tinged blue? Gerta missed a math Regents exam to take her to the hospital. Or the times her younger brother's teachers came to her, not her parents, with reports the boy was not turning in his homework. 
But by senior year, Gerta felt torn between duty and desire. Every time she stopped in the college office, Ms. Sternlieb peppered the girl with stories about others before her who had resisted leaving home, changed their minds and thrived. 
Gerta's mother, alarmed if her children are 10 minutes late, turned her head away silently whenever her daughter broached the subject of going away. "Maybe she'll come around," Gerta said, unconvincingly.
Gerta's father, a worldly man whose relatives had been killed, jailed and persecuted by the Albanian Communists, was more open-minded. "For me, it's what's best for Gerta," he said. "She learns to take care of herself."
But Gerta had her doubts. During the summer, as she contemplated what lay ahead, she said: "This coming year is going to decide a lot of things in my life. If I want, I could screw it up real bad."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the college application process for three New York City high school students referred incorrectly to a comment by the counselor at the Collegiate School, Bruce Breimer. Mr. Breimer said he had discouraged a senior from making an application for early decision at Yale this year because the student's credentials were not competitive. He did not take that action to improve the prospects of another Yale applicant.

HEADLINE: Measuring a Downturn With a Show of Paws 

BYLINE:  By HOPE REEVES 

 BODY:
Dodging the hordes of people clogging Brooklyn's busy Court Street one recent lunch hour, Linda Thompson ducked under an awning, reached into her purse and pulled out a handful of lint and key rings.
 She inspected the lot, finally selected a generic looking set and headed for the elevator. 
 "Come on, Taxi," she said. "Time to pick up Penny." 
Ten seconds later, the foyer of Apartment 4H was a den of fur and panting, with Ms. Thompson, a middle-aged woman with a mass of white hair, struggling to leash Penny, a frenzied dachshund, who was wrestling with Taxi, a golden retriever mix, before she rushed the group out the door and off to Wendell the French bulldog's house.
Most days, Taxi, Penny and Wendell are first on Ms. Thompson's list. A professional dog walker, she has 30 or so clients and carefully assembles each group to ensure the most peaceful trot. 
A Scottie named Violet, for instance, gets an early afternoon walk while Pluto, a cocker spaniel, goes out later in the afternoon because Violet doesn't appreciate Pluto's sniffs, and walking them together would destroy the cohesion. Taxi and Wendell, on the other hand, romp playfully as they make their way down the street while Penny moves her little legs as fast as they can go to keep up.
But while Ms. Thompson has her hands full now, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks dealt the dog walking, dog day care and kennel businesses a hefty blow. With people losing jobs, many took to walking their own dogs because they were home anyway or could not afford to pay someone else to do it. (Walks, at least in Brooklyn, where 23,674 dogs have city licenses, cost around $10 per half-hour, day care usually runs about $25 a day, and kenneling starts at $35 a night.) 
People canceled vacations and didn't make new plans for fear of flying, leaving kennels empty. In a twist even dog walkers said they did not expect, things got worse as the unemployed turned to self-employment -- in many cases dog walking -- to pad dwindling bank accounts.
"All of a sudden, signs went up everywhere." said Danielle Vidals, who with her husband, Arturo, runs Four Paws Inc., a dog-walking and pet-sitting company based in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. "There's always a trickle-down effect in this business and we expect an ebb and flow, but it had never been as bad as it was after Sept. 11."
Ms. Vidals returned home from a 10-day vacation in February to find five messages on her answering machine from clients saying they would no longer need her services. All told, she lost 12 of her 35 clients in the six months after the attacks. 
"It was everything from 'I'm moving' to 'I was laid off' to 'I just can't afford you anymore,' " Ms. Vidals said.
Ms. Thompson does not know exactly how many clients she has at any given time but reckoned she lost a good deal of them after the attacks. 
"The vizsla, the black pug . . .," she said, counting on her fingers.
Business at Woofs 'n Whiskers, a kennel in Carroll Gardens, dropped by 60 percent in the month after the attacks, and the owners were not sure how long they could keep their cages open. They added services -- like Luxury Lap sessions (15 minutes of unconditional human love for $5), Cozy on the Couch (15 minutes of couch time with a human for $5), Silly Soccer (15 minutes of running with a ball for $5) and M'M'Massage (15 minutes of massage for $10) -- to boost sales, and even sent out an entreaty in the form of a postcard offering a fall getaway package for Fido with a third night free. 
Although the new services have brought in more revenue, Robert Holbrook, one of the owners, said things still looked pretty dire.
Yet even in the roughest times, not one of these folks said they entertained the idea of finding other work. Most had come to their current jobs after meandering through what they considered some fairly miserable professions -- Mr. Holbrook was in software development and downing seven Advils a day; and Hannah Koltuv, the owner of Monster Mutt, a day-care center in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, was a television producer working on an ulcer.
In fact, Ms. Thompson, who among other things had been an elementary-school teacher (which may explain her unending patience with the likes of Taxi and Penny), credits her job for her sanity. It was the dogs -- Ling Ling the black Lab, Zeke the collie-shepherd mix, Franky the beagle and Danny Boy the wheaten terrier -- that helped her after Sept. 11, she said.
"Dogs have their priorities straight," Ms. Thompson said. "All they want to do is enjoy the sights, the smells. They want to play and kiss and they don't think about tomorrow, just how they can have fun today."
To her, dogs are perhaps better friends than humans and though she charges only for a half-hour walk, Ms. Thompson said she often took the dogs out for an hour or two. Sometimes she takes them for car rides to their favorite spots and recently she took Danny Boy to a reading at a neighborhood bookstore. She knew he would want to hear an excerpt from "Danny Boy: The Legend of the Beloved Irish Ballad," by Malachy McCourt, and bought him a signed copy before taking him home.
No doubt the dog will always treasure the photo of him being petted by a smiling Mr. McCourt.

HEADLINE: Florida Redoubles Efforts for the Elderly 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: DUNEDIN, Fla. 

 BODY:
Evelyn Kusk used to fret about crossing a busy intersection here on her way to the bank and the grocery store. She is 85 and not as speedy as she used to be.
 "Every time, I'd run even to make it halfway," said Mrs. Kusk, a retired seamstress from Brooklyn. "I'm getting old, so I don't run that fast." 
 But Mrs. Kusk has been able to relax a bit lately. In recent months, the city has begun adjusting its traffic lights to give pedestrians 15 seconds more to cross the street. It has also been putting in wider sidewalks, shelters for bus stops and stop signs with bigger, easier-to-read letters.
That is not all. Elderly residents like Mrs. Kusk, who walks and cycles around town and insists on being independent, can now find emergency call boxes on sidewalks and a ready supply of church volunteers to escort them on errands and visits to the doctor. In addition, Mayor Tom Anderson says, a $1.7 million center for the elderly, largely state-financed, will offer computer and fitness classes, a dinner theater and line dancing. The city has also begun providing many low-income elderly residents property-tax breaks beyond those allowed by the state.
What has gotten into Dunedin (pronounced duh-NEE-din), a town of 35,000 on the Gulf of Mexico 25 miles west of Tampa?
The answer is that it is in the middle of a half-million-dollar effort to make life safer, easier and more appealing to people 65 and older. The reasons have to do partly with some hard generational truths, partly with enlightened self-interest. 
Dunedin is one of more than 40 Florida communities working to be certified as "elder ready" under a program introduced in 2000 by Gov. Jeb Bush and the state's Department of Elder Affairs. The program, Communities for a Lifetime, is the country's most comprehensive effort to encourage independent living by older people, whom Dunedin and the rest of Florida have in abundance.
Communities that meet the program's guidelines will get state help in marketing themselves to retirees, who will then, the thinking goes, buy homes there, pay taxes there and stimulate the local economy. 
"Once you explain the concept to people -- that the whole purpose is to allow elders to remain in their homes with dignity, security and purpose in an elder-friendly environment -- then it makes sense for a community to begin to prepare," said Peg Cummings, Dunedin's coordinator.
Cities in Florida and elsewhere have for years been making adjustments for the elderly, like adding handrails to showers in hotels and, since adoption of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, ramps to buildings. But under Florida's program, communities are making comprehensive changes.
"In the 50's, people said, 'We need to set up an infrastructure to handle all these children,' " said Bentley Lipscomb, director of the Florida AARP. "Well, now it's the reverse."
Florida often confronts issues concerning the aging long before the rest of the country, and for good reason. By at least one measure, it is the nation's oldest state: in the 2000 census, its 2.8 million residents 65 or older accounted for 17.6 percent of its population, compared with 12.4 percent for the nation as a whole. In Dunedin, 40 percent of the residents are at least 65.
Census projections put Florida's figure at 26.3 percent by 2025, with the national figure 18 percent.
"Florida is looked at as the incubator as to what the rest of the country will look like in 20 years," said Terry F. White, secretary of the Department of Elder Affairs. "Because of this, we need to be better prepared than the rest of the nation."
To gain "elder ready" status, a city must demonstrate that it has made changes to help the aged in categories including transportation, medical services and law enforcement. A city that wins approval will be permitted to post signs proclaiming itself elder-friendly and receive promotional support from the state.
Under guidelines issued by the Department of Elder Affairs, the participating cities themselves assess everything from ambulance response times to whether the police department trains officers to spot schemes that bilk the elderly.
The state also encourages communities to look for ways to make everyday life easier for older people, like asking banks to install A.T.M.'s with large buttons and encouraging grocery stores to include checkout lanes exclusively for the elderly.
"This is the most comprehensive program I've heard of," said Charles Jarvis, chairman of the United Seniors Association, an advocacy group. "When Florida moves in a particular direction, other states follow." 
Cities seeking certification are permitted to pick and choose among the state guidelines. 
"This isn't a 'one size fits all' state," said Cathy Brown, executive director of the Council on Aging of St. Johns County, which includes St. Augustine, one of the participating cities. "The whole point is to have each community say, 'This is what we need in our community.' "
So communities begin by evaluating what changes would most improve the lives of elderly people locally. St. Augustine has refurbished its senior citizens' center and added new services there. 
The city also plans to build low-income housing for older residents, and strengthen in-home services for them, she said.
Other cities, however, are still deciding whether to join the initiative. But in the cities where changes are already under way, people like Donald Blades voice appreciation.
"This isn't just elder-friendly," said Mr. Blades, 83, of Dunedin. "It's just plain friendly."

PERSON: Yevgeny Svetlanov 

HEADLINE: Yevgeny Svetlanov, Gifted Russian Conductor, Dies at 73 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Yevgeny Svetlanov, the renowned Russian conductor who led his nation's State Symphony Orchestra for 35 years and was a guest conductor of orchestras around the world, died Friday at his home in Moscow, The Associated Press reported, quoting Russia's NTV television. He was 73.
 A leading interpreter of Russian composers, Mr. Svetlanov's programs were hailed at home and abroad as disciplined, spirited expressions of Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Mussorgsky and Scriabin, but he also performed Mahler, Beethoven and others in the classic repertoire. 
 One of Russia's most versatile musicians, he was known as a gifted pianist and as a composer of symphonies, instrumental chamber music and vocal pieces. But on tours that took him to Europe, Asia and the Americas, he often spoke of his affection for jazz, the big-band sounds of Glenn Miller, even the Beatles.
Born in Moscow on Sept. 6, 1928, Yevgeny Fyodorovich Svetlanov was a child of the Bolshoi. His mother was an actress and his father a soloist with the company, and by the age of 7 he was playing the role of a Cossack boy in Dzerzhinsky's opera "Quiet Flows the Don." He studied with Mikhail Gnesin and graduated from the Gnesin Institute in 1951, and studied conducting at the Moscow Conservatory.
In a career that spanned the last decades of the Soviet Union and the vast changes in Russian life and culture of the post-Soviet era, Mr. Svetlanov began conducting for the Soviet All-Union Radio in 1953 while still a conservatory student. After graduation in 1955, he became an assistant conductor for the Bolshoi Theater, and was its chief conductor from 1963 to 1965.
In 1965, he was named artistic director and chief conductor of what was then known as the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra.
While his tours typically took him to cities across the Soviet Union and to the Communist bloc countries of Eastern Europe, he also performed in London, Stockholm, Paris, Australia and New Zealand. As cultural exchanges with the United States grew, he brought his orchestra to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other American cities.
Reviewing Mr. Svetlanov and the Moscow Symphony performing Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" at Carnegie Hall in 1969, Harold C. Schonberg, the music critic of The New York Times, wrote, "In this work, there was discipline, there was power, and there was a spirit to the playing that made the work an absorbing experience."
Mr. Svetlanov's style was not flashy, and his work was praised as sensitive to detail, grasping and molding the music into a structure, with interpretations that were sometimes sentimental but more usually full of power and free of superficial showmanship. Occasionally, he made news outside the concert halls. In 1986, speaking to an interviewer on a visit to Washington, he denounced a performance at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by the pianist Alexander Torade, a Soviet defector, calling his Rachmaninoff a "catastrophe."
While his remarks were criticized by American cultural leaders as those of a cold warrior, Mr. Svetlanov, who spoke no English, had often scolded the Soviet Ministry of Culture just as acidly. Two years ago, he was dismissed as chief conductor of the State Symphony after Mikhail Shvydkoi, the culture minister, said he was spending too much time conducting abroad.
He had, indeed, partly because the Russian economy was in disarray. In the last two years, he had been an honorary conductor at the Bolshoi and a guest conductor for many orchestras abroad, spending much of his time in the Netherlands.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the Russian conductor Yevgeny Svetlanov in late editions on Sunday misspelled the surname of a pianist critical of his work. (It was correct in a reprinted version yesterday.) He is Alexander Toradze, not Torade.

HEADLINE: Dams, and Politics, Channel Flow of the Mighty Missouri 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: SOUTH SIOUX CITY, Neb. 

 BODY:
Scientists know what is ailing the great rivers of America. They also know how to cure it.
 From the Columbia in the Northwest to the Everglades in Florida, they have been empowered by federal and state governments to take control of ecologically imperiled rivers that have been harnessed for decades to stop floods, irrigate farms and generate power. 
 Instead of demolishing dams, they are using them to manipulate river flows in a way that mimics the seasonal heartbeat of a natural waterway. Scientists have discovered that a spring rise and summer ebb can give endangered fish, birds and vegetation a chance to survive in a mechanized river. 
So far, though, their knowledge has done nothing to alter the flow of water in the Missouri River basin, explored by Lewis and Clark in 1804 and home to 10 million people spread from northern Montana to eastern Missouri. Here, along America's longest river, the politics of regional self-interest have paralyzed change.
By the end of this month, the Army Corps of Engineers will decide whether to alter flows in the Missouri. But no matter what the corps decides, there will be challenges in the courts and a long-running battle will continue in Congress among influential lawmakers representing far ends of the 2,341-mile-long river. In Congressional disputes over the Missouri, parochialism almost always trumps party loyalty and political ideology.
"It seems like everybody's narrow little interest is all they care about," said Jeanne Heuser of the United States Geological Survey, who helped organize a river science conference here this spring on the banks of the Missouri.
The hundreds of biologists, hydrologists and other river experts who assembled here in April agreed that the scientific debate about how best to rescue the Missouri had been over for years -- and the restoration of seasonal river flows had won.
What sounds like a reasoned decision at a scientific conference in northeast Nebraska, however, sounds like a reckless scheme by the time it percolates 400 miles downstream to farms in the flood plain of central Missouri.
"It is a big science experiment and my farm is the guinea pig," said Tom Waters, whose 3,500-acre farm in Orrick, Mo., hugs the river. 
Some of Mr. Waters's land will be inundated by water every few years if the plan for a spring rise becomes federal policy. "The way I see it, these scientists and environmentalists are saying, 'You flood plain farmers have benefited from the river long enough and now it is time for you to hurt,' " he said.
Missouri is the last downstream state on the river and the one with the most people. Across the state, farmers, barge operators, power plant managers and politicians, both Republican and Democrat, regard any deviance from a 60-year-old status quo in river management as a half-baked recipe for spring floods, summer water shortages and chronic financial headaches.
"The science is simply not there to disrupt the economy of Missouri," said Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, a supporter of the river in its current state. 
As it works now, the lower Missouri, which has been dredged, straightened and walled up behind levees, has an artificially reliable supply of water from April to November. Upstream dams hold back the river in the spring so farmers like Mr. Waters can use heavy machinery to plant corn in the flood plain. In the summer, when the river levels would normally fall, dams release water to provide barges with a channel that is 9 feet deep and 300 feet wide, all the way from Sioux City to St. Louis, a distance of 735 miles.
This reliably unnatural river is the principal source of drinking water in Kansas City and St. Louis. Its water helps cool several thermal and nuclear power plants in Missouri.
Mr. Bond vowed to prevent any change in the way the Army Corps of Engineers operates the Missouri. He dismissed the restoration of river flows -- supported in the last two years by studies from the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Academy of Sciences -- as "purely a speculative experiment that would screw up the river."
In four of the last five years, Mr. Bond has attached riders to Senate appropriations bills to prohibit the corps from spending money to change flows in the Missouri.
"Delay is our friend," said a senior member of Mr. Bond's staff.
President Bill Clinton vetoed Mr. Bond's last attempt to attach a no-change rider to an appropriations bill, but President Bush takes a different view. During a campaign appearance in Missouri in 2000, Mr. Bush announced his opposition to changing flows in the river. His Democratic opponent, Al Gore, supported it. 
Mr. Bush carried Missouri, an important swing state, by just 78,786 votes. The river issue, political analysts in the state have said, was a factor in his victory. 
It is a factor in nearly every statewide election in Missouri, so much so that most officeholders, including Democrats like the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, and Senator Jean Carnahan, oppose change in the river.
Their upstream nemesis in the regional river game is Senator Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, a Democrat from South Dakota. Dams on the river have blessed his sparsely populated state with huge reservoirs, which attract fishermen and hunters who spend tens of millions of dollars.
Mr. Daschle supports the changes in river flows that have been requested by the Fish and Wildlife Service to protect endangered species. In particular, he likes the idea of sending less water downstream during the height of his state's tourist season.
Nearly every summer, the corps has to draw down reservoirs in North and South Dakota, as well as in Montana. In drought years, this has stranded docks and marinas hundreds of feet from the water's edge and chased away tourist money. As Mr. Daschle and other upriver politicians see it, their constituents are sacrificing a $100-million-a-year tourist industry so Missouri can keep afloat a $7-million-a-year barge industry. 
"I was delighted that the recommendations of the Fish and Wildlife Service for protecting the river coincide to a large extend with the needs of sportsmen and the recreation industry," Mr. Daschle said, adding that Congress should buy out flood plain farmers and "the few remaining barge operators."
But Mr. Daschle said he doubted that the Bush administration would permit the corps to act on sound scientific recommendations. 
"I have very little confidence the corps will make the changes needed to restore and protect the river," he said. "If that is true, then the only way to succeed will be to battle to a draw in Congress and allow the states, the sportsmen and the environmental advocates to prevail in court."
Behind all the Congressional and legal squabbling lies a 60-year-old master plan for the Missouri River that even the corps now concedes was flawed.
According to the plan, in the wake of World War II, military veterans would settle around reservoirs in the upper Missouri basin. There, they would grow grain on irrigated farms and ship it downstream by barge. But the veterans never showed up and the grain was never shipped. That did not prevent the corps from transforming the Missouri, once a meandering river with countless braided channels that sheltered fish, birds and riverine plants, into a leveed-line ditch. It denuded the lower river basin of its cottonwood forests and killed off four-fifths of its fish. 
Barge traffic never approached corps projections, and it has been declining for decades. "Congress told us to do navigation and has not told us to do otherwise," said Rosemary Hargrave, a senior manager at the corps office in Omaha. "If we had known what the environmental consequences would be, we would have designed the project completely different."
But on the Missouri, as on many highly engineered American rivers, a new design is unthinkable, at least among those who have staked their lives on flood control and other benefits of the original project. On Tom Waters's flood plain farm, the one that will be partly inundated every few years if river scientists have their way and the Missouri rises in the spring, any mention of changing the river to make it "more natural" is greeted with contempt.
"I paid good greenback money to buy land that the environmentalists now tell me should belong to the river," said Mr. Waters, who is 38 and whose family has been farming alongside the Missouri for seven generations. "Well, I don't think so. I am in touch with Senator Bond, and we are preparing ourselves to sue."
But if the corps does not do enough this month to protect two riverine birds and a fish that scientists believe are on the brink of extinction, environmentalists are also planning to sue, for enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.
"You have got great forces aligned against change on the Missouri, and we think the corps will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future," said Chad Smith, who represents the environmental group American Rivers in this part of the country. "It seems the only way to do it is in the courts."

HEADLINE: Two Latin Americas, Two Diverging Outlooks 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
SHUJI MATAGA could not believe his luck. 
 Mr. Mataga, the president of MMC Automotriz, a Japanese-Venezuelan venture, had arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on April 10 to sign an agreement with Hyundai Motor to enlarge his auto assembly plant in northern Venezuela. But antigovernment protests here had turned into an uprising, and dissident military officials were about to remove Hugo Chavez as Venezuela's president in a short-lived ouster. 
 Somehow, Mr. Mataga persuaded his Korean partners, who were growing increasingly concerned, to go ahead with the deal. 
"Volatility here is a way of life," Mr. Mataga, who has lived in Venezuela for three years, said after flying back to Caracas. "I try to look at the basics -- the population, the cheap gasoline, geographic location. Otherwise the situation is truly worrisome."
Under a plan to produce 6,000 small Hyundai cars called Elantras by next year, Mr. Mataga's company, which is controlled by the Nissho Iwai Corporation, a large Japanese trading company, will create about 1,000 jobs in the state of Anzoategui. The cost of the expansion is only about $5 million, but that is the kind of investment Latin American nations have been desperate to get, although with little success outside of Brazil and Mexico.
Latin America is expected to grow half a percent or less this year, even less than last year's measly 0.6 percent economic growth. As worldwide growth slowed, or stopped, last year, foreign direct investment in the region fell by 6 percent, to about $71 billion, compared with the previous year, according to the World Bank.
Such anemic growth perpetuates the continent's skewed distribution of income, with the wealthiest 10 percent of Latin Americans controlling 40 percent of the region's income and the poorest 30 percent accounting for less than 10 percent of it. About 211 million Latin Americans, some 40 percent, still live in poverty, and of that number 89 million do not earn enough to cover basic food needs, according to the United Nations.
But at a time when Europe and North America are each melding into one large market, facilitating investment, Latin America is instead fragmenting economically. Some nations, like Brazil, Chile and Mexico, are pressing ahead with reforms and integration into the global economy, while others, like Venezuela and Argentina, are beset by political problems that create obstacles to growth. The widening economic gaps and differing interests between the two groups, meanwhile, are frustrating attempts at regional trade pacts, like Mercosur, the bloc centered around Brazil, which aspires to be the continent's powerhouse.
Although the number of Latin American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange has climbed from exactly one in 1990 to more than 100 today, few of those businesses have made expansion throughout the region a priority -- or a reality. Brazil has multinationals that manufacture jets and process poultry, for example, but they sell more of their products to nations in Asia or the Middle East than to neighboring countries.
"Latin America is at a crossroads after pushing through with a first stage of relatively easy reforms like privatizing aluminum smelters or airlines," said Moises Naim, a former minister of trade and industry in Venezuela who edits Foreign Policy magazine in Washington. "The really difficult work lies ahead, like reforming tax systems or building hospitals that work. Without attention to these granular issues, the region will continue to suffer from violence and pressure on governments to spend freely, the byproducts of inequality."
How each country proceeds is now more important than ever.
The region is expected to recover in 2003, to perhaps 3.8 percent growth, but only if three things happen: if a global economic recovery led by the United States proceeds, if Brazil elects a president who does not frighten foreign investors and if recessions abate in Venezuela and Argentina, where the government was forced to close the banking system for several days last month to prevent a huge outflow of deposits.
THE economic slowdowns sparked by political crises in those two countries, Latin America's third- and fourth-largest economies, are the exception. Strip out Argentina, whose economy is expected to contract by 10 percent this year, and Venezuela, and Latin America should grow 3 percent this year, said Ricardo Hausmann, a former chief economist at the Inter-American Development Bank who is now a Harvard professor.
Growth varies, of course. The giants, Brazil and Mexico, which together account for nearly two-thirds of Latin America's economy, are expected to grow in the low single digits. The Dominican Republic, with projected growth this year of 4 percent, and Peru, with 3 percent growth, are expected to be the region's best performers.
But all told, the region is not growing fast enough. This year, if Brazil is excluded from the statistics, the regional economy is actually expected to shrink by 1 percent. Yet Latin America needs to grow at least 4 percent to 5 percent a year just to prevent poverty rates from worsening as its population increases.
The economic segmentation of Latin America has a positive side; it may prevent the spread of economic problems in the continent's most troubled parts to other countries. Argentina's dilemma is unique, with politicians unable to cobble together the consensus needed to limit spending by the government. Without such action, Argentina's return to international borrowing markets remains a distant possibility, leaving the government dependent on the unlikely possibility of more investment from rich industrialized countries to finance its day-to-day operations.
Venezuela's problems, meanwhile, are related to policy struggles between Mr. Chavez, a populist president, and the nation's elite. It is seen most sharply at the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, where the two sides disagree on the direction and control of oil policy. For a nation that depends on oil for 80 percent of its export revenue, the tenuous truce between the president and executives at the company is exacerbating uncertainty over the direction of economic policy.
To some, the containment of problems in places like Argentina and Venezuela represents a major step in Latin America's political and economic evolution. As recently as 1994, tension in one part of Latin America could touch off a crisis in another.
When Mexico devaluated the peso that year, the economy of Argentina -- nearly 4,600 miles from capital to capital -- shrank by 3 percent. Even in 1999, Brazil's devaluation of its currency, the real, revealed the vulnerability of currency policy in neighboring Argentina, where a rigid link to the United States dollar exacerbated the already pressing economic stagnation.
According to this school of thought, Uruguay is the only country in the region that may be aversely affected by developments in Argentina.
It may be too easy to assume that foreign investors and Latin Americans themselves have grown more sophisticated in analyzing the region in recent years. Some governments, like the administration in Peru, are worried that losses suffered by large foreign investors in Argentina, particularly utilities and banks from Spain and the United States, may make them wary of acquiring companies elsewhere in the region. Many of Latin America's shared problems, such as dependence on commodities exports whose prices swing widely and on relatively expensive financing from abroad, persist.
BUT the differences among the region's countries have become almost as striking as the region's unequal distribution of wealth.
Mexico, for example, has chosen to uncouple from the rest of Latin America and cast its economic lot increasingly with the United States and Canada. When the United States grows, so does Mexico. As a result, Mexico's reach in international markets has grown, but the country also suffered when the American economy slowed in 2001.
Similarly, Brazil has opened its economy to investment from abroad and has reaped benefits. Its decision to float the real, instead of maintaining a peg to the dollar, not only allowed large Brazilian exporters, like Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer, a maker of small passenger jets, or Sadia, a processed foods producer, to compete better globally, but also put Brazil on stronger financial footing at home.
The Eaton Corporation, a maker of auto parts and aerospace systems based in Cleveland, illustrates the trend. It has increased the value of its plant and equipment in Latin America -- almost entirely in Mexico and Brazil -- to $203 million in 2001 from $193 million in 2000 and $182 million in 1999. Meanwhile, Eaton shrank the total value of its worldwide assets to $2.05 billion last year, from $2.186 billion in 1999.
While Eaton expanded in Brazil, nothing went into Argentina. The one Argentine plant, part of a global division that made truck axles, was transferred to the Dana Corporation in 1997 with the sale of the entire division. Eaton's most recent Latin expansion was a new transmission plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. "We are just now ramping up production," Alexander M. Cutler, the chairman of Eaton, said in a telephone interview.
Earlier, in April 1999, Eaton acquired aerospace equipment plants in Brazil through its purchase of Aeroquip-Vickers. "Anyone who is a student of the Brazilian economy knows that it tends to have large swings, but you have to look through the swings," Mr. Cutler said. "The growth rate has been attractive."
Eaton's eight Brazilian plants -- including three in the Sao Paulo area and one in Rio de Janeiro -- mainly make transmissions and clutches for all sizes of trucks, some of which are exported. As for Mexico, Mr. Cutler bragged about a recently announced $250 million contract from Mercedes Benz to supply transmissions for medium-duty trucks to be sold in Europe and Latin America. Eaton has operated in Brazil since 1958.
Regional integration largely depends on Brazil. There, industrialists and officials at Itamaraty, its elite diplomatic corps, are trying to prevent Brazil's influence in South America from eroding if the United States gets its way in negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas, a hemispherewide trade accord, political analysts say.
The United States, for its part, has been reluctant to give too much credence to Brazil's potential leadership role in the region. A recent move to place tariffs on Brazilian steel exports and a perception in Brazil that the United States is unwilling to budge on protecting producers of soybeans, orange juice, beef and sugar -- commodities where Brazil fiercely competes with the United States around the world -- have reinforced the view in Latin America's largest nation that free trade with the United States is more about rhetoric than action.
In the meantime, individual countries like Chile and Mexico have pursued the expansion of bilateral trade pacts while the effort to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas, dominated by the United States, has stalled.
Until regional trade groups emerge -- or a continentwide trade agreement is reached -- companies face stiff challenges. Mr. Mataga, the Japanese investor in Venezuela, for example, is hoping to increase exports of the cars produced at his plant after starting to sell some models in neighboring Colombia last year. Much of these hopes are hinged on Venezuela eventually negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Brazil, Mr. Mataga said.
In fact, cars from Mr. Mataga's assembly plant could be transported on a highway completed in the late 1990's that connects Venezuela with Manaus, a large city in the Brazilian Amazon. The road was initially expected to bolster trade between the two nations, and although the transport of some goods has increased, stagnation and political instability in Venezuela have prevented closer ties between the countries.
Governments around Latin America are closely following events in Venezuela, where Mr. Chavez's populist policies have led to a lack of confidence in the economy and capital flight estimated at $10 billion a year, said Jose Luis Daza, the emerging markets strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
As Mr. Chavez frightened investors with his battle to exert greater control over the national oil company, parts of Venezuela's economy appeared to be spinning out of control. Inflation is expected to triple, to more than 30 percent, and an announcement last week raising the minimum wage will cost the government at least $600 million, money analysts expect to come from oil revenues.
The listless Caracas Stock Exchange reflects the nation's economic angst. Trading volume has dried up since the mid-1990's, with only one issue, Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, or CANTV, the phone company controlled by Verizon Communications, firmly on the radar screen of foreign investors. Shares in CANTV surged 25 percent the day Mr. Chavez was removed from power, as hedge funds bought it as a bet on Venezuela's economic recovery, said Greg Haywood, a senior analyst at Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco. (CANTV's stock is now trading at preouster levels.)
Yet if Venezuela's economy underscores the region's risks, the economy in neighboring Peru offers a glimpse of Latin America's fragile opportunities. After several years of stagnation, Peru's economy is expected to grow as much as 3.8 percent this year, assuming the government of Alejandro Toledo remains committed to market-friendly policies in the face of persistent opposition to these measures in Congress.
Mr. Toledo, despite a decline in his popularity, has stuck to a privatization program that could generate about $1 billion of revenue for the government over the next three years. Peru's exports, meanwhile, are climbing and would bring more foreign exchange into the country if not for the decline in prices of some commodities, like zinc, that play a big part in the economy.
In February, as problems in Argentina continued to worry investors, Peru successfully sold $1.4 billion in bonds in international markets, its first such sale in 1928. Still, populist demands in Congress -- tax amnesty proposals for example -- have added to concern over a widening of the budget deficit.
"People in Peru have been against the wall for years," Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's finance minister, said in an interview. "We're happy to see the economy grow more than 3 percent this year but we know Peru needs to grow 7 or 8 percent a year to really make an impact on poverty."
MUCH growth rates have been rare in the region, but they do exist in some smaller countries. Through much of the 1980's and 1990's, Chile was the star performer after implementing market-oriented policies, but its growth has slowed after a decade of healthy government spending and a decline in prices for commodities like copper. Then, the Dominican Republic displaced Chile as the region's fastest-growing (though still tiny) economy, with average annual growth exceeding 6 percent from 1992 to 2000.
Growth in the Dominican Republic probably slowed somewhat in 2001, as tourism weakened. Still, analysts point to several important measures implemented in the 1990's, like a special tax structure that protects foreign investors' rights, that subsequently encouraged foreign investment in the island nation of 8.6 million. Companies have flocked to Industrial Free Trade Zones, where more than 400 companies employ about 200,000 people.
Such fundamental steps to opening the economy remain elusive in Venezuela, however, which last week was ranked second to last in a competitiveness list of 49 countries compiled by the International Institute for Management Development of Lausanne, Switzerland. Argentina ranked last. The study was front page news in Venezuela's leading newspapers, testament to the gulf of sentiment between Venezuela's business establishment and blue-sky optimists like Mr. Mataga, the Japanese investor.

Harry and Louise II: The Same, but Somehow Different

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE has been reviving characters from the last 60 years, like Punchy, the thirsty pugilist who peddles Hawaiian Punch; Buddy Lee, the diminutive doll who pitches Lee jeans; Mikey, the eager eater of Life cereal; and the singing cat that asks for Meow Mix. 
 Now, Harry and Louise, the couple who appeared in commercials attacking the Clinton administration's health-care reforms in 1993 and in spots in 2000 urging help for 44 million unemployed Americans, are joining the comeback crowd -- with a twist. 
 The characters have the same names and are being played by the same actors, who are working for the same agency that hired them before, Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli. This time, though, Harry and Louise are seeking public support to fight White House efforts to ban human cloning, saying that cloning for medical research could help fight diseases. The ads are paid for by a group named CuresNow. 
The organization that hired Goddard Claussen to make the 1993 and 2000 spots, the Health Insurance Association of America, is fuming, worried that the cloning of Harry and Louise will cause people to assume -- wrongly -- that the association is taking sides in the cloning debate. Last week, it sued. 
It is exceedingly rare for characters from a campaign for Advertiser X to resurface in a campaign for Advertiser Y. First, "almost 100 percent of the time, it's basically a given" for contracts to stipulate that "when all the fees are paid, the client owns the completed materials," said Jaime Wolf, a lawyer at Pelosi Wolf Effron & Spates in New York. Recycling characters for a different client "seems more like a failure of creativity than an exercise of creativity," he added.
Further, such poaching would undermine the bedrock foundations of product advertising, where the association of merchandise with characters and concepts is the whole point. But characters are far more rare in issues advertising, and Goddard Claussen is a public affairs and public relations agency based in Washington, not a Madison Avenue institution. 
And there are a few cases of reuse, like parodies. (Remember Leslie Nielsen for Coors Light, dressed like the Energizer bunny?) Siltanen/Keehn Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., writes its contracts so that it retains some rights to characters created for clients. That paid off when one, Freeinternet.com, for which the agency created a talking baby named Bob, went out of business owing it $2 million.
"The property became ours," said Rob Siltanen, chief creative officer. So when Viacom developed a sitcom for CBS based on the baby character, Mr. Siltanen was named a co-executive producer. The show ran for six weeks in March and April and may make the CBS fall schedule.
Are viewers ready for "Harry and Louise: The Series"?

Profits at Canon USA Decline in First Quarter
Canon USA of Lake Success, a subsidiary of Canon Inc. (NYSE: CAJ), says that net sales and profits for the first quarter were down significantly from last year's first-quarter results. Nevertheless, they exceeded the company's forecasts. 
 Sales for the quarter were $4.9 billion, a decline of nearly 14 percent from the first quarter last year, when the company reported $5.7 billion in sales. The company showed a first-quarter profit of $238 million, down nearly 31 percent from the $349 million it recorded during the same quarter last year. 
 Toshizo Tanaka, senior managing director for the parent company, said that "harsh global economic conditions" restricted growth but that the company had exceeded its own profitability projections by about 11 percent.

Gain Technology Acquired
Standard Microsystems (Nasdaq: SMSC) of Hauppauge announced on Monday that it had agreed to acquire the Gain Technology Corporation, a privately held company in Tucson. Gain designs integrated circuits and other applications for personal computers. The deal is valued at $34 million.
Gain's proprietary technology will be used in developing connectivity, performance and control devices, the company said.

Swimming With Stock Analysts, or Sell Low and Buy High . . . Enthusiastically

BYLINE:  By NOAM COHEN 

 BODY:
Nasdaq's run for the roses in 1999-2000, the year and a half when the public greeted the arrival of each and every new Internet stock with wild cheers and fists full of money, was buoyed in part by well-heeled analysts who scoped out the crowded stock market field and recommended the winners. Shunning traditional methods for assessing a company's value, they spoke of "paradigm shifts" and and made more TV appearances than David Brenner.
 A star among them was Merrill Lynch's Henry Blodget, who has since left the firm and is now at the center of an investigation by New York State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer. A series of emails subpoenaed by the attorney general's office and filed with the state Supreme Court form part of the case against the company, which Mr. Spitzer argues abused its position as a banker by allowing its business relationships to affect its supposedly objective assessments of stocks. . But the trove of e-mails, some of which are excerpted below, also give a firsthand view of the life in the trenches in late 2000, when Internet stocks started to nosedive. NOAM COHEN 
 In October 2000, the market was already turning, brokers were getting jittery, and sins that were ignored during the boom were suddenly given much more scrutiny. Here, Mr. Blodget receives a feverish complaint from Jeff Sexton, a financial consultant who, like many in the industry, relied on Merrill Lynch's stock ratings. . 

From: Jeff Sexton
To: Blodget, Henry
Subject: Handwritten Infospace Annual Report!?!?
Would you or someone in your office please repsond to the Dow Jones News Service article by Michael R. Sesit October 20 discussing a new study analyzing annual reports of new economy companies? In that article, Infospace's is held up as a "horror story" due to its "high school exam format" and "some pages that are handwritten." . . . A handwritten annual report for a company you have a buy rating on with a price target of $100 is disconcerting to me to say the least. Tell me the article is wrong. . . .
Jeffrey A. Sexton
Mr. Blodget then forwards the email to a member of his research team, with an added request.

From: Blodget, Henry
To: Syer, Virginia
FW: Handwritten Infospace Annual Report!?!?
I am so tired of getting these things. Can we please reset this stupid price target and rip this piece of junk off whatever list it's on. If you have to downgrade it, downgrade it.
So embarrassing.
h
But before his research team can respond, Mr. Sexton writes back with a mea culpa.

From: Jeff Sexton
To: Blodget, Henry
Subject: Infospace Annual Report
My apologies. I have read the 1999 Annual Report for Infospace. While weird and difficult to read, it . . . s eems like the study cited in the article was attempting to bash Infospace and new economy stocks. Surprise.

From: Blodget, Henry
To: Syer, Virginia
Phew. still would love to reset the price target to $30 or something.
Mr. Spitzer alleges that Merrill was slow to react to downturns. The firm, Mr. Spitzer argues, was loath to revise down its recommendations for stocks for fear of losing new business. In this case, another broker is trying to get a true assessment of Internet Capital Group (ICGE).

From: Watkins Jr., Jack M.
To: Blodget, Henry
Subject: ICGE
Henry,
I feel like I need some help with what I should tell my clients regarding ICGE. I have never been hit like this and some of my clients are getting pretty upset . . . 
What do I do?
Thanks, Jack
The reply comes from Mr. Blodget and one of his deputies, Edward McCabe.

From: Blodget, Henry
To: Watkins Jr., Jack M.
Subject: Re: ICGE
Jack,
No hopeful news to relate, I'm afraid. This has been a disaster, and I'm sorry we all have been in front of it. There are no "operations" here to fall back on, so there really is no "floor" to the stock. Lots of investors are just saying the heck with what they've got left, so there is enormous sell pressure and no buying. We see nothing that will turn this around near-term. The company needs to restructure its operations and raise additional cash, and until it does that, there is nothing positive to say...Hope this helps.
Henry and Ed

From: Watkins jr., Jack M.
To: Blodget, Henry
Re: ICGE
Does this mean I should sell it all...
Thanks, Jack
And of course, spin control was paramount. A note from Merrill Lynch's public relations department to Mr. Blodget:

To: Tutschek, Joanne
From: Blodget, Henry
Re: AOL-CNN
CNN called and wanted to know if we are in AOL deal as an advisor. Head of media relations gave them a no comment. If you are asked on Moneyline interview about that say something to the effect that you are not in the loop on that as you are in research not banking. Thanks. Joanne.
According to Mr. Spitzer's office, Merrill's scale for rating companies was meaningless. Ostensibly a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being a strong buy recommendation and 5 being a a sell recommendation. The New York attorney's office argues that stocks being "covered" by the firm were never rated a 5 (sell) - or even a 4 (reduce). But if clients found Merrill's ratings confusing, the following email was sent by the head of Merrill's global research division and forwarded to Mr. Blodget, whose response indicates that even the company's analysts were confused about what the various ratings ought to mean.

Subject: What's a 2-2
Yesterday, at Deepak's monthly meeting we spoke of the need to effectively differentiate our research through a combination of greater spadework on the fundamentals using broader industry sources and more differentiated investment opinions. As I listen to the morning call and read the research it is clear that many of your 2-2 opinions do not seem to be enthusiastic recommendations to accumulate that particular stock. I am sure that comes across to both sales and the investor and therefore does not help either your credibility or long-term franchise. . . .

The message is then forwarded to Mr. Blodget by Chris Burns, title TK, and Mr. Blodgett replies:

Chris,
. . . G iven that we have such things as 2-1's and 1-1's, I also now need to understand exactly what the difference is between "enthusiastically accumulate" -- 2-2 -- and "enthusiastically buy" -- 1-1. And while I'm at it, I probably also need to understand what an "enthusiastically accumulate now and enthusiastically buy later" means -- i.e., 2-1. . . .
Thanks.

HEADLINE: Meg Whitman and eBay, Net Survivors 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
TEN heads nodded in unison around a long conference table as Rob Veres pointed to a large computer display. The scene was the latest of eBay's "Voice of the Customer" sessions, a brainchild of its chief executive, Meg Whitman. A cross-section of those who buy and sell over this huge online bazaar had been invited to eBay's headquarters here to spend two days talking to its executives. 
 In one session, Mr. Veres, a product manager, showed proposed improvements to a feature called "Mr. Lister," which lets users put dozens of items up for sale at the same time. There were murmurs of praise. Then Mr. Veres brought up an option that would let sellers specify that an auction would not start until a later date. 
 That was fine, too, the group said, until Mr. Veres said eBay was thinking of charging 10 cents for each delayed auction. 
Cries of outrage erupted.
"Ten cents means a lot to me," said George Ward, who sells jewelry and aviation headsets over eBay.
A dime? Who cares about a dime these days? On eBay, where grandmothers in nursing homes sell side by side with I.B.M., someone cares about everything. Ms. Whitman has forced eBay to care about them.
That goes a long way to explaining why eBay, on Ms. Whitman's watch, has become what Lauren Levitan, a Robertson Stephens analyst, calls "the most successful Internet company left." 
During the Internet boom, the precise and low-key Ms. Whitman was upstaged by flamboyant technologists and entrepreneurial visionaries in other companies. But eBay's diverse and ornery community of buyers and sellers provided all the color the company needed, as well as its engine of growth and the source of the auction fees that made it profitable from the start. As it turned out, what eBay -- like a lot of dot-coms -- needed most was the sort of disciplined management practiced by Ms. Whitman, now 45. She steered clear of many seemingly lucrative opportunities, and instead kept eBay focused on nurturing its trading community, expanding its ranks and the scope of goods it deals in.
So as eBay ponders how high it can go, the ultimate question is just how much business can truly be done by people in attics and garages.
EBay certainly benefited from the great idea of its founder, Pierre M. Omidyar, and the powerful forces that draw buyers and sellers to the most active marketplace. But Ms. Whitman's many fans say she did much more than ride the rocket ship.
"There are a lot of guys who had good ideas, were first, and raised $1 billion who are now out of business," said Richard Perry, president of Perry Capital, the New York hedge fund that hired Ms. Whitman to be chief executive of FTD, the flower company, in 1995. "What Meg has done has taken a brilliant idea, and with execution, monitoring and constant improvement, made it infinitely bigger."
Indeed, today eBay is far more than a fad, far more than what it started as -- a trading post for Beanie Babies and other collectibles. Now two-thirds of the site's sales are for practical goods. This year, eBay expects to sell $2 billion worth of used cars and $1 billion worth of computers. Coming next are event tickets, food, industrial equipment and real estate. Last week you could buy a five-acre parcel in Hualapai Highlands, Ariz., for $3,000 and a classic 1966 Caterpillar D9 bulldozer to clear it for $12,000.
Even as growth has slowed for the handful of dot-coms that survived the explosion of the Internet bubble, Ms. Whitman remains committed to the goal she set in the froth of 2000: Revenue in 2005 of $3 billion and profits of $600 million. That implies that eBay will have to see total sales of $30 billion to $40 billion, more than those of J. C. Penney.
To reach her target, Ms. Whitman will need to continue to expand the range of merchandise eBay sells and build its network of sites in 14 foreign countries. More difficult, she wants a third of eBay's business to be fixed-price sales, offering the convenience and instant gratification offered by Amazon.com, rather than the excitement of auctions. So far results are mixed. Some 20 percent of eBay's sales use its new instant-purchase "buy it now" feature. But Half.Com, a site it bought that sells used books and such at fixed prices, is being trounced by a copycat offering by Amazon.
THEN again, eBay has enviable profit margins and no debt, compared with the heavily indebted Amazon. It may be nothing more than a coincidence, but eBay's managers are largely in their 40's. At Amazon, a majority of the top executives are in their 30's, reflecting the generation of its 37-year-old founder, Jeff Bezos.
Experience is the hallmark of Ms. Whitman, who, after getting an economics degree from Princeton and an M.B.A. at Harvard, stamped her corporate passport at Procter & Gamble, Disney, Bain & Company, Stride Rite, FTD, and Hasbro before coming to eBay in 1998. She had already developed a reputation as an able manager when Mr. Perry recruited her to try to soothe the feathers ruffled when FTD converted from an association to a profit-making company. She developed an emotional advertising campaign and then sold it to FTD's affiliates.
"Meg was willing to mix it up with florists all over the world," said Mr. Perry. "She would shake their hands and kiss their babies." As eBay has thrived, Ms. Whitman has moved into the corporate mainstream. She was invited to be on the board of Goldman Sachs, and accepted. And in February she promised to give $30 million to Princeton to build Whitman College, a new undergraduate dormitory. She and her husband, Griffith R. Harsh, a professor of neurosurgery at Stanford, have two teenage sons.
At eBay, Ms. Whitman is known for delegating responsibility to other managers and focusing on strategic issues. But she will dive into details when things go awry. For example, she took over eBay's computer operations in 1999 after a series of computer crashes threatened to derail its business. 
At management meetings, Ms. Whitman insists that all the other executives voice their opinions on troublesome issues before she expresses her own. By all accounts she listens carefully but does not hesitate to overrule her colleagues. In 2000, for example, she vetoed a deal to buy iBazar, a European auction site that was beating eBay in France and Italy. The price tag approached $1 billion -- too much, she felt. The next year, eBay was able to buy it for closer to $126 million.
Financial prudence, in fact, is another Whitman hallmark. Earlier this year, she began a round of cost cutting with some modest layoffs. There was no budget hole that needed to be filled, she insisted. Rather, any company that had grown from 50 to 3,000 employees in four years was bound to have some fat that could be trimmed. But most of all, Ms. Whitman understood that eBay needed to limit its expansion to areas that also benefited customers, or the "community."
"People were worried that auctions were becoming the Wild West," said Rodrigo Sales, chief executive of AuctionWatch.com, which provides tools to eBay sellers. "Ebay has walked the fine line between being a free venue and creating regulation to rein in the excesses."
Ms. Whitman, in fact, has made tough choices. She turned down advertising deals in the late 1990's that could have doubled eBay's revenue because advertisers competed with eBay sellers. (EBay does take some advertising.)
"Meg never got seduced by the easy money," said Robert C. Kagle, a partner at Benchmark Capital, which provided the early financing for eBay. "She understood that if you put up too many billboards in a neighborhood, people wouldn't want to be there."
And in 2000, she walked away from a $30 billion buyout offer by Yahoo hours before it was to be announced because she felt the eBay community was not going to be given enough prominence. "We didn't just want to be auction functionality for Yahoo's shopping channel," Ms. Whitman said.
Ms. Whitman, of course, has made her share of mistakes. She was slow to expand in Japan, letting Yahoo take most of the auction business. And she was too conservative in developing a way for people to use credit cards. PayPal, a money-transfer service, offered $5 bounties to new customers and walked away with the market. But Ms. Whitman has a trait that many chief executives lack: she is not afraid to do an about-face. Earlier this year, eBay simply pulled out of Japan, ceding it to Yahoo. And last month it tried to buy PayPal, which was valued at over $1 billion in its recent public offering, but talks broke down.
"We have been careful to remain humble," Ms. Whitman said. "We have to be free to say what we did didn't work out and we'll try again."
EBay, for instance, originally said it would merge Half.com into eBay's main site, then said it would keep the sites separate. It imposed fees in the formerly free iBazar site in France, only to remove most of them as users objected.
"You have to honor and respond to the community of users," Ms. Whitman said. If that slows down the pace of change, so be it.
EBay seems unusually obsessed with trying to see the world through users' eyes. Employees are encouraged to buy and sell on the site, and they boast of their feedback ratings, or tally of satisfied customers.
"If you give a presentation to Meg, she'll say, 'Great. What do your top 20 sellers think?' " said Josh Kopelman, founder of Half.com. "If you don't know, she'll ask why not."
Similarly, Ms. Whitman set up the Voice of the Customer meetings to bring people to San Jose. At the time of the most recent session, she was in China, but her top management team took visitors to a Japanese steakhouse in San Jose and spent the next day with them, hearing all manner of gripes.
Mr. Ward, who runs the jewelry and aviation products business, complained bitterly that eBay no longer let him include a link to his Web site. Like many eBay sellers, Mr. Ward does most of his business on his own site, findsonline.net.
"Your link policy was a big blow to us," Mr. Ward said. Rob Chesnut, who enforces compliance with eBay's rules, told him the policy helps "the community" by keeping buyers on the site, but Mr. Ward was not convinced. 
Jay Sensese, who sells more than 150,000 CD's a year over eBay, asked why his customers were distracted by banner ads from CDNow, an online album retailer. Jeff Jordan, a former Disney executive who now runs eBay's American operations, contritely promised that the ads would not be renewed.
Jerry Van Nostrand, who became a dealer of 1950's housewares after selling the contents of his mother's house on eBay, said some of his wares were hard to find. "Ashtrays," he grumbled, are listed under "advertising."
Everyone complained bitterly about rising fees. EBay increased its take of sale prices earlier this year by 0.25 percentage points. (The fees range from 1.5 percent to 5.25 percent.) And it introduced a 5 cent fee to use its popular "Buy it now" feature. Ms. Whitman has told Wall Street she hoped all fees combined would rise from 7.5 percent to close to 10 percent of total sales.
"The funny thing about eBay is that people have a love-hate relationship with them," said Debra Schaum, a Bronx, N.Y., computer consultant who sells miniature collectibles. "People spend a lot of time complaining about it, but they are still there."
This complex relationship makes for more than a few challenges for eBay managers, whose every move is ridiculed on eBay's message boards.
"I have never had my job performance criticized so broadly and so openly," Mr. Jordan said. "We are trying to run a corporation that optimizes its profits at the same time we are running one of the more empowering social phenomena of the last decade."
EBay's toughest critic on Wall Street is Holly Becker, a Lehman Brothers analyst, who complains that domestic revenue growth has slowed to an "uninspiring" 45 percent, from 64 percent last year.
Lots of investors wonder about eBay's sky-high stock price -- at $51.28, down from a 52-week high of $72.74, it is still 132 times earnings -- but they do not doubt that its business will continue to grow even if its share price falls.
Ms. Whitman must have some good ideas if she is to meet her 2005 revenue goal. "The $3 billion is Meg's BHAG," Mr. Kagle said, referring to the Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals promoted by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras in their book "Built to Last."
EBay still needs to develop $1 billion in revenue from its international affiliates, plus $1 billion from selling items with fixed prices.
Part of the growth has come as eBay has attracted big manufacturers and retailers like Home Depot and I.B.M. Ms. Whitman herself called on Louis V. Gerstner Jr., then chairman of I.B.M., and Samuel J. Palmisano, then its president -- and now its chief executive -- to persuade them to sell personal computers on eBay.
IT was a complicated discussion, because eBay subjects a Fortune 500 corporation to the same rules as a high school kid in Des Moines selling a few baseball cards -- no volume discounts, no preferred placement, no exclusive deals, no escape from sometimes merciless member feedback. 
In I.B.M.'s case, though, it didn't hurt that eBay agreed to buy $50 million worth of software at the same time.
But even as big companies establish credibility and help bring buyers to their categories, much of the sales activity remains with smaller players. There are mom-and-pop computer dealers that sell more on eBay than I.B.M. does.
One surprising eBay success has been eBay Motors, the used-car section it began in 1999. Playing to eBay's strength, it started by focusing on unusual cars. But soon it reached out to owners and dealers of mainstream cars. This year, eBay expects to sell more than 200,000 cars, with a value of more than $2 billion. 
EBay, which lists about 15,000 cars at a time, still trails other car sites. Autotrader.com has 1.5 million used car listings. Autobytel.com generates 800,000 sales a year for new cars at dealers.
And Jeffrey Schwartz, Autobytel's chief executive, questions whether eBay has the willpower to generate listings from dealers.
"They are so in love with their 80 percent profit margins that they don't have a sales force calling on car dealers," he said. "This is a messy business, and we have 50 people talking to the car dealers every day."
One hallmark of eBay's expansion has been how few people it devotes to finding sellers. It has four new categories it is building this year -- sports, home and garden, tickets and travel. Two people split their time managing all four.
But Ms. Whitman argues that if eBay can keep listening to its customers, as it does with the Voice of the Customer program, the growth will take care of itself.
"It's far better for a car dealer to hear about eBay from another car dealer than for our sales force to call on them," she said. "Buyers attract sellers, who in turn attract buyers, and so on. That's been the success formula in every category on eBay so far."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Europe's Identity Crisis

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: VIENNA 

 BODY:
AS the European Union moves inexorably toward completion, Europeans are awakening to a less sovereign, less comfortable world, prompting the kind of anxiety among the elderly and the poor that continues to feed the growth of the far right.
 The strong showing of the French neo-fascist, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in the first round of France's presidential election seemed a new endorsement of the racism and xenophobia that the 73-year-old has been pressing for 30 years. Though sure to lose to Jacques Chirac in today's final round, Mr. Le Pen has created an earthquake. 
 His anti-crime and anti-immigration themes have found echoes across Europe, from Austria and Italy to Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. But Mr. Le Pen is also tapping into a new anxiety about the loss of national identity, made more acute by the prospect of Europeanization and globalization, which he combines to call "Euro-globalization."
By tying this frightening new world to American actions, Mr. Le Pen is planting ground prepared for him nicely, with fertilizer and nutrients, by France's left, with its complaints about "Coca-colonization," McDonald's and genetically modified food.
"There is a deep concern over issues of personal and national identity in which the hard right is rooted," said Simon Serfaty, director of European studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "People feel an invisible invasion: too many immigrants, the European Union, the intrusion of American culture."
Europeans are discovering that as the European Union completes itself -- both geographically, as it absorbs nations of the former Soviet bloc, and institutionally, with its large library of laws and shared currency -- the nation-state for which so many of their parents and grandparents fought and died is itself dying.
The European Union was born out of the cataclysm of World War II, to save the nation-state. But the concept of union is now inescapable. "Europeans are recycling the nation-states into member-states, which will have to keep to a discipline that will deny them the national sovereignty for which they fought so many wars in the past," Mr. Serfaty said.
Tied to all that change is an anxiety that swells from the bottom: that Brussels will not take care of its citizens as gently and lovingly as the national capitals have in the past.
Faceless European institutions now define national monetary policy and regulate what people drive, what is safe to eat, even how they dispose of their garbage.
Added to these sacrifices of traditional liberty, of course, is the phenomenon of immigration, with the citizens of the colonial empires Europe fought to create now returning to the metropole -- but darker, younger, poorer. This becomes wrapped up in an increased and hardly illegitimate fear of crime, which itself becomes tied to the fear of Muslim terrorism that followed Sept. 11, linking terrorism and foreigners.
The main question for Europeans, Mr. Serfaty said, is "how do you become something different without being turned into something else, or something less?"
EUROPE's major parties have had little to say to this anxiety, said Christoph Bertram, director of the Institute for International Affairs and Security, which advises the German government.
"It's political correctness, but we're not airing issues like immigration and crime," said Mr. Bertram. He pointed to the large numbers of Europeans who say politics is not relevant to their lives. "The establishment pretends that these are not serious issues, or if you raise them you side with the unwashed and the fascists."
Exploiting a general disappointment with Europe's mainstream politicians, evident in the lower voter turnout, Mr. Le Pen and others who have modernized their fascism, like Jorg Haider of Austria and Pim Fortuyn of the Netherlands, have made extraordinary showings in percentage terms. Mr. Haider drew 27 percent in 1999; Mr. Fortuyn polled more than 34 percent in local elections in Rotterdam, and is expected to win 20 of 150 seats in Parliament in elections May 15.
Mr. Haider, Mr. Le Pen and others have discussed forming a pan-European party to counter the European Union, a threat centrist politicians are taking seriously.
Timothy Garton Ash, an Oxford-based historian, sees Europe's "greatest single failure" in its inability "to integrate immigrants from the European periphery as European citizens." The correlation between the Le Pen vote and the percentage of "non-E.U. foreigners" in France, displayed by Le Monde in a color map, is startling. Europe's greatest challenge, beyond job creation, Mr. Garton Ash said, "is coming up with our own European notion of the American dream."
For Mark Hunter, a researcher at Insead, a business school in Fontainebleau, France, Mr. Le Pen's success is partly explained by the failure of mainstream politicians of left or right to have any serious answer to crime and immigration. Worse, he said, "the left has been hammering for years on the menace to French culture and identity of American culture." By doing so, "the left helped legitimize the idea that French culture is in danger of disappearing, and this has helped to legitimize the discourse of the French far right. The National Front has explicitly made the connection."
Mr. Le Pen argues that French culture is at risk from American ideas, spawned by a "mongrel nation," being adopted by the European Union. 
The left was supposed to have answers for the working class. But with the collapse of Communism and the left's move to the center -- as in Britain -- the left has run out of ideological gas. 
For Christopher Patten, the foreign-policy commissioner for the European Union, the challenge of the far right requires a serious pan-European answer. "If politics doesn't seem to have a purpose, you leave a vacuum into which people with simple solutions and xenophobes can slip," he said. "We need to ensure that the institutions we create Europe-wide are properly democratic and accountable, so people feel they own them."
But for many of Europe's disenchanted, attracted by the far right, Mr. Patten -- urbane and unelected -- is the disease for which he purports to be the cure.

HEADLINE: Afghan Warlords Squeeze Profits From the War on Drugs, Critics Say 

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: GHANIKHEL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
On entry to this town, beside a sprawling concrete-walled mosque, stood what was probably the world's largest openly declared market for raw opium and heroin.
 From the mid-1990's, Ghanikhel's bazaar was the base for hundreds of merchants working from shops enclosed in a mud-walled maze, protected by a battalion of armed guards. The Taliban lashed and even executed Afghan drug users, but hundreds of tons of opium, and thousands of pounds of its derivative, heroin, were smuggled over donkey trails leading from here into Pakistan, and on to the West. 
 The Taliban banned poppy growing under American pressure two summers ago, in an effort to win an easing of stifling economic sanctions that had been imposed because of its harboring of Osama bin Laden. But Ghanikhel kept on trading, and while its supplies dwindled, its prices shot up. 
But at the end of April, Ghanikhel's status as the company town came to an end. One dawn, trucks of soldiers sent by an American-backed warlord an hour's drive away, in Jalalabad, raided the market, seizing three truckloads of opium, heroin and bundled cash, and tons of the chemical acetic anhydride that is needed to refine opium into heroin.
Seventy traders were arrested and thrown into a dank, fetid detention cell -- with no windows, no lighting and no sanitation -- in the wall of an old royal palace in Jalalabad.
The American-backed interim government in Kabul portrayed the raid as evidence of its earnestness in ridding the country of evils of its past. It was also a bold response to an ultimatum from the United States, Britain and other coalition partners that the interim government, under Hamid Karzai, had to cut off the drug trade to start the flow of $4.5 billion in reconstruction and development aid pledged by donor nations in January.
"America and the rest of the international community told us flatly, 'Either you do this, or we won't give you the help that was promised at Tokyo,' " said Hajji Adbul Qadir, the warlord who sent his son, Zahir, to Ghanikhel to direct the raid, and in the process to bring the hoard of drugs and cash back to a strongroom at the 18th-century palace. 
"We knew what we had to do," he said, "and now it's up to America and the rest of the world to keep their promises to us."
But people who monitor the drug eradication program -- poppy farmers, relief officials, and even officers in the militias of various warlords -- cast doubt on how successful the interim government has been, both here and across four eastern provinces. These critics say the crackdown, now a few weeks old, is showing many of the hallmarks of the wider ills besetting Afghanistan. Warlords, these people say, have hijacked the program and turned it into a way of gouging cash for use in recruiting new followers, paying soldiers and acquiring weapons. Many of the crops the warlords claim to have destroyed continue to yield opium gum, and farmers mill about every day at the warlords' gates complaining that they have been denied the money that is their due.
Before Mr. Karzai began the crackdown, poppy growers in this region and in the province of Helmand, in the southwest, seemed to be on their way to producing an opium crop of about 1.9 million tons, as predicted by the United Nations Drug Control Program. If the crackdown succeeds, even in part, tons of heroin might never reach the streets of Europe, where 90 percent of Afghan production has usually gone.
After the Taliban's collapse, drug barons in Pakistan and Afghanistan hoped to restore Afghanistan to the position it held in the late 1990's as the world's largest single-country source of raw opium, with a crop of about 5,000 tons in 1999. That figure dwarfed other countries and regions, including Colombia and the Golden Triangle region of Southeast Asia, which produce much of the heroin sent to United States.
Several times a week, American or British military helicopters land at the Jalalabad airport with strongboxes carrying cash for the drug eradication program. Afghan officials say that Britain, the United States and the World Bank have so far provided $80 million to Mr. Karzai's government for the poppy farmers.
The cash is then supposed to be distributed to the farmers at the rate of about $700 per acre for every poppy crop destroyed -- about a tenth of what they might have earned from raw opium, but substantially more than they would have received from wheat.
But monitors of the program say that much of that $80 million has been siphoned off by the warlords and local tribal chiefs, or maliks, who rule the hinterland under the warlords' protection. One reason this is possible is that warlords, and Afghan relief officials under their domination, have been left in control of the eradication program. The United Nations drug control agency, after years of experience in Afghanistan, has been frozen out of the operation.
Critics say the warlords fabricate reports of the crops destroyed, so that some fields are left intact, or only partly eradicated. Entire districts, including several in the Jalalabad area that produce some the richest opium in the country, go untouched, with farmers and sharecroppers working from dawn to dusk, scoring poppy capsules with razor-edged scrapers that cause the opium gum to flow.
These critics say the eradication program has become a crucial source of income for the warlords as they build their power bases ahead of a loya jirga, or grand tribal council, that is to convene in early June to choose a provisional government to succeed the Karzai administration and lead Afghanistan to elections in mid-2004. This means that the warlords have a strong interest in seeing that the eradication program remains a job only partly done.
While the three warlords who confront each other in Jalalabad have all nominally backed the eradication program, there are many signs that it has become another arena for the maneuver, deceit and double cross that are endemic wherever Afghan warlords compete.
The bitterness of the rivalry in this strategically crucial region of eastern Afghanistan -- astride the main trade route linking the Afghan heartland to Pakistan -- was thrown into relief when a powerful bomb exploded in a central Jalalabad square in April just as two of the warlords, Mr. Qadir and Hazrat Ali, were driving into the square with Mr. Karzai's defense minister, Muhammad Fahim, on his first visit to Jalalabad since the Taliban collapsed.
The bomb, hidden in a construction crew's generator, narrowly missed the vehicle carrying the three men, but killed 27 bystanders and injured more than 60 others.
Initial reports suggested that the bomb might have been set by drug barons. But the talk now is that the bombing grew out of tangled local politics. Aides to Mr. Qadir handed out photographs showing the third warlord, Hajji Zaman, peering from a nearby corner at the bloodied bodies only moments after the blast. 
Mr. Zaman's aides say it was his job to protect General Fahim, and that was why he stationed himself in Talashi Square. But Mr. Qadir, in an interview in the royal palace, strongly hinted that he suspects Mr. Zaman in the bombing. Asked if he thought it significant that Mr. Zaman was close at hand when a bomb nearly killed his two principal rivals, Mr. Qadir laughed and said, "A lot of people are asking that question, and I'm asking myself the same question." 
After the raid that put the Ghanikhel opium market out of commission, Mr. Zaman's loyalists, who nominally control the area, began challenging accounts of the raid. They said that Mr. Qadir's claim that the raid netted 4,400 pounds of raw opium, 550 pounds of heroin and 8,800 pounds of heroin-producing chemicals hugely understated the amounts actually taken. Mr. Qadir has indignantly denied the implication that he acted to hoard the drugs himself.
On a tour of the empty Ghanikhel Market the day after the raid, local police officials loyal to Mr. Zaman said Mr. Qadir's men had filled a large truck and two pickups with bundles of opium and heroin. The men took away at least 44,000 pounds, the district police chief, Muhammad Nassem, estimated. "They left nothing," he said.
Outside Ghanikhel were miles of undisturbed poppy fields, their pink and white flowers already shed in a sign that the crops had reached harvesting time, their opium capsules swollen to the size of tennis balls. 
Mr. Qadir, the governor, was frank in expressing his anger at the United States and Britain for pressing the poppy eradication program at a politically sensitive time when the Karzai government is mobilizing for the national council in June. There is also the worry, others say, that popular opinion in poppy growing areas could swing back toward the Taliban.
In the poppy fields around Ghanikhel, farmers out tapping the poppy capsules for gum were equally indignant, saying that for crops already planted the West should offer compensation much closer to the sums the farmers would earn from selling the opium gum.
"We don't do this because we like it, we know it is wrong, but we are poor," said a farmer who gave his name as Jameel. 
Holding a patty of freshly tapped opium gum in his hand, wrapped in the poppy plant's leaves and tied with twine, the 33-year-old farmer said he had expected an income of $5,000 from his poppy fields, but would get less than $1,000 if the fields were destroyed under the compensation scheme. But he owed more than 70,000 Pakistani rupees -- $1,160 -- to a local drug baron, he said, and faced ruin and punishment if he could not repay. 
"When the Taliban fell, we were happy, because they took away our freedom, they forced us to go to the mosques, they made us grow long beards," he said. "But now we are not happy, because the governments that control Karzai, the American and the British, are cruel. They freed us from one evil, and now they have delivered us into another one."

HEADLINE: Russian Oil and U.S. Security 

BYLINE:  By Leon Aron; Leon Aron, director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, is author of a biography of Boris Yeltsin.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With another oil shock looming thanks to Saddam Hussein's decision to suspend Iraq's oil exports and to the turmoil in Venezuela -- not to mention Saudi Arabia's recent, brief waving of "the oil weapon" -- the need to broaden the range of America's energy sources has become urgent.
 One underappreciated source is obvious: Russian oil. Russia is the world's single largest non-OPEC oil exporter, with 10 percent of currently known oil reserves and 9 percent of world output. Yet Russia's irregular, "spot market" deliveries to the United States are a fraction of 1 percent of American imports. By contrast, Iraq's share of American imports last year was 7 percent; between them, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iraq, OPEC members all, accounted for 34 percent. 
 To be less dependent on any one of these sources would help stabilize oil prices and lessen American vulnerability to political blackmail. Americans are not in the habit of looking to Russia for help in enhancing our security. But Russia has been transformed in the last 10 years, and Vladimir Putin's solidarity with the United States since Sept. 11 has sealed that transformation.
A decade of privatization of the Russian oil sector has been a success. Since the mid-1990's, Russia's "big six" oil companies have invested an estimated $5 billion in exploration, equipment and rehabilitation of oil fields damaged by Soviet policies. Twenty years ago most experts thought Russia would have to import oil. Instead, it has increased production by 15 percent in the past two years and is poised to pump 11 percent more this year than last. Last February, Russia pumped more oil than Saudi Arabia.
At the same time, Russia has striven to create the conditions for private business -- domestic and foreign -- to thrive. From demilitarization, privatization and de-Bolshevization in the Yeltsin era to last year's flat 13 percent income tax and other pro-business measures, Russia has progressed enormously since the end of the cold war.
Moscow has also guarded its freedom to maneuver in oil politics. Through the fall of 2001, Russia resisted OPEC's demand to reduce exports, thus shielding the American and European economies from higher energy costs. The other two leading independent exporters, Mexico and Norway, followed suit. Moscow eventually said it would cut exports by 150,000 barrels a day -- but went on to increase production, showing that it remains fully independent of OPEC.
Russia is awash in oil, and while Russian companies are busily acquiring assets in Europe, the ultimate prize is America. President Vladimir Putin is likely to raise the issue of Russian oil with President Bush at the summit on May 23 to 25 in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
The obstacles to Russian oil exports to America, however, are formidable. The first problem is transport. Russia's major oil fields are thousands of miles away from the deep-water ports that oil tankers require.
Getting Russian oil to America's West Coast from terminals on the Pacific Ocean in the Russian Far East -- the shortest route -- will require spending billions to put in pipelines from western Siberian oilfields and to develop the rich Magadan and Chukotka shelves in the extreme Northeast. Although the Russians can tackle parts of the problem themselves -- the state pipeline company Transneft announced last month that it would invest $5 billion in a pipeline from southern Siberia to the Sea of Japan -- drilling in eastern Russia and transporting the oil will not be possible without outside investment.
Partnership with American oil companies is critical. There have been some joint ventures in recent years: the acquisition in 2000 of Getty Petroleum Marketing by Russia's largest oil company, Lukoil, for example, or Exxon's $4 billion partnership last year with Russian, Japanese and Indian companies for deep-sea drilling around Sakhalin. But American companies remain wary of getting too close to Russian counterparts that only recently abandoned some very unscrupulous business practices, including strong-arming minority shareholders and wresting some of the richest oil fields away from foreign co-owners through corporate shenanigans.
American oil companies are perfectly able to gather information and make their own investment decisions. Nonetheless, given our need to broaden our range of energy sources for security reasons, Congress and the White House ought to collaborate on legislation giving tax incentives to American oil companies investing in Russia. In exchange, President Bush should seek the Russian government's commitment to enforcing fairness, transparency and predictability in regulation, taxation and repatriation of profits.
The Bush administration should also consider applying some pressure to the European Union. The union's current rule -- no more than 30 percent of total E.U. imports can come from a single outside source -- greatly hampers Russia's ability to bring more oil to the world market.
Even if the Russians were to succeed in getting the capability to reach American oil buyers, there should be no illusions: the displacement of the Persian Gulf in America's energy market is going to be neither total nor swift. Yet a sizable Russian presence in American markets over the next decade will be enough to provide a critical safety margin for energy prices and increase stability in American oil supplies.

 BODY:
Bill should not be the next Oprah.
 That's silly. 
 He should be the next Ozzy.
After all, as one network executive says of the prolix ex-president: "How could he be an interviewer? He only wants to hear himself talk."
There is a delicious symmetry in Bill Clinton's exploring the idea of a daytime syndicated talk show: the man who brought Oprah-style psychobabble and misty confessions to politics taking the next step and actually transmogrifying into Oprah. 
Last Wednesday, Mr. Clinton and his pal, the TV producer Harry Thomason, met in Mr. Thomason's Burbank office with NBC honchos Jeff Zucker and Andrew Lack.
News of the meeting generated hilarity. The New York tabloids both blared "Bubba TV" and speculated on whether the former president would consider a BBC offer to be Regis on a new quiz show. David Letterman wondered whether Mr. Clinton "could be the first president ever to be impeached and canceled."
But the meeting with NBC did not generate a deal. As it turned out, the president didn't want to be Oprah. The ultimate survivor, the man who managed to avoid being expelled by the tribal council in Washington, does not want to sink to the level of the lurid real-life drama cherished by networks. He wants to raise the intellectual tone. He's been toying with the notion of a serious, issues-oriented "town hall" meeting shown weekly.
As one top TV executive yawned to The Times's Bill Carter, "Who's going to watch a show like that?"
Trust Bill Clinton to turn everything upside down and inside out.
When he was in the Oval Office, where he was supposed to be high-minded, he kept lapsing into low rent. Now that he's mulling a career in a medium that loves low rent, he wants to be high-minded.
Mr. Clinton thought he would get beyond the misdeeds of his presidency by doing Jimmy Carteresque good deeds in his post-presidency. Through his foundation, he planned to devote himself to religious and racial reconciliation, economic empowerment and citizen service.
Yeah, right.
It was hard enough for Sunday Morning Bill to keep Saturday Night Bill at bay when he had all the rigors and restraints of the White House and first lady in place.
How is he going to do it now that he is prowling around the world, dining with Chris Tucker, lunching with Robin Williams, playing golf with Jack Nicholson and partying with New York socialites?
Besides, Clinton the Elder Statesman is a tough sell. President Bush didn't even acknowledge his Democratic predecessor's offer to help out in the Middle East. And as The Times's Don Van Natta reported last week, Mr. Clinton is struggling to raise the $200 million he needs to build his library in Little Rock. Many big-pocketed donors were put off by his pardon of Marc Rich, and some wonder why they should give money to someone making $150,000 for a 30-minute speech. Mr. Clinton is learning that it's easier to bring entertainment to the world of issues than issues to the world of entertainment.
Perhaps the man who reshaped presidential campaigns when he answered the boxers-or-briefs question on MTV and played saxophone on Arsenio Hall should return to his roots. Let Bill be Bill -- on cable.
A passel of washed-up celebrities are vying to be the next Ozzy Osbourne -- reports say Ozzy has been offered $20 million by MTV to continue letting cameras record him puttering, coloring and scratching.
Mr. Clinton may not have any tattoos and his brain is intact, but the spectacle of Bill 24/7 would certainly be entertaining for us, and gratifying for him, giving him all the attention and love he craves.
We could watch our ex in all his myriad moods -- fun-loving, intellectual, angry, self-pitying, lip-biting, gluttonous, flirtatious. 
Bill alone and restless, padding around the kitchen in Chappaqua, C-Span going in the background, desperately dialing up Tony in London, Donatella in Milan, Hillary in D.C., shaking awake Oscar the Valet to play hearts and listen to him scoff at Bush's Mideast diplomacy and Gore's Midwest strategy.
Bill housebreaking his new Lab puppy. Bill ordering a vente white chocolate extra-whip mocha at the Starbucks in Harlem, complaining to the cashiers that his post-presidential life is not being taken seriously enough.
"It would bleep rule," as Ozzy says.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Sudan to Divide Oil Income as Step to Peace 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 4 

 BODY:
President Bush's special envoy for Sudan, John C. Danforth, has recommended that the Sudanese government share its oil revenue with rebels as part of an effort to end a decades-long civil war.
 Rebels of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting for self-rule for the southern part of the country, have been attacking oil installations, including a 900-mile pipeline spanning the country. The rebels say oil provides the money that pays for the Islamic government's military campaigns against the mostly Christian and animist south. 
 In the report delivered to the White House last month -- which has yet to be made public -- Mr. Danforth argues that oil, which has long been a central element in the conflict, could also be a factor in peace, according to officials and a draft copy of the report. 
"No enduring settlement to Sudan's war can be achieved unless the oil dimension is effectively addressed," Mr. Danforth says in the draft of the report. "It should be possible to find a monetary formula for sharing oil revenue between the central government and the people of the south who could use it for the purpose of economic development."
Some critics of Sudan's government have urged that foreign investment in the oil industry be halted until the fighting ends, but Mr. Danforth has taken the view that oil could be used to bring the warring parties together.
"The prospect of major foreign investment and of the greatly increased oil production revenue likely to result from that investment should serve as a powerful incentive for the Sudanese government and the S.P.L.M. to reach agreement," he says, using the abbreviation for the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, the rebels' civilian arm. 
However, the Sudanese government has already rejected the notion of an oil deal. "The petroleum is a national wealth owned by the Sudanese people and cannot be an object of compromise," Ali Osman Taha, the first vice president of the National Islamic Front, told reporters in Khartoum on Wednesday.
He did say, however, that the government would be willing to grant the south "a special status in the oil revenues for improving services and achieving stability there."
Another Danforth recommendation, reported recently in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was more in line with the Sudanese government's thinking. Mr. Danforth suggested that dividing Sudan into two countries was not feasible and should be shelved in favor of one country where differences are respected.
In Sudan last year, Mr. Danforth noted the lack of infrastructure in the south and how difficult it would be for the poor region to thrive on its own.
Representatives of the rebels, based here in Nairobi, and some critics of the Sudanese government in the United States dismissed the oil proposal as a naive approach toward dealing with a government that breaks promises as fast as it makes them. "The international community, led by the U.S., must demand a suspension of oil development pending a just peace," said Eric Reeves, a professor at Smith College.
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, in its own recent report on Sudan, recommended that the government put oil revenues into an internationally administered trust fund that would be divided between the north and south and spent solely for development purposes.
Meanwhile, in Congress, some lawmakers have been pushing for a legislation that would remove from American financial markets any oil companies doing business in Sudan. The legislation, which was passed in the House of Representatives but has stalled in the Senate, is principally aimed at Talisman Energy Inc., the only Western oil company operating in Sudan.
For its part, Talisman argues that its presence in the country allows it to push the government toward moderation.
The discovery of oil by an American company, Chevron, helped revive the Sudanese war in 1983. But the company pulled out of Sudan the next year after rebels killed three of its employees. Sanctions imposed in 1997 restrict American companies from doing business in Sudan.
A consortium of Malaysian, Chinese, Canadian and Sudanese companies now pumps an estimated 220,000 barrels a day out of Sudanese wells. In the next few years, the government expects to more than double that production, making the country one of the world's medium-sized producers.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
China Finds Way to Beat Chip Limits

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 5 

 BODY:
Despite earlier efforts by the United States to keep China behind the high-technology curve, the country is fast catching up with America's ability to make advanced semiconductors, the computer chips that run everything from rice cookers to missile guidance systems.
 Already, two semiconductor plants in China have ordered equipment from Europe and Japan capable of etching circuitry just 0.13 microns wide, or less than one one-hundredth the width of a human hair. Such tiny circuitry is used in the smallest, fastest and most powerful computer chips in world. The two Shanghai companies that have ordered the equipment, Semiconductor Manufacturing International and Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing, could start manufacturing made-to-order chips with superfine circuitry as early as next year. 
 Export controls that were intended to restrict the sale of such chip-making technology to China have lost their teeth, largely because the United States no longer has a monopoly on any of the roughly 250 processes used to manufacture computer chips.
"If the U.S. won't sell us a piece of equipment, we can get it elsewhere," said Joseph Xie, an American-educated native of Shanghai who returned to China last year to work for Semiconductor Manufacturing International, which was founded by Richard Chang, a Taiwanese businessman.
The general availability of the most sophisticated chip-making tools poses a problem for Washington, which has long wielded cumbersome export controls meant to ensure that American technology does not fall into the hands of China's military. It is part of a broader challenge to keep an American edge at a time when commerce often trumps politics and the line dividing commercial and military technology is increasingly blurred.
American executives say that if the United States does not relax its grip on semiconductor manufacturing equipment shipments to China, American makers of such gear will lose more and more sales as nimbler competitors meet China's quickening demand for the sensitive machines.
Though American companies created the semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials industries decades ago, Japan took over several critical areas of the market in the 1980's and today is the leading supplier of several key pieces of equipment, including lithography machines that miniaturize circuitry designs and use lightwaves to transfer them onto thin silicon wafers. 
European companies, too, now make and sell much of the equipment, chemicals, gases, films and other materials needed to make integrated circuits. The result is that anyone wanting to build an up-to-date semiconductor plant no longer needs to turn to the United States.
So, the chip-making technology is flooding into China, raising concerns that it could help the country turn its enormous yet inefficient army into a streamlined, high-technology force.
Chinese government institutes have bought some of the most sensitive equipment, including some from Germany that could be used to manufacture radiation-hardened electronics and solar cells for satellites, high-power radio-frequency weapons and infrared sensors and imaging equipment.
A report recently released by the Government Accounting Office in Washington warned that China's new chip plants gave China's military an important source of custom-made integrated circuits not subject to foreign export controls. That makes China's communications, surveillance and missile guidance equipment "less vulnerable to foreign disruption during a protracted conflict," the report said.
The report called for a review of American export-control policy, which it said had been aimed at keeping China two generations behind American industry in semiconductor manufacturing. It quoted an unidentified senior official of the Defense Department as saying that China's advancing chip industry "will have direct application in future military systems," including advanced phased-array radar used to track missiles.
To control the dissemination of such sensitive technology, the United States is a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement, an information-sharing forum that was created in 1996 to succeed the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls. The forum's 33 participating countries agree to maintain export controls on a long list of sensitive technology and to notify the group of any sales.
But the Wassenaar Arrangement does not have the binding status of a treaty, and each country is free to decide what it will export to whom.
"Think how bad the Japanese economy is," said Nasa Tsai, president of Grace Semiconductor. "They love to sell."
The United States, for that matter, also approves most equipment sales. But it can take six months or more for American companies to secure an export license. By that time, many have lost the sale.
Last year, Semiconductor Manufacturing International dropped plans to buy a piece of sophisticated equipment from a California company after waiting months for the United States to issue a license. It placed a multimillion-dollar order with a Swedish company instead.
"We love to do business with the U.S., but we can't wait forever," Mr. Xie said. "Europe and Japan are getting the business." 
China's semiconductor industry consisted of a handful of relatively primitive plants just a few years ago, but it has grown quickly as manufacturers shift operations here to feed the fastest-growing computer chip market in the world.
The country is already the world's biggest cellular telephone market and is expected to surpass Japan as the second-biggest personal computer market next year. All those devices need computer chips -- $12 billion worth last year. A multinational industry association, Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, predicts that China will be the world's second-biggest consumer of computer chips by 2010, behind only the United States.
Hoping to wean China from dependence on foreign technology, Beijing has made self-sufficiency in the manufacturing of computer chips an economic and strategic goal.
A decade ago, it began wooing semiconductor manufacturers with tax breaks and cheap land, and today there are at least a dozen silicon-wafer fabrication plants in various stages of planning or construction in China. More are expected as Taiwan eases its rules barring investments in semiconductor manufacturing on the mainland.
With billions being spent on clean rooms filled with high-technology gear, China has become the world's most promising new market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials. Sales to China are expected to reach $7 billion next year.
Applied Materials, a Silicon Valley company that is the industry leader in chip-making equipment, predicts that 20 percent of its revenue could come from China in the next 10 years, assuming the United States government streamlines its export controls.
Otherwise, said Jennifer Connell Dowling, the director of public policy at the industry trade group, "the U.S. is just giving the market away."

HEADLINE: With 'Spider-Man,' and Others, Sony Seeks to Revive Fortunes 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 5 

 BODY:
Giddy fans lined the red carpet at the movie premiere of Sony Pictures' "Spider-Man" here last Monday evening.
 "Can you sneak me in?" a young woman in a U.C.L.A. sweatshirt and persuasively short skirt whispered to a photographer. A talent agent, picking up his passes, crowed to his date, "This is going to be huge." 
 But it may have been an awestruck 12-year-old boy who captured the essence of this pop-culture moment. "They're going to make $85 million their first weekend," he gasped. 
He was off by about $30 million. "Spider-Man," which opened in theaters last Friday, shattered the box-office record for any opening weekend, taking in an estimated $114 million. That far exceeded the previous record of $90 million set last fall by "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." 
A big debut for "Spider-Man" was what Sony executives had been hoping for last Monday at the post-screening party, where guests sipped Green Goblin martinis and raved about Tobey Maguire's star turn in the title role. "We have a lot riding on this film," said Sir Howard Stringer, the chief executive of the Sony Corporation of America, whose Columbia Pictures unit released "Spider-Man."
Columbia hopes "Spider-Man," and its summer lineup of other would-be blockbusters, can return the studio to a status it has not known since 1997, when Columbia and its Sony Pictures siblings made $1.3 billion at the domestic box office -- still a record -- with hits like "Jerry Maguire," "Air Force One" and "Men in Black."
Since then, Columbia has had more bombs than blockbusters, and its share of the domestic box office has been no higher than fourth place. But in Hollywood, where fortunes change with the whims of moviegoers, Columbia is, for a few minutes at least, the envy of its peers. 
Other hoped-for hits Columbia will be rolling out through mid-July include sequels to "Men in Black" and "Stuart Little." There is also "Enough," a thriller with Jennifer Lopez, as well as "Mr. Deeds," an adaptation of the 1936 Columbia classic "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."
The Sony Pictures Entertainment division, which besides Columbia includes the Sony Pictures Classics and Screen Gems units, also has a production deal with Revolution Studios, the company formed by Joe Roth, the former chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Sony is banking on a summer hit with Revolution's "XXX," an action film starring Vin Diesel and directed by Rob Cohen, who teamed up last year on "The Fast and the Furious."
Sony executives in the United States know a big year may be essential to stay in favor with their bosses back in Tokyo. Since the Sony Corporation of Japan bought Columbia and other assets for $3.4 billion in cash in 1989, Sony Pictures Entertainment has covered its costs and made a profit only once -- last year, after cutting costs by $150 million.
The biggest belt-tightening came at Sony Pictures' television production operation, which has cut back sharply on the number of shows it will produce. 
"We asked ourselves the tough questions in each of Sony Pictures' businesses to ensure the underlying economics made sense in the current environment," said Robert S. Wiesenthal, chief financial officer of Sony in the United States.
Hollywood executives have made a sport of speculating if or when Sony executives in Japan might simply give up and sell the entertainment properties, which also include the Sony Music Group. Unlike other media companies, Sony -- a foreign-owned company -- cannot own a broadcast or cable network, which critics say has hampered its growth. But Sir Howard says that Sony is intent on pursuing its long-nurtured notion of melding entertainment with the consumer electronics business, a strategy he said the company's executives would amplify this Thursday at an investor conference.
Sir Howard has explored merging Sony's PlayStation video-game assets with the company's entertainment properties and forming a separate company, according to several executives apprised of the plan, who say the idea failed to muster interest in Tokyo. Last fall, Sony Pictures also had merger discussions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But these executives say the deal was scotched by Sony officials in Japan, who feared they would be forced to share power with Kirk Kerkorian, M.G.M.'s largest shareholder.
Now, even if Columbia hits the summer sweepstakes, the questions include how much profit these expensive films will make and whether the studio can sustain momentum. "Other studios have had big years, then seen profitability fall the next year," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "The trick is to keep it going forward." 
That may prove particularly challenging because John Calley, the 72-year-old chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, is set to retire next year. Much of the credit for Columbia's summer slate lands squarely at the feet of Mr. Calley and Amy Pascal, 44, chairwoman of Columbia Pictures, who oversees development and production at the studio.
Mr. Calley, a seasoned studio executive, held top spots at Warner Brothers and United Artists before joining Sony Pictures in 1996 at Sir Howard's behest. Ms. Pascal, who has spent most of her career at Columbia, with a brief detour to oversee production at Turner Pictures, took the top post at Columbia in 1999, after three years as president.
Mr. Calley is largely credited with bringing stability to a studio that was in disarray when he arrived. Costs had spun out of control in the 1990's, and the decision to make movies was handled largely by committee.
"One would like to say it's a rational business, but the fact of the matter is, it's all gut," Mr. Calley said in an interview last week. "If I like a movie and Amy likes it, we make it. If not, and we still make it, we should be thrown out."
The years 1998 and 1999 were lean ones at Columbia, with duds like "Jakob the Liar" and "Crazy in Alabama" offsetting the occasional hit like "Stuart Little" and the Adam Sandler comedy "Big Daddy." Ms. Pascal, meanwhile, had acquired something of a reputation as a booster of "chick flicks," like "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" and "Girl, Interrupted," which failed to ignite at the box office.
Ms. Pascal sighed into the phone last week when asked about that reputation. "If they don't work, they are called chick flicks," she said. "If they work, they are just movies."
She pointed to the success of "Charlie's Angels," the 2000 Drew Barrymore-Cameron Diaz-Lucy Liu romp that grossed $264 million worldwide. And she noted "Panic Room," the current Jodie Foster thriller, which cost an estimated $45 million but has already taken in $89 million at the domestic-box office.
"No one is saying that is a chick flick," she said.
But Ms. Pascal acknowledged that in 1999 she began to re-evaluate the type of movies Columbia was making. The lineup needed to be more varied, she concluded. And she had to develop more film franchises and closer ties to actors. 
Mr. Calley had similar ideas, which is why Columbia is now big on sequels -- including one for "Spider-Man" that is already in production. "Having four pictures you can make each year gives you a plausible cornerstone," he said. "It's like, if we don't, we're dead meat."
For her part, Ms. Pascal said she was now more focused on buying audience-friendly concepts. "I wanted to buy things I loved, but they also had to pass the 'Friday-night test,' " she said. "That means if you had a lousy week, have to pay a baby sitter or take a bus, you were going to go see that movie. Before, I was making movies that I love, but did not have that sense of urgency."
To secure franchise talent, in 2000 she cemented multifilm deals with superstars like Ms. Barrymore, Mr. Sandler, Ms. Lopez and Will Smith. "This year's slate wouldn't exist if I didn't have the experience of 1998 and 1999," Ms. Pascal said. But she does not assume she has forever solved Columbia's problems.
During the "Spider-Man" premiere party last week, Ms. Pascal doubled over when a guest offered his record-breaking estimate of what the studio could earn at the box office this year. "I don't want to know!" she said, cupping her ears with her hands. "That's too much pressure. I just want to make good movies."

PERSON: Yevgeny Svetlanov 

HEADLINE: Yevgeny Svetlanov, Conductor, Dies at 73 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Yevgeny Svetlanov, the renowned Russian conductor who led his nation's State Symphony Orchestra for 35 years and was a guest conductor of orchestras around the world, died Friday at his home in Moscow, The Associated Press reported, quoting Russia's NTV television. He was 73.
 Mr. Svetlanov was a leading interpreter of Russian composers, and his programs were hailed at home and abroad as disciplined, spirited expressions of Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Mussorgsky and Scriabin, but he also performed Mahler, Beethoven and others in the classic repertory. 
 One of Russia's most versatile musicians, he was known as a gifted pianist and as a composer of symphonies, instrumental chamber music and vocal pieces. But on tours that took him to Europe, Asia and the Americas, he often spoke of his affection for jazz, the big-band sounds of Glenn Miller, even the Beatles.
Born in Moscow on Sept. 6, 1928, Yevgeny Fyodorovich Svetlanov was a child of the Bolshoi. His mother was an actress and his father a soloist with the company, and by age 7 he was playing the role of a Cossack boy in Dzerzhinsky's opera "Quiet Flows the Don." He studied with the composer and musicologist Mikhail Gnesin and graduated from the Gnesin Institute in 1951. He studied conducting at the Moscow Conservatory.
In a career that spanned the last decades of the Soviet Union and the vast changes in Russian life and culture of the post-Soviet era, Mr. Svetlanov began conducting for the Soviet All-Union Radio in 1953 while still a conservatory student. After graduation in 1955, he became an assistant conductor for the Bolshoi Theater, and he was its chief conductor from 1963 to 1965.
In 1965, he was named artistic director and chief conductor of what was then known as the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra.
While his tours typically took him to cities across the Soviet Union and to the Communist bloc countries of Eastern Europe, he also performed in London, Stockholm, Paris, Australia and New Zealand. As cultural exchanges with the United States grew, he brought his orchestra to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other American cities.
Reviewing Mr. Svetlanov and the Moscow Symphony performing Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" at Carnegie Hall in 1969, Harold C. Schonberg, the music critic of The New York Times, wrote, "In this work, there was discipline, there was power, and there was a spirit to the playing that made the work an absorbing experience."
Mr. Svetlanov's style was not flashy, and his work was praised as sensitive to detail, grasping and molding the music into a structure, with interpretations that were sometimes sentimental but more usually full of power and free of superficial showmanship. Occasionally, he made news outside the concert halls. In 1986, speaking to an interviewer on a visit to Washington, he denounced a performance at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by the pianist Alexander Toradze, a Soviet defector, calling his Rachmaninoff a "catastrophe."
While his remarks were criticized by American cultural leaders as those of a cold warrior, Mr. Svetlanov, who spoke no English, had often scolded the Soviet Ministry of Culture just as acidly. Two years ago, he was dismissed as chief conductor of the State Symphony after Mikhail Shvydkoi, the culture minister, said he was spending too much time conducting abroad.
He was indeed, partly because the Russian economy was in disarray. In the last two years, he had been an honorary conductor at the Bolshoi and a guest conductor for many orchestras abroad, spending much of his time in the Netherlands.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the Russian conductor Yevgeny Svetlanov in late editions on Sunday misspelled the surname of a pianist critical of his work. (It was correct in a reprinted version yesterday.) He is Alexander Toradze, not Torade.

HEADLINE: For Illegal Workers' Kin, No Paper Trail and Less 9/11 Aid 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
In his telephone calls to Mexico, Victor A. Martinez Pastrana had told his wife little beyond the fact that he lived in an apartment in Manhattan with a friend, whom he simply called "Chava," and washed dishes in a restaurant he never named at the World Trade Center with a fellow Mexican from Puebla. 
 Illegal immigrants like Mr. Martinez Pastrana by necessity lead lives with few traceable details, but now that traditional survival tactic has come back to haunt his wife, Rosario Arrazola. Mr. Martinez Pastrana, who was 38, is believed to have disappeared in the rubble of the towers on Sept. 11, leaving Ms. Arrazola with the almost impossible task of trying to prove that her husband worked there. Without such proof, she has been unable to obtain a death certificate and may be shut out of a range of financial aid available to survivors. 
 And without the death certificate, she said, she is not protected by a Mexican government policy under which her house payments would be forgiven. 
"This house is the only patrimony that my husband left me, and I'm about to lose it," Ms. Arrazola, who has three children, said in a telephone interview from Puebla.
Illegal immigrants who were the breadwinners for families not just in Mexico, but in Ecuador, Colombia, Pakistan and West Africa died in the collapse of the World Trade Center. Mostly men, they worked in all-but-invisible jobs as delivery boys, kitchen aides and maintenance workers. They were often absent from official payrolls, sometimes rooming with other men who had no family in the city, leaving few if any traces to avoid deportation.
But in the aftermath of a tragedy in which terrorism was the great equalizer, the survivors of these victims have encountered unique problems in navigating the bureaucracy of death, say lawyers, immigrant groups and consular officials.
And while many have received charitable contributions from the Red Cross, private groups and churches, they are also being denied significant financial assistance, because more often than not, they are also here illegally. 
"It's the coldest form of discrimination imaginable," said Bill Granfield, president of Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. "We've been able to get them short-term assistance, but their long-term prospects are very much in doubt."
Among the 43 members of Local 100 lost at Windows on the World Restaurant, 15 were illegal workers, 13 of them male, Mr. Granfield said. He said relatives were covered by life insurance, and the union also helped them secure charitable aid by filling out paperwork, gathering documents and even obtaining legal representation to push applications for aid through. 
But unlike the families of legal workers, these relatives are not eligible for much of the assistance that helps rebuild lives, such as unemployment insurance, state workers' compensation and federal Social Security benefits for survivors. 
The illegal status of the survivors also means they do not qualify for federal assistance like subsidized housing and emergency help with bills and food, lawyers handling their cases say. Even some private organizations have denied aid to illegal immigrants or given them less, some lawyers and immigrant groups said.
The National Association of Realtors, for instance, gave away $8.3 million to more than 1,000 families -- more than half of that to families in New York -- to help them meet rent and mortgage payments so they would not lose their homes. But recipients had to be citizens or legal residents. "We wanted to support the families of people who were here legally," said Steve Cook, a spokesman for the group.
But this stance has curtailed aid to one of the neediest groups, some lawyers for the immigrants argued.
"These deaths left behind women who by virtue of their culture, their lack of education, their lack of fluency in English and their child-rearing responsibilities, will have difficulties getting jobs, and they're living off whatever assistance they get," said Debra Brown Steinberg, a partner with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and one of the lawyers working free for immigrant families affected by the terrorist attack.
The exact number of illegal workers who died at the World Trade Center is not known, but it is believed to be small. Nonetheless, their survivors have faced obstacles that have complicated not only their recovery, but their grieving. Some immigration groups have called for the government to grant legal residency to survivors who lost loved ones to terrorism. 
A 25-year-old widow in Queens said her main problem was finding a low-cost apartment for her and her young child after her husband, who made about $3,000 a month, disappeared. "They ask for a Social Security number," she said of landlords. "They ask me if I work, and when I say no, they think I won't be able to pay for the apartment."
A 34-year-old Canadian woman whose husband was an American and was sponsoring her application for legal status says she is now in limbo, not knowing whether she and her two children will eventually be forced to leave the country.
"Starting over with them would be like losing again," she said.
Unlike most widows, who saw their husbands just hours before they died, Ms. Arrazola said she last saw hers in April 1999, when he set out to cross the border illegally through Tijuana, looking for a better-paying job. 
On Sept. 11, she watched the tragedy unfold from afar, then came to New York with her children last November to give DNA evidence. She was flown here by the Red Cross. 
No boss greeted her to give her condolences. She did not know where to go to retrieve her husband's personal belongings.
She knew so little about him in New York, she said, because when he called home with calling cards every 15 days around 9 p.m., he usually had more pressing business than to talk about himself. Instead, he would use up his cards saying hello to his three children and trying a little long-distance child rearing. "I'd complain to him and then I'd put on the child who misbehaved and he'd tell him to obey me," Ms. Arrazola, 35, said. 
Ms. Arrazola said she knew her husband was gone only when his calls stopped. Their oldest son's birthday was Sept. 13, she said, and there was no call from his father.
"He never missed calling on a birthday," she said.
Ms. Arrazola's husband is among 16 illegal immigrants from Mexico whose families reported them missing after the trade center attack. The reports were made to the Mexican Consulate in New York City. 
Norberto Terrazas, the consul in charge of legal affairs, said that in 12 of the 16 cases, relatives were still waiting for a death certificate, mostly because some of the information needed to prove that the person was at the trade center had been hard to come by. There are no payroll check stubs and receipts for remittances, for instance, if workers were paid in cash and they sent money to relatives with friends, he said.
City officials say safeguards are required to prevent fraud and that the decision on death certificates is ultimately that of the Surrogate Court of the City of New York. Those who do not meet the court's criteria must wait for the identification of remains or for three years to petition the court directly, they said. 
Other family members are still trying to prove their loved ones' employment in the towers and struggling with requirements that legal residents can easily meet, said Joel Magallan, a Jesuit brother who is the executive director of Asociacion Tepeyac de New York, a group that has been coordinating relief for relatives of undocumented victims. 
In recent weeks, Tepeyac has tried to coax employers to report names. "Our lists could expand," he said.
There are better situations. Families whose loved ones belonged to unions have received significant support in pursuing their claims, and in some instances getting visas for children and other relatives overseas to reunify families. Some employers have been forthcoming in identifying illegal workers and providing evidence of employment. 
A major source of financial assistance to survivors -- the federal Victims Compensation Fund -- is available to those illegally in the country. Kenneth R. Feinberg, the official who oversees the fund, said he had tried to reassure families that they could apply without fear of deportation. He said the same immunity from prosecution had been offered to employers who hired illegal workers so they could come forward with financial information. But he conceded that it might be difficult for people who worked off the books to meet some requirements, such as proving economic loss. 
In Puebla, Ms. Arrazola makes do by selling tostadas, chalupas and fritters from her doorstep. She said she had received scholarships for her children's education this year and about $9,000 in aid, with checks from a cultural institute in Mexico, from the Tepeyac Association, and from the Robin Hood Foundation.
She said her husband of 18 years had left for the United States because his children, who attended private school, were approaching college age and what he made as a chef in Mexico would soon hardly be enough.
"He always thought education was the least we could leave them," she said.
Mr. Martinez Pastrana's first trip back home was scheduled for this coming July, when his eldest is to graduate from high school. 
But he never set a return date to come home for good. He used to tell his children the towers where he worked were so high he was really not that far. 
"I can see you all from here," he said.

HEADLINE: Cory Booker for Mayor in Newark 

 BODY:
Politics in Newark has never been a garden party. So it comes as no surprise that Cory Booker, an impressive 33-year-old member of Newark's City Council, has found himself in rough territory as he challenges Mayor Sharpe James in the city's May 14 mayoral election. Mr. James, who has been in the job for 16 years, deserves credit for lifting Newark from an urban wasteland to a slowly recovering metropolis. What the city needs now is a dynamic new leader unencumbered by Newark's long, corrosive history of machine politics who can take it to the next level. Cory Booker fits the bill. He can move Newark forward with better schools, more job opportunities and more hope for prosperity for all Newark residents.
 This race is the 66-year-old Mr. James's first real political test since he took the mayor's job in 1986. Known for years as a one-man cheerleading squad for the city, Mr. James helped lower crime, add jobs, demolish decrepit buildings to make way for development and promote a stylish new performing arts center to anchor downtown. 
 Nevertheless, he has run the city like a fiefdom, rewarding friends and punishing foes to promote his increasingly limited vision of the next stage of progress. One sign of the raw patronage system that fuels his power is that almost a third of Mr. James's campaign contributions come from city workers.
Mr. Booker has a less-conventional political pedigree and a more far-reaching set of proposals to advance the city. He grew up in a middle-class New Jersey suburb and attended Stanford, Oxford and Yale. Yet he has chosen to live in one of Newark's poorest housing projects in one of Newark's poorest areas, which he serves as a councilman. From that vantage point, he has been hearing firsthand about how Newark works for the less fortunate. He has outlined impressive plans to raise the quality of life citywide, lowering crime not just in the new business compounds but in elderly housing and projects like his own. He pledges to work with the state in more creative ways to improve Newark's failing schools. He has also persuaded many business leaders that he can best attract new investments to turn Newark into a thriving and more commercially competitive city.
There are several troubling aspects to the Newark campaign, and none reflect well on Mr. James. The strong-arm tactics of his supporters are deplorable. They have harrassed Mr. Booker's campaign workers, including a filmmaker trying to videotape the mayor in public, and disrupted meetings by locking the halls or by shouting Mr. Booker down. Equally disturbing is the racial subtext that Mr. James has introduced. Though both men are African-Americans in a city that is slightly more than half black, the James campaign has constantly tried to characterize Mr. Booker as a candidate who represents white, moneyed interests outside the city. Such charges do both candidates a disservice, shortchanging Mr. Booker and making Mr. James seem desperate.
Mr. Booker has presented many imaginative ideas to spur Newark's renewal, including streamlining the city budget process and campaign finance system, as well as modernizing policing to target pockets of drug or gang activity more effectively. A few of his proposals are more problematic, including his endorsement of vouchers for the poorest students, which could end up eroding public support for public schools. That said, Mr. Booker clearly offers Newark a more dynamic alternative. He has great empathy for the poor and the will to make the city the bustling urban center it deserves to become. For these reasons we endorse him in the race for mayor of Newark.

HEADLINE: The Peril and Profit in Bagging Big Antlers Behind High Fences 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: LOMETA, Tex. 

 BODY:
The seven-mile fence around Randy Shipp's rugged Central Texas ranch stands eight feet tall, because his most lucrative animals can jump seven feet.
 Mr. Shipp owns cattle and horses, but first and foremost he is a deer rancher. He has a breeding shed, where he tries to engineer prize bucks using $500 samples of deer semen. He fattens his herd with metal feeders. And he collects his reward every winter, when hunters arrive from around the country and pay him $4,000 each to shoot a trophy for the fireplace. 
 "White-tailed deer have kept this ranch a family ranch," said Mr. Shipp, 47, who says he cannot earn enough from farming and cattle. "If I need to sell my cows to keep my deer herd, I will."
More than a century ago, ranchers began hemming in the frontier with barbed wire. But with cattle ranching rarely profitable today, more and more high fences like Mr. Shipp's have risen across rural Texas and in other states, enclosing so-called game ranches, where the money comes from raising and hunting white-tailed deer. A host of ethical, economic and environmental questions are rising, too.
Hunters debate the fairness of what critics call canned hunts. Biologists debate whether game ranches help spread chronic wasting disease and other wildlife plagues. Game ranchers, meanwhile, argue that high fences protect habitat and help preserve it from encroaching development.
The ranches are controversial in many Western states with vast public lands. Wyoming and Washington ban them, while Oregon allows them for raising meat or breeding, but not hunting. Montanans approved a measure in 2000 restricting game ranches and banning paid hunting on them. Legislation on the issue is pending in Eastern states, including New York and Pennsylvania.
In Texas, where 97 percent of the land is privately owned and as many as four million acres are believed to be behind high fences, public opinion appears divided. Politicians have passed laws permitting the high fences, though without addressing the questions that arise as private landowners fence wildlife, a public resource. The ranches have even won support in some unlikely quarters. 
"Not only am I in favor of the practice of using high fences to breed deer for contract hunting," Joe Nick Patoski wrote in a Texas Monthly article titled "A Tree-Hugger's Case for High Deer Fences," "but also I think it may be one of the few good things to happen to the land in this state since the days of the open range."
Dr. James Kroll, director of the Forest Resources Institute of Texas at Stephen F. Austin State University, says game ranches help not only habitat, but rural economies, too. "The way we look at it is, anything that preserves wild places is a win-win for nature, especially for wildlife," he said.
The first high fences in Texas went up in the 1930's, to enclose African animals in exotic-game ranches, which still exist. But high fencing for native white-tailed deer, and the industry that has grown with it, has taken off only recently. Texas certainly does not suffer a deer shortage; it has four million, one for every five people.
Dr. Robert D. Brown, head of the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Science at Texas A&M University, regularly spars with Dr. Kroll at public meetings on wildlife issues. He says game ranches can be likened to "deer feedlots" and can also upset the ecological balance, especially if ranchers, eager to improve hunting, keep too many deer.
"The fence itself is not the issue," Dr. Brown said. "Really, the issue is what goes on behind the fence."
Rumbling along in his pickup on a dirt road through oak trees and prickly pear, Randy Shipp said he was sensitive to criticism that fenced hunting was not true hunting. On an hourlong drive, a handful of deer could be seen flashing through the trees, but the deer, and the fences, were mostly out of sight.
"You can basically see that it's not a canned hunt," Mr. Shipp said.
He began ranching in Central Texas three decades ago, when he managed more than 6,000 acres of farmland and cattle pastures for an uncle. In 1975, after his uncle died, Mr. Shipp began selling leases to deer hunters and made $400 a month on low-fence hunting alone. The estate was divided among relatives, and Mr. Shipp said that today his was the only parcel still in ranching.
"If the white-tailed deer industry is destroyed, this ranch here will be nothing but homes for people in Austin," he said.
Mr. Shipp surveyed his ranch by helicopter in 1989 and found only 20 deer. He put up a high fence in 1990, and halted hunting for three years to rebuild his deer population. He got a state permit to double the deer hunting season to four months, in return for restoring natural habitat. He has more than 130 deer today, and he said native plants and turkeys and other wildlife had also rebounded.
In winter, hunters come from as far as New York for three-day trips. Those seeking trophy bucks spend $4,000 to be guided by Mr. Shipp. He limits the number of bucks killed each year and forbids the shooting of animals near feeding stations. But about 85 percent of his hunters bag a trophy buck.
This helps explain why the Boone and Crockett Club, which oversees national hunting records, refuses to certify deer shot inside high fences. The club said an animal must be able to escape in a fair hunt, yet Jayar Daily, a club spokesman, allowed that it was possible to have "fair chase" within high fences, depending on a ranch's terrain and size. Still, neither the club nor anyone else has drafted guidelines to clarify the issue.
Animal protection advocates point to abuses, like the shooting of animals near feeding troughs or breeding pens. The most potentially far-reaching concern is disease. Chronic wasting disease, akin to mad cow disease, has spread through deer and elk in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Montana. Some experts believe the transporting of captive deer and elk has allowed the disease to spread. In a preventive move, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission last month banned imported white-tailed deer.
The emphasis on bagging a big deer that is a central attraction of game ranches also concerns some hunters.
"My personal feeling is that the emphasis on the size of the antlers has done two things," said Charlie Jeffers, who owns a low-fenced, 3,000-acre ranch in the Texas hill country. "It's shifted the emphasis to be on the animal harvest, rather than the hunting experience. And it has increased the price of hunting to an extent where a lot of people aren't able to participate."
But Mr. Shipp was philosophical. "As the barbed wire was going up, everybody thought it was bad," he said. "Now, everybody wants their places fenced. We're just in changing times."

HEADLINE: Korean Leader Quits His Party Over Scandal 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, May 6 

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea resigned from his party today in a bid to insulate it from corruption allegations surrounding his children and several close aides.
 The resignation followed the arrest on Saturday of Kwon Ro Gap, a close associate of Mr. Kim, on charges of bribery and stock manipulation. Two of Mr. Kim's three sons also face summonses by prosecutors. They are suspected of peddling influence in return for bribes. 
 "I can't find words to describe my apologetic feeling," Kim said in a statement read by his chief of staff, Park Jie Won. "I and my wife spend every day in agony." 
Mr. Kim's resignation comes at the start of an intense campaign to succeed him that will culminate in presidential elections in December. The move appeared calculated to help the candidate of his governing Millennium Demo cratic Party, Roh Mu Hyun, by disassociating himself from the party's affairs well before the vote. In recent opinion polls, Mr. Roh has appeared to be the early front-runner in an intensely competitive race to succeed Mr. Kim.
Two former presidents, Roh Tae Woo and Kim Young Sam, also quit their parties on the eve of elections, at the request of their parties' presidential candidates. 
Mr. Kim resigned from the leadership of his party in November in a similar bid to defuse the escalating corruption allegations. The investigations of the president's two sons, however, are expected to accelerate with Mr. Kim's departure from the party. One of the sons, Kim Hong Gul, is in the United States and may return to South Korea as early as next week, promising renewed attention to the corruption allegations.

North Pulls Out of Economic Talks
 SEOUL, South Korea, Monday, May 6 (Reuters) -- North Korea said today that it was pulling out of economic cooperation talks planned for this week in Seoul. The North's official news agency blamed its action the South Korean foreign minister for making "reckless remarks" during a recent visit to Washington when he said the North had edged back toward talks in part because of the tough stance against it by the United States.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Corporate boards are supposed to represent shareholders. Why aren't they more democratic?

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
THE Hewlett-Packard proxy fight was seen as a rare example of shareholder democracy in action, of corporate life imitating the rough-and-tumble of politics. 
 It ended last week when a Delaware judge dismissed the suit brought by Walter B. Hewlett, who had accused Hewlett-Packard's management of rigging the shareholder vote that narrowly approved the company's purchase of Compaq Computer. After a proxy contest that was costly, acrimonious and personal -- often resembling a presidential campaign in tone and tactics -- the court challenge in Delaware was the business equivalent of the Bush-Gore fight in Florida after the 2000 election. 
 But back to the issue of corporate democracy. Why does it seem so rarely in evidence? And why do the checks and balances in corporate governing not work more effectively to prevent abuses like Enron's or astronomical pay for executives at companies whose fortunes, and stock prices, have declined? 
Mr. Hewlett, an heir of William Hewlett, a Hewlett-Packard co-founder, is no grass-roots populist. He is to corporate democracy what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York is to political democracy -- testimony to what money and a brand name can do. And as a director, Mr. Hewlett, according to his own testimony in court, missed the board meeting when strategy behind the Compaq merger was explained in detail, and he never asked to hear that strategic assessment. Listening to any promerger arguments did not seem to be a priority for Mr. Hewlett.
Yet Mr. Hewlett's campaign of opposition to the merger very nearly won for two reasons. First, many Hewlett-Packard stockholders shared his "grave concern" that the Compaq merger was a bad idea, reasonably enough, given the poor track record of big mergers in the computer business. Second, his dissent was bound to get a thorough, sympathetic hearing because having a board member publicly object to a management-backed deal is so unusual. And Mr. Hewlett did so in the shadow of the Enron scandal, a cautionary tale of the perils of a board that did not stand up to management.
Time and events will determine whether Mr. Hewlett was right or wrong about the Compaq merger. But his arguments on the need for more open, democratic governing practices in corporate America resonated well beyond the computer industry.
Mr. Hewlett made his case most eloquently after the proxy contest was over, in a speech before the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington. "Despite more than 200 years of political practice in the United States, democracy remains an ideology strangely alien to many corporate boardrooms," he told his audience. "And too many corporate executives still fail to distinguish dissent from disloyalty."
"At the very least," he said, "boards must be pried loose from the grip of management and its hired hands."
Experts in corporate governance say that directors are too often selected by chief executives, who tend to choose people likely to be agreeable for one reason or another. The so-called outside directors may in fact be other members of the chief executive club, or they may be suppliers, customers or consultants who do business with the company. 
"You want governance to act as an insurance policy against abuses," said Patrick S. McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large shareholders on corporate governance matters. "And having truly independent directors who are really doing their best to serve the interests of shareholders is the best safeguard."
A corporate board can be thought of as a parliamentary form of government. The shareholders are the citizen-owners who elect the board members as their representatives. And the board members then select, monitor, compensate and, if necessary, fire the chief executive. That is the theory anyway, but in practice the board too often merely ratifies management's proposals instead of serving the shareholders.
The complaint is not a new one. In 1868, a popular magazine, Hours at Home, wrote, "Stockholders' rights are no more considered by the managers of some of our colossal railway corporations than the squeezed rind of the lemon whose juice has given a passing flavor to the fluid which stands in the directors' private room." 
Colleen A. Dunlavy, a business historian at the University of Wisconsin, argues that the road to the present predicament began in the 1850's with the shift in corporate governance from one vote for each person to one vote for each share. "This signaled the demise of the shareholder as citizen of the corporation," Ms. Dunlavy wrote in a recent academic paper.
But organized shareholder rights activism is a relatively recent phenomenon. Many of today's corporate governance professionals and shareholder advocates really had their start in the 1980's. With their stock holdings increasing steadily, pension funds found themselves owning a significant slice of corporate America, and the Labor Department ruled that in the interests of the workers and retirees the funds represented, they had to vote their shares actively.
The biggest pension funds also held sizable stakes in most major companies, so they could not easily register dissatisfaction by trading in and out of companies. They were the modern buy-and-hold investors. Some of the pension funds, led by the nation's largest, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, started pressuring poorly performing companies and pushing for governance reforms, like independent boards.
Executive pay was high on the list of changes advocated by some pension funds and shareholder rights groups. The goal was to align the interests of managers more closely with those of shareholders, and the perceived way to do that was to compensate them more with stock -- to give executives an economic incentive to behave like owners.
The idea was sound, but it opened the door to the abuse of stock options in recent years. Executives reap huge gains in good years, but are often bailed out in bad years by having their options repriced or by being issued new options that can be exercised at a far lower price.
Once again, boards that are beholden to management are to blame, investor groups say. "Executive compensation is a barometer to show that at large publicly traded companies, markets are not working efficiently," said Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, an organization of large pension funds. "And the basic problem is simple. When fifth-graders pick their teachers, fifth-graders get A's."
So what steps can be done to move toward greater board independence? One step favored by corporate governance experts is to have all board members selected by a nominating committee of nonmanagement directors. That is at best an evolutionary step, though, if the current members of the nominating committee owe their board seats to the chief executive. Another suggestion is that the board should have its own financial and legal advisers -- not the management's team -- when a company is weighing a major strategic step, like a merger.
Michael C. Jensen, a corporate finance and governance expert, argues that the single most effective reform would be to "effectively remove the chief executive as chairman of the board, to have a nonmanagement chairman who sets the agenda."
The advantage, says Mr. Jensen, a former professor at the Harvard Business School who is a managing director of the Monitor Group, would be to make sure there is a certain balance of power in the boardroom. Mr. Jensen points to measures like auditing, the process of formulating and ratifying strategy, and evaluating and compensating senior management as "functions that are best separate from the chief executive."

HEADLINE: Old Hewlett Is Preparing To Show Off Its New Look 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Ever since Hewlett-Packard announced its plan to buy Compaq Computer last September, A. M. Sacconaghi, a computer analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, had been an outspoken critic of the deal.
 But last Thursday -- after the long bitter proxy contest waged by Walter B. Hewlett had finally ended, with a court ruling in favor of the company and a concession by Mr. Hewlett -- Mr. Sacconaghi issued a buy recommendation on Hewlett-Packard, his first in nearly two years. 
 He said he changed his mind for two reasons. First, Hewlett-Packard shares have dropped about 25 percent since the deal was announced, from $23.21 a share to $17.44 on Friday. Second, Mr. Sacconaghi pointed to "the enormous and diligent effort" Hewlett-Packard and Compaq had put into planning how the two companies are put together. So, he says, the new company can achieve sizable cost-cutting gains over the next year or so, partly by eliminating 15,000 workers from a combined payroll of 150,000.
His stance sums up the net effect of the proxy fight, one of the most heated and costly in corporate history. Mr. Hewlett's campaign of opposition has focused investors, analysts and the company on the many hurdles that must be overcome to make the merger a success.
Yet the counterattack of persuasion, led by Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, resulted in a recognition, even if grudging among skeptics, that the planning behind the integration of the two companies has been swift and thorough.
Evidence of the progress will be announced this week. Today, shares in the combined company will begin trading under a new stock symbol, HPQ.
But the official introduction comes tomorrow with a news conference in Palo Alto, Calif., and presentations to employees and customers.
The 100 largest corporate customers will be told who will be handling their accounts at Hewlett-Packard, given a thick "playbook" of the company's product road map (which products stay and which will be eliminated over time) and the transition plan will be detailed. Other customers, industry partners and computer resellers will be given the product briefings soon.
The company Web site, www.hp.com, has been fine-tuned so that starting tomorrow, customers should be able to get information on products from both companies using an integrated search feature. The next paycheck that the former Compaq employees receive will have the Hewlett-Packard logo. Signs at the Compaq sites will begin changing next week -- Hewlett-Packard is the surviving corporate name, and preferred rendering for most purposes will simply be HP.
Three layers of management in the new company, more than 15,000 people worldwide, will be named tomorrow. Employees will be welcomed to the new company and told of changes in briefings from executives, written materials and Webcasts. About two dozen executives from Compaq's offices in Houston will be moved to the Hewlett-Packard headquarters in Palo Alto.
The proxy contest focused mainly on how efficiently the two companies could consolidate their operations -- that is, heated debates over the projections of cost-savings and the estimates of revenue losses from eliminating overlapping product lines. Mr. Hewlett argued that the company's management was overestimating the cost savings and underestimating the revenue losses.
Yet most analysts agree that the company seems to have made solid progress toward wringing greater efficiency and cost-savings from combined company, even without accepting the Hewlett-Packard projections. Mr. Sacconaghi, for example, shaved 25 percent off the company's cost-savings estimates and assumed greater revenue losses than the company, and still determined Hewlett-Packard shares were attractive because the price has declined so much. The all-stock purchase, which was valued at $25 billion when it was announced, was worth less than $19 billion when it was completed last week.
But the larger test will be whether the strategy behind the deal materializes.
"In the short term, we will see radical cost-cutting, and that will create value," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who was a critic of the deal. "But ultimately this business is not about cost-cutting. For HP to thrive, will require innovation and gaining market share."
The merger is a bet that the combined company can indeed become a computer-industry powerhouse in a way that neither Hewlett-Packard nor Compaq is today. 
"The only reason for making a big strategic move like this is to gain leadership," said Michael D. Capellas, the former chief executive of Compaq, who is now president and chief operating officer of Hewlett-Packard.
The Hewlett-Packard strategy is to become the leading supplier of industry-standard technology to corporate data centers. Industry standard computing typically means the technology of personal computing -- Microsoft's Windows operating system or the Linux operating system, running on Intel microprocessors.
The Hewlett-Packard bet is that it can bring the economics of personal computing into large corporate data centers, thus undercutting the data-center leader, I.B.M., which has higher profit margins. But Hewlett-Packard is also hoping that data-center computing will require expertise in designing big systems and supplying services that is beyond the capabilities of the current champion of the PC industry, Dell Computer.
The larger ambition, a basic rationale for the deal, is the one that is most in doubt, even among supporters of the Compaq merger. "On the cost savings alone, the deal could well make sense," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst for Merrill Lynch, who endorsed the Compaq purchase. "But for it to be a real success, Hewlett-Packard has to have a clear strategy to gain market share. I'm still skeptical about that."

HEADLINE: Remaking Urban Welfare 

BYLINE:  By Andrew White; Andrew White is director of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School University.

 BODY:
This is an opportune moment for New York to embark on a practical, nonideological kind of welfare reform. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has expressed his belief in government's ability to help people overcome poverty. His administration should take advantage of tools already in place to support that conviction.
 Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani often said most people were better off without government financial support, and he created a welfare system that at the end of his tenure was turning away a majority of the families that sought help each year. Many interviews and extensive job search documentation were required before a family could receive any benefits. Mr. Giuliani made caseload reduction his rallying cry, boasting about cutting the city's welfare rolls by more than half. Yet the city's poverty rates declined only modestly. 
 But he did set up the bureaucratic structures on which an effective antipoverty policy could be built, using existing federal programs. And Governor George Pataki and the State Legislature established a substantial earned-income tax credit, which in just three years has added more than $1 billion to the household budgets of lower-income New Yorkers.
Under current New York welfare rules, a mother of two who moves from welfare into a minimum wage job can boost her income by more than $3 an hour with public benefits, combining her wages with food stamps, a small cash welfare grant, and the state and federal earned-income tax credits. She can receive subsidized health insurance and vouchers for child care. The city should use those rules to help more parents make a transition from unemployment to an entry-level job and gradually to one adequate to support a family. The city could offer an extra cash benefit to mothers who work more hours, a tactic tried successfully elsewhere. And, without skirting the rules, it can even support additional education and job training.
New York should also provide meaningful, intensive help -- like literacy classes, mental health care and job supervision -- for the very hard to employ who are now the majority of adults remaining in the system for years at a time or who return again and again to welfare. This group includes women who have limited schooling or learning disabilities or who struggle with depression, abusive partners or drug addiction.
Better policies like these don't meet the ideological goal of caseload reduction, since they require that people remain on the rolls even after they begin to work. They also require that the system be accessible to more of the poor.
Research by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation and other reliable organizations shows that flexibility in welfare policy matters if the true goal is to help families move out of poverty. While caseload reduction may save the city and state governments money in the short term, it does too little to combat poverty.
Congressional proposals for the next round of welfare reform could damage some effective policies. If the current welfare block grants to states are cut substantially, as is likely, there will be fewer dollars for programs that help people moving through the welfare system toward a better life. The Bush administration's proposed requirement that 70 percent of the adults in each state's caseload record at least 40 hours of work each week may require using more resources -- including money for child care, transportation and supervision -- to support larger make-work programs. (Already, 19,000 welfare recipients in New York City are in so-called workfare jobs, because private-sector jobs are so hard to come by.) Yet workfare jobs have generally been found to teach no new skills and not to lead to private-sector employment. 
While it still can, New York City needs to work to build a better welfare support program. And Washington should allow states and cities the flexibility to pursue less ideological and more effective welfare reforms that can truly reduce poverty.

HEADLINE: Mumbling Toward November 

 BODY:
Normally, with an election approaching, Republicans and Democrats in Washington would be trying to carve out separate identities by sharpening their differences. That is not happening so far this season. Part of the reason is that the war on terrorism has until recently crowded out serious debate on domestic issues. Another is that both parties, for their own peculiar reasons, are still tentative about their agendas. While Republicans are nervous about the economy, the Democrats are unsure about what course to take on the federal budget. They have criticized President Bush's tax cut for deepening the federal deficit. But at the same time they are leery of big new spending measures. They are going to have to show some boldness if they plan on keeping the Senate and taking control of the House. 
 If the Democrats have any say, Social Security will eventually become a central campaign issue. Right now, Republicans would rather not talk about their proposals to privatize Social Security. Doing so would only call attention to the decline in federal tax receipts, which is forcing the use of revenues from the big federal retirement systems to underwrite other needs. The polls show that Americans get nervous when that happens. In the next few weeks, Congress will have to raise the ceiling on the debt limit to keep the federal government going. Democrats should not irresponsibly delay that decision, but they are certainly right to use it to call attention to the administration's irresponsible fiscal policies and the danger they pose for both Social Security and Medicare. 
 The race for Congress is as uncertain as it has been in a long time. Yet the Democrats seem to be in better shape than they were a couple months ago, which should give them room to be more aggressive on the issues. Mr. Bush's approval ratings have slipped from the upper to the lower stratosphere, or about 70 percent, and Americans are again giving the Democrats an edge on domestic issues. The Democrats should also be emboldened by the fact that in the areas with most of the 40 contested House seats -- the industrial Midwest, Southeast and Southwest -- the economy is not seen as having turned around. That cannot help the Republicans. 
The Senate, where Democrats have the slimmest of majorities thanks to the defection last year of James Jeffords, is also closely contested. Democrats say that several of their incumbents who looked vulnerable a few months ago are now less so. In part, that is because several are in farm states and Congress is in the process of passing one of the biggest farm-bill giveaways in years. 
Since the most competitive races are in places that are still struggling economically, Democrats should be pushing harder for more spending on education and a prescription drug program for the elderly that is more generous than the unrealistic Republican plan. They need to make a bigger issue of the environment, including the administration's shaky stewardship of public lands. They also need to be more forthright about the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's economic policies, namely, the tax cut. A number of Democrats in tough races voted with Republicans to enact it in the first place.
But most of all the party has to do more to level with voters and tell them that Social Security, Medicare, education and other domestic priorities -- not to mention the defense and homeland security buildup -- cannot be paid for with borrowed money. Americans are ready to meet their responsibilities in these areas and realize that if the needs are important, revenues will have to be found. A campaign where everybody pretends otherwise will be muddled and sterile indeed.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With theNext Mogul of Cable TV 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 5 

 BODY:
Brian L. Roberts may be the least probable mogul.
 He wears a power suit, but is unprepossessing. He was born into wealth, but does not seem entitled. The stock of his company, Comcast, is down sharply this year. Yet Comcast, where Mr. Roberts, 42, is the president, is poised to become the nation's biggest cable television company and one of the world's most powerful media companies -- assuming regulators approve its $47 billion stock deal for AT&T's cable business later this year. 
 The cable industry, which gathers here this week for its annual convention, is a relatively mature business, but still a fairly robust one, too. Many of the biggest cable companies have reported strong quarterly results in recent weeks. 
Yet investors seem unconvinced. Cable stocks as a group are down this year, as investors fret that consumers are not buying new digital services as quickly as they had hoped and that satellite television will siphon off cable subscribers.
If the AT&T deal is completed, as is widely expected, Comcast -- now the nation's No. 3 cable company -- will become the industry leader by far, with more than 22 million subscribers, compared with about 12.7 million for the runner-up, Time Warner Cable. And Mr. Roberts, son of the Comcast founder, Ralph Roberts, will become chief executive of the new AT&T Comcast. The Roberts family will have effective control of AT&T Comcast, with a third of the vote.
As thousands gather here for the National Cable and Telecommunications Association convention, the industry for which Mr. Roberts has emerged as de facto leader is facing challenges. Satellite television companies continue to add subscribers even as cable's subscriber growth has all but leveled off.
Millions of cable customers do continue to sign up each year to upgrade their cable subscription to digital service, as well as high-speed cable Internet access. Some customers are even receiving their local telephone service over cable wires. Yet the growth rate for each of those new, revenue-enhancing services has slowed recently.
Cable providers are now beginning to deploy their next generation of services, led by the long-ballyhooed video-on-demand, which is meant to allow consumers to punch up what they want to watch when they want to watch it. It is too early to gauge the economics of video-on-demand and its effect on advertising, among other revenue considerations.
Meanwhile, the costs that cable companies must pay to programming providers -- whether video giants like Viacom, which owns MTV, or upstart systems like New York's YES network, which is affiliated with the New York Yankees -- continue to grow.
Sensitive to the uncertainties, attuned to the opportunities, Mr. Roberts sat down for an interview in Manhattan last week to discuss the industry's prospects.

Q. There has been concern that digital cable television has not been as successful as some people had expected. What's the outlook for digital cable?

A. Originally, digital cable was 10 channels of HBO for the price of one, or several Showtimes for the price of one. It was a tremendous value and a huge success.
But some people don't really want HBO or Showtime even if you get 10 of them. So now we have dozens of digital basic channels. These channels, like the multiplexed MTV channels, are attracting attention, but they aren't the drivers for digital like the pay channels are. Digital basic is about customer retention. On systems we've rebuilt that have digital, satellite has penetration that's only about half the national average.

Q. As satellite signs up customers, how important is it that they have the full National Football League package and cable companies do not?

A. We would certainly love to get that content on digital cable and we've reached out to the N.F.L. to see if that's possible. That said, for many people who absolutely must have the N.F.L. package, they've already switched to satellite. The question is, how many people are left who are dying for that product and haven't already switched?

Q. What is the state of the relationship between cable and satellite providers on the one hand, and programming providers, on the other hand?

A. Programming costs are by far our biggest single cost -- about 20 percent of revenues, while our salaries for tens of thousands of people are about 10 percent. As I look at programmer-operator relationships, there are sports rights and then there is everything else.
On the nonsports side, it is evolving well. There is tension, but it is a reasonably healthy tension. In our case, last year programming costs went up 15 percent, which is almost three times higher than our typical 5 percent increases to our customers.
We went to the programmers and said: "We can't pay 15 percent. We need some more of your content for digital." They said, "Well, we need these rate increases on the basic analog programming, but here's a good deal on programming for the digital tier."

Q. What about on sports?

A. On the sports side there is no one villain that you can point to. No one person controls the sports world.
Look at the YES Network in New York, which carries the New York Yankees games. We agreed to carry YES and we had to pass through a rate increase. Cablevision is not carrying YES, and they have a lot of unhappy customers.
I don't know what the right answer is. If you raise rates, somebody comes back and says, "Why did my rates go up so much?" And with all due respect, when someone writes the newspaper headline, it says "Cable operator raises rates." But if you don't carry YES, the headline is "Cable operator won't carry the Yankees." The reality is it's a Hobson's choice, and it is unpopular no matter what you do.

Q. For years, consumers have been hearing about video on demand. What are the next steps and what will this service look like?

A. This is what is most exciting to me about digital cable. As an industry, we will have 25 million digital set-top boxes out there by the end of this year, and they will all be able to do V.O.D.
Let's break V.O.D. into three categories, all of which we will make available to all digital customers. Level one is movies and impulse events on demand. You push the button, you get a product, you pay for the individual transaction. 
Level two is subscription video on demand. The best example of that is HBO. You buy HBO with the S.V.O.D. feature, and you get any episode of "Sex and the City" or "The Sopranos" anytime you want. You get to pull up HBO movies anytime you want them. 
But the newest idea, and the one that I'm most excited about, is a third level of free video on demand. Why don't we go to CBS or ABC or NBC, and say, "Would you like your local or national newscast to be available anytime the consumer wants it after the original broadcast -- and leave the commercials in. Why not give it a shelf life for the rest of the day? If I'm "60 Minutes" or "NBC Nightly News," why don't I want people to have more access to the show? I've already made it. All my costs are fixed. This way I get more people to watch the ads.
We benefit by getting more people to sign up for digital, and the consumer benefits by having free V.O.D. built into the digital tier. We're going to roll this out in Philadelphia this summer. The beauty of it is that satellite can't do it. There is no V.O.D. on satellite.

Q. What about the challenges in integrating AT&T and Comcast?

A. We have a massive integration challenge to create a 22 million subscriber company. This has never been done before. We have 250 or so people at the senior level along with AT&T Broadband's senior team.
When we combine the companies and pick out the best of the best to run it, we should be able to radically accelerate the improvement necessary to create the world's premier cable and telecommunications company and to justify this deal and its valuation.

HEADLINE: Burmese Democracy Advocate Is Released From House Arrest 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Monday, May 6 

 BODY:
The military government of Myanmar freed the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi today after 19 months of house arrest and said it would allow her to pursue her political activities as leader of the country's democratic opposition.
 At noon, she left her lakeside villa and drove for the first time in months to the headquarters of her political party, the National League for Democracy. Thousands of ecstatic supporters who had waited for hours in the hot sun shouted "Long live Aung San Suu Kyi." 
 "Today marks a new page for the people of Myanmar and the international community," said a government spokesman, Lt. Col. Hla Min, in a statement faxed from the country, the former Burma, that was framed as an overture to the outside world for improved relations. 
"We shall recommit ourselves to allowing all of our citizens to participate freely in the life of our political process, while giving priority to national unity, peace and stability of the country as well as the region," he said.
Myanmar's ambassador to Washington, U Linn Myaing, was more specific, saying, "Suu Kyi is at liberty to carry out all activities relating to her party as of May 6."
The key to assessing the significance of the move will be the degree of liberty granted to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to travel and organize her party, experts said.
"If it is truly a freedom that she can go wherever she chooses, see whoever she wishes and not have to get government approval in advance, it is a monumental change, because it opens a door that has been slammed shut since 1962, when all opposition was suppressed," said Josef Silverstein, a professor emeritus from Rutgers University and a leading authority on Myanmar.
"If she is truly free to meet and talk with people, that would probably be the most important change to have occurred." 
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been in conflict with the country's military rulers since before her party won 82 percent of the seats in a parliamentary election in 1990. The military government summarily set aside the results.
Many elected members of Parliament and many more of their supporters have been arrested in the years since. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has been under house arrest twice. When she was freed the first time in 1995, tight restrictions on her activities only led to further confrontations and a return to house arrest in September 2000.
Political analysts said that if the announcement was a real compromise by the government, it was likely to have been a result of the political isolation and tough economic sanctions that have driven the junta into a corner, reviled by the outside world and scorned by its own people.
Myanmar has been a closed state under military rule since U Ne Win staged a coup in 1962 and instituted the "Burmese way to socialism," an autocratic government that drove his country from prosperity and a flourishing culture steadily backward into poverty and harsh repression.
He stepped aside in 1988 in the face of a nationwide popular uprising that was violently crushed by the military, which instituted the current, equally repressive government.
In the months since Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was returned to house arrest, she has held talks with military leaders to work out some form of accommodation. The government has made a series of conciliatory gestures, including the releases of what human rights groups say are about 250 of an estimated 1,500 political prisoners.
In his statement today, Colonel Hla Min said that a much higher number of prisoners had been freed and that the releases would continue.
"We have released nearly 600 detainees in recent months and shall continue to release those who will cause no harm to the community, nor threaten the existing peace, stability and unity of the nation," he said in what seemed a thoroughly qualified promise.
The United States has made it clear that any relaxation of its economic sanctions -- which have been joined by the European Union and international donor agencies -- would require the unfettered freedom of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
"It is important that the release be unconditional, that Aung San Suu Kyi be afforded full freedom of movement and association," a State Department spokeswoman, Julie Reside, said last week.
Such freedom of movement and political activity could pose a difficult challenge to the government because of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's high popularity among the population and her potential ability to rally huge crowds.
It is a decision the government has been reluctant to take, and it was a result of long and delicate discussions with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
"I think there were external forces at work here that pushed this dialogue and that this step had to be taken," Mr. Silverstein said. "Burma has no money and has no way of gaining money. The moneys it has earned from the sale of natural gas from the Andaman Sea to Thailand amount to about $400 million a year."
Myanmar is also one of the world's leading exporters of opium, a trade that also helps somewhat to sustain the struggling government. 
In what seemed to be an overture to the United States and other donors, though, Colonel Hla Min said his government would join with other nations to combat terrorism and would work toward the "total eradication of narcotic drugs which are threatening mankind."
The manner in which the military government has chosen to use its money raises questions for future donors -- the kind of questions Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has presented in advocating sanctions over the years.
Last year, the government signed an agreement with Russia to buy 10 new MIG-29 fighter jets for $130 million. It is also making plans to build a nuclear plant with help from Russia and may have also had to make a down payment on that project.
In addition, Myanmar sustains an army of 400,000 troops, many of whom run government departments and economic enterprises but many more of whom are engaged in a decades-long war against ethnic insurgencies.
International donors want any assistance to go to the underfinanced education and health systems and other badly needed social services, rather than to further military spending.
Colonel Hla Min also acknowledged the largely hidden problem of an explosion of H.I.V. and AIDS in Myanmar, saying his government hoped to work with the international community to combat the disease.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Returns to Profit, Buffett Tells Shareholders 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: OMAHA, May 5 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, this weekend signaled a return to profit for Berkshire Hathaway, but warned that frauds and sloppy accounting were rife in American business, while returns on stock investing would probably be lower over the next few years.
 "You're going to see great results from our insurance businesses," Mr. Buffett told an estimated 10,000 shareholders. 
 Berkshire, whose main business is insurance, reported a loss last year as it was hammered by billions of dollars in insurance claims from Sept. 11. It is now making up the ground as premium rates soar.
Berkshire's insurance businesses, including the reinsurer General Re and the cut-price car insurer Geico, made underwriting profits in the first quarter, he said. Berkshire's first-quarter results are due to be released on Friday.
Mr. Buffett said that insurance premiums held by Berkshire before payouts grew by $1.8 billion in the quarter ended March 31, and that the company had an underwriting profit of $20 million in the period. That contrasts with an underwriting loss last year of more than $4 billion. About $2.4 billion of that was attributed to Sept. 11.
Elsewhere, Mr. Buffett, 71, and his longtime partner Charlie Munger, 78, were less bullish on ways to make money, saying 6 percent to 7 percent was a fair return on investments in the current environment of low interest rates.
"We have more money than ideas," Mr. Buffett admitted, saying that finding good investments was not easy. Berkshire, which has grown to more than $110 billion in market value since Mr. Buffett took over in 1965, is always on the lookout for acquisitions.
Mr. Buffett predicted that derivatives, a major business for Enron, would also trip up other firms. "There's no place with as much potential for phony numbers as derivatives," he said. Berkshire's reinsurer, General Re, is currently unwinding its derivatives unit, taking some losses.
The partners were more vocal on Enron, the collapsed energy trader, and other woes besetting American business.
"Enron was the most disgusting example of a business culture gone wrong," Mr. Munger said. Neither showed much sympathy for Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, while they also criticized Wall Street investment banks, blamed by some for fueling the Enron debacle.
Both returned to their familiar tirade against stock-option accounting, saying options should be treated as an expense, just as other types of compensation are. Not doing so misleadingly boosts profits and hurts shareholders by diluting the value of their shares.
"It's shameful," said Mr. Buffett, who is backing the recent attempts by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to persuade regulators to insist on changes in stock-option accounting. But he is pessimistic that changes will be made. "C.E.O.'s have their hands on the switch," Mr. Buffett said. "They get what they want every year; consultants just fan the flames."

HEADLINE: Attention, Holiday Shoppers: Bargains Abound 

BYLINE:  By JULIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
MEET Alison Denny of Port Charlotte, Fla., 51 years old, retired psychiatric nurse, mother of three, grandmother of seven and a typical American traveler. What makes her typical is that she goes away three or four times a year in the United States. "The other day, my sons and I were talking about taking a trip to the Netherlands," she said. "My family is originally from there. But I told them not this year. It's much safer to stay within our own borders." 
 Moreover, last fall she started booking her trips on Expedia.com, the online travel service, "to save time and for financial reasons," as she put it. She is starting to think about the annual fall vacation that she and her husband, Robert, will take in October. "But I'll wait until August when the airlines announce their deals for the fall," she said. "We'll narrow our choices down to a few places and then I'll go on Expedia to book it." 
 Ms. Denny embodies all the important trends that are affecting leisure travel among Americans today. She travels a lot and is always looking for deals. That's why she goes online and hasn't used a travel agent in 15 years. She books her trips shortly before she leaves, and in the wake of 9/11, she is leery of going abroad. 
Ever since the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, tour operators, travel packagers and hotels and airlines have been offering a slew of price-cutting and promotional deals in the mainland, Hawaii and Canada. The result is that travel prices from January through March of this year were 1.8 percent below the same period in 2001, according to the Travel Industry Association.
In response, leisure travel has picked up since Thanksgiving (after practically drying up after Sept. 11), although it is nowhere near the volume of a year ago. American Airlines revenue passenger miles in the first quarter of this year were 13.3 percent below the same period in 2001. Still, considering everything, the situation is not that bad. "If we end the year being 10 to 20 percent off in business, it's a good year," said Robert E. Whitley, the president of the United States Tour Operators Association. "Last October, we predicted that travel would be off 50 percent." 
What sort of deals can a vacation customer expect? Hilton Hotels (www.Hilton.com) has an Easy Escapes promotion that provides guests who check into a Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, Conrad or Doubletree hotel with a booklet of transferable vouchers good for travel until Dec. 31. Among the lures, you can travel to any of 99 cities in the continental United States for $299 round-trip, receive 5 percent off any international round-trip flight and earn a free Sunday night at any participating hotel that you book for three consecutive nights, including a Sunday. There are also two $50 flight credits for yet another trip and savings on Avis car rentals.
State convention bureaus are promoting vacation deals through their Web sites. Flausa.com -- an odd name that stands for Florida USA -- offers 29 packages for the Tampa area alone. Tampa is the home of Busch Gardens, an African-adventure theme park where Ms. Denny will be taking three of her grandsons, 4-year-old twins and their older brother, 5, this summer. For $129.95 a person, a Best Western All Suites Hotel, right behind the Gardens, offers two nights in a two-room suite, plus two one-day passes to the park, breakfast and a 99-cent happy hour. Buy your own tickets to the park for $44.95 each, and the deal drops to $69.95 a person. 
This year, said Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association, "Patriotism is very strong, so the popular places are those that stress what is uniquely American, what makes our country great." That means the national parks like the Grand Canyon and what Ms. Keefe called "the foreheads," otherwise known as Mount Rushmore. 
Tauck World Discovery (www.tauck.com), a high-end package tour operator, has luxury 10-day tours starting May 20 continuing through Oct. 2 that start in Las Vegas and take in five national parks, including Zion, Bryce Canyon and the Grand Canyon, and two days of houseboating on Lake Powell in Arizona and Utah. Prices start at $3,546 a person, including accommodations inside the parks, as well as meals, transportation and gratuities. 
You have to get yourself to and from Las Vegas, however, but a stay there could be an opportunity to see why it is the country's No. 1 tourist destination. There are plenty of bargains for the summertime, when, as Richard Rodriguez, the marketing director for Liberty Travel, said, "It's 110 and you can fry an egg out there." 
Liberty sells a three-night package for a midweek stay in Las Vegas at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino -- with its fountains, botanical gardens and 2,000-piece glass sculpture in the lobby -- for about $150 a night, including air fare. The Bellagio itself (bellagio.com) has a promotion Sunday through Thursday, when rooms are available for $159 a night plus a 9 percent tax. 
Many Americans who might have gone abroad this summer are going to Canada instead. "People who went to Europe every year now want Banff or Bermuda," said Debbie Gioquindo, the owner of Personal Touch Travel in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. "They don't want to go too far away this year. They fear the distance, being too far away in time of trouble." The Canadian dollar is worth roughly two-thirds the American dollar, which means good bargains, and Canada offers enough of a taste of a foreign country without the jet lag. 
The Canadian Rockies are popular this year, and Via Rail Canada (viarail.com), the nation's passenger train service, offers a four-day, three-night journey from Toronto through the mountains to Vancouver. Two adults can share a compartment with bath for $2,210 (American dollars), meals included. More unusual is a seven-day/six-night excursion that begins in Toronto and includes a trip to Niagara Falls before departing for Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fares start at $839 (American dollars). If you are accompanied by a child who is 11 or younger, and are traveling on a Via Rail package between May 25 and Aug. 31, you will receive a second free ticket when you buy an adult economy fare. 
Family travel accounts for almost three-quarters of all vacation travel in the United States, according to the Travel Industry Association. If you fall into this category, you might consider a pit stop at familytravelfiles.com, a Web site devoted to ideas and suggestions for off-the-beaten-track jaunts that all family members can enjoy. These include dude ranches, working farms and even an 1870 sod house bed-and-breakfast in Sanborn, Minn. -- the heart of Laura Ingalls Wilder territory. The Web site includes reports from parents who have visited these places and a section called Ask Mom that fields questions about trekking with children. 
Family vacations are also becoming opportunities for family reunions. For those seeking neutral territory on which to congregate, Kingsley Pines (kingsleypines.com), a family resort on Panther Lake in Raymond, Me., is promoting "vacation camp" the last two weeks in August, for as many family members interested in spending time together. Everyone sleeps in cabins, and a full week for adults is $605 per person ($520 each if two or more adults share a cabin); children are $205 to $225 each a week, depending on their age; those 3 and under are free. Rates include meals and all activities, like tennis, boating, hiking and sailing. This is camp, so cabins with bathrooms are $225 extra. 
When sorting through the multitude of deals and packages, there are things to keep in mind to figure out exactly the bargain you're getting. Unless you recognize the name of the hotel, look it up in a guidebook to verify what "deluxe" and "five-star" really mean. If you have never heard of the airline, try to find it on the Internet. 
When traveling with children, breakfast can be a big expense, especially if the youngster is a picky eater, so meals included in the price can be worthwhile. Transfers from the airport to the hotel are an important benefit -- a taxi, say, from Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan costs $35, without tolls and tips. Do you just "view" an Indian crafts village from a tour bus, or actually visit the village?
Don't be too quick to sign up for a package that allows children to stay free in your room. Nancy Nelson-Duac, the editor of Familytravelfiles.com, points out that most parents sleep in their own rooms at home, as do the kids. So on vacation, she said, "Kids-stay-free is not a deal, it's a penalty." She suggests packages that offer a second room at half price. "That's a deal."

HEADLINE: Check Out The Tour's Reputation 

BYLINE:  By JULIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
AN increasing number of Americans research their travel plans online. According to Forrester Research, 23.4 million households investigate and book their reservations on the Internet. 
In the first quarter of this year, consumers spent $7 billion on online travel purchases, accounting for 41 percent of all e-commerce in the United States, said Dan Hess, a vice president of ComScore Networks, a data analysis company. But while everyone is feeling more confident that Web transactions are safe, the possibility of fraud still exists. 
 When visiting an unfamiliar tour packager on the Web, click on "About Us" or "Our Company" to see who the officers are and to learn more about the business. The packager should be a member of a reputable travel industry association, like the United States Tour Operators Association or the National Tour Association, which both require their members to post bonds to protect vacationers if the company goes bankrupt. 
 Bear in mind that a vacation for less than $100 a day a person, everything included, is an exceptional value, as is coast-to-coast air fare of less than $250. But what, actually, is included? Are you getting meals at four-star restaurants or in cafeterias? Don't be afraid to ask a tour operator specific questions. If you are being pressured into making a deposit, back off.

HEADLINE: No Bill for a Room, But RV's Ring Up Costs of Their Own 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT W. STOCK 

 BODY:
FOR people with large families who do not make flight and hotel arrangements far in advance, the economics of renting a recreational vehicle can be attractive. By putting his family up in an RV to go to Florida, Scott Wright, a printer in New Jersey, said, he saved about $5,000 on air fare and thousands more on hotel rooms over his 11-day vacation. He parked his RV at a campground in Fort Wilderness in the Disney World complex for $75 a night, a fraction of the cost of a room in a Disney World hotel, but twice as much as many private RV sites. 
 Saving money, however, is not the primary reason people rent RVs, because they are not inexpensive. Cruise America's 7-night-rental rate for a 23-to-25-footlong motor home in the high season (June 17 to Sept. 3) in the Northeast is $1,165. That comes with 1,000 free miles and some insurance, but does not include $3-an-hour generator charges (when you're driving, say, and you want to turn on the air-conditioning) or one-way drop-off fees. You also pay for gasoline, a major item with these vehicles, depending on the RV's size and terrain. The 23- to 25-footers average 7 to 10 miles a gallon. You must also factor in a charge of up to 29 cents a mile once you use up your free allotment. 
 There are other expenses, too. Motor home bedding packages rent for $35 a person, and a "vehicle provisioning kit," which includes can openers, brooms and silverware, is $85. 
Reserving an RV with a dealer as far ahead as possible is recommended, especially in the high season. Between them, Cruise America and El Monte RV have about 6,000 motor homes for rent at more than 200 locations nationwide. In addition, thousands are rented by individual owners and RV dealers. Yet in recent summers, rental motor homes have been hard to find, and the supply this summer is expected to be even tighter -- that goes for campgrounds as well. 
Information on RV rentals and campgrounds is widely available on the Internet. For first-time renters, a good starting place is www.gorving .com, a site created by a group of manufacturers, dealers and campgrounds. It offers a virtual tour of motor homes of various sizes, a free getting-started video and links to dealer and campground Web sites.

HEADLINE: Big Discounts for Those Who Will Listen 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE NEGRONI 

 BODY:
WITH some frequency I receive marketing material on time shares inviting me to stay at a luxurious Florida resort for some ridiculously low price. These offers always seem too good to be true and I toss them in the trash. The most recent offer, from the Marriott hotel chain, came by mail and was followed by a phone call. Because I am a member of Marriott's frequent-guest program and, more significantly, I had just bought air tickets to take the family to Orlando to visit my mom in April, I said the words a telemarketer longs to hear: "Sure, I'm interested. Tell me more."
 There was a catch. I would have to sit through a sales pitch designed to persuade me to actually buy a time share rather than freeload in one. I was promised the pitch would last just 90 minutes. It sounded like a fair trade to me. 
 Our stay at the Marriott Grand Vista Resort in Orlando was, by any standard, a great deal. We had a beautiful and spacious two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with a fully equipped kitchen. My four children and the exchange student living with us swam in the pool, took their in-line skates around the property and passed their evenings playing air hockey and Ping-Pong with other children in three large game rooms. 
Add $100 worth of coupons we were given for tickets to the nearby theme parks, and we had a very affordable vacation at $248 for the rooms. Not bad, we thought, for spending only an hour and a half of our time. Why doesn't everybody do this?
After all, the official position of the time-share-industry trade group is that minivacations and time-share premiums are there to be taken. It might have seemed like a secret to me, but Howard C. Nusbaum, the president of the American Resort Development Association, said that it was only a secret in that many people did not know how to take advantage of it.
We were feeling pretty smug until the last day of our stay, when it was time for my husband, Jim, and I to keep our end of the bargain. We were reluctant to tear ourselves away from the children, the pool and the sun to head inside for a sales presentation. 
In the overly air-conditioned Marriott Vacation Club office, which offered child care and a continental breakfast, my husband and I were seated in front of a beautifully produced, but substantively barren, videotape showing a wide spectrum of vacationers enjoying themselves in an equally wide variety of settings. Then a chatty saleswoman, who said we should relax because there would be no high-pressure sales tactics from her, steered us through the pros -- and only the pros -- of buying a Marriott time share, repeating the benefits over and over. 
In brief, a time share gives a buyer occupancy rights to a room or a suite of rooms at a resort for a predetermined period. Bigger rooms, multiple weeks and occupancy during the high season all increase the price. In this case, it was $17,000 for the right to buy the same accommodations we had in Orlando for one week every year in the high season, every year for a lifetime. 
"You with me?" the saleswoman asked after painstakingly explaining each point. "Are we on the same page?" 
Her pitch was topped with the promise of 100,000 Marriott reward points, enough to give our family another high-end free vacation, if Jim and I signed on the dotted line then and there. But we couldn't take a day to think about it because those points were a now-or-never proposition. If we signed right away, we could use the time share this year. This requirement did not fall under her definition of a high-pressure tactic.
It's hard to blame her. Various travel-industry experts say that only 1 in 10 people who attend these presentations actually buy. "The highest level of interest someone is going to have is when they're there on the property," said Ed Kinney, the senior director of public relations at Marriott Vacation Club. "You want to make sure they don't lose that enthusiasm as they go away."
The American Resort Development Association estimates that the time-share industry has been growing 14 to 17 percent every year in the last decade, an easy figure to believe in Orlando, where construction cranes seem as ubiquitous as palm trees. 
Mr. Kinney of Marriott said that his company's sales rate was better than 1 in 10, although he would not elaborate. Still, many people are like me, taking advantage of generous time-share previews with nary a thought beforehand to actually buying one.
Finding and then persuading people to take a look is an expensive undertaking. Sales brochures, personal interviews and preview tours add up to more than half the price of a time-share unit.
Having spent serious amounts of energy wooing potential buyers to their sites, sales representatives are reluctant to let them go after 90 minutes. Immediately after our saleswoman introduced herself, she warned us that the presentation could last longer if we asked questions. We did. Three and a half hours later, saying we needed more time to think, we said goodbye to our saleswoman, who was crestfallen. Numb and mentally exhausted, we were released into the Florida sunshine.
Did we really ask two hours of questions? No way. Presidential press conferences don't go on that long. Frankly, I had suspected all along that the promise of a presentation that would have us in and out in 90 minutes was unrealistically optimistic, leading me to wonder, what other details were they glossing over? 
Was the 3 1/2-hour investment worth our free stay? Absolutely. For large families like mine, a time-share preview is a great opportunity to explore a different way of vacationing, and the one we enjoyed in Orlando offered a higher level of amenities than we were accustomed to, at far less expense. Carry that argument to its logical conclusion, and a time-share-buying family could emerge. 
Developers know that many of the people they lure to their minivacations will go home without buying. They also know that the average time-share buyer attends two to three previews. So there is good reason to invite nonbuyers back. Which is exactly what happened to us.
We returned home to a message on our answering machine from Ramada Plaza Resorts, saying we had been selected to receive a dirt-cheap "romantic fun-filled Florida vacation," including a cruise.
For that, they can have me for five hours. 

Mastering the Economics of Time Shares
THE saleswoman I encountered at the Marriott Vacation Club tried hard to convince me that "the only question you need to answer is whether you deserve this kind of vacation." In fact, there are many questions potential buyers should ask themselves, starting with a simple assessment of how they hope to benefit from the purchase of a time share. 
Alan Ziobrowski, a professor of real estate at the J. Mack Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University, thinks time shares are good for people who vacation at the same place every year.
"On the assumption that you would go to that location and rent a similar quality property for that one or two weeks every year for the next 10 years," he said, "the answer is yes, they are good investments." He is skeptical about the practicality of buying a time share to trade for accommodations elsewhere, though during my visit at Marriott's Grande Vista in Orlando, Fla., I met families who had been doing that for years. Exchanging a time share, however, is not a free deal.
Besides the fee for an annual membership in a time-share exchange program, the price for processing a trade can cost $79 to $150 or more. And even the most enthusiastic proponents of vacation ownership admit there is no money to be made selling a time share. Loans are largely unavailable to buy time shares, so the market is limited to those who can buy with cash. "There are a lot of people who might buy if they could pay it off over six, seven or 10 years," Mr. Ziobrowski said, "but to ask them to come up with $20,000 in cash, there aren't that many."
What is bad news for sellers is good news for buyers. Since resale time shares can sell for less than half the developer's price, and many are drastically discounted further, buyers can search classified ads, the Internet and online auction sites like eBay for time shares at cut-rate prices. Some sellers, eager not to pay annual maintenance fees that can run into hundreds of dollars, even donate their time shares to charities, which then auction them for pennies on the dollar.
Mark Silverman, a former time-share salesman who writes about the subject for The San Francisco Examiner, said that time shares should not be looked at as a way to make money. "Rather than an investment that will appreciate," he said, "a time share is an investment in yourself that you will appreciate."

HEADLINE: Biologists Sought a Treaty; Now They Fault It 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
A treaty enacted nine years ago to conserve and exploit the diversity of species on earth is seriously impeding biologists' efforts to catalog and comprehend that same natural bounty, many scientists say.
 They say the treaty has spawned paralyzing biological bureaucracies built on the widespread belief that any scientist collecting samples -- whether for a drug company or a dissertation -- is bent on stealing genetic material and making a fortune. 
 As a result, biologists say, in many tropical regions it is easier to cut a forest than to study it.
"Something that was well intentioned and needed has been taken to an illogical extreme," said Dr. Douglas C. Daly, a curator of Amazonian botany at the New York Botanical Garden, who has worked in Brazil for 20 years in partnerships with Brazilian scientists, but recently had to wait a year and a half for a new research visa. 
"The net result has been that it's kept biologists out of the forests," Dr. Daly said. "That plays into the hands of the forces of uncontrolled development. If a tree falls in the forest and there's no biologist there to hear it, it definitely doesn't make a sound."
Some officials in restrictive countries have begun to concede as much. For example, Brazil, which in 2000 stopped all exports of biological samples, even to Brazilians working abroad, has convened a National Council of Genetic Resources charged with finding a way to resume controlled exchanges.
The parties to the treaty, the Convention on Biological Diversity, met last month in The Hague and adopted voluntary guidelines aimed at distinguishing between "bio-prospecting" and basic science. But the parties, numbering 183, have yet to negotiate the details, and even after they are complete, signers are free to maintain existing rules.
The United States was involved in the talks, and the Clinton administration signed the treaty. But the Senate, lobbied by agriculture and drug companies, has never approved it. The Bush administration is reviewing whether to pursue ratification.
Scientists and some officials from restrictive countries agree that the solution is a regulatory system that is more streamlined for scientists who cede any right to profit from their findings. But creating such a system may be nearly impossible, because many universities, botanical gardens and other research institutions, besides conducting basic studies, also seek to exploit discoveries and, sometimes, have partnerships with drug companies.
In many countries, the fight against what is called biopiracy has proved politically popular, linking the interests of conservative nationalists, indigenous tribes and antiglobalization groups. In the hinterlands, the police and, sometimes, rural villagers have detained or chased out scientists.
Over the decades, there have been just enough examples of furtive expropriation of natural resources to fuel such fears, scientists say. Those include Brazil's loss of its rubber monopoly to Britain in the 19th century -- rubber trees thrived in British-controlled Malaysia -- to recent efforts by some companies to commercialize substances from tropical plants and animals without seeking permission or paying royalties. 
Some countries are so eager to thwart biological thievery that they are going beyond the vague terms in the treaty.
At a meeting in February in Cancun, Mexico, representatives of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and nine other countries -- together controlling perhaps 70 percent of the world's biological diversity -- formed the Group of Allied Mega-Biodiverse Nations. The coalition would, among other activities, certify "the legal possession of biological material" and negotiate terms to transfer it.
Existing and proposed restrictions in countries with biological resources are all aimed at controlling research by drug and biotechnology companies. But evidence has grown that they are harming the most basic field work, even observational studies of wildlife in which nothing is taken away. The restrictions not only affect northern scientists' probing southern forests, but also local scientists.
Dr. Ricardo Callejas, a professor at the University of Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia, specializes in the 2,000 species in the black pepper family. Dr. Callejas said fears of biological theft seemed particularly intense in South America, adding that it was "much, much easier to get permits for collecting in the Philippines and Vietnam" than in Colombia.
His discipline is taxonomy, basic analysis of the subtle differences among species and a field with little commercial appeal. Even so, Dr. Callejas said, he and his graduate students had been accused of biopiracy and booted from one village while on a collecting trip. He added that he longed to collect in a dizzyingly rich area in western Colombia, the Choco forests, but that the treaty had made the effort impossible.
"If you request a permit," Dr. Callejas said, "you have to provide coordinates for all sites to be visited and have to have the approval from all the communities that live in those areas. Otherwise, go back to your home and watch on Discovery Channel the new exciting program on dinosaurs from Argentina. I am still waiting after 14 months for a permit for collecting in Choco."
Delays, fees and research restrictions in countries like Brazil and provinces like Sarawak, the Malaysian part of Borneo, have caused many scientists simply to abandon the critical, difficult work of charting the still largely unexplored maze of species.
In some cases, scientists have been detained and their collections destroyed. In the Brazilian Amazon in 1998, an American geographer studying the forest for hints of ancient cultivation methods was placed under house arrest by the federal police in Santarem, and his boat, equipment and samples were seized. 
The scientist, Joseph M. McCann, who now teaches at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, had all the appropriate permits and visas. He said that he eventually got back his gear and the title to his old riverboat, but that most of the collection of pressed plants rotted because the police had stored it outside. The plants had been destined for a Brazilian herbarium, not a pharmaceutical laboratory, he said.
Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers have been affected most of all, from both developing countries and from the North.
At the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, Andre M. Amorim, a visiting botany professor from the State University of Santa Cruz in Bahia, Brazil, has had trouble completing his doctoral research because of the ban on shipping even the tiniest leaf fragment.
His work focuses on Brazilian lianas and related vines and shrubs, and it requires advanced molecular and genetic analysis using equipment in New York. 
"This is a real problem when Brazilian researchers are working in other countries," Mr. Amorim said. 
In some places, restrictions have forced biologists to pack up and leave or to avoid the least-studied regions like the Amazon, where the classification of species lags, and focus on more accessible places like Hawaii or Puerto Rico.
In Sarawak, Dr. Navjot S. Sodhi of the National University of Singapore abandoned a project to survey the bird species in several national parks after tighter research restrictions took effect in 1998.
"Sarawak is the best place on earth to work, because there's so much rain forest left and the people are so nice," Dr. Sodhi said. "They provided free workers to help us, and we trained them in return and hired local guides. We were only collecting blood samples from birds to look for parasites and also collecting bird feces to study their diets."
But word spread that a potential AIDS drug had been discovered in the region. New rules greatly complicated his program, he said. "Now, to collect bird feces we had to get an export permit." 
Officials began harassing his students.
"I couldn't take the nonsense any more, and we pulled out," Dr. Sodhi said. "I was willing to sign anything saying that we were not doing any bioprospecting." 
But there was nothing to sign.
Officials at some companies that are sifting ecosystems for potential profits say it is appropriate that scientists from universities and other academic institutions play by the same tight rules. 
"Academics have been kind of naive to the question of ownership of genetic material," said Eric J. Mathur, senior director for molecular diversity at Diversa, a company in San Diego that works around the world to find enzymes and other substances that could make valuable drugs or other products. "They think that under the guise of academia they can do whatever they want. But if their work results in any kind of invention -- and most come serendipitously -- you can be sure their institution will want to own it and make money from it."
Mr. Mathur said that the last year or so had finally seen the biodiversity convention "start to come of age." In a growing number of countries, he said, the general precepts of the convention have translated into workable contracts that, for the first time, clarify who owns what and how any benefits will be shared.
But many scientists and some officials say there is clearly the need for a system with two tracks, to separate and simplify work that clearly has no commercial application.
The impetus for the treaty, scientists note ruefully, arose largely from biologists, who in the late 1980's powerfully promoted the notion that rain forests could turn out to be medicine chests for the world. But the promise has rarely turned into profits, with just a handful of drugs and products reaching markets. 
"It's never really panned out and was totally oversold," said Dr. George Amato, director of the conservation genetics program at the Bronx Zoo.
Dr. Amato's program has frequently been stymied in helping foreign researchers identify animal species and strains through using genetic analysis, because no material can be sent abroad. In one such effort, aimed at identifying a strain of yellow-headed Amazon parrots, the DNA ended up being tracked down in a stuffed museum specimen.
The worst side effect of the biology restrictions, many experts say, is that young researchers are being driven away from important ecosystems and fields of study. 
In 1999, Christiane Ehringhaus, a German botanist pursuing a doctorate at Yale, was teaching Brazilian students and studying plants in the state of Acre in the Brazilian Amazon when newspapers implied that she was collecting seeds and insights from indigenous people in pursuit of potential drugs.
Although she is still in Acre, Ms. Ehringhaus said the resulting difficulties had prompted her to abandon botany altogether and shift to social and economic studies. 
"First," she said, "they drove me completely away from medicinal plants and now from plants, period." 
Prof. John H. Barton of the Stanford Law School, an expert on the biodiversity treaty, said the biggest weakness in the pact was its focus on biology as property. "It is much more about sharing the profits from genetic resources than it is about conserving biodiversity, about science," Professor Barton said.
Around the world, that focus has translated into warped expectations and suspicions, Dr. Callejas said in Colombia.
"I have trouble convincing my closest friends that what I do is because of passion, curiosity, a desire to know more about a group of organisms," he said. 
Everyone around him, he added, is convinced, with all the talk of property rights and miracle drugs, that it is about money. 
"The convention," Dr. Callejas said, has produced a "distorted view of what science is and who scientists are. And so now, we are the problem, not the solution."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Hard-Traveling Quayle Misses a Perk

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ASK Dan Quayle what he misses most about being vice president of the United States and he sounds a little like that midget from the old television program about that island. "The plane! The plane!" he says.
 Mr. Quayle, 10 years away from the comforts of Air Force Two, is a business traveler now -- "another average Joe out there schlepping his bags, trying to make the next plane," he said in a recent interview. 
 As vice president, Mr. Quayle, 55, made official visits to 47 countries and all 50 states. Now, as chairman of Quayle & Associates, a consulting firm, he racks up well over 100,000 miles a year in airplanes.
This makes him something of an authority on the rigors of frequent flying. In 1994, after a string of long airplane flights, Mr. Quayle developed a blood clot in his leg that migrated to the lungs. This pulmonary embolism, as it is known, was a painful and potentially deadly symptom of deep-vein thrombosis, a medical condition that occurs when blood clots form within a vein, usually in the leg or pelvis.
While some skeptics have scoffed that the number of passengers who develop deep-vein thrombosis is statistically minuscule, business travelers who fly frequently are among the most vulnerable.
The former vice president is a good example. When I spoke with him on the phone last Friday, he had just returned home to Phoenix from a business trip to New York City. The week before, he had flown to Taiwan, and then on to Japan. He flies to Asia at least six times a year.
"You can stretch out on international flights," he said. "They're actually the best," even if they're the longest, because "you can walk around the airplane." 
The deep-vein thrombosis associated with flying is often referred to as economy-class syndrome, because, obviously, trapping a human body in one of those wretched middle-row seats with 30-inch pitch on a 15-hour flight to Tokyo is an ideal way to test its susceptibility.
Though they are clearly vastly superior to steerage, airline first-class and business-class accommodations are not exactly like relaxing in your living room either. To the extent possible in a security-stressed era, it's a good idea to get up and stretch your legs regularly on a flight, said Mr. Quayle, who is working with an Internet health-advice company, Spotlight Health (www.spotlighthealth.com), to increase awareness of deep-vein thrombosis.
"I try to get up on an hourly basis," he said. "I just either go to the restroom," to avoid creating a commotion in the aisle, "or sometimes I go up and stand and chat with the flight attendants."
Mr. Quayle has had two separate episodes of deep-vein thrombosis, the second in 1998.
"The second time I got it, it was clearly indirectly related" to flying, he said, "I had a long flight from Phoenix to Nashville, about a three-and-a-half-hour, four-hour flight, and then I had a dinner the next night, and I sat a long time there."
Adding complications, he had days earlier helped his daughter move from her college dormitory. Lugging heavy objects, he later learned, can cause a shock to the legs and aggravate deep-vein thrombosis.
"I was carrying these heavy boxes out of her dorm, 70 pounds worth," he recalled. "And the reason I know it was 70 pounds is that I had to take them to the post office to mail them home. Too many clothes."
Besides reduced mobility (not to mention having children in college), among the risk factors are recent surgery (especially hip or knee); illnesses like heart disease, emphysema, pneumonia or infectious disease; pregnancy and blood clotting disorders. After his second episode, Mr. Quayle said he discovered that he had "blood that is predisposed to clotting" easily.
Identifying common blood clotting disorders is an important way to head off deep-vein thrombosis complications, Mr. Quayle said. Typically, he added, routine annual physical examinations do not test for this.
"This is something you can test for," said Mr. Quayle, who takes medication to alleviate the blood clotting problem. "I've had my kids tested to see if they have my blood."
Does he like to fly? "Well, you have to fly," Mr. Quayle replied. "As I said, I just came in from New York, and just got back from Asia. I'm going to Los Angeles on Monday, to Washington on Wednesday."
By the way, don't think that the airport security bureaucracy is unduly impressed when a former vice president shows up at the gate. That fair-haired fellow you see at the checkpoint in his stocking feet with his arms outstretched while a guard wands him under the ever-watchful eye of a rifle-toting National Guard warrior in camouflaged fatigues could well be Dan Quayle.
On his recent trip to Taipei, he was about to board the plane when a security guard told him to step aside. 
"She says, 'Random check go over there,' " Mr. Quayle said. "I go, 'Pardon me? What random check? Check for what?' And she says, 'Go over there!' "
Over there was an airline employee who apologized politely for the intrusion, while searching the former vice president's briefcase thoroughly. "A very nice lady, just doing her job," Mr. Quayle said.
On another recent trip, he was at Reagan National Airport when a security guard discovered a pair of toenail clippers in his carry-on bag.
"It was hilarious," Mr. Quayle said. At the airport, lots of fellow passengers recognized him, at least as a famous governmental face. "Half the people said 'Hi, Mr. Vice President,' and the other half said 'Hi, Senator,' and this guy is sitting there watching," with the toenail-clipper contraband in hand, he said.
"Finally, he says. 'Well, do you want this with the metal file on the end of it?' And I said, 'Well, what's my choice here?' And he said, 'I can break it off and give you your nail clippers back. Otherwise I have to keep these as nail clippers.' I said, 'Well, I'd like to have my nail clippers back.' So he just broke off" the file, "and I was on my way," Mr. Quayle said.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding a Damaged Palestine 

BYLINE:  By Robert Malley; Robert Malley is director of the Middle East Program of the International Crisis Group.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
One of the significant subplots in the current Israeli-Palestinian confrontation is that while Prime Minister Ariel Sharon loudly denounces Yasir Arafat for seeking to draw the international community into the conflict, Israel's actions push inexorably toward that result. Secretary of State Colin Powell's announcement that an international conference will be held this summer is but the latest indication.
 Beyond that, as the ability of the Palestinian Authority to deliver basic social services or ensure law and order declines, the prospects for more robust international intervention increase. Ideas once considered far-fetched -- a peacekeeping force, an international trusteeship or protectorate over the Palestinian territories -- suddenly are being taken seriously. The question is no longer whether the conflict will be internationalized, but how. The challenge is to intervene in a way that accelerates rather than impedes the search for an enduring solution. 
 Although the long-term strategy behind Israel's military actions may be unclear, their immediate impact on the Palestinian population is anything but. The operations have crippled Palestinian security organizations, sapped the ability of ministries to provide essential services and divided the territories into disconnected parts.
Security concerns can legitimately explain some of the Israeli Army's actions. But in more than one instance, that rationale would be difficult to sustain. Civilian ministries and medical facilities have been damaged; equipment and public documents with no discernible intelligence value, like school records, have been destroyed. The logic behind these actions appears to have less to do with furthering Israel's security than with its political goals. The result is that someone will have to reconstruct those institutions and deliver services.
From Day One, the Palestinian Authority has had to rely to a large extent on foreign help. Arguably, every single one of its branches -- from security to financial services -- has been supported, sometimes heavily, by one or several international actors. To take the most conspicuous example, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East runs roughly half of the social services in the West Bank and Gaza. But now, given the damage, international involvement of a far different magnitude may be necessary to help the Palestinian Authority provide shelter, restore water and sewage systems, and deliver basic government functions like security and law and order.
All this explains why so many are thinking so seriously about putting a transitional international structure in place.
Of course it may seem odd to evoke any international presence at this time, given Israel's refusal to allow a United Nations fact-finding team in Jenin. The dispute over the fact-finding plan shows the intensity of Israel's general distrust of international interference, which it views as a reward for Palestinian violence, and its particular distrust of the United Nations, which it views as hopelessly anti-Israeli. But in this situation, there are no appealing alternatives. Israel would be ill-advised to take on administration of the territories, and the Palestinian Authority cannot administer them on its own. Moreover, Israel's objections might well subside if an international presence helped enhance security for Israelis and if its representatives came from countries agreeable to both sides.
The challenge is to create an international role that reflects the goals and concerns of the two parties. Lessons from the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and from conflict-resolution efforts elsewhere suggest a few key principles.
First, and most important, the political end game must be clearly stated. To introduce an international apparatus without initially defining the outcome and a time line for reaching that outcome is to invite constant manipulation by the warring sides. Worse, the international effort would risk being perceived by the Palestinian people as a civilian counterpart to Israel's military occupation and therefore a target of radical militants.
In this instance the outlines of a final settlement are by now familiar: a sovereign and nonmilitarized Palestinian state whose borders would be based on 1967 lines, with land swaps of equal size to accommodate demographic realities; Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Arab neighborhoods as the capital of Palestine; a robust international force to provide security and monitor implementation of the agreement; and a solution to the refugee issue that does not threaten Israel's demographic balance.
Second, the goal should be to restore the Palestinian Authority's capacity to operate -- not to replace self-government, but to support it. What smacks of external imposition of control is likely to be treated as such.
Finally, the opportunity should not be lost to lay the foundation for a truly modern Palestinian state. In the past decade, Palestinian governance has proved to be a sorry tale of graft, economic mismanagement and human rights violations. A broad-based international involvement can help introduce more accountability and the rule of law. It can also help turn the Palestinian security forces from a multitude of competing fiefdoms into a more streamlined, professional police force.
The 20 months of fighting since the start of the second intifada may well have slowed down the process of Palestinian nation-building. But Israel's recent military actions will almost certainly accelerate the process of internationalization that Israelis have so far resisted and Palestinians have so often called for. If done right, the introduction of an international presence can benefit both sides. It can help increase security for Israelis and Palestinians, rebuild Palestinian self-government and provide Israel with assurances regarding Palestinian performance. Most important, it may begin to set in motion the process that should lead to the emergence of a viable state of Palestine living side by side with Israel.

Oil prices dropped nearly 2 percent yesterday after Iraq announced that it would resume crude exports on Wednesday, ending a monthlong ban on sales to protest Israeli incursions into Palestinian territory.
 The price of light crude fell 50 cents, to $26.12 a barrel, as Iraq called off a self-imposed embargo on its two million barrels a day of crude exports -- some 4 percent of internationally traded oil. 
 Iraq's return to world markets, coupled with a lull in the fighting in the West Bank, appears to have capped a rally that added 30 percent to the price of crude since the start of the year, analysts said.
"Short of a major supply dislocation," said Michael Rothman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, "the nearer-term markets have likely topped out."
Oil prices are more than $2 below six-month highs reached a month ago on fears that rising Middle East violence could upset supplies from the region, which pumps a third of the world's oil.
Stiff supply cuts imposed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries since January have added to the rally and fostered concern over rising energy costs in a fragile economic recovery.
Before it halted its exports on April 8, Iraq was supplying two-thirds of its crude to the United States. But the embargo had yet to cut into the United States fuel stockpiles, which are at surpluses compared with a year ago. 
Inventory figures to be released today are expected to show a modest fall in crude oil stocks and mild increases in refined product supplies.
OPEC will meet on June 26, and some ministers have signaled that they will not ease production curbs, which have cut the group's output to the lowest in a decade.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
With No Compelling Reasons to Buy, Investors Sell Off

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
With no favorable news, investors sold off stocks again yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 200 points and the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest close in nearly seven months.
 Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners in Orlando, Fla., said that two things were controlling the market: poor earnings and high valuation. "Put those two together, you end up with a lethal combination and the rough-tough trading we have been seeing," he said. 
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 34.55 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,578.48. The Nasdaq has been extremely weak, falling 12 of the last 14 sessions. The last time the Nasdaq closed lower was on Oct. 9, at 1,570.19. 
The market's other major indicators also finished lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 198.59 points, or 2 percent, to 9,808.04, after gaining 1 percent last week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 20.76 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,052.67, having slipped 0.3 percent last week.
Analysts said the market would continue to struggle until investors were assured that business was improving and that the economy was strengthening.
The market was also anxious about today's meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which may act on interest rates. At its last meeting on March 19, the committee left rates unchanged after making 11 rate cuts last year to stimulate the economy.
Investors are concerned that the committee may signal that it will raise interest rates before the economy has decisively improved.
Investors dealt with their qualms by selling, which they have been doing as companies report lackluster first-quarter earnings and fail to offer positive forecasts.
Technology has been on a steady decline throughout 2002 as the market expects it will be the last sector to emerge from recession. By the end of Friday's session, the technology-heavy Nasdaq had plunged 21.7 percent from its high close for the year, 2,059.38, on Jan. 4.
The network equipment maker Cisco Systems lost 25 cents, to $12.89; its fiscal third-quarter results will be released today.
Oracle, the software maker, lost 21 cents, to close at $8.22, adding to losses last week after two investment firms reduced their outlooks and a third investment firm questioned Oracle's growth prospects.
Blue chips posted widespread losses, illustrating investors' skepticism -- even about safer havens. Caterpillar fell $1.60, to $52.40; Exxon Mobil declined $1.34, to $39.25; and Home Depot stumbled $1.80, to $44.70.
But there were some winners, including Hewlett-Packard, up 78 cents, at $18.22 on its first day of trading since closing its merger with Compaq Computer.
After weeks of selling, the market might be poised for a rally, but Wall Street is not capable of sustaining an upturn, analysts said, until companies offer better outlooks.
"The market is probably just going to trade around here; you might see a little move lower and another move a little higher," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Treasuries fell yesterday as the federal government prepared its biggest quarterly debt sales since 1999, damping the allure of the fixed-rate securities. 
The Treasury plans to sell a record $22 billion of 5-year notes today and $11 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow, swelling the supply of debt to finance the country's first budget deficit in five years. 
The 10-year note dropped 3/32, to a price of 98 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.07 percent from 5.05 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond declined 2/32, to 97 20/32. Its yield was unchanged, at 5.54 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: More Small Colleges Dropping Out 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H. 

 BODY:
Mary Jane Lavoie is no stranger to colleges going out of business.
 Two years ago, she was the last registrar at Bradford College in Massachusetts, which shut its doors three years short of its 200th anniversary. Now, as the registrar of Notre Dame College here, she is going through the same sad routine, sending hundreds of transcripts to colleges for students seeking a new home, writing recommendations for colleagues looking for jobs and finding storage for records accumulated over 50 years. 
 "How can I get into this situation again?" said Ms. Lavoie, 41. "Shouldn't I be able to find myself a job from which I can retire?" 
Bradford and Notre Dame Colleges are not isolated cases. At least 27 of the nation's 1,600 private colleges -- many important in their regions, a few known more widely -- have announced plans to close since January 1997, a 35 percent increase from the previous five-year period.
Dozens more are in precarious financial situations and may face closing if the economy does not improve. Some of these, like Marymount College Tarrytown, north of New York City, have chosen to merge with stronger competitors. Some, like Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., have sought loans many times larger than their modest assets to spruce up their campuses in hopes of attracting students. 
Morton O. Schapiro, the president of Williams College in Massachusetts and an economist of higher education, said many of these private colleges offered the small classes and intimate settings unavailable in larger public institutions nearby.
"Every time you lose one of those jewels, it's unfortunate," he said. "It's like Wal-Mart opens up on the highway, and the mom-and-pop store around the corner closes."
The economy is not the only reason for the straits of many colleges. The more marginal private colleges have been losing students to cheaper public institutions, and women's and religious colleges have been hurt by other societal factors.
The private college market has shifted, becoming much more national than even a decade ago, hurting many regional colleges. High school graduates in the 1980's might have chosen regional colleges because of family or religious affiliations or simply to stay close to home, but young people today are less inclined to do so. The Internet has contributed by making it easier to learn about colleges far from home. 
To be sure, top liberal arts colleges like Williams and Amherst are not facing financial crises. Endowed with hundreds of millions of dollars each, they are in control of their destinies. But of the roughly 500 private liberal arts colleges, fewer than 50 are in such secure positions, said a recent study by Mr. Schapiro and Michael S. McPherson, another economist of higher education. Most have very small endowments or none.
David Breneman, an economics professor at the University of Virginia who is a leading analyst of the finances of higher education, said most private liberal arts colleges charged tuition of $15,000 to $25,000, lower than Ivy League tuition but much higher than tuition at public universities. "There are not enough families who are willing to pay the prices these schools ask for," he said.
The odds are stacked against private liberal arts colleges, the experts say. "Most of the rising demographic demand generated by Baby Boom 2 is being absorbed by public universities and community colleges," said John Nelson, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service. "The competition from the public sector is a lot more intense." Fifty years ago, half of college students went to private institutions. Today, less than one-fifth do.
Mary Peloquin-Dodd, who analyzes the college and university market for Standard & Poor's, said teenagers today choose colleges differently from the way their parents or grandparents did. 
"The students are more savvy," she said. "They are looking for things that cost more money. They want apartments instead of dorms. They want physical facilities -- buildings, gyms, computers -- that are the state of the art."
But most liberal arts colleges, unlike the big public and elite private institutions, cannot afford large-scale construction or periodic computer upgrades. 
To win over more students, many of these regional colleges offer large scholarships, which cut into tuition income. In the meantime, the popularity of liberal arts majors has declined. In 1969, about half of all college degrees awarded were in liberal arts. The figure dwindled to less than 40 percent in the 1970's and is about 25 percent today. 
To survive, many small colleges are redesigning their curriculums and redefining their missions. The College of St. Mary in Omaha has set aside an entire dormitory for students who are single mothers, even offering day care.
But the room for error is small, the economists say, and one misstep can push a college under. Bradford closed its doors after a new dormitory failed to attract a bigger enrollment. 
Ms. Lavoie, the registrar at Notre Dame College, is not the only one reliving the pain of a college's demise. Kerry Phipps, a Notre Dame junior, attended Trinity College in Burlington, Vt., for her freshman year and afterward learned it was closing. This time, the end is not as sudden, so she can at least say goodbye to professors and classmates. 
"I bought a Notre Dame class ring," she said. "I really wanted to graduate from here." 
The seniors here are more worried about the lack of an alma mater. "You know how you want to come back to your school and show your kids," said Jimmie Denwiddie, a senior on scholarship who has majored in business management. "I am getting a business degree from a school that goes out of business."
Few of the 62 members of Notre Dame's faculty have found jobs, and the future does not look rosy. 
No one has bought the Georgian-style campus of Bradford in the quaint town with which it shares its name. Thick dust has settled on dormitory lamps, desks and beds. Salt and pepper shakers, half full, still sit on dining hall tables. 
"It feels like the school were just on a break," said Kristen Hollenbeck, a fund-raiser who runs Bradford's alumni organization, as she sauntered recently on the empty campus. "It feels like next week the kids would all be coming back."

HEADLINE: Medical Students Sue Over Residency System 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
Every March, graduating medical school students wait anxiously for Match Day, when a computer tells them where they will spend the next several years as medical residents in teaching hospitals.
 A class-action lawsuit to be filed in Washington today challenges the matching program on antitrust grounds. The suit says the defendants, including seven medical organizations and more than 1,000 private hospitals, have used the program to keep residents' wages low and hours long. Almost all first-year residents make less than $40,000 a year and often work 100-hour weeks. 
 If the suit is successful, the nation's health care system faces an enormous financial liability and the prospect of being forced to change the way that generations of doctors have been trained. 
More than 80 percent of first-year residency positions are offered exclusively through the program, known formally as the National Resident Matching Program. The matches are based on ranked lists submitted by hospitals and the 15,000 or so students, and both sides agree in advance to accept the match. 
There is no room for negotiations about wages, hours or other terms of employment. As a consequence, the plaintiffs say, the hospitals, which share detailed salary information with each other, can force residents to accept below-market wages for the three to eight years, depending on specialty, of their residencies. 
"The match basically controls where you are going to spend the first part of your professional life," said Dr. Paul Jung, one of the plaintiffs, who is now a fellow at Johns Hopkins University. Yet, he said, "you're expressly forbidden from having any kind of agreement about any kind of salary or anything."
Lloyd Constantine, who was New York's top antitrust official for a decade and is not involved in the suit, said the case raised important issues. "If this were coal or steel or autos, it would flat out be a felony and would probably be prosecuted criminally," he said of the matching system.
Alvin Roth, an economics professor at Harvard, redesigned the system in 1997. He said it merely ensured that medical students obtain the best residencies they could. This fosters competition, he said, which the antitrust laws are meant to protect. 
But James F. Blumstein, an expert in health care regulation at Vanderbilt Law School in Nashville, said that the matching program "does prevent competition in the sense that you can't entertain competing offers." 
"It's not only salaries but also access to opportunities," he said. "It's hard to see what the pro-competitive justification is here."
Defenders of the matching program say that it is a mistake to think about it in purely commercial terms. They say residencies serve an important social purpose in training doctors and providing care for patients. Whether the antitrust laws should take account of these kinds of arguments is the subject of debate.
"It's not exactly a job, it's a continuation of a medical education," said Kevin Jon Williams, a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, who has written extensively on the matching program.
Sherman Marek, a Chicago lawyer whose law firm, along with 14 others, represents the plaintiffs, said there was nothing special about jobs that educate. "In any employment, the employee is acquiring skills that can then be taken elsewhere, so there is always an education element," he said. "Nevertheless, market forces are allowed to operate."
Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to speculate on how much residents' salaries might change if the matching program were eliminated.
Representatives of the medical organizations declined to comment on the lawsuit or did not return calls.
Residents' wages are certainly both low for the profession and uniform. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, which operates the program and is a defendant in the suit, the average first-year resident, having completed four years of medical school, is paid $37,383. In the Northeast, the average is $39,060; in the South, the average is $35,552.
Hundred-hour workweeks for residents are common, meaning that they often make less than $10 an hour. 
"They get less money than nurses and physician's assistants," said Michael J. Freed, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs' legal papers say the uniformity of the wages proves that something is wrong. 
"Employers pay residents standardized salaries, regardless of such factors as program prestige, medical specialty, geographic location, resident merit and year of employment," the papers argue. "With few exceptions, employers pay salaries very close to the national average and very close to each other. By contrast, post-residency physicians earn widely varying compensations based on these factors, especially geographic location and medical specialty."
But Professor Roth, the system designer, said the similarities in wages by themselves prove nothing. "If you're looking at prices, both competition and collusion look similar," he said. Moreover, "people would be willing to pay to take these slots," he said, referring to the most desirable positions. 
George L. Priest, a professor at Yale Law School who was a consultant to the plaintiffs, disagreed. "The salary data is highly suspicious," he said. "There is no good reason why doctors after four years of graduate school should make a quarter of what lawyers make."
The low wages and long hours have serious consequences, Dr. Jung said. "I had to constantly battle fatigue as a factor affecting the quality of my life and the lives of my patients," he said.
Dr. Jung, 32, said his residency at the MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland was dispiriting.
Hospitals "use residents as cheap labor," he said. "I had the expectation, maybe naively, that a lot of time would be spent with patients." 
Instead, Dr. Jung said, he performed many menial and administrative tasks. "It was a lot more hours and a lot less patient care than I expected," he said.
He added: "Residents want to be treated fairly, and patients want to be treated well. Patient care will improve if you let residents have more say in their working conditions."
The Justice Department looked into the residency matching program in the mid-1990's. It reached a settlement with an association that administered a separate program for family practice residencies, but did not challenge the main program. Professor Roth said this meant the government had given the hospital matching program "a clean bill of health."
Mr. Constantine said that the professional training aspect of residents' work made it difficult to predict the outcome of the case. "There is a level of sentimentality" among judges, he said. "They will listen to excuses they would not listen to in the context of a purely commercial situation," he said.
Professor Blumstein said those excuses should not play a role in antitrust analysis. "The better view and the correct view is that antitrust law does not allow for worthy purposes to offset the anticompetitive actions," he said.
The closest analogy, Mr. Constantine said, is the civil suit that the federal government brought a decade ago against the eight Ivy League colleges and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology challenging their cooperation in setting student financial aid. The case ended in settlements that limited the amount of information the institutions could share.
Such information sharing is even more problematic when salaries are involved, he said. "The medical world really is closer to coal, steel and autos than to colleges giving out financial aid," he said. 
Critics compare the residency matching program to early decision programs at colleges. They say that colleges accepting applicants through early decision can offer less attractive financial aid packages because there is no competition for those students, just as hospitals can pay residents low wages because they have nowhere else to go.
The stakes in the new suit are high. The complaint does not specify how much money the plaintiffs seek, but they claim to represent a class of 200,000 residents. If residents' fair market salaries were determined to be $100,000, say, the sums at issue for a single year would exceed $12 billion, and since this is an antitrust case, the damages would be automatically tripled. 
"It's not obvious that it's in the interests of the plaintiffs to bankrupt every hospital in the country," Professor Priest said. "But it's going to change the nature of medical care. They are going to have to bid for the services of these medical residents, and they won't be able to work them 120 hours a week."

HEADLINE: At Last, Colleges Answer, And New Questions Arise 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
There was plenty to do beside wait and worry once the last test was taken, the last essay written, the last application mailed. 
 Gerta Xhelo readied herself for her only college interview, still flip-flopping about staying home or going away. 
 Jed Resnick continued his high-wire act of performing and studying, and awaited word from Yale. 
And Reuben Quansah tended his relationship with schools scouting minority students and hoped for a financial-aid windfall.
The lives of these three New York City high school students had converged for most of the hectic college admissions process. But there was one critical difference. 
For Jed, an upper-middle-class boy at the Collegiate School in Manhattan, the hardest part would be choosing from the colleges that accepted him. For Reuben, an African-American teenager at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, and Gerta, an Albanian immigrant at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, a fat envelope from their No. 1 college meant nothing unless it came with enough financial aid. Jed could follow his heart. The others had to follow the money.
By mid-February, Gerta was receiving acceptance letters: from Baruch, a City University campus; St. John's; and Pace. These live-at-home options might have satisfied her six months earlier. But now Gerta was vacillating, wanting to stay home one day and go away the next.
"I'm 17," Gerta said. "That's what 17-year-olds are supposed to do: change their minds."
She still longed for N.Y.U., a long shot. Some days she was tempted by Syracuse, which she had never visited. But the first choice of her counselor, Roz Sternlieb, was the Rose Hill campus of Fordham. 
Many of the counselor's students had thrived in the state's Higher Education Opportunity Program there. The program offers sizable scholarships and remedial services for promising low-income students. Fordham's program is particularly generous and has a staff as caring as the little college office at Grover Cleveland. The girl could live on campus and still be close enough to look after her family.
Ms. Sternlieb began pestering the HEOP office about Gerta early in February. She dialed from memory Stephie Mukherjee at Fordham and praised "one student in particular who would really benefit" from the program's one-on-one attention. "Her last name is Xhelo," Ms. Sternlieb said, "but not like the regular Jello."
Within days, Gerta had a March 12 interview. It would be Gerta's first, months behind both Jed and Reuben, who had taken grand tours by comparison. She didn't even know where the Bronx was.
But Gerta had an unexpected glimpse of what college might be like as a residential student. She had taken a school trip to Sugarbush, in Vermont, over Presidents' Day weekend. It was an eye-opener.
She came home with an album of snapshots of new friends crowded into hotel rooms, horsing around in their pajamas, eating vending machine junk food, having the time of their lives.
The morning of her interview, Gerta took so long choosing what to wear that she missed the first two school periods. Her mother, Shpresa, weighed in, so the result was conservative: dressy black slacks and a red turtleneck sweater. Mrs. Xhelo persuaded Gerta to wear a crucifix, as Fordham was a Jesuit school.
The walls in the HEOP office are covered with plaques of gratitude from prior classes. Melba Diaz, the receptionist, is known to the students as Mom. A typical visitor was a current undergraduate who stopped in to say that her mother was in the hospital and that she had broken her engagement to a boy Ms. Diaz did not like.
Gerta, meanwhile, spent nearly two hours closeted with Ms. Mukherjee, who was impressed with her grit, effervescence and classic immigrant's story.
Gerta told Ms. Mukherjee of her worry that being in HEOP would pigeonhole her as a second-class student. "These are not HEOP degrees," Ms. Mukherjee assured her. "They are Fordham degrees, just like everyone else's." The girl emerged radiant.
"Unbelievable as it might sound, my mother accepts the idea that I might have to dorm there," Gerta e-mailed the next day. "I was shocked but very very glad." 
Gerta's acceptance letter from Fordham arrived on March 26. She said she was "jumping and screaming" when she entered the Xhelos' apartment. She could barely hold still to translate for her parents.
Gerta's father, Zegir Xhelo, who quietly dotes on his daughter, said he was proud. "That's the first time he's ever said that out loud," Gerta said.
She was extraordinarily fortunate. Recent studies, including one titled "Losing Ground," released last week, have documented how poor and middle-class families are paying an ever-rising share of their income to attend public universities, normally the more affordable part of higher education. The HEOP program in New York has fallen behind inflation; it supported only 5,774 students in the 1999-2000 school year as opposed to 7,528 in 1993-94.
But Gerta, telling no one, clung to her concern that being in HEOP was a mark of inferiority. And at the last minute she came up with a new plan. 
Her financial aid package from Syracuse had arrived, inferior to Fordham's and with none of the remedial services. Still, out of the blue, and with just 24 hours before the formal reply date, Gerta burst into Room 118A announcing she had changed her mind.
Ms. Sternlieb sputtered. Gerta had never seen Syracuse. Without the HEOP services, at a huge university so far from home, she might lose her way. Should the counselor call Gerta's parents, whom she had never met? Should she urge the safer decision? 
With the office door closed, the counselor probed Gerta's thinking. The girl swore she could act responsibly. She insisted her parents could fill the $5,500 gap between her aid package and the real cost. She was unfazed at graduating with twice the loans to repay that she would have after Fordham. 
Gerta had taken a virtual campus tour. She had checked the ratings and found Syracuse ranked higher. She had been on the phone with friends of her cousin who went there. She wanted to go someplace that "accepted me like I was anybody else."
Gerta saw dismay on Ms. Sternlieb's face. "I really, really thought about it," she said, seeking approval. Ms. Sternlieb could muster only tepid enthusiasm. 
Gerta busied herself with an application for a $1,000-a-year scholarship from Amoco. That money mattered more now. Ms. Sternlieb helped her remember all her community service activities. And when asked, she passed the girl the tube of white-out.
"I put Fordham here," Gerta said. "Now I have to change that." 

Jed Resnick
Crucial Months For the Counselor
Jed's parents, accustomed to paying $21,000-a-year private school tuitions and $7,000 more for his theatrical activities, can afford his college education. So the boy was spared the financial aid ordeal. 
That meant January, February and March were pleasant. It was O.K. to cut school now and again. Jed had plenty of time to go to the theater with his family. And there were his own productions: the demanding soliloquies of Edward Albee's "Zoo Story," his first turn both directing and starring in Jonathan Harvey's "Beautiful Thing," and even a Collegiate benefit where he did a star turn with professional performers who happened to be Collegiate parents -- Kate Burton, Tovah Feldshuh and Simon Jones, to name a few. 
But these were crucial months for his counselor, Bruce Breimer, the time for "due diligence calls" to the colleges with heavy dockets of Collegiate applicants. In principle, any high school counselor can make such calls. In fact, they are most common at private schools and high-end public schools, or in rare inner-city schools with an aggressive counselor like Ms. Sternlieb.
These confidential calls allow admissions officers to tell Mr. Breimer who is out of the running and who is headed for final committee review. Mr. Breimer, in turn, can advocate for a candidate and ready himself to soften the blow for boys facing rejection.
A due diligence call to one Ivy League school left Mr. Breimer alarmed to discover that a boy with superb grades and a leadership position had attracted only lukewarm interest. In time to influence the decision, the counselor researched and passed along the history of similar applicants in years past.
Another call, to a top-ranked school not among the Ivies, focused on three applicants. In one case, the university mistakenly thought a candidate's grades were too low. Mr. Breimer's assistant faxed updated information, which kept the boy in play.
Next came "a special interest case," somewhat underqualified but with a prominent parent. This situation is similar to a "legacy," a boy whose father or mother attended the school, or what admissions officers call a development office special, the child of someone prepared to donate more than a half-million dollars. 
Admissions officers are under pressure to take such students, but do not want to look compromised. Mr. Breimer assured his counterpart that this particular boy was "strong enough not to raise any red flags." 
Last was a boy who had overcome learning disabilities. Mr. Breimer told the admissions officer that he would be accepted at an Ivy League school that both his parents had attended and would prefer to go there. 
With colleges judged in popular rankings by their yield, or the percentage of accepted students who matriculate, Mr. Breimer likes alerting admissions officers if they are about to waste an offer. This makes a strong statement that he does not condone "scalp-hunting," the "gluttonous" tendency of today's students to make as many as two dozen applications, and collect acceptances to brag about at the expense of other candidates.
Certain seniors give Mr. Breimer a "blood oath" that they will go to their first-choice college if accepted. He then passes along this information. Sometimes the No. 1 college will "whisper in my ear" that the boy will be admitted, Mr. Breimer said. Then he goes a step further and tells that boy's safety schools that he is locked in elsewhere, giving another set of admissions officers an opportunity to improve their yield. 
Mr. Breimer also tries to help students through the shoals of rejection, as he did for Jed on April 3, when the boy went online to find out his fate at Yale. "Sorry to tell you . . ." popped up. Mr. Breimer was at the boy's elbow, cushioning the blow by telling him that "more good news is coming."
Jed had already been accepted at Tisch School of the Arts, part of New York University, and at Vassar. He was still waiting for word from Harvard, Williams and Brown. Jed hoped that Mr. Breimer's wink-and-nod meant a Brown acceptance was on the way.
Brown had been Jed's tentative second choice and a blood-oath No. 1 for his twin brother, Micah. Brown does not post results on the Web, so it took two days for both boys to hear they were in. For Micah the ordeal was over. For Jed, hard decisions remained.
Was he willing to forgo the intellectual stimulation of liberal arts for Tisch's specialized training? Was going to the same school as Micah such a good idea? Maybe Vassar's fine theater department was a compromise.
Mr. Breimer urged the boy to "take your own sweet time," and revisit each college. 
A return to Tisch soured Jed quickly. The students complained about any nontheater courses, he said. Plus, he concluded, "I do need to get out of the city" and the lingering bitterness of his parents' divorce and his father's August remarriage.
A visit to Vassar ended similarly. "It felt too small, too incestuous, and the people were surprisingly homogenous,"Jed said.
On the other hand, Brown delighted him. 
Along with his brother and 900 other accepted students, he traveled to Providence, R.I., on a special Amtrak train, went to a class called Latin Love Elegies, saw a cappella performances and learned "what was Brown and what was un-Brown." 
Jed could already imagine combining theater studies and classics. He had "a secret little ambition" to set the Cupid and Psyche myth to music. At Brown, he now knew, there was one student-written musical each year. Why not his? 

Reuben Quansah
Intrusions Of Income Form
No parents' assembly at Cardinal Hayes is better attended than the one each January that deconstructs the daunting form known as the Fafsa, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The four-page questionnaire about income and assets requires six pages of instructions.
Reuben's mother, Maureen Dowouna-Nortey, took copious notes as Bill Lessa, the college counselor, and two financial aid officers, one speaking English and one Spanish, tried to explain it. 
Are the blue sections for student information and the lavender for parents or the other way around? Does the Department of Education really send the form back if it is not printed in capital letters? 
What does "eligible non-citizen" mean? Who fills out the form for a ward of the court? And what about second marriages? Does a stepfather's income count?
Mr. Lessa, and Roz Sternlieb at Grover Cleveland, have the rules down pat because needy students are their primary constituency. By contrast, Bruce Breimer, Jed's counselor, is clueless. He is a wizard at selling his students to Ivy League schools. But he refers Collegiate's students needing college scholarships to an outside consultant. 
The parents at Hayes are sensitive about financial matters, reluctant to tell Mr. Lessa how much they earn, or provide verification if they are on welfare. Reuben's mother, for instance, was unwilling to reveal her income and sent out the Fafsa form herself rather than funneling it through Mr. Lessa's office. "It's my personal business," she said.
But she gave him enough information to make it clear that Reuben would not qualify for HEOP, which would require a family income below $23,500. 
"Here I am struggling, so they can tell me I make too much," said Ms. Dowouna-Nortey, who works double shifts as a nurse-technician at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx and goes to night school at City College so she can resume the teaching career she had in Ghana. "It just makes me cry." 
One element of the Fafsa presentation particularly held her attention: the federal guidelines for who is considered a parent for the purpose of calculating income. The law stipulates that a remarried woman like Ms. Dowouna-Nortey include her husband's income, whether or not he contributes to the household, as long as he is living there on the day the form is filed. Ms. Dowouna-Nortey did not list her husband, Jonas, and was confident she had followed the guidelines.
"You have no idea how many times he has been in and out of this house," she said.
Money remained a worry, but acceptances were not. While Jed sweated out the Ivy League wait until April, Reuben's mailbox was brimming with good news by February.
Manhattan College took him and offered extra scholarship money if he would commute, since dormitory space was tight. (All of Reuben's schools use a system called rolling admissions, rather than the fixed reply date of the most elite colleges.) 
Then Clarkson said yes with a $6,000 "incentive" scholarship, a technique used to flatter students and keep them interested while they await other replies. The State University at Buffalo wanted Reuben, too. So did Lafayette, which, like Bucknell, was seeking to increase minority enrollment and was not restricted by court rulings striking down affirmative action in some state systems. 
But best of all was an informal letter in February from Bucknell, Reuben's first choice, weeks ahead of the usual mailing. "Given the anxiety prevailing at this time of year, we thought you might enjoy some good news now," it said, inviting Reuben to an April open house for accepted students.
These early letters and spring receptions are increasingly popular among college admissions officers, as yet another way to improve their yield and look better in college rankings. The Ivy League and other select colleges moved their notification date from mid- to early April a decade ago to give them more time to roll out the red carpet. And since then, more and more money is being spent wooing prospective freshmen.
The early letter from Bucknell pleased Reuben but did not free him to celebrate. "I still have to worry about money," he said. "If another school gives me more . . . I'll go where I get the most aid."
At Bucknell, a typical financial aid package covers $19,000 of the annual $32,000 cost of tuition, room and board, leaving a gap of $13,000. But when Reuben visited last fall with a group of inner-city students, Mark Davies, the dean of admissions, told them that "typical" means just that. Some students "pay next to nothing."
Bucknell, Mr. Davies told them, "works hard to meet the demonstrated level of need." Then he went further: An initial financial aid offer was not the last word. "I want to hear from you if there's something else we can do," he said.
This time, no further appeal was needed.
When Reuben and his mother arrived at Bucknell for the accepted students' festivities they were handed his financial aid information. His was a "preferential package," the document said, because of his "outstanding academic credentials" and the contribution he would make to "cultural pluralism." 
Reuben's costs each year, including tuition, room and board, books, travel and incidentals, would be $33,583, Bucknell estimated. The school would pay $28,500 of that; $2,750 more would come from a federal Pell grant and $2,625 more from a federal Stafford loan. In addition, he was eligible for an on-campus job that paid at least $1,500. That totaled almost $2,000 more than he needed.
This was as good as it gets, Mr. Lessa told him. "All he's been doing is smiling," Ms. Dowouna-Nortey said.
Reuben, grinning ear to ear, ducked his head.

PERSON: Antoine Riboud 

HEADLINE: Antoine Riboud, Builder of French Food Giant, Dies at 83 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 6 

 BODY:
Antoine Riboud, the banker's son who built one of the biggest food groups in Europe and exercised a far-reaching and often paternalistic influence over its global empire, died at his Paris home early Sunday. He was 83.
 Mr. Riboud, who built the Danone group over several decades before handing the reins to his youngest son, Franck, in 1996, was a man of extremes. He engineered the first hostile takeover in France, in 1968, and bought and sold businesses the way chess players move pawns. Yet he made passionate appeals, often to the chagrin of other French capitalists, to allow social concerns alongside the profit motive in French business. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Mr. Riboud, a music lover, mobilized his private plane to carry the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, a friend, to perform in Berlin. 
 Mr. Riboud went through several businesses in his lifetime, beginning with glass and packaging, then successfully moving to food products. He was a consummate salesman who always had a company candy bar in a side pocket to offer visitors. He had an instinctive appreciation for the value of a brand, and saw the Danone brand -- Dannon in the United States -- climb in recognition to rank second in Europe to Coca Cola.
His critics, though they were not many, chided his paternalism in standing up for the rights of employees as well as shareholders. Moreover, he was bitterly attacked in 1996 when -- even though his family controlled only 1 percent of Danone shares -- he named his son to run the business on his retirement at age 77. 
But his force of personality and persuasive power persuaded Danone's main shareholders, including the Agnellis of Italy and the investment bank Lazard, to back him, and the decision was accepted.
To his admirers, he was one of a generation of unconventional French captains of industry who moved along untrodden paths to bring France out of economic isolation and onto the world stage. Today Danone is a food giant, with global activities and 14 billion euros in annual revenue, ranking with Nestle of Switzerland and the English-Dutch conglomerate Unilever among the world's biggest food companies.
Born the fifth of seven children of a banker in Lyon on Dec. 24, 1918, Mr. Riboud was sent by his father during World War II to work at a family-owned glass company, Souchon-Neuvesel, where within seven years he worked his way up to be president. In 1966, Mr. Riboud, recognizing the demand for glass in the building and automobile boom of postwar France, persuaded the shareholders of a plate-glass manufacturer, Boussois, to merge with his company, forming a new glass-making group, Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel, or BSN.
In December 1968, Mr. Riboud did the unthinkable, making a hostile bid with the backing of the powerful Lazard banking house for the prestigious French glassmaker Saint-Gobain. After a bitter but unsuccessful battle, Mr. Riboud was forced to back off, but the audacity of the assault increased his notoriety.
By the 1970's, Mr. Riboud began moving away from glass products, like bottles, into products that filled them. In 1972, BSN acquired the food businesses of the Evian bottled water company, then in quick succession the breweries Kronenbourg and Kanterbrau. That same year, he merged with Gervais-Danone, a pioneer in the mass production of yogurt; it had been founded before World War II by a Frenchman, Daniel Carasso.
During the war, Mr. Carasso had fled to the United States, where he made and sold yogurt under the anglicized Dannon name. The business was later bought by the Beatrice Foods Company, which sold Dannon to Mr. Riboud in 1981, thus returning it to the French fold.
After the second oil shock, in 1979, Mr. Riboud determined to move his activities completely out of glass and to focus on food products. After snapping up smaller French companies making everything from mineral water to cookies, in 1989 he took a decisive step out of France, acquiring the European activities of Nabisco.
In the midst of this activity, Mr. Riboud became an outspoken proponent of a balance between profit and social responsibility. In 1972, he angered the French corporate elite when he championed his view in a widely publicized speech to the French employers association. In 1981, when a leftist government was voted into office, he became an occasional adviser to the new prime minister, Pierre Beregovoy.
By the early 1990's, however, when the company was still called BSN, Mr. Riboud realized his industrial strategy needed tuning. Recession enveloped Europe, and revenue and profit began contracting, beginning a slide that was not arrested until 1996. But in 1994, Mr. Riboud decided to change the company name to Danone, capitalizing on the fact that every day some 37 million containers of Danone, or Dannon, yogurt were consumed around the world. Two years later, Mr. Riboud again surprised the business world, announcing that he would step down and nominating Franck, then 40, to succeed him.
Mr. Riboud is also survived by his wife, Lucette; two other sons, Patrice and Gilles; and a daughter, Christine Mital.

HEADLINE: Home Lender Offers to Settle Claims of Predatory Practices 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
A major home equity loan company that government agencies and consumer advocates once described as a symbol of predatory lending has reached a proposed $1.65 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit waged on behalf of thousands of borrowers.
 A lawyer for the plaintiffs called the accord the "absolute best we could get" in months of negotiations with the loan company, Delta Financial Corporation of Woodbury, N.Y. He noted that some of the plaintiffs would have their mortgage payment arrears cut in half. But some consumer advocates said the proposed agreement was inadequate, because it offered many borrowers one-time payments of only $20 or less while requiring them to give up legal rights. 
 The deal is subject to court approval. 
In 1999 and 2000, several federal and New York State agencies filed lawsuits accusing Delta of predatory lending practices involving loans to thousands of homeowners in poor and minority neighborhoods in more than 20 states, most often in New York, as well as to homeowners with poor credit ratings. The company pressured them to take loans that they could not afford, and that carried exorbitant and illegal fees and interest rates, the agencies said.
Those suits were settled with Delta denying wrongdoing but agreeing to adhere to the agencies' demands and submit to close scrutiny. One of the suits, brought by the State Banking Department, also resulted in relief totaling $12 million.
Delta also denies wrongdoing in the current proposed settlement.
Notice of the proposed settlement has been delivered to the plaintiffs, who must decide by Friday whether or not to take part. On May 24, Magistrate Judge Marilyn D. Go of Federal District Court in Brooklyn is scheduled to hold a hearing on whether the accord "should be approved as fair, adequate and reasonable," according to the notice.
One provision calls for Delta to reduce the remaining loan balance for some of those who defaulted early by 10 percent, and the arrears on those loans by 50 percent -- reductions that the agreement values at $1.15 million. Many other class members would get cash payments of varying but apparently small amounts totaling $500,000.
Those who choose not to take part in the proposed settlement can sue Delta on their own.
Abbey Gardy, the Manhattan law firm representing the plaintiffs, has said that more than 10,000 people were in the class. They are people who obtained loans from Delta Financial's mortgage subsidiary, Delta Funding, between November 19, 1992, and October 31, 1999, or from another lender that sold the loans to Delta later.
Government regulators and critics said that when the borrowers, often elderly people who needed money to fix up their homes or meet other expenses, defaulted in their payments, Delta foreclosed on their homes, which were the collateral.
Some of the government lawsuits, including one filed by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York, also accused Delta of violating civil rights laws.
An opponent of the pending settlement in the class-action suit, Pamela Sah, a staff lawyer with the foreclosure prevention project of South Brooklyn Legal Services, maintained that most of those in the class would be entitled to the cash payments, rather than the reductions of outstanding principle and mortgage arrears. She said the offers of payments she had seen for those her group represented in foreclosure actions by Delta had been onetime amounts no higher than $21.
In return, she said, the borrowers agree to give up not only the right not to sue Delta on the issues in the case, but the right to sue the company in the future or to defend themselves in foreclosure actions should they default on future payments.
Sarah Ludwig, director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, based in Manhattan, said the proposed settlement "appears to offer small benefits against the backdrop of abusive lending practices."
The plaintiffs' lawyer in the suit, Curt P. Beck of Abbey Gardy, said he would have liked to get much more in the settlement, but "it's just not possible."
Yesterday, Delta issued a statement defending the proposal as a "fair and reasonable settlement based on a myriad of factors, including an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the borrowers' case and Delta's denial of liability, as well as the broad-based relief afforded to borrowers and the exemplary practices adopted by Delta under its settlements with" the Banking Department and attorney general.

HEADLINE: On the Road, With Mr. West Virginia 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"How Do West Virginians Spell Pork? It's B-Y-R-D" (front page, May 4) brought to mind my wife's and my pleasant experience driving across West Virginia last summer.
 Our journey took us along the Robert C. Byrd Highway -- or, as I am now wiser to say, a Robert C. Byrd highway. 
We marveled at this ribbon of runway that snaked round one mountain after another, giving us magnificent vistas unimpeded by other road users, since there was hardly a soul on the road this weekday afternoon. 
 As we cruised effortlessly along, road signs reminded us every couple of miles that we had Robert C. Byrd to thank for this luxury.
We realized, too, that we were discovering where so many billions of our tax dollars were being oh-so-democratically bestowed.
But as we finally sailed over the state line into our more familiar world of congestion, potholes and lane closings, it occurred to us that there was a flaw in this scheme for the West Virginia economy, and it was this: we had traversed the state so easily that we had had no need of a Robert C. Byrd rest stop or a break for a Robert C. Byrd burger and Coke.

HEADLINE: True Blue Americans 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Remember how hard New York's elected representatives had to fight to get $20 billion in aid for the stricken city -- aid that had already been promised? Well, recently Congress agreed to give farmers $180 billion in subsidies over the next decade. By the way, the population of New York City is about twice as large as America's total farm population. 
 I've been a stern critic of the Bush administration, but this is one case where Democrats in the Senate were the lead villains. To its credit, the administration initially opposed an increase in farm subsidies, though as in the case of steel protection, it didn't take long before political calculation trumped the administration's alleged principles. But politics aside, maybe the farm bill debacle will help us, finally, to free ourselves from a damaging national myth: that the "heartland," consisting of the central, relatively rural states, is morally superior to the rest of the country. 
 You've heard the story many times: the denizens of the heartland, we're told, are rugged, self-reliant, committed to family; the inhabitants of the coast are whining yuppies. Indeed, George W. Bush has declared that he visits his stage set -- er, ranch -- in Crawford to "stay in touch with real Americans." (And what are those of us who live in New Jersey -- chopped liver?)
But neither the praise heaped on the heartland nor the denigration of the coasts has any basis in reality.
I've done some statistical comparisons using one popular definition of the heartland: the "red states" that -- in an election that pitted both coasts against the middle -- voted for Mr. Bush. How do they compare with the "blue states" that voted for Al Gore? 
Certainly the heartland has no claim to superiority when it comes to family values. If anything, the red states do a bit worse than the blue states when you look at indicators of individual responsibility and commitment to family. Children in red states are more likely to be born to teenagers or unmarried mothers -- in 1999, 33.7 percent of babies in red states were born out of wedlock, versus 32.5 percent in blue states. National divorce statistics are spotty, but per capita there were 60 percent more divorces in Montana than in New Jersey. 
And the red states have special trouble with the Sixth Commandment: the murder rate was 7.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in the red states, compared with 6.1 in the blue states, and 4.1 in New Jersey.
But what's really outrageous is the claim that the heartland is self-reliant. That grotesque farm bill, by itself, should put an end to all such assertions; but it only adds to the immense subsidies the heartland already receives from the rest of the country. As a group, red states pay considerably less in taxes than the federal government spends within their borders; blue states pay considerably more. Over all, blue America subsidizes red America to the tune of $90 billion or so each year.
And within the red states, it's the metropolitan areas that pay the taxes, while the rural regions get the subsidies. When you do the numbers for red states without major cities, you find that they look like Montana, which in 1999 received $1.75 in federal spending for every dollar it paid in federal taxes. The numbers for my home state of New Jersey were almost the opposite. Add in the hidden subsidies, like below-cost provision of water for irrigation, nearly free use of federal land for grazing and so on, and it becomes clear that in economic terms America's rural heartland is our version of southern Italy: a region whose inhabitants are largely supported by aid from their more productive compatriots.
There's no mystery about why the heartland gets such special treatment: it's a result of our electoral system, which gives states with small populations -- mainly, though not entirely, red states -- disproportionate representation in the Senate, and to a lesser extent in the Electoral College. In fact, half the Senate is elected by just 16 percent of the population.
But while this raw political clout is a fact of life, at least we can demand an end to the hypocrisy. The heartland has no special claim to represent the "real America." And the blue states have a right to ask why, at a time when the federal government has plunged back into deficit, when essential domestic programs are under assault, a small minority of heavily subsidized Americans should feel that they are entitled to even more aid.

HEADLINE: Bush Expected to Name 2 Economists to Federal Reserve Seats 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
President Bush is preparing to nominate two prominent monetary economists -- Ben S. Bernanke of Princeton University and Donald L. Kohn, a top aide to Alan Greenspan -- to open seats on the Federal Reserve Board, government officials said today.
 The appointments, which have been rumored for weeks, could be made within days, the officials said. 
 The Fed is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to consider interest rate policy. Economists and financial markets expect the Fed to hold its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks steady at 1.75 percent. 
In selecting Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Kohn, Mr. Bush is addressing what some analysts consider to be a potential problem for the Fed: the absence from the seven-member board of governors of economists with deep experience in monetary policy and the standing to debate or even disagree with Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, over interest rates.
Mr. Bernanke, the chairman of Princeton's economics department, is among the most respected academic economists in the field of monetary policy. 
Mr. Kohn, while largely unknown outside the Fed, has exerted tremendous influence within the central bank for years by virtue of working more closely with Mr. Greenspan on interest-rate policy than anyone else. His stature within the Fed is clear from the location of his office: alone among the senior staff economists he works alongside Mr. Greenspan and the other governors on the second floor of the central bank's main building.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Kohn would be Mr. Bush's fourth and fifth appointments to the Fed. He previously renominated Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former management consultant, as vice chairman, and named two former bankers, Susan S. Bies and Mark W. Olson, to fill other vacancies. The seventh governor is Edward M. Gramlich, whose previous government and academic experience was primarily in fiscal policy.
Mr. Bernanke declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Fed referred calls about Mr. Kohn to the White House. 
In recent years, Mr. Greenspan's primary sparring partner on the Fed was Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster, whose term expired earlier this year. Mr. Meyer advocated a more formulaic inflation-fighting strategy than Mr. Greenspan, whose policy decisions tend to be driven less by economic rules and theories than by real-world data and intuition based on long experience.
Deep policy disputes within the Fed are rare. Mr. Greenspan has always sought to forge consensus on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which includes the 7 governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, 5 of whom have voting seats at any one time. Both Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Kohn seem likely to fit well within the mainstream of thinking inside the Fed about the economy and interest rates. Mr. Kohn has been a sounding board for Mr. Greenspan for 15 years and seems unlikely as a governor to deviate much from the pragmatic but inflation-wary philosophy that has defined the Greenspan Fed.
Mr. Bernanke has advocated an approach to inflation-fighting that Mr. Greenspan has always resisted: publicly setting an inflation target and raising or lowering rates to meet it. Many other central banks around the world have adopted such targets, both to provide a public measure of their success or failure and to make clear to financial markets the direction and goal of rate changes.

HEADLINE: Bush, at School, Promotes Education Bill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SOUTHFIELD, Mich., May 6 

 BODY:
President Bush visited a once-failing elementary school today in a neighborhood brimming with Arab immigrants to press educators and parents to put into effect the education bill that he signed this year and to celebrate the successes of young Arab students.
 Three months after signing the bill, which calls for annual testing of elementary school students, Mr. Bush defended the required evaluations, telling students and teachers, "If you are afraid to be held accountable, something must be going wrong." 
 But the school where Mr. Bush appeared, Arthur Vandenberg Elementary School, which holds classes year-round, had demonstrated significant improvement in the years before the bill was passed. In 1992, 29 percent of Vandenberg's students performed satisfactorily on the Michigan Achievement Test. By 2001, the principal said, that figure had risen to 93 percent, even though 30 to 50 students enter the school each year unable to speak English. 
Just shy of 60 percent of those students speak Arabic, and the educational challenge of teaching in English was evident as Mr. Bush toured the classrooms. The school employs four full-time translators. Clocks, doors and other objects around the school are labeled in English and Arabic.
Several of the students whom Mr. Bush met today had left countries that he has identified as part of the "axis of evil." Among them was Mariam Karana, identified by school officials as a fourth grader who arrived here two months ago from Iraq knowing no English beyond the letters of the alphabet.
With the president in her classroom this morning, Mariam was softly reading a short essay assigned by her teacher, "How Diversity Has Made America Great."
"She was very nervous; that's why it was so hard to hear her," said the principal, Sharlane Charns, who has overseen the large improvement in test scores.
Mr. Bush emerged beaming from the encounter.
"She was able, in front of the president of the United States, and the press corps, to read about values that matter. But it's the same values that matter to my little girls," he said, referring to his college-age twins, Barbara and Jenna.
Then, in what amounted to a quick civics lesson for the fourth and fifth graders, Mr. Bush took a few questions from reporters about his meeting with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel on Tuesday in Washington and what he thinks of Yasir Arafat.
"He must lead," the president said of Mr. Arafat as the students looked on quizzically at the scene of the president's being peppered on Mideast diplomacy in front of the chalkboard.
"You're watching democracy," Mr. Bush told the students. 
The trip here was the first of three this week in an effort to focus anew on Mr. Bush's domestic agenda, even as his time back in Washington is dominated by Mideast diplomacy.
Mr. Bush was joining a 25-city tour by Education Secretary Rod Paige to make schools and parents aware of the new education bill and its provisions for student accountability.
In many states, the increase in student performance was under way well before Mr. Bush pressed for the bill. Ms. Charns, the principal, told reporters after Mr. Bush had left that the improvements occurred in the past eight years, driven largely by her initiatives in this economically mixed suburb of Detroit.
While Mr. Bush spoke, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the bill and became Mr. Bush's unlikely ally along the way, argued that the administration was not following through with the money needed for the schools to meet the new requirements.
"President Bush proposes just a 2.8 percent increase in education (or $1.4 billion)," Mr. Kennedy said in a statement, "less than one-fourth of the 13 percent average increase over the last seven years. Just one month after signing most significant education law in 30 years, the president's budget takes a large step backward. Accountability will work only when matched with adequate resources."
The White House says the issue is not money but reforms and insists that the money is sufficient. The president's budget requests for next year include $387 million to help states develop systems to measure student performance.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
After his gloom went over like a lead balloon, Trump tries to sell happiness, in junk bonds.

BYLINE:  By Riva D. Atlas 

 BODY:
SIX months after threatening to default on junk bonds issued by his three Atlantic City casinos, Donald Trump is back, marketing a new deal to investors.
 Mr. Trump hopes to raise $470 million in new junk bonds this week, refinancing debt that will mature next year with bonds that will not come due until 2010. Mr. Trump is seeking to take advantage of some strong results at his casinos and a revival in demand for new junk bond offerings after a slump in issuance last fall. 
 Analysts and investors said that it made sense for Mr. Trump to refinance the debt but that it took some nerve. After all, in late October Mr. Trump was arguing that an ailing economy and the expectation of new competition meant gloomy prospects for his casinos. Citing hard times, Mr. Trump tried to persuade bondholders to accept lower interest rates on some of his casinos' outstanding debt. He even threatened to default on the bonds, although he ultimately paid the interest owed.
Now Mr. Trump is painting an optimistic picture for his casinos.
"Donald is a master salesman," said J. Philip Rosen, a partner at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which was retained last fall to represent holders of $1.3 billion in bonds issued by Trump Atlantic City that come due in 2006. "Back then, he was trying to sell negative news. Good news is easier to sell -- and more believable -- than bad news."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Trump said that circumstances had changed.
"After Sept. 11, I assumed there would be no bond market," he said. "What has happened is the gaming market kicked in strongly."
Ted Meyer, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, the underwriter for the offering, declined to comment.
Mr. Trump's casinos, like other gambling companies, have posted strong results over the last few months, thanks in part to unseasonably warm weather. Cash flow at Mr. Trump's Marina casino, formerly known as Trump's Castle, was reported at $14.7 million in the first quarter, a 62 percent increase over the period a year earlier. At a riverboat casino he owns in Gary, Ind., cash flow also increased, to $8 million from $6.8 million.
The new bonds, issued by an entity called Trump Casino Holdings, will be secured by the assets of these two properties, according to a prospectus distributed to institutional investors. The bonds will not be backed by Mr. Trump's other Atlantic City casinos: the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza.
Strong results at most casinos have made junk bonds as well as stock issued by these companies popular with investors this year. According to Jacques Cornet, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, casino bonds are up 7.4 percent through the end of April, twice the return of the overall junk bond market.
The biggest casino company stocks are up 39 percent, according to a recent report issued by Jason Ader, a Bear, Stearns & Company analyst, while smaller casino shares rose nearly 34 percent through the end of last month. In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7 percent in the period.
At the same time, investors are hungry for new junk bond offerings, which many had shunned after the terror attacks last September. About $30 billion in junk bonds were sold to investors in the first four months of 2002, according to Credit Suisse First Boston. That is down slightly from the corresponding period last year but an improvement over the $27.4 billion sold in the last half of 2001.
More than three-quarters of the offerings this year have been from companies, like Mr. Trump's casinos, that are looking to refinance bonds, bank loans or some other form of debt, said Jonathan Blau, a director of global leveraged finance research at Credit Suisse.
Still, Mr. Trump's recent behavior could make the bonds a tough sell, analysts and investors said.
"How do you trust a manager who withholds the interest he owes because he doesn't like the terms of his debt?" said Barbara Cappaert, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm.
Other analysts think Mr. Trump will probably be able to sell the bonds, although at a higher rate than other casino companies might pay. Some holders of the debt maturing next year will be persuaded to buy the new bonds, to guarantee that Mr. Trump pays off the old debt. Other investors will be enticed by a high yield.
Prices quoted for the bonds coming due next year indicate some traders are worried that Mr. Trump might not succeed. He plans to use the money he raises to pay bondholders par, or 100 cents on the dollar. But traders are quoting these bonds at about 95 cents, analysts said.
"The market is saying there is some level of uncertainty about whether this deal gets done," Mr. Cornet said.

HEADLINE: Behind The Terrorists 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
From President Bush to bleeding hearts on the left, there's agreement that to combat terrorism, we must attack root causes like third-world poverty and illiteracy.
 But as often happens when wisdom becomes conventional, it's wrong. In fact, it would be easier to make the case that to fight terrorism, we should promote destitution and bomb universities around the world. 
 I'm not urging that, of course. It's just that while there are many good reasons to favor foreign aid and better schools abroad, fighting terrorism probably isn't one. 
At a conference on terrorism here at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, experts chipped away at the international consensus about roots of terrorism (that poverty and hate-filled education, or no education at all, breed terrorists). "The most commonly cited 'root causes' seem to me not to be important factors," noted Graham Allison, director of the school's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Poverty is frequently mentioned as a root cause. "We fight against poverty because hope is an answer to terror," President Bush said in March in announcing an increase in foreign aid. And liberals fall all over themselves to agree.
But Osama bin Laden's tricycle was probably gold-plated, and we all know that the 9/11 hijackers came from privileged backgrounds. Look at ETA in Spain, Red Brigades in Italy, Aum Shinrikyo in Japan, the I.R.A. in Ireland or Timothy McVeigh: they suggest middle-class alienation rather than third-world deprivation.
Still, international poverty does promote terrorism in at least one indirect way: poor nations periodically collapse and end up providing sanctuary to terrorists.
"Terrorists need headquarters, and if you need a headquarters, the best place is a failed or even collapsed state," noted Michael Ignatieff, a professor at the Kennedy School. Thus foreign aid may be a good investment to fight terrorism if it props up countries like Pakistan or Indonesia and prevents them from becoming chaotic Afghan-style bases for terrorism.
Education might seem likely to soothe a disposition for violence, but it doesn't. The most rigorous analysis is in a new paper by Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Jitka Maleckova of Charles University, and they find no correlation between involvement in terrorism and either poverty or illiteracy.
For example, they looked at the backgrounds of Lebanese Hezbollah militants killed in action, and they found that they were better off and better educated than the general population. Likewise, they examined public opinion polls in the West Bank and Gaza and found that better-educated Palestinians were more likely than others to approve of violence.
So if poverty and illiteracy aren't direct causes of terrorism, what are? Three other factors seem important:
First, humiliation. "This word is extremely important in explaining why terrorists are so successful in recruiting large numbers of young men," said Jessica Stern, a Harvard scholar who has interviewed terrorists around the world. Indeed, if we are to reduce terrorism in, say, the Middle East, then (as President Bush has suggested) it would help to reduce security arrangements that needlessly humiliate Palestinians.
Second, economic isolation. Robert Lawrence, an economics professor, noted that the great majority of nations are members of the World Trade Organization, but that the few that are not include North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia. So trade promotion may help. 
Third, foreign policy. Anybody who has met Al Qaeda supporters knows that the terrorists are motivated in part by American foreign policy, principally the American military bases in Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, Palestinian rights. But it's hard to make too much of the Israel angle because Al Qaeda was planning the 9/11 attacks just as peace talks were proceeding unusually hopefully in 2000.
"Does anybody here think that the attack would not have been carried out if we had succeeded at Camp David or afterward?" asked Dennis Ross, the former Middle East envoy. 
So where does this leave us? With a puzzle. And in trying to uproot terrorism, perhaps we should think in new directions, like extending trade or, especially, trying to confront feelings of humiliation that may well be more explosive than poverty or illiteracy.

HEADLINE: Freed Burmese Democracy Leader Proclaims 'New Dawn' 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, May 6 

 BODY:
Radiating joy and confidence, the woman known throughout Myanmar as the Lady stood before a cheering crowd today for the first time in years and proclaimed, "It's a new dawn for the country."
 Freed this morning after 19 months of house arrest in the capital, Yangon, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, 56, the leader of the pro-democracy movement, said it was time to move forward from a period of fence-mending to the beginnings of substantive change in the country, the former Burma. 
 After a year and a half of what were called confidence-building talks with the military leadership, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said, "The next step is discussions about policy." In remarks televised throughout much of Asia, she offered no specifics but said her task now was to do "everything I can to make sure that democracy comes to Burma." 
Clearly that will mean slow and careful moves rather than the confrontations that have marked her relations with the country's junta since it nullified a parliamentary election in 1990 in which her party, the National League for Democracy, won 82 percent of the seats.
In a signal of an emerging new relationship, the government spokesman, Col. Hla Min, said there would be no restrictions on her movements and activities, "because we are confident that we can trust each other."
It appeared from the events reported and statements made today that Myanmar was moving into a tentative new phase of its history after the more than a decade of political and economic paralysis that followed the 1990 election.
"Basically, that's history," said David I. Steinberg, a professor at Georgetown University who is a leading expert on Myanmar. "It was unfortunate, but in the 12 years since that time they've had a political stalemate. And that stalemate seems now to be in the process of breaking, and that's progress."
That also seemed to be the assessment of the events in Myanmar by the United States, which tends to be sensitive to the views of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. The latest State Department report, issued in February, dropped the customary reference to the nullified election and spoke instead of a process of democratization and improvement of human rights.
In her remarks today, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said, "We look forward to moving on." Diplomats and other analysts said by telephone they did not expect any high-profile moves in the near future. Both sides are expected to tread carefully as they feel their way to a new accommodation.
An early gauge of the new climate will be whether the government keeps its promise to free large numbers of political prisoners, which human rights groups estimate at up to 1,500. In particular, dozens of members of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party who were elected to Parliament remain in prison.
"I and my party have been disappointed by the slow rate of the release of political prisoners," she said at a news conference in Yangon. "Their release is not only important in humanitarian terms but also political terms."
Other major steps still remain to be taken. One of the most difficult, perhaps, would be opening the government-controlled press to opposing viewpoints. Another task on the agenda would be to hold a national convention to draw up a new constitution. The convention, the next formal step in creating a new government, has been stalled for a decade, since Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters withdrew in protest against its control by the military.
The changes now under way appear to have been forced on the junta by a combination of factors. They include tough economic sanctions, international isolation, pressure by Malaysia and other fellow members of the Southeast Asian regional grouping and the unflagging popularity of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi despite the government's efforts to marginalize and defame her.
In the long term, if the process of compromise does move forward, analysts said, it is difficult to guess at the future political shape of the country. A central tenet of nationhood for the military, since independence from Britain in 1948, has been the unity of the state. It is unlikely to yield to the demands of Myanmar's many ethnic minority groups for independence or autonomy, Mr. Steinberg said.
Nevertheless, any new government will need to address issues of minority rights; both the military junta and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party are dominated by ethnic Burmans. The military is likely to insist on its autonomy within the state, Mr. Steinberg said, along with veto power over a variety of policies, particularly those that affect its huge economic holdings.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi made clear today that her release was only a step in a slowly emerging process of dialogue and potential cooperation.
"The contacts between us will carry on, but we have made no specific arrangements," she said.
Within her own National League for Democracy, no new policy decisions have been made for the moment, she said, adding, "The N.L.D. has always said it wants to be flexible to get an outcome that's most favorable to the people of Burma."
It may be, as she said, a new dawn for the country, but dawn is only the start of the day. "We only hope the dawn will move forward very quickly into full morning," Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said.

HEADLINE: Ending Repression in Myanmar 

 BODY:
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has waged a long Gandhian struggle against the dictatorship in Myanmar, the last 19 months under house arrest. Now the world's most prominent political prisoner is free. How free is an open question, however. No one should confuse her liberty with real democratization until she and the rest of Myanmar's political opponents can carry out a full range of political activities. 
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's release illustrates the persuasive power that diplomatic and financial isolation have had on the government of Myanmar, which is hoping the outside world will now resume aid and trade. Europe has maintained sanctions on Myanmar, which used to be known as Burma, for the last several years, and in 1997 President Clinton banned new American investment there. Since 1995, at least 50 foreign companies have pulled out of the country. Myanmar's financial desperation led it to begin secret talks with the opposition in October, facilitated by a United Nations special envoy, Razali Ismail. 
 The State Department was right to say yesterday that Myanmar must democratize further for sanctions to be lifted. Myanmar has claimed that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's liberty will be unconditional, but the government must prove that it is granting her and her political party full freedoms. She has been released from house arrest before, in 1995, but her activities were severely limited and she was re-arrested right after she tried to leave the capital.
Myanmar must also speed up the release of political prisoners. Some 250 have been freed, but more than 1,000, some old and frail, remain imprisoned for nonviolent opposition.
If aid to Myanmar resumes, it should not flow without restrictions. The government has squandered its few resources on the military while spending just 28 cents a year to educate each child. It ranks second to last globally in the quality of health care. A third of children under 5 are malnourished, and AIDS is rampant and virtually ignored. Humanitarian aid is urgent, but should be administered by nongovernmental groups or by a committee that includes opposition leaders and government officials.

HEADLINE: ENRON FORCED UP CALIFORNIA PRICES, DOCUMENTS SHOW 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
Electricity traders at Enron drove up prices during the California power crisis through questionable techniques that company lawyers said "may have contributed" to severe power shortages, according to internal Enron documents released today by federal regulators.
 Within Enron, the documents show, traders used strategies code-named Fat Boy, Ricochet, Get Shorty, Load Shift and Death Star to increase Enron's profits from trading power in the state -- techniques that added to electricity costs and congestion on transmission lines. 
 The documents -- memorandums written in December 2000 by lawyers at Enron to another lawyer at the company -- also describe "dummied-up" power-delivery schedules, the submission of "false information" to the state, and the effective increasing of costs to all market participants by "knowingly increasing the congestion costs."
The memos, which provide the first inside look at the complex trading strategies Enron used in California, give strong ammunition to state officials who have long argued that Enron and other power marketers manipulated the state's market and played a crucial role in the crisis that cost California consumers and utilities tens of billions of dollars in 2000 and 2001. The documents state that other power companies used similar techniques. 
Tonight, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she would ask Attorney General John Ashcroft "to pursue a criminal investigation to determine whether in fact federal fraud statutes or any other laws were violated" by Enron's energy-trading activities. Federal prosecutors are already conducting an inquiry into Enron's accounting, which falsely increased reported profits but ultimately led to the company's filing for bankruptcy protection in December.
Enron agreed to sell its energy-trading unit earlier this year to UBS Warburg, a division of UBS, Switzerland's largest bank. Nearly all of Enron's senior executives, and most of its board members, have departed in the last nine months. 
Enron's senior management learned of the documents in late April, and the company's board decided during a meeting on Sunday to waive attorney-client privilege and turn the memos over to investigators at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a person close to the company said. The company has also informed the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the attorney general of California about the documents.
At a noon meeting today, lawyers for Enron gave the memos to investigators from the regulatory commission, which is examining whether Enron manipulated energy markets in the West. The agency released the documents a few hours later. Officials at the commission declined to comment, but they are continuing their investigation into Enron's effect on power prices and asked the company today to provide additional documents on its electricity and natural-gas trading activities.
In a letter sent by officials at the commission today to Enron, investigators at the agency said the documents described how Enron traders were "creating, and then 'relieving,' phantom congestion" on California's electricity grid. The documents also detail what investigators described as "megawatt laundering," in which Enron bought power in California, resold the power out of the state and then bought the power back and resold it back into California -- allowing Enron to circumvent price caps meant to clamp down on costs.
"These documents prove that these companies can manipulate the market," said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission. "Enron prevented California from seeing these documents for years, and now we know why."
Ms. Lynch said the documents supported her argument that FERC should leave in place temporary electricity price restraints, introduced last June, which state officials say have played a large role in reining in prices. "I don't see how FERC can remove the boundaries they put in place on our market last June."
An outside lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, said he could not comment on the trading strategies described in the documents. "Because we have sold the trading unit and the people with the knowledge of trading practices are no longer with the company, we do not know what the true facts are, and we do not know which parts of the memoranda are correct and which parts are incorrect," Mr. Bennett said tonight.
But he emphasized that the company had agreed to waive that attorney-client privilege because it was trying to cooperate with the various investigations into Enron's business practices. "These memoranda came to the attention of the board and current management in late April, and the board instructed its counsel to not assert the attorney-client privilege and produce these documents to the appropriate government entities," Mr. Bennett said.
Another memo written by a separate group of lawyers for Enron in 2001 -- apparently in January or February, after soaring wholesale power prices in California pushed the state's largest utilities to the brink of insolvency -- tried to play down the strategies described in the December 2000 memos.
In this later memo, which was written to prepare Enron for the "various investigations and litigation" it faced because of the California power crisis, the lawyers repeatedly tried to play down or cast doubt on the conclusions drawn by Enron's own lawyers in the earlier memos. 
"Some of the information" in the earlier memos "which resulted in some erroneous assumptions and conclusions, cannot be supported by the facts and evidence which are now known," the later memo stated.
In one strategy described in the December 2000 memos, Enron would buy power from a state-run exchange for $250 a megawatt-hour -- the maximum under the price caps -- and resell it outside California for almost five times as much. 
"Thus, traders could buy power at $250 and sell it for $1,200," according to one memo. In that document, the Enron lawyers acknowledged that such activity could be playing a big role in causing electricity shortages in the state, but they suggested that was not a significant concern.
"This strategy appears not to present any problems," the memo stated, "other than a public relations risk arising from the fact that such exports may have contributed to California's declaration of a Stage 2 Emergency yesterday."
The Death Star strategy, as described in the memos, allowed Enron to be paid "for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion."
And the Load Shift strategy allowed Enron to generate about $30 million in profits in 2000 using techniques that, according to the documents, included creating "the appearance of congestion through the deliberate overstatement" of power to be delivered.
In the past, Enron officials said the California power crisis was caused by the state's deeply flawed electricity deregulation plan, the lack of new power-generation capacity and by temporary factors, like a drought that drastically reduced available hydropower. Even some economists who think price manipulation was widespread say these other factors contributed to soaring prices.
But Enron executives always insisted that absolutely nothing their traders had done contributed to the crisis. In an interview last year, Enron's former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, dismissed accusations that manipulation was even partly to blame for California's troubles. 
"Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it's always collusion or conspiracy or something," Mr. Lay said in the interview, which was also taped for "Frontline" on PBS. "I mean, it always makes people feel better that way."

HEADLINE: Where Schnitzel Meets Ahi Tuna for a Beer 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
A CENTURY ago, almost every American city had one German restaurant, where men with handlebar mustaches drank beer from large steins at a long bar and families gathered for schnitzel, sausages with sauerkraut and apple strudel drenched in whipped cream. Sawdust on the floor was a trademark.
 Most German immigrants shed their ethnic identity after a generation or two, and as they climbed the economic ladder many German restaurants closed. A few around the country still thrive, and of these one of the most venerable is Berghoff, on the same block in downtown Chicago since 1898. 
 Berghoff lives in two ages: one in which the food was hearty, portions were large and patrons did not worry about waistlines, and the modern one, in which diners crave culinary ingenuity, the spiciness of Thai or Mexican cuisine and foods less apt to stick to the ribs. The owners, descendants of the founder, Herman Berghoff, strive to balance the two. 
The Berghoff facade, while not noticeably German in style, marks it as one of the dwindling number of old buildings that survive in Chicago's Loop. It faces the future, quite literally: across the street, a skyscraper is going up. Inside, the restaurant retains much of its turn-of-the-last-century character, with original brass lighting fixtures and idealized images of old Germany painted on wall panels. Patrons stand at the bar to eat sandwiches and drink Berghoff's own beer and root beer. Sawdust is no more, a casualty of health regulations.
The restaurant is managed by Peter Berghoff, 38, great-grandson of the founder. His brother, Tim, is the bartender. Their father, Herman, 66, worked in the restaurant for nearly half a century. He has graduated to the title of chairman.
"We've lasted this long because we always reinvested our profits in the restaurant and because the family always wanted to stay involved," Herman Berghoff said. "Every generation has wanted to keep this up, and nobody has come along to offer us a zillion dollars for the real estate. I think the place can survive for a lot longer, but that's up to the generations to come."
Whether those generations will want the kind of food German grandmothers traditionally cooked for Sunday dinner remains to be seen -- dishes like the schlachtplatte, which features a pork chop, a knockwurst and a Thuringer wurst (a light-color sausage native to the German province of Thuringia), together with a heap of sauerkraut. There are also sauerbraten and pot roast, of course, and thick chicken noodle soup is the appetizer of choice. Creamed spinach and potato pancakes are favorites.
But to keep up with changing tastes, there are daily specials with no German pedigree, like sesame-crusted ahi tuna, a bistro-style lamb shank or a salad of spinach and smoked duck. These tastes are slowly taking over: less than a third of the meals served are traditional German dishes.
It is quite a change in a city that had nine German breweries when the Civil War broke out. Among the thousands of Germans who streamed into the Middle West during the late 19th century was Herman Joseph Berghoff, who left Dortmund in 1870 and established a brewery in Fort Wayne, Ind., with his three brothers. He came to Chicago to sell his beer at the 1893 World's Fair and returned a few years later to open a bar next door to the current location on West Adams Street. Beer sold for 5 cents. Sandwiches were free.
A dining room was added in 1918, when Prohibition began. The day after it ended in 1933, Berghoff received the first liquor license issued in Chicago.
Though there is no real German neighborhood left in Chicago, German is spoken in shops and restaurants along Lincoln Avenue, about three miles north of the Loop, where German products are sold. Perhaps the most famous establishment is Delicatessen Meyer, where sausages are made on the premises. 
Meanwhile, Berghoff thrives on business lunches, with patrons jamming the long bar. Others come in for beer after work, and families predominate in the evening. Being one of the closest restaurants to the Art Institute and Symphony Center is good for business. So are the prices. Dinner entrees run from $9.95 to $17.95. A dinner for five, including several steins of beer, cost $140, tip included.
Reflecting the family's desire to change with the times, it recently opened a Berghoff Cafe at O'Hare Airport. Though the menu consists mostly of easy, fast food like pizza and salads, one thing's the same: Berghoff beer is served, and even busy travelers stand up at a bar to drink it.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Day in Town Takes an Unexpected Tryst

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Sex is such a profoundly disruptive force in Adrian Lyne's film "Unfaithful" that as you watch it with your heart in your throat, you realize the degree to which Hollywood has succeeded in reducing screen sex to a fashion accessory. Its purpose in most movies nowadays is to embellish a story with enough (but not too many) discrete fillips of titillation and soft-core fantasy to quicken the pulse without causing palpitations.
 "Unfaithful" crashes through that mold by acknowledging that sex, especially reckless adulterous sex, can rock people's lives and have catastrophic consequences. The lovemaking in "Unfaithful" leaves deep emotional imprints. In the most extraordinary scene, Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), a beautiful, happily married suburban housewife and mother of a young son, mentally relives the details of her first extramarital tryst while taking a commuter train from Grand Central Terminal home to Westchester County. 
 Connie is so absorbed in the memory of an encounter that has left her dazed and exhilarated that her features subtly re-enact the contortions of ecstasy, joy and trepidation she experienced during sex. It's only at this point that the film shows us the tryst, flashing back and forth between Connie's afternoon of passion and her delirious recollection. The portrait of someone unstrung by a single sexual encounter is disturbing for being so entirely convincing.
Ms. Lane has the role of her career in Connie, and her indelible (and ultimately sympathetic) performance is both archetypal and minutely detailed. Connie is the embodiment of a confident supermom who seems to be in supreme control of her complicated upscale suburban life. It is precisely because she believes she can handle any situation that she foolishly surrenders to an erotic whim. But as her affair intensifies, she becomes increasingly careless and distracted and finally jealous. You sense that were she to end the affair without being caught, putting the pieces of herself back together would still be extremely difficult.
In many ways "Unfaithful," adapted from Claude Chabrol's film "La Femme Infidele," could be described as "Fatal Attraction 2." Once again a tranquil suburban marriage is endangered by a reckless indiscretion (in big, bad New York City) that spins wildly out of control. And once again the sex is explosive and edged with violence. As in "Fatal Attraction," the lovers are so besotted that when the urge overtakes them, they have sex standing up, and their frantic rutting, instead of satiety, leaves them raw and aching for more.
"Unfaithful" doesn't repeat the "Fatal Attraction" mistake of turning into a horror film with a pat, reassuring ending. Although this movie pays a witty, deadpan homage to the notorious bunny rabbit scene in that 1987 movie, it steers a much more ambiguous path toward a sad, surreal twilight zone of guilt and hopelessness.
When Connie and her lover, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), first meet, they literally collide on the street outside his SoHo apartment on a windy day. When she trips and falls, he coaxes her upstairs to bandage her skinned knees. Connie's rescuer turns out to be a charmingly insolent French dreamboat who is staying in a borrowed apartment where he deals in rare books. 
Paul preaches a tantalizing live-in-the-moment philosophy that appeals to Connie because it runs so counter to her life of family responsibilities and school and charity events. Not long after their first meeting, she returns to New York to thank Paul. He puts the moves on her, and after a halfhearted struggle she succumbs. 
Compared with Paul, Edward (Richard Gere), Connie's devoted husband of 11 years, who runs a successful but unspecified business that involves shipping products by truck, is not especially glamorous. He is reasonably handsome and still in love with his wife, but under his apparent calm you sense a fierce watchfulness and grinding tension. When a longtime colleague announces he's leaving the company, Edward, who values loyalty above everything, takes the departure as a personal betrayal and turns on him furiously. 
In portraying Edward, Mr. Gere, who is now 52, has shucked off the preening narcissism of his younger days to give a performance that is remarkably devoid of vanity. In what may be the most emotionally affecting scene of Mr. Gere's screen career, Edward, having amassed damning photographic evidence of his wife's affair, visits her lover's loft and inexorably loses control. At this point the story turns into a melodrama with resemblances to "In the Bedroom," although the earlier movie's investigation of violence and its impact on a white upper-middle-class couple who have considered themselves above crimes of passion cut much deeper.
"Unfaithful" has a taut, economical screenplay by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. that digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism. 
Mr. Lyne's fondness for high-gloss, television-commercial-ready imagery was the most glaring flaw in his otherwise moving screen adaptation of "Lolita." Here, the cinematography shamelessly fetishizes the Sumners' model-perfect home and the objects inside it. And the exaggerated windstorm that blows Connie and Paul into each other's arms is almost as pushy (and phony) a symbol as the white tornado in a cleanser commercial. 
As scrupulously as Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere delineate their characters, Connie and Edward emerge as an American Everycouple of a certain class and background, while Paul becomes a generic Continental rake. But as the movie darkens and becomes a desperate and not always convincing tale of crime and cover-up, "Unfaithful" takes Mr. Lyne into areas where he has never gone.
The saddest and most unsettling element of "Unfaithful" is its portrayal of an affluent, articulate couple who for all their individual sensitivity can barely bring themselves to communicate on a less than superficial level. Does a successful middle-class marriage really require this amount of emotional suppression? If so, God help the institution. Even after Connie's affair is long over, and the Sumners are clinging to each other in fear and uncertainty, they cannot bring themselves to address the past. The best that Connie can manage is two words: "I'm scared." She has every reason to be.
"Unfaithful" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has intense sexual situations and scenes of violence.

HEADLINE: Steak Endures in Lean Times 

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
SURELY this is the moment to cry for Argentina. Or is it?
 After years of economic contraction and months of political turmoil, money is short and times are hard. Vacations have been canceled and housing purchases deferred. Food-loving Argentines have been forced to forgo many of the pleasures of the table -- even curtailing their compulsive consumption of beef, this country's longstanding agricultural and gastronomic pride and joy. 
 No longer can most people eat beef five or six times a week. No longer can they afford to consume something like 130 pounds of beef a year per person, more than twice as much as Americans. No longer do construction workers set up makeshift grills at curbside to cook steaks for lunch or dinner, perfuming much of downtown Buenos Aires with the sweet, smoky smell of sirloin. 
Many working people have given up beef altogether; a few have even given up their habitual Friday night pizza. When President Eduardo Duhalde said recently that Argentina should "be more like Chile," which is a little like a British prime minister saying that his country should be more like Italy, it was widely suggested that he had given up steaks for humble pie.
Yet with the help of an influx of tourists, parts of Buenos Aires, which used to style itself "the Paris of Latin America," still twinkle like the City of Light. There may be a few empty places at Cabana Las Lilas, the town's top steakhouse, but the toothsome cuadriles (rump steaks) and sturdy malbec reds from Mendoza still draw the movers and shakers. The young, hip and beautiful pour into the Gran Bar Danzon to devour delectable sushi and ceviche and sample flights of chardonnay. They also frequent its smart new sibling, Sucre, where the chef is Fernando Trocca, who used to cook at Vandam in SoHo.
Families still go for Sunday lunch, often with babes in arms, to Il Matterello, a homely Italian spot in La Boca, the working-class quarter of brightly painted houses founded by immigrants from Genoa. There everyone laughs, talks, drinks and feasts on superb homemade pastas, which Buenos Aires gourmands fancy almost as much as their beloved bife.
Accomplished French food remains on offer (at La Bourgogne, among other places), as does skillfully prepared fish (like the elvers, or tiny eels, at Dora). Also available, inevitably, is some decidedly iffy international fare, such as that at Katrine, a French-Italian-Argentine establishment run by a Norwegian, which was skewered by Jonathan Meades of The Times of London as "all ambition and no achievement."
A FEW restaurants have been forced to close by 15 to 25 percent declines in business, including Harry Cipriani, once the hangout of many of the politicians now reluctant to show their faces in public. Francis Mallmann, a charismatic 46-year-old chef who shot to prominence through his television programs, is hoping to offset slumping receipts at his restaurants in Argentina and across the River Plate in Uruguay by opening a place this month in Westhampton on Long Island, called Patagonia.
But Argentines are Latins, after all, and most are reluctant to give up their evenings on the town. In addition, the devaluation of the peso, which has fallen from parity with the dollar to a current rate of three to the dollar, has helped the local restaurant trade in two ways: relatively prosperous Argentines get a lot more for their newly weak pesos in a Buenos Aires restaurant than in one in Miami, and foreign visitors find that Buenos Aires, once an expensive city, has turned into a cheaper one.
So Chileans, Brazilians and Europeans are traveling to Argentina, along with a rapidly increasing number of North Americans.
For them, everything is half price, or less. Dinner with wine at Las Lilas that used to cost $40 now goes for only $20. Lunch at Munich Recoleta, a Germanic brasserie, costs $12. Hoping to lure more Americans to his country, the new Argentine ambassador to Washington, Diego Guelar, touts food bargains in his capital.
"The best steak in the world, in a deluxe restaurant, for $15 tops," he enthused recently. "In a simpler place, a neighborhood parrilla or grill, it's only $5 or so. Unbeatable."
For most of the last century, the melancholy strains of the tango, so universally beloved here, have provided the perfect background music for bewildering failure. Early in the 1900's, Argentina was richer than France and had more cars than Japan. Uniquely in Latin America, it boasted a large middle class. Now it is a land of punctured hopes.
"It's our own fault," Mr. Mallmann said. "We've failed as a people because we haven't faced up to reality. We have to learn you can't buy everything with a credit card."
The portenos, as the locals call themselves, make do and pray that better days lie ahead. One of them explained the formula: "A good meal, a glass or two of good red wine and a good, healthy denunciation of the politicians and all their works makes our lives more tolerable."
BEFORE rioting broke out late last year in the streets of major cities, leading to five changes of presidents in two weeks, before impoverished government treasuries began printing scriplike "bonds" called patacones and lecops and lecors, my wife, Betsey, and I flew west to the Pampas, the infinitely rich inland seas of grass where the big steers graze.
We were the guests of Octavio Caraballo, a leading Argentine beef baron who owns Cabana Las Lilas -- a burly, gravel-voiced, larger-than-life figure who had already fired up a stogie when we met him at 10:30 in the morning. It took his Cessna only an hour and a quarter to leave the sprawl of Buenos Aires behind and deliver us to his 17,846-acre estancia, or ranch, also called Las Lilas, about 270 miles due west of the capital.
It is hard to imagine a better place for cattle than these immense grasslands, stretching table-flat to the horizon. Their potential was evident to early Spanish settlers. Juan Ortiz de Zarate, a forward-looking conquistador, took seven cows and a bull to the River Plate region in 1554, and they and their successors have thrived on an all-grass diet. Argentine steers are fed no grain and given no hormones, which produces meat with much lower fat content and cholesterol than American beef.
Munching away for centuries, generation after generation, on alfalfa, gray grass and clover, the herds have provided meat for markets both at home and abroad. Beef from the Pampas built the carnivore culture of Argentina, a country where discussions of steak cause grown men and women of all social classes to roll their eyes, smack their lips and pat their bellies. Beef from the Pampas also helped make the nation rich; at one time Argentina accounted for half the world's beef exports.
But no longer. Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease here have several times led countries abroad to close their markets to Argentine beef. Europe recently reopened its markets after all 52 million head of cattle in this country were vaccinated.
The big American market remains shut tight. United States authorities reopened it in 1997, and Argentine beef began to build a following among restaurateurs and supermarkets, but in 2000 a fresh outbreak of the disease brought a new closure. In 1999, sales of beef from Argentina reached about $52 million.
When Ambassador Guelar presented his credentials to President Bush several months ago, he also handed Mr. Bush a toy stuffed cow named Valentina as a reminder that Argentina was eager to resume the beef trade. More recently, Mr. Guelar said he expected that the American market would reopen next February, a year after the last appearance of foot-and-mouth disease in Argentine herds on Jan. 23.
Las Lilas and other estancias will have to augment their stocks, and slaughterhouses increase capacity, if exports are to resume. But the potential is certainly there. In good times, Mr. Caraballo told us, Las Lilas has fattened 4,500 to 5,000 steers a year -- brooding Angus, fuzzy-faced Herefords and crosses of the two. Calves weighing 400 pounds grow after 18 months on its pastures to about 1,000.
"The goal, of course, is to produce the most meat with the best flavor in the shortest time," he said as we rattled across the range in a truck, surrounded by swarms of butterflies. "If you're good to the land, I find, the land will be good to you."
From a distance the gigantic beasts look like a fleet of cruisers and destroyers silhouetted against the horizon. Up close, they look even more formidable, until you notice the jaunty little yellow birds perched like lookouts on their broad backs.
In his breeding operation, one of the largest in the world, Mr. Caraballo uses the latest technology. Each bull's bloodline is recorded in a computer, and studies are carried out to evaluate fertility and other aspects of bovine reproduction. Ultrasound devices are used to calculate yield and quality, such as percentage of fat marbling.
But Las Lilas is also a stronghold of custom. It is manned by lean, laconic, self-sufficient gauchos in traditional dress -- broad-brimmed straw or green felt hats; ponchos whose design identifies the gaucho's home territory; the pleated trousers known as bombachas; and flat-heel boots. They ride tough quarter horses with white diamonds on their foreheads, much as their forebears did in the days of Mr. Caraballo's grandfather Alfredo Hirsch, who founded Las Lilas in 1912.
A wealthy man, Mr. Caraballo could collect Italian paintings or English furniture. But he surrounds himself instead with the artifacts of life on the estancia -- old ponchos, carriages, silver harness ornaments, caricatures of gauchos, photos of grand-champion steers. An inveterate traveler thoroughly at home in New York and Europe, he remains a man of the Pampas.
He gave us a proper Pampas lunch, packed with protein, daunting in quantity, on the veranda behind his peach-colored stucco ranch house. An asador (pit master) had started a fire of hardwood logs at 10 in the morning in a nearby grove, and had begun cooking ribs of beef a half-hour later. These were spread-eagled on an iron frame off to one side of the fire. Sausages, steaks and fillets of beef went onto a standard grill, known here as a parrilla.
The asador let both of the fires fade to gray coals before starting, so the meat would cook slowly.
We started with ham and cheese empanadas, and then tasty but pretty skimpy salads of cabbage and tomatoes; most Argentine grown-ups like vegetables about as much as most American kids do. The meat came to the table very well done, to put it mildly. A picky eater might have described it as burned.
But my first bite of rib-eye -- ojo de bife -- made me an ardent advocate of Argentine beef. It was a bit chewier than our grain-fed meat, but dripping with juice despite its long sojourn on the fire, vibrant, smoky and slightly gamy in flavor, with a salty caramelized crust. I thought the simple chimichurri sauce of garlic, parsley and red pepper flakes in olive oil a perfect condiment, but Mr. Caraballo turned up his nose.
"I don't think it's good for the blood," he said earnestly.
Health wasn't much on our minds, especially at the end of the meal. Already full to bursting with rib-eye, chorizo sausage and a succulent Argentine cut of ribs called tira de asado, we succumbed to a dessert of vanilla ice cream topped with gooey dulce de leche, or caramelized milk.
BACK in Buenos Aires, I joined Mr. Caraballo for dinner at Cabana Las Lilas; by then, Betsey had had enough beef for a lifetime or two. Housed in a converted warehouse in the dock area, the restaurant is paneled in dark "masculine" wood, with a series of huge parrillas at the entrance. These are of special design. The grill bars are in fact triangular steel channels, which conduct fats and juices away from the fire, where they might cause flare-ups.
Among the treats that evening were spicy chorizo sausages, crisp-skinned morcillas (blood sausages studded with raisins), crusty sweetbreads and amazingly tender kidneys, to say nothing of steak, steak and more steak. Tomato-and-onion salad. Souffle potatoes. The best red wine in the land. And a puckery lemon sorbet at the end.
This feast was as much fun to watch in preparation as to eat. The grill men deftly shuffled the cuts of meat from the hottest parts of the coals to cooler areas, turning them and methodically inspecting them every few minutes, in a bravura performance that is repeated night after night as the restaurant works its way through 90 tons of beef a year, which is roughly 4,600 steers!
The city is stuffed with steakhouses, not only grand ones like Las Lilas and El Mirasol, near the Four Seasons Hotel, and the much-loved Raya, in the Palermo district, but also thousands of simpler places. La Estancia, downtown, features beef cooked barbecue style over a campfire. Los Anos Locos, a big, loud barn of a place out along the river, is amazingly inexpensive.
Sadly, the very best beef I ate is out of reach for the moment. That was at Francis Mallman's house, in which he formerly operated a low-key, reservations-only semi-restaurant. I must confess that even his subtle touch could not convince me of the virtues of matambre -- flank steak poached and wrapped around hard-cooked eggs, carrots, parsley and bell peppers.
But a huge roasted sirloin bought from an Italian butcher in the neighborhood, not some elite provisioner of restaurants, came dangerously close to perfection. Mr. Mallmann called it a "corta de pistola" because the end of the sirloin drooped a bit, giving it the shape of a gun. He served it with crisp disks of pommes Anna and a concentrated, jammy merlot-malbec blend from the Salta region that stood up very well to the steak's richness.
Picking and choosing among the many other highlights in my notebooks, I must mention the knowledgeable, multilingual young sommelier at La Bourgogne, a Cuban named Orlando Vazquez, who taught me a lot about Latin American wines in a single evening. And the austere old Munich Recoleta, with its white-aproned waiters and stuffed kudu head on the wall, where I ate a classic milanesa or sauteed veal cutlet, accompanied by a properly drawn chopp, or draft beer. Jorge Luis Borges, the great novelist, was a regular there.
If I lived in Buenos Aires, I would hang out at Filo, a jazzy, modern, authentic pizzeria, as well as Il Matterello, whose homemade pastas made me sing. Green tagliatelle with parmesan, cream and pancetta was terrific; ravioli with tomatoes of exquisite concentration and sweetness was better; and fettuccine showered with chopped arugula was magnificent, with the heat of the noodles releasing a wonderfully springlike aroma from the arugula.
It was enough to make a person forget beef. Well, almost.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Wednesday about the endurance of steak as Argentina's national dish even in difficult economic times misstated the term for a cut of sirloin with a shape reminiscent of a gun. It is cuarto pistola, not corta de pistola.

A consultant issues a report that looks at how public service ads could be greatly improved.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
MAYBE it was more than a coincidence that public service advertising was the one category in which the American Association of Advertising Agencies did not present an O'Toole Award for creativity at its annual conference last month.
 Public service advertising, at least in print form, is not connecting effectively with consumers, and there are ways it could be better, according to a new report by Andy Goodman, an independent communications consultant who focuses on public-interest groups and foundations. 
 The report, "Why Bad Ads Happen to Good Causes and How to Ensure They Won't Happen to Yours," begins with a study of 195 public-interest print ads and is followed by seven guidelines for creating more effective ones. The Starch division of RoperASW, part of the NOP World Company, conducted the study and provided data for the guidelines. 
"Those of us who feel deeply about causes recognize that there's a huge opportunity for them to do better advertising," said Philip Sawyer, senior vice president and director at Starch in New York, "and also recognize that they had missed an opportunity by not creating more powerful advertising."
The report, for nonprofit organizations as well as executives or agencies that serve them, looks at ads published from 1990 to 2000 in magazines like Business Week, Glamour, Rolling Stone and Vogue. It studied ads for several organizations, including the American Heart Association, the National Mental Health Association, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and the Sierra Club.
The ads were judged according to three criteria: the percentages of readers who remembered having seen an ad in the selected issue, who recalled the name of the advertiser or campaign, and who read at least half the written material. The results were compared with those of other ads in the same publication as well as to just the public service ads.
"Relatively rare is the ad for a nonprofit organization that earns high readership scores," Mr. Sawyer said in the report, "and quite common are those that rank among the lowest ads in a given issue of a publication we have studied."
About two dozen ads are reproduced in the report, along with written explanations of what is good and what is bad about each ad. For example, an ad for Save the Children in Westport, Conn., with a photo of a baby's feet, received below-average scores.
"Among subjects for a photograph in an advertisement, babies are one of the most powerful 'eye magnets' available," reads the report. "Starch data confirms this, but the company's research also shows that the way the baby is depicted is critically important."
Because the ad included a direct response order form, Save the Children calculated that the ad reached 8 percent of its goal. Amanda Akel, advertising manager at Save the Children, who was not involved in the creation of the ad, responded in the report: "Showing the baby's feet is not telling much of a story, so I'm not surprised."
The ad showed that problems with public service advertising may not lie solely with advertising.
"If you're pushing something like Coke, McDonald's or Nike, those are products people are familiar with and may already have good feelings about," said Mr. Goodman, who is based in Los Angeles. "But if you want to talk about hunger, worldwide reproductive rights, gun control, global warming, those are things people may find confusing, upsetting, maybe they don't really want to think about them."
The first three guidelines for more effective advertising are: "Capture the reader's attention like a stop sign and direct it like a road map," "Make an emotional connection before attempting to convey information" and "Write headlines that offer a reason to read more."
The project, including the 5,000 copies that have been printed, was financed with $154,500 from five organizations: the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation in New York; the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J.; the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in Los Altos, Calif.; the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia; and the Surdna Foundation in New York.
A booklet and an insert intended for use on the job by employees of nonprofit organizations were designed by Cause Communications in Santa Monica, Calif. Organizations and their agencies can order the report at Mr. Goodman's Web site, www.agoodmanonline.com. Mr. Goodman has already given away 1,000 copies.
"There's so many well-intentioned people in the not-for-profit world that try to put together communication," said Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive at the Advertising Council in New York, which coordinates about 40 public service campaigns. "The more they can be told what works or what doesn't work, the more effective it will be."
John Passacantando, executive director for the United States operations of Greenpeace in Washington, who learned about the report while attending a presentation by Mr. Goodman, said he was ordering copies for his communications staff.
"This won't make people great copywriters," Mr. Passacantando added, "but it will at least give people a lot more of the right questions to ask."

HEADLINE: The War on What? 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
Spend a few days in Indonesia and you'll find many people asking you a question you weren't prepared for: Is America's war on terrorism going to become a war against democracy? 
 As Indonesians see it, for decades after World War II America sided with dictators, like their own President Suharto, because of its war on Communism. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, America began to press more vigorously for democracy and human rights in countries like Indonesia, as the U.S. shifted from containing Communism to enlarging the sphere of democratic states. Indonesians were listening, and in 1998 they toppled Mr. Suharto and erected their first electoral democracy. 
 Today Indonesians are still listening, and they're worried they're hearing America shift again -- from a war for democracy to a war on terrorism, in which the U.S. will judge which nations are with it or against it not by the integrity of their elections or the justice of their courts, but by the vigor with which their army and police combat Al Qaeda. For Indonesia, where democracy is still a fragile flower, anything that encourages a comeback by the long-feared, but now slightly defanged, army and police -- the tools of Mr. Suharto's long repression -- is not good news.
"Indonesian democrats have always depended on America as a point of reference that we could count on to support us," said the prominent Indonesian commentator Wimar Witoelar. "If we see you waffling, whom do we turn to? It is like the sun disappearing from the sky and everything starts to freeze here again." 
There is a broad feeling among Indonesian elites that while some of their more authoritarian neighbors, like Malaysia or Pakistan, have suddenly become the new darlings of Washington as a result of the war on terrorism, Indonesia is being orphaned because it is a messy, but real, democracy.
"We sometimes fear that America's democratization agenda also got blown up with the World Trade Center," says the Indonesian writer Andreas Harsono. "Since Sept. 11 there have been so many free riders on this American antiterrorism campaign, countries that want to use it to suppress their media and press freedom and turn back the clock. Indonesia, instead of being seen as a weak democracy that needs support, gets looked at as a weak country that protects terrorists, and Malaysia is seen as superior because it arrests more terrorists than we do." 
Indeed, many people here believe that retrograde elements in the army and police have helped stir up recent sectarian clashes in Aceh and the Maluku islands to spur Parliament to give the security services some of their old powers back.
Says Jusuf Wanandi, who heads a key strategic studies center here: "I just spoke with some senior military people who said to me: 'Why doesn't the government give up all this human rights stuff and leave the problem to us?' They said the Americans should normalize relations again with the Indonesian Army 'and we'll do the job for them.' That is not the right approach, because we do not trust yet that the reforms of the military here have been adequate."
In fairness, the Bush team has kept aid for Indonesia at $130 million and made it the official policy in all diplomatic contacts that Indonesia should continue fighting its war for democracy, while contributing what it can to the war on terrorism. (It's not clear if there are any Qaeda cells here.)
Nevertheless, some top Pentagon officials are definitely pushing to let the Indonesian military make a comeback and to restore ties with the Indonesian military that were suspended after the army ran amok in East Timor in 1999. Indonesia is just beginning to try military officers involved in those killings. If there is any hope of senior army officers being held accountable for East Timor, it will certainly be lost if America signals that all it cares about now is that the new antiterrorism laws being debated by the Indonesian Parliament give the army anything it wants. 
America needs to be aware of how its war on terrorism is read in other countries, especially those in transition. Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim country. Its greatest contribution to us would be to show the Arab Muslim states that it is possible to develop a successful Muslim democracy, with a modern economy and a moderate religious outlook. Setting that example is a lot more in America's long-term interest than arresting a few stray Qaeda fighters in the jungles of Borneo.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
A Costly Rebirth for a Big Old Resort

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: WHITEFIELD, N.H. 

 BODY:
A sprawling mountain resort that was built here in the late 1920's and had been closed since 1986 will open its doors to guests again on May 22 after a four-year restoration.
 The resort traces its roots to 1865, when a modest house in the White Mountains was turned into an inn after its owners provided shelter to passengers whose Montreal-bound stagecoach was caught in a storm. 
 Over time the inn became the 200-room Mountain View House, on a 12,000-acre swath of land. Like many other 19th-century grand hotels that catered to the rich and famous, Mountain View House attracted guests including presidents, moguls, athletes, starlets and others who craved luxury and privacy.
When the automobile and then the airplane put other vacation destinations within reach, many of the remote, expensive and aging resorts -- a recent article in Smithsonian magazine put the total number at more than 200 at their peak -- quickly lost their appeal. The Mountain View House was one of them. 
Yet when Kevin Craffey, the owner of a contracting business in Massachusetts, stumbled upon the shuttered, deteriorating four-story hotel, he believed that a lot of work and a lot of money could restore its luster. He bought the hotel and its adjoining 100-year-old nine-hole golf course for $1.3 million and has since invested millions more.
Time will tell whether his intuition and judgment were correct.
The resort, now on 4,000 acres, is surrounded by another privately owned 8,000-acre property that once belonged to the hotel. But the former white elephant itself -- renamed the Mountain View Grand -- has been restored to its original elegance, with many added modern touches.
Each guest room was enlarged by reducing the total number to 146 from 200, and each is equipped with telephones with Internet data ports. A kitchen and an indoor pool were added on the ground floor, and a spa has been installed in the building's signature tower, which rises three stories atop the building. An additional 15 rooms have been set aside for guests of the spa who want facials, hydrotherapy, massages and similar treatments.
Mr. Craffey also plans to build 200 condominiums around the golf course. The condos, to be offered for sale beginning at the reopening of the resort, will mainly be two to four bedrooms in town house style, at prices from $190,000 to $600,000. Eight lots of about two and a half acres each are being reserved for houses -- or "mansions," as Mr. Craffey likes to say. 
Also celebrating opening day will be the bankers who lent the project some $6.5 million, after various local, state and federal agencies approved about $8 million in loans and grants for refurbishing the hotel and building new sewer and water lines for it. Part of the financing package -- a five-year waiver of state taxes that is limited to historic hotels being restored -- required an amendment to the state Constitution. The financing package was conditional on the sale of $2 million in state tax credits. National Gypsum, a major dry-wall manufacturer, bought $1.4 million of the credits and provided free technical support in the construction of the hotel. 
Though the various government agencies were motivated in part to preserve one of New Hampshire's few remaining historic grand hotels, and the one that is believed to be the oldest in the state, their overriding motivation was to stimulate economic development in a town where total property valuation declined by more than 10 percent from 1990 to 1996, according to the federal Economic Development Administration. Coos County, within which Whitefield is situated, lost 5.6 percent of its population from 1990 to 1998.
David A. Sampson, the Bush administration's assistant secretary of commerce for economic development, said that his agency invested $452,000 in the $753,350 sewer and water project through the Town of Whitefield, because the Mountain View Grand will create 203 jobs immediately. More than 70 percent of the jobs, Mr. Sampson added, will be available for people of low or moderate income. 
Pam Remick, a Whitefield resident who is vice president of the Weathervane Theater Players, the town's longtime repertory company, was optimistic as opening day approached. "All the people I know," she said "are just thrilled about the hotel opening up. 
"At one time practically everybody here was employed there," she continued. "When the Mountain View is open, this town jumps."
Expecting that the reopened hotel will start Whitefield jumping again, an art gallery recently opened in the town, and an art store, a bakery and a bed and breakfast are scheduled to open soon. 
Despite the hotel's makeover and new name, visitors who have not been to the property for years should have little trouble recognizing the hotel. Like the rest of the exterior, the tower and both wings are built of cedar siding newly restored and painted in the hotel's original colonial yellow color. 
Each guest room has an unobstructed view of the mountains, trees and other scenery for which New England is noted. It was just such views that attracted Mr. Craffey to the area when he read in a Boston newspaper in 1998 about the abandoned hotel with its golf course and vast acreage. 
Still, "If I had known about all these hurdles, I wouldn't have run the race," Mr. Craffey said one recent day as contractors swarmed in and around the hotel, whose 511-foot width would have posed a challenge even to a blast off the bat of Babe Ruth, who was an occasional guest.
But no one who knows the kinetic Mr. Craffey, who is 37, is likely to take his lament seriously, since he appears to enjoy his role not only as owner and builder but also as the hotel's architect and the overseer of its gardens and business operations. 
Looking back at the years of hard work on the project, he said he still cherished the advice that his 5-year-old daughter, Felicia, the oldest of his three children, gave him, using a phrase that he had repeatedly invoked while teaching her to ride a bike.
So it is that when the celebratory banner is unfurled from the Mountain View tower on opening day, Mr. Craffey said, its motto will consist of the exact words that his daughter repeated: "Winners Don't Quit."

Survival, a la Grand Dames
Only a few of America's grand old hotels, or the Grand Dames, as they were affectionately known, have managed to escape the ravages of time and changing vacation patterns. They have done so mostly by preserving the best of what made them grand and adapting.
That has frequently meant developing their extensive property with privately owned homes. The 100-year-old Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, N.H., with 200 guest rooms, now has about 150 such houses on its 2,600 acres and will soon add more. Thirty houses have been built on the grounds of the Greenbrier hotel in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., which has 739 guest rooms, while an additional 70 or so lots have been sold (at prices ranging from $280,000 to $2 million). 
The Cliff House in Ogunquit, Me., owned by the same family since 1872, with 194 rooms, has sold 22 lots on its 70 acres for private homes over the years. But it no longer does because "preserving the acreage and keeping up with change are the keys to our survival," said Kathryn Weare, the current owner. Those changes include a conference center and, as of May 17, a new oceanfront spa and health club, as well as 32 new oversized guest rooms. 
Last December, the 133-year-old Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., with 251 guest rooms, opened a large refrigerated ice rink -- just in time. Lake Mohonk, which runs through the property, and on which guests have skated for years, froze over only a few days the entire winter.

PERSON: Lou Thesz 

HEADLINE: Lou Thesz, 86, Skilled Pro Wrestler, Dies 

BYLINE:  By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
Lou Thesz, the most celebrated professional wrestler of the mid-20th century and one of the last who relied on physical skills rather than show business gimmicks, died on April 28 in a hospital in Orlando, Fla. He was 86 and had undergone triple-bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement three weeks before.
 In the late 1940's and the 1950's, when professional wrestling was a mainstay of early television despite, or perhaps because of, preordained outcomes, Thesz was a hero even to his peers. He knew amateur wrestling holds, and unlike his colleagues who bleached their hair or pranced around the ring or taunted the crowd, he really wrestled. 
 He once said: "I am a wrestler. Not a wrassler, not a clown. A wrestler."
He competed in seven decades, starting his professional career in 1932, at age 16, and finishing in 1990, at 74. His last match was in Japan, where he was an icon. At 215 pounds, he wrestled Masahiro Chono, who was 27 and weighed 260. Thesz lost after his artificial hip buckled.
Why wrestle at age 74? He told The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Va., "I was old enough to know not to do it, but I did it anyway."
He was the six-time world champion of the National Wrestling Alliance, the most important governing body of the era, winning his first title at 21. He held the title a total of 13 years, a record. In a time when pro wrestlers sometimes fought legitimate bouts, he won 936 consecutive matches from 1948 to 1955.
He sometimes wrestled 200 to 250 times a year, often after driving all night from one site to the next. By his count, his career encompassed 6,000 matches, 200 broken bones and 16 million miles.
Aloysius Martin Thesz was born April 24, 1916, in Banat, Mich. He grew up in St. Louis, where he was taught to wrestle by his father, Martin, a cobbler who had been an amateur champion in his native Hungary.
The handsome youngster grew to 6 feet 2 inches and 225 pounds and became a quick success. He wrestled in memorable matches against such stars as Gorgeous George, Killer Kowalski, Gene Kiniski, Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Baron Michele Leone and Bronko Nagurski. Thesz was the kind of superior wrestler known as a hooker, one of the few who had command of the most difficult and potentially crippling moves.
To the critics who dismissed pro wrestling as merely show business, and bad show business at that, he said one essential point linked wrestling to other pro sports.
"They're all entertainments with an economic bottom line," he said in "Hooker," his autobiography, "and they're staged for no other reason except to give the paying customers entertainment. Once you sell a ticket to an athletic contest, it stops being a sport and becomes a business.
"The 'winner' wasn't always the wrestler whose hand was raised, but the one whose performance stuck in the mind of the fans as they headed home after the matches, the one they would pay money to see again, regardless of whether they hated or admired him."
Still, he did not like what his sport had become. In the 90's, he said that contemporary pro wrestling was "choreographed tumbling, a clown act, a circus, with no dignity."
In his autobiography, published in 1995, he wrote: "The reality, or substance, of professional wrestling is the ability to perpetuate a fantasy. I never distinguished between fantasy and reality. I made my fantasy reality for over 60 years."
Thesz helped create a national wrestling hall of fame in Newton, Iowa, near Des Moines. Until his last illness, he worked out in a gymnasium three or four times a week near his home in Winter Garden, Fla.
He is survived by his wife, Charlie; three sons, Jeff of Las Vegas, Robert of Vero Beach, Fla., and Patrick of Cambridge, England; three sisters, Ann Rode and Kay Schmidt of San Marcos, Calif., and Helene Haack of St. Louis; and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed Panel's Statement 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to leave interest rates unchanged: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. 
 The information that has become available since the last meeting of the committee confirms that economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory investment. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain. 
In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the committee believes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals. 
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jerry L. Jordan; Robert D. McTeer Jr.; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern. 
Voting against the action: none.

HEADLINE: Studies in Favor of Indian Point's Closing List Power Effects 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Closing down the Indian Point nuclear power plant, despite the grim predictions about blackouts and soaring electricity costs, might not be as painful as the plant's owners have contended, according to two new studies commissioned by opponents of the plant.
 The studies, issued yesterday by the environmental group Riverkeeper and the Pace Law School Energy Project, say that the lost power would be more than made up for by a falloff in electricity demand caused by the recession and the disruption of business in Lower Manhattan, along with the prospect of seven new gas-fired plants that could be built in New York State over the next five to seven years. Conservation measures like those used in California last year could also sharply cut demand, the studies say. 
 Many environmentalists and public officials have expressed concern since Sept. 11 that Indian Point's two reactors, about 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan in Buchanan, N.Y., could be a target for terrorists and that evacuation plans might not be workable in such a densely populated area.
The plant's owner, Entergy Corporation, released a study last week by two independent research groups, which concluded that closing the plant could cost consumers $3.4 billion over the next four years in developing alternative sources.
One of the reports released yesterday, by Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., said that last week's study underestimated the amount of new electricity supply in development, and overestimated how much demand will grow.
The other report, by Charles Komanoff, an independent energy consultant in Manhattan, said that using the same legislative and policy tools that cut peak demand by 10 percent in California last summer, New York could more than make up for losing Indian Point's power as soon as this summer, even if no new plants were built.

HEADLINE: U.N. Prepares For a Debate On Dire Needs Of Children 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 7 

 BODY:
As world leaders gathered here on the eve of a landmark special session on children, tales of abomination were hardly in short supply today. Some 10 million children died of preventable diseases in the 1990's, a United Nations review found. Infant mortality rates deteriorated in large swaths of Africa. Aid from rich nations to the poor lagged at a time of unprecedented global prosperity, and in much of the developing world, the number of people who lived on less than $1 a day shot up over the last decade.
 Then there was the peculiar horror of the 1990's -- the deployment of child soldiers -- for which top United Nations officials reserved their strongest condemnation. The secretary general, Kofi Annan, called it a "despicable and damaging practice" and hinted at punishing those responsible. The United Nations Security Council held a rare meeting on the subject. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 children are fighting in wars. 
 "Those who practice this form of child abuse must be held accountable," Mr. Annan declared this afternoon. "For far too long, the use of child soldiers has been seen as merely regrettable. We are here to ensure it is recognized as intolerable." 
The campaign against child soldiers is an issue around which consensus can be reached, relatively easily. Even though the three-day General Assembly Special Session on Children does not get under way until Wednesday, it is already riven by acrimony.
Much of the debate centers on abortion, and how it should be addressed in the final document of the special session. All 189 member states must agree on the document, which will delineate specific goals and measures to improve the lives of children over the next 15 years. 
At issue is the phrase "reproductive health services." The Bush administration, whose chief delegate to the special session is the secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, wants the document to specify that such services would not include abortion. Its allies are a host of Catholic countries from Latin America, as well as a swath of the Islamic world.
"Let's do an asterisk that says, 'Hey, by the way, health care services doesn't mean abortion,' " an American official said, explaining the administration's wishes. "Nobody wants to put it down and spell it out."
The other point of contention concerns language on the rights of children. The United States is one of only two countries in the world that have yet to ratify the landmark 1989 treaty on children's rights; Somalia is the other. 
Conservatives in Congress have repeatedly objected to the treaty. They say they fear its provisions place the rights of children over those of their parents; allowing children to access certain health services without their parents' consent, for instance. The treaty also outlaws the death penalty for anyone under 18, something that nearly half of all American states allow. 
The American delegation to the session is unlikely to agree to any language in the final document that is seen as an endorsement of the convention on children. 
If nothing else, the special session has already offered a chilling snapshot of the plight of the world's smallest, most vulnerable citizens to some of the world's most powerful. Among the 3,000 official delegates from over 180 countries are 60 presidents, prime ministers and monarchs and about 200 child delegates.
Indeed, a progress report for the decade, assembled by the secretary general's office, offers as much evidence of progress and regress for the world's two billion children.
More children are in school than ever before, the report has found. Yet 100 million children are unable to attend school, 60 percent of them girls. Polio has been all but eradicated, and the number of children who die of diarrhea has been reduced by half. Yet 10 million die every year from preventable diseases.
The picture in sub-Saharan Africa is especially stark. Infant mortality rates have improved in much of the world. But in several African countries, the picture is the opposite: 17 percent of newborns do not live to the age of 5. Sub-Saharan Africa has 10 percent of the world's population and 90 percent of its AIDS orphans.
Squeezed by foreign debt, many governments have spent less and less on basic social services. Some poor countries, the United Nations report found, spend three to five times as much paying off foreign debt as they do on basic services.
At the same time, rich countries fell far short of the commitments they made at the 1990 summit meeting: to devote an average of 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to development assistance. Only four countries, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, met the 1990 goal. The United States ranked No. 22 among donors, with 0.1 percent of its G.D.P. devoted to aid. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about preparations by the United Nations for its special session to discuss the needs of children misstated the number who died of preventable diseases in the 1990's. It is estimated at 130 million, not 10 million. The article also misstated the number of countries that met their pledge to devote an average of 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to development assistance. It is five, not four. (Luxembourg did, along with Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway.)

HEADLINE: At Workshop, Students Tackle Real-Life Problems 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Nzingha Dorner once gazed at the neglected structures and blighted buildings in her neighborhood and thought that replacing them took little more than some cash and a dream. She has since learned that developing a piece of property is not that simple.
 "I thought that if I wanted a clothing store there, it's going there; that's the end of it," said Nzingha, 12. "I had no idea that it was this much trouble." 
 Of course, Nzingha, a seventh-grade student at Juan Morel Campos Intermediate School 71 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has never had to think about owning property. She lives with her mother and grandmother in the Marcy Houses in Williamsburg. Her fellow students are also mostly the children of renters, some of whom live in public housing projects and others of whom live on rent subsidies.
But these days Nzingha and her classmates can speak of erecting a building and know that the steps they would have to take would include studying land use and tax maps, raising capital and understanding how interest rates affect the price of real estate. Since February, Nzingha and 27 of her seventh-grade classmates at I.S. 71 have been getting a crash course in urban planning and design.
About three times a month, instead of their math class the students attend a 90-minute workshop that is put on by members of the M.I.T. Club of New York, some of whom work in fields that relate to urban planning.
The seventh graders are not designing in the abstract. The M.I.T. alumni selected a swath of waterfront property in Williamsburg that is now home to a manufacturing plant. The property, which is on Kent Avenue and is bounded by North 12th Street and Bushwick Creek, is at the center of a controversy as a private developer of power plants, TransGas Energy Systems, has proposed that it be converted into a power plant. 
At the end of the five-month workshop, the students are expected to have developed a proposal for the site illustrated by maps detailing everything from the placement of buildings and landscaping to a pedestrian and vehicular access plan.
The idea is not just to understand real estate. The students are applying important mathematical concepts as well as learning about design, graphics and photography. They are also familiarizing themselves with the city's political structure, polishing their public speaking skills and learning to work in groups. 
The workshop is an example of the increasing use of practical projects, not just to prepare students for the world of real work but to stretch the boundaries of their imagination beyond the jobs held by the people they see every day. Often these projects are shepherded by corporations or nonprofit groups that have immersed themselves in the troubled New York City school system in ways that were not the case a generation ago.
The mock development program at I.S. 71 is the brainchild of Michael Johnson, an M.I.T. club member and a former urban planner who works in financing for the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Johnson was once a student at I.S. 71 and said he started the workshop because he wanted to reinvest in the school, which has mostly black and Latino students and where 84 percent of the students qualify for the federal free lunch program. 
"I see myself in them," said Mr. Johnson, 29. "African-American, Hispanic youth who live in areas that may not get the opportunities that other places get, and I know that in that school there are some future doctors, attorneys, politicians, maybe even the president of the United States." 
Each workshop begins with a lecture. At a class last month, Deidre Dunn, an M.I.T. alumna who is a trader at Goldman, Sachs, led the students in a discussion about the economics of architecture and real estate, using terms like budget line, capital and income statement.
Ms. Dunn distributed a handout with word problems that asked students to pretend that they were the project finance department of a real estate corporation and to figure out the cost and income associated with being profitable -- a weighty assignment even for those who actually have a venture to finance.
The students' lessons are not always directly related to math.
In late April, they explored the intricacies of the public review and approval process. As Kate Collignon, a senior project manager for the city's Economic Development Corporation, began a a discussion about the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, 28 blank faces, some with furrowed brows, stared back at her.
But when she explained that the students had to seek approval from entities that ranged from the local community board to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the students started to anticipate questions the bureaucrats might ask.
"What's going to happen to the people who work in the manufacturing plant?" asked Jonathan Viera, 13, who was worried about displacing people with his new development. 
"That's one of the questions that you want to provide an answer for," Ms. Collignon said.
After the lecture, the students usually divide into five groups -- each has a different development plan -- to work on mapping their visions for the site. One group, for example, wants to build an outlet mall since there are few retail outlets in the area.
The group members then work together to draw the outlines of their development on a series of maps. Later this month, the students will have a chance to try some public speaking skills when they present their completed proposal to real estate developers and local politicians.
Although the students' ideas are very unlikely ever to come off the drawing board, they said they had learned skills that were transferable to the real world. When Stephanie Rodriguez's parents were presented with maps that construction workers will use to remodel their home, she recognized a tax map and could identify the block and lot numbers on which her house sits.
Susana Pena now knows how many feet are in an acre. "Forty-three thousand, five hundred and sixty," she said. "It's in my mind." And she has a desire to learn more. "I want to know how they build the building itself and how they design the building," she said.
Jonathan Rodriguez, 12, who lives in Borinquen Plaza with his mother, sister and uncle and said he always wanted to be a basketball player, now thinks he could be an architect. 
"I always thought about it, but I never took it into consideration until this project," he said.

Two Cities, Two Elections And Two Different Worlds

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
AFTER studying the riots that erupted in 1967 here and in other urban centers, a commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson warned that the nation was "moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."
 Today young people still inhabit vastly different worlds, even if that difference is not defined solely by race. Consider two cities -- Tulsa, Okla., and Newark -- that are among several participating in an effort by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania to involve high school students in municipal elections. The idea is that if the program can whet their appetites now, these students are more likely to be involved in the civic process once they become adults. 
 In both Tulsa and Newark, high school classes have toured neighborhoods to define what they think the campaign issues should be. Students have posed questions to mayoral candidates on the Internet (at www.student-voices.org), and the candidates have responded.
In Tulsa, students are roughly half white and half black, and mostly middle class. During the campaign for the city's mayoral election, held in March, their main concerns were potholes and a lower-income area that they wanted beautified. The city's budget shortfall was also an issue. But the Tulsa youths expressed little personal fear of violence from gangs or drug dealers.
In Newark, where a mayor will be elected next week, students live in a much poorer and more violent community. Here young people tell a very different story. At Technology High School, for example, Tariq Raheem teaches history to seniors who have concluded that the chief election issues should be gang violence, police corruption and the presence of drug dealers on the street.
In a walk around the city, Mr. Raheem's students observed strewn crack vials. In class discussions, they complained of living in fear that they would be shot if they wore clothing that by chance matched a gang's color, or if they merely went outside in the evening. Those fears were palpable during a student panel's recent interviewing of the candidates, to be broadcast at 6:30 p.m. tomorrow by NJN, New Jersey's public television service. (A student discussion of the issues will be broadcast on WBGO-FM 88.3 , Newark public radio, at 8 p.m. on Monday.)
One of Mr. Raheem's students, Tiffany Williams, said she would support a candidate who favored creating more jobs and raising the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour. Ms. Williams reasoned that if young people could live on their earnings, they would be less drawn to gangs and crime. Although the minimum wage is beyond the mayor's power to set, she argued that a mayor should be expected to advocate a higher one to other officials.
Some students disagreed with Ms. Williams. Toaine Johnson said that once youths joined gangs, they could not be induced to leave simply by providing them regular employment and slightly higher wages.
Mr. Raheem's students debated other election issues, but most of those topics also concerned, directly or indirectly, the effects of crime and gangs. Mr. Raheem described how community policing might work, and asked if students thought it would help. Some deemed it reasonable, but one young woman objected to having police officers live in neighborhoods they patrol; she said a policeman who lived in her community was its biggest drug dealer.
In a city with an exceptionally high dropout rate -- 40 percent is a good estimate -- that Mr. Raheem's students have reached senior year defines them as among those with the most perseverance and talent. Even so, he has had to spend one class period a week, all year, trying to convince them their future would brighten if they attended college; most never before considered the idea. 
Mr. Raheem says roughly half his students are going on to college in the fall. Still, attrition rates there are high among students who come from communities characterized by violence, unemployment and poverty.
In a number of cities, the Annenberg Center's two-year-old project, Student Voices, has improved teenagers' civic awareness and attitudes toward political involvement, and sharpened the desire of many to participate in public affairs as adults. These are hopeful signs, though there is no hard evidence that such student attitudes actually lead to political participation later in life.
In any event, it will take more than civic awareness, of course, to make those two societies one.

HEADLINE: Ladies, Sing the Blues 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I was feeling pretty happy, in a guilty-pleasure sort of way. It was a banner week for schadenfreude.
 First the tumble of the arrogant colossus, AOL Time Warner; then the unraveling of the imperious Hollywood Svengali Michael Ovitz; finally the news that the batrachian Enron executives may do time for manipulating energy markets in California. 
 As in Greek myths: Hubris gets its just deserts. 
AOL Time Warner was the humongous beast that got a stomachache trying to gobble up everything in sight. The Internet crowd was in the throes of a narcissistic and economic explosion two years ago. It treated its partners, putting out prestigious products -- such as Time, People, InStyle, Fortune, HBO and CNN -- contemptuously, even though they provide most of the conglomerate's profits. The dot-com cabal dismissed content as the vestige of an obsolete universe.
But now that the company has lost $54 billion in the first quarter, we must ask: What is AOL, anyhow? Isn't it just cyberspace tin cans strung together?
AOL placed a losing bet that the bottle was more important than the wine. The universe is not so easy to master, after all.
Maybe Mike Ovitz and the hotshots of AOL and Enron, all those emperors of etherea, those peddlers of pseudo-services, will have to get real jobs now. 
I was reading the paper, gloating that the puffed-up were not prospering, when I learned that my glee could kill me. Happiness could be unhealthy.
Articles detailed new research indicating that a pale shade of the blues may actually be good for women's longevity. A Duke University study showed that women with mild depression were 40 percent less likely to die prematurely than women who were not depressed, or than those with severe depression.
This was going to require some tricky calibrations in our personal lives.
Single women can now call off the exhausting and maddening hunt for Mr. Right. Mr. Right would bring bliss -- and an early grave.
But women will also have to try harder to avoid Mr. Wrong. Mr. Wrong, or a series of Mr. Wrongs, would lead to a slough of despond -- and an early grave.
For the sake of our health, women will now have to look for Mr. Slightly Wrong, someone a little annoying, a man who can modify, qualify, deflect and overturn our happiness just enough so that we wake up not happy and not sad. We must find men who leave us with a sense of malaise, but who don't leave us.
O.K., I thought, I'll find Mr. Slightly Wrong and live very long.
But then I read about the Attack of the Killer Potatoes. Swedish researchers found out that frying spuds spurs the formation of a carcinogenic molecule.
French fries and potato chips are my major food group. I've downed enough Pringles to shingle Versailles.
Now I was really depressed. My life was rapidly growing shorter.
I pondered psychopharmacology: I could lift my unhealthy deep depression to a restorative mild one by taking an itty bit of Prozac.
But then I spied the front page of The Washington Post, which reported that sugar pills may work just as well as Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft.
So maybe I'll just put sugar in my tea, a beverage that dramatically reduces the chance of death following a heart attack, according to another new study this week.
Besides, the Duke research implied that anti-depressants would lull me into not fixing the problems in my life, and thereby shorten my life by making me too happy.
My imperative was clear: I had to dwell on the sad things with silver linings, at least if I wanted to stick around to keep being moderately saddened by them.
The new research sounds like the old Catskills joke: Restaurant-goers complain that the food is awful -- and the portions are too small.
As much as boomers cherish age-attenuating measures, maybe it's better just to be happy, quickly. In the opera "The Makropoulos Case" a 16-year-old is given a magic elixir by her father that allows her to live for three centuries. When we meet her she is a ravishing 337-year-old opera singer, bored with fawning men and perpetual reruns.
That is when she realizes: Brevity is the soul of life.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Content Not to Raise Interest Rates 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
With new data suggesting that inflation will remain under control, the Federal Reserve voted unanimously today to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the durability of the economic recovery remained uncertain.
 On a day when the Labor Department reported a bigger-than-expected surge in the growth rate of productivity, the central bank reiterated that it was not in any rush to raise interest rates, despite a sharp upturn in economic growth in the first quarter. The productivity gain is evidence that companies may be able to restore their depressed profit margins without having to jack up prices. 
 The decision left the federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at a 40-year low, 1.75 percent, where it has been for nearly five months. Economists said the Fed would probably not seriously consider raising rates until August, especially if the unemployment rate continued to rise, as it has in recent months. 
On Wall Street, stock prices were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.51, to 9,836.55. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,573.82, down 4.66.
In a statement, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee stressed that the 5.8 percent economic growth rate in the first quarter was largely a one-time boost from companies' beginning to rebuild their inventories as the recession ended. It is not yet clear, the committee said, that economic activity is picking up on a sufficiently broad basis to ensure that a healthy expansion will continue.
"Economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory adjustment," the committee said. "Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain."
The Fed signaled that it expected to have to raise rates at some point, saying that the "stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative." But it said it would maintain its position for now, given that the risks to the economy are evenly balanced between the risk of inflation and the possibility of another downturn.
In remaining patient about when to begin reversing the Fed's string of 11 rate cuts last year, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have had the luxury of not having to worry much about inflation. Today's report on productivity, or output per hour, gave them further statistical reassurance that they are unlikely to feel pressed to act anytime soon just because of rising prices.
Productivity in the first quarter rose at an 8.6 percent annual rate, its fastest pace since 1983. Productivity growth in last year's fourth quarter was revised, to 5.5 percent from 5.2 percent.
Productivity growth measures the economy's ability to produce more goods and services with a given amount of labor. It is the most basic predictor of the economy's ability to expand without generating inflation.
The assumption that the growth rate of productivity has fundamentally improved after a two-decade lag has been at the heart of speculation about a technology-driven "new economy," an economy that is able to grow faster and sustain lower levels of unemployment than suggested by traditional economic theory.
The surge in productivity has been driven in large part by relentless business competition. In industry after industry, companies have been unable to raise prices and have instead invested heavily in cost-saving technology, often combined with layoffs. In the last seven months, the unemployment rate rose 1.1 percentage points, to 6 percent in April.
The result has been to get more production out of fewer workers.
As a result, unit labor costs -- how much companies pay to workers per unit of production -- fell at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Lower costs should help companies fatten their profit margins, a development that could get Wall Street out of the doldrums, analysts said.
"We won't see another quarter as strong as the first," said a report today from Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, "but we do believe productivity will grow at a 4 percent rate or better during the rest of the year. If so, earnings should be up strongly, despite a lack of pricing power, and inflation should be a no-show."
The consensus forecast for the economy for the rest of the year calls for a gradual recovery with a slow upturn in spending by companies on capital equipment, the sector hit hardest by the recession.
But some economists remain concerned that the economy is very fragile, and that any shock, like another terrorist attack or a spike in oil prices, could put the United States into a deflationary spiral, in which a lack of demand would fuel a downward slide in prices.
Japan has been enduring such a problem for years.
Even those economists who do not worry about deflation say the Fed could be on hold for months if the unemployment rate continues to rise, as it typically does for months after the technical end of a recession.

Australia Raises Rate
 SYDNEY, Australia, Wednesday, May 8 (Bloomberg News) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia increased its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point from a 28-year low to keep inflation in check as the economy expands faster than expected.
The central bank raised the overnight cash target rate to 4.5 percent, the first increase since August 2000, as annual inflation threatens to break through the top of the bank's target range.
Australia's economy is expected to grow 3.9 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said last month. That would be the second-fastest growth rate for industrial nations, behind Korea, whose central bank unexpectedly increased rates on Tuesday.
Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. That is near the top of the central bank's target range for annual inflation of 2 percent to 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Brisk Housing Market Pinches Suburban Homeless 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., May 7 

 BODY:
Suffolk County's homeless population is swelling, in large part because low-income housing is scarce, lawyers, social workers and other advocates for the homeless testified at a public hearing here today.
 In February, officials said, the number of families placed in shelters, motels and other emergency housing arrangements reached an all-time peak of 509, up from a monthly average of 249 families in 1999. 
 The last time the number of homeless families peaked was in June 1994, when 447 families sought emergency housing from the county. This time, experts said, the homelessness problem has in many cases just as much to do with the strong housing market as with unemployment. 
The vigorous housing market "has been a double-edged sword," said Dennis J. Nowak, a spokesman for Suffolk's Department of Social Services. "The story we hear over and over is, 'My landlord just served me an eviction notice because he's selling the house.' "
Take the Cuffies, a family of six who were evicted from the three-bedroom house in Bay Shore they had rented for $1,100 after the landlord decided to sell it. The cheapest three-bedroom house the family could find cost $1,500, Theresa Cuffie said at the hearing, so they ended up at the Sunrise Inn motel, in West Babylon, with the county paying the bill.
At the time of the eviction, in October, Mrs. Cuffie was unemployed and her husband, Myles, was on leave after hurting his back while working at a furniture warehouse, she said. Now, both have jobs and together they earn about $49,000 a year.
Even so, said Mrs. Cuffie, 36, it will be difficult to find a home they can afford. She suggested that the county use the money it pours into motels and shelters to fix abandoned homes instead.
"The ridiculous amount of money that the county pays for a family to stay in a shelter, manpower involved and strain on the local school districts would well be worth the cost of fixing up these abandoned homes and allowing people to move in," she said.
"I am here to discredit the notion that we need more shelters," she added. "If you are looking for real solutions, this is going to take years and should have been addressed years ago."
Today's hearing was held by a countywide task force on homelessness appointed by the county executive and the presiding officer of the County Legislature. It includes representatives of nonprofit organizations and shelter providers and is expected to compile a list of recommendations by the fall.
In Nassau County, only 111 homeless families are living in shelters and motels, said a spokeswoman for Nassau's Department of Social Services. But there, too, the problem appears to be growing. 
"I think it's a general suburban phenomenon that is not well recognized," Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist at the Long Island Association, a group of business, labor and civic leaders, said in an interview. "People don't think of homelessness as a suburban phenomenon. They associate it with something that happens in central cities. But the truth is that we do have people living in their cars or in substandard mobile homes."
Mr. Nowak said that in more than 17 percent of the 477 homeless families Suffolk is now caring for, at least one member is working.
Some nonprofit groups that work with the homeless have suggested that Suffolk is sheltering only a fraction of the homeless families that exist. Some families, these groups say, stay below the official radar by moving in with friends or relatives, or even living out of cars.

HEADLINE: As a Hurdle Is Cleared, Building Begins At Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In the most visible sign yet that the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan has begun, workers yesterday began the first step in erecting a new skyscraper on the site where 7 World Trade Center once stood.
 In recent days, Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who owned the 47-story tower, received word that his insurance company would not contest his $861 million claim, clearing the way for construction. Yesterday, Mr. Silverstein had workers begin erecting a construction fence around the site, on the north side of Vesey Street. 
 Mr. Silverstein's insurance company, Industrial Risk Insurers, had been investigating whether a 6,000-gallon oil tank that had been installed in the building in the late 90's had significantly contributed to the collapse of the tower on Sept. 11. The oil tank was installed for the Giuliani administration's emergency crisis center there. 
Both Mr. Silverstein and state officials had been worried that if the insurance company refused to pay the claim, the project would falter, sending a gloomy message about the future of Lower Manhattan. 
But the two sides resolved the issues amicably. Dean Davison, a spokesman for the insurance company, said that Industrial Risk was "moving toward payment of the claims."
Mr. Silverstein said excavation would start in the coming days, while pile-driving and a formal groundbreaking ceremony would occur sometime in June.
"It's resolved," Mr. Silverstein said yesterday morning with a sigh of relief. "A lot of things are beginning to happen."
According to executives who have been briefed on Mr. Silverstein's negotiations with the insurance company, there is one remaining issue: the developer wants Industrial Risk to pay the claim in one lump sum, rather than in periodic installments, so that he, in turn, can pay off his existing mortgage at 7 World Trade Center. Either way, the executive said, Mr. Silverstein should not have a problem financing the new tower.
Mr. Silverstein's latest plan calls for a somewhat taller but less bulky skyscraper designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill. The location of the tower will be shifted slightly to the south to allow for the restoration of Greenwich Street. And the project will accommodate a Con Edison substation. Two substations that relayed electricity to much of Lower Manhattan were destroyed Sept. 11 when 7 World Trade Center collapsed.
The project still requires approval by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the land. But Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and New York's top economic development official, has long encouraged Mr. Silverstein to rebuild 7 World Trade Center. The developer also said he would continue to work with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency created to oversee the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan. Although it has no formal role in the project, the corporation has successfully pressed the developer and Con Edison in the reconfiguration of the building.
"This shows that you can get good things to happen in Lower Manhattan by working together," said Louis R. Tomson, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, said that many civic groups were still hoping that Mr. Silverstein had come up with an environmentally responsible design that included reductions in energy use, elimination of toxic materials and the use of natural light and air.
At the 16-acre World Trade Center site on the south side of Vesey Street, the development corporation is playing a more critical role. The Port Authority owns the land and Mr. Silverstein controls the lease for that site as well. But the development corporation is charged with the politically sensitive task of creating a memorial for the 2,824 people killed at the trade center and taking into account a public consensus for what should be built on the land.
Mr. Silverstein backed off on his original proposal to simply rebuild the 10.5-million-square-foot trade center, with either two or four large towers, after community groups, civic organizations and the families of victims of the terrorist attack objected. In recent weeks, Mr. Silverstein has kept silent about his design for the site, while the development corporation has been drawing up its own plans.
The Port Authority and the development corporation are reviewing applications from 13 groups of urban planners, architects and transportation experts interested in become consultants on a development plan. The Port Authority will select the winning proposal in two weeks and develop a plan by July, a speedy timetable that has drawn criticism from some who say it does not leave enough time to create an imaginative design.
Work is moving forward on rebuilding the PATH train tunnels and a subway station destroyed in the attack. But that is far less visible than a new tower.
State and city officials considered the rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center to be less politically sensitive. It was important, they said, to rebuild the electrical substation by July 2003, and to reassure financial firms that had fled the area that Lower Manhattan would be rebuilt quickly.
"This will be a concrete and positive statement about the viability of new commercial redevelopment in Lower Manhattan," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.

HEADLINE: Argentina Shakes, Uruguay Rattles 

BYLINE:  ByJENNIFER L. RICH 

 BODY:
Not long ago, the beaches of Uruguay were filled with Argentine tourists, its banks stuffed with Argentines' offshore wealth.
 Now, Argentina is mired in the worst economic crisis in its history, and Uruguay appears to be the only South American nation that is being taken under by its neighbor's troubles. 
 As many ties that once bolstered the Uruguayan economy have come unraveled, the government in Montevideo has been scrambling to adjust.
Its task recently became even more difficult. On Friday, Moody's Investors Service lowered Uruguay's precious investment-grade rating to junk status, saying the country was "increasingly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks emanating from Argentina." The downgrade followed similar moves earlier this year by the other two major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. 
Uruguay's financial troubles predate the current Argentine crisis. Several years ago, a series of global emerging markets crises pushed down world commodities prices, forcing Brazil, and then Argentina, into an economic tailspin. Sandwiched by the much larger Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay, about the size of the state of Washington and with a population of just 3.3 million, is highly dependent on its neighbors. It soon followed them into recession.
Last year, Uruguay had its third year of economic contraction, with gross domestic product falling 2 percent. G.D.P. is expected to decline a similar amount this year.
When the Argentines were forced to devalue their currency in January, the Uruguayan government reacted by doubling, to 12 percent, the band in which it allows its peso to float. Last week, the government predicted that its peso would depreciate 2.4 percent a month until the end of the year while floating within that band..
Because of the devaluation, Uruguay's mostly dollar-denominated debt now adds up to more than 60 percent of G.D.P.
In an effort to reduce the $779 million fiscal deficit posted in December from 4 percent of G.D.P. to 2.5 percent, the government has come up with a plan to cut spending by $270 million and increase tax revenue. Praising the "energetic" response by the government, the International Monetary Fund in March granted a standby loan of $743 million over three years to the country. This month, the economy minister, Alberto Bension, announced that Uruguay would receive about $1 billion in aid from the World Bank and the Bank of International Development from now to the end of 2003.
But many analysts and economists said that the spending cuts had failed to go to the heart of Uruguay's structural spending problems and that increased taxation was counterproductive after four years of recession, when tax revenues are falling over all.
The country, which has one of the strongest centrally planned economies left in Latin America, needs to privatize its energy, telecommunications and infrastructure assets to pay down the debt, they say. But such moves are tricky politically.
"Uruguay is a country where one in six people work for the government," said Morgan Harting, sovereign-debt analyst at Fitch Ratings. "Public opinion is conservative and opposed to rapid change."
Although a depreciating currency will increase the competitiveness of Uruguayan exports, until now the bulk of such goods have gone to Argentina and Brazil, its biggest partners in the Mercosur trade bloc, which also includes Paraguay.
To help expand its export base, Uruguay recently signed a trade pact with Mexico. It also established a Joint Commission on Trade and Investment with the United States to explore ways to increase trade and address bilateral trade issues.
Financiers are closely watching Uruguayan banking. Many wealthy Argentines, fearing devaluation (or avoiding taxes) at home, had substantial deposits in Uruguay; when the Argentine government severely limited withdrawals from their Argentine accounts, the depositors drew cash from their Uruguayan accounts instead, draining hundreds of millions of dollars. Uruguay's central bank had to intervene in the Uruguayan operations of Banco Galicia, Argentina's largest private bank, because of a run on deposits.
As the crisis next door continues, the concern is that Uruguayans will start putting their money under the mattress, too.

Investors' Fears Drag S.&P. to Lowest Level in 7 Months

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell to its lowest level in seven months yesterday, reflecting investor concern that an economic rebound would fail to revive profits as much as expected.
 The American International Group and Johnson & Johnson were the biggest drag on the S.& P. 
 Federal Reserve policy makers held overnight interest rates unchanged at a four-decade low yesterday, suggested that economic growth remained anemic. They said they were "still uncertain" about a sustained recovery. 
"There's fear that earnings for the second half will be below expectations," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, which manages about $100 billion in active investments.
The S.& P. 500 slid 3.18 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,049.49, the lowest since Oct. 1. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 28.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,836.55, led by Honeywell International. The Nasdaq composite index, down 19 percent this year, fell 4.66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,573.82, led by Dell Computer.
The S.& P. 500 has dropped 8.6 percent this year and trades for 20.5 times estimated profits. Earlier in the year, the S.& P. 500 traded for almost 26 times earnings. The Dow has dropped 1.9 percent this year.
A slide in the indexes in the final hour reflected investor skittishness, said Curt Rohrman, who helps oversee $27 billion at USAA Capital in San Antonio. "The mentality in the market is that any rally in a stock is an opportunity to sell it," Mr. Rohrman said. 
The declines came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at 1.75 percent, saying the economy is just getting back on its feet after a recession that started in March 2001.
Stocks were bolstered earlier in the day after the government said nonfarm productivity jumped 8.6 percent in the first quarter while unit labor costs declined 5.4 percent. 
Pharmaceutical stocks were the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500 after Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would limit tax deductions for marketing to what drug makers spend on research.
Johnson & Johnson declined $1.68, to $60.42; Wyeth fell $1.19, to $54.06; and Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 83 cents, to $28.01. Pfizer lost 80 cents, to $35.75.
Insurers including American International and MetLife were the second-biggest losers.
MetLife dropped $2.29, to $31.86. Its earnings were below analysts' expectations and some investors said they were skeptical the company could meet 2002 estimates.
A.I.G. lost $1.90, to $67.65. The decline in insurance shares came after comments Warren E. Buffett made at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway over the weekend in which he discussed potential losses from future terrorist attacks.

Treasury Prices Climb
 (By Reuters) -- Shorter-dated Treasury bonds popped higher yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left short-term interest rates unchanged and reiterated its view that risks to the economy were balanced between weakness and inflation.
Expectations in the market that the Fed will wait until at least the August meeting before raising rates kept demand for Treasuries strong.
By late in the day, the two-year note was up slightly, rising 1/32, to a price of 100 15/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.12 percent from 3.15 percent. The 10-year note rose 2/32, to 98 19/32. Its yield fell to 5.06 percent from 5.07 percent.
The 30-year bond rose 3/32, to 97 23/32. Its yield dropped to 5.53 percent from 5.54 percent.

HEADLINE: More Enron Mischief 

 BODY:
The people who ran Enron always insisted that the company had nothing to do with the California energy crisis. The crisis, which peaked in the winter of 2000-2001, was variously attributed by them and their friends in Washington to California's environmental regulations, to shortages of natural gas and new generating capacity and to a flawed system of deregulation. But incriminating documents released Monday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission suggest that market manipulation by Enron and possibly other companies aggravated the crisis. California officials welcomed the documents as the "smoking gun" necessary to help them recoup billions in overcharges. 
 It was obvious from the beginning that some of the explanations for the crisis that were being floated by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were nonsense. California's environmental laws posed no serious impediments to energy production, and there was no shortage of natural gas. The regulatory system, which capped retail prices while letting wholesale prices run free, and the shortage of generating capacity were definitely factors, though perhaps not as important as once thought. Meanwhile, state officials insisted that market shenanigans also played a huge role. 
 Internal documents provided by Enron's lawyers to the commission seem to support their case. Never ones to miss a naming opportunity, Enron's playful if dishonest traders used strategies code-named Fat Boy, Ricochet, Get Shorty and Death Star to increase profits. Under the Death Star strategy, for example, traders "created" and then "relieved" phantom congestion on California's electricity grid, allowing the company to be paid handsomely "for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion." Other documents describe complex strategies of "megawatt laundering" under which the company evaded federal price caps. 
California says the documents provide reason for Washington to keep those caps in place. Indeed they do. The documents should also inspire investigators inquiring into Enron's behavior to keep pressing until they completely understand exactly what Enron was up to, and who precisely was responsible for the colorfully named strategies that burdened the state's taxpayers and its economy.

HEADLINE: Cisco Buoyed By Earnings, But It Sees No Turnaround 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 7 

 BODY:
Cisco Systems reported profits for its fiscal third quarter today that were better than expected, as belt-tightening, drastically lower costs for parts and a slight rise in sales helped the company turn around from a steep loss a year before.
 Cisco, the leading maker of Internet networking equipment, said it earned $729 million, or 10 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 27. Cisco cut its expenses nearly in half from the quarter last year, when it took a enormous charge to eliminate 5,000 jobs and had a loss of $2.7 billion, or 37 cents a share. 
 Yet the company, which is based in San Jose, Calif., predicted no quick recovery from the slowdown in spending by its customers at telecommunications providers and large corporations. 
John T. Chambers, the president and chief executive of Cisco, said he saw encouraging signs for a recovery, but he cautioned that the rapid growth that briefly made Cisco the world's most valuable company would not resume until its customers started reporting profits of their own. For the current quarter, he said sales would be about the same as or slightly better than the $4.82 billion reported today for the third quarter, which would improve upon the $4.3 billion in sales last year.
"We're not calling a turnaround, but we are seeing some early indications that are of interest to us," Mr. Chambers said, citing signs of strength in manufacturing in the United States.
Cisco shares gained 19 cents, to $13.08, in regular trading before the earnings release. Encouraged by the report, investors hurried to buy Cisco shares in after-hours trading, sending them as high as $14.80.
Cisco's sales for its third quarter were up 2 percent over last year but $40 million less than expected by Wall Street analysts. Despite the shortfall, Cisco's profits excluding one-time items exceeded expectations by 2 cents a share. 
After removing items related to acquisitions, taxes on stock options and other charges, Cisco earned 11 cents a share, nearly quadrupling its pro forma earnings last year of 3 cents.
In a sign of the effect of recent accounting questions at other companies, Cisco said today that it would abandon a synthetic lease that had moved some of the company's exposure to real estate off its balance sheet. Cisco had hired another company to own and manage some of its properties, allowing Cisco to deduct interest payments and depreciation from its taxes but keeping the property and debt off its balance sheet. Cisco will buy those properties back for $1.9 billion.
Dennis D. Powell, Cisco's vice president for corporate finance, said the synthetic lease arrangement had affected the company's earnings by less than one-tenth of a penny a share per quarter. "We simply wanted to take that concern off the table and to be able to say we did not have any off-balance-sheet transactions," he said in an interview.
Compared with a year ago, less of Cisco's revenue came from selling Internet routers and other products, but the company made up the difference through consulting and technical services.
Despite efforts to sell more high-end routers to telecommunications providers, Cisco has been unable to match the dominance it enjoys in selling midrange and low-end equipment to corporations that are setting up or upgrading networks. Cisco held 69 percent of the high-end router market in the last three months of the 2001 calendar year, compared with 95 percent of the midrange to low-end corporate router market, according to the Dell'Oro Group, a market research company.
Dell'Oro said Cisco's strength among corporations had helped it remain more profitable in the downturn than many of its rivals, which rely heavily on communications providers. In general, corporate spending on routers, although down sharply, has shown more resilience than telecommunications spending: while the corporate router market fell 24 percent, to $850 million, the telecommunications router market fell 44 percent, to $466 million, from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2000.
Companies like Juniper Networks have borne the brunt. Juniper, which counts heavily on service providers, posted a first-quarter loss of $46 million last month, as sales plunged 63 percent from the period last year.
In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Chambers highlighted the difference between Cisco's results over the last year and those of its competitors. While Cisco's revenue rose 2 percent over the last year, he said, the combined revenue of the 10 leading competitors declined 43 percent.
Paul Sagawa, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said Cisco had improved its profits through markedly better gross margins, not a rise in demand for Cisco's products. He was surprised by the stock's sharp rise in late trading.
"It's unrealistic to think Cisco is going to get any wind at its back until three months after we see any significant shift in economywide corporate earnings," he said.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: DIPLOMACY; 
Splits Over Palestinian Statehood And Arafat Role Are Unresolved

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel remained divided today about how quickly to move toward the creation of a Palestinian state and whether to deal with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Mr. Sharon's visit was abruptly broken off by news of a suicide bombing in Israel, which interrupted their Oval Office meeting and jeopardized the administration's hopes of rapidly restarting a political dialogue.
 Mr. Sharon hurriedly met Congressional leaders tonight, but canceled a planned trip to New York and prepared to fly back to Israel. Before he left, however, he made clear that retaliation was on his mind, and said: "He who rises up to kill us -- we will pre-empt it, and kill him first." 
 Before news of the attacks, Mr. Bush said that he planed to send the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, back to the Middle East to work on building a new Palestinian security force, but on a very different model from the one that Israeli forces have attempted to destroy. Beyond that, it was clear from brief public comments by the president and Mr. Sharon that their meeting today -- their fifth face-to-face encounter -- yielded little progress. 
While Administration officials described the encounter as upbeat and forward-looking -- at least before the chief of protocol slipped news of the suicide bombing into the Oval Office -- it was clear that Mr. Bush and Mr. Sharon remained sharply divided on how to approach dealings with the Palestinians.
One of those differences was cast into stark relief when the two leaders were asked today whether the creation of a Palestinian state should be the clear goal of the peace effort. Mr. Bush immediately shot back, "Yes, I haven't changed my position."
Seconds later, Mr. Sharon said it was "still premature to discuss this issue" until the Palestinian Authority was radically reformed and offered clear signs that he is still unwilling to follow the administration's lead in moving quickly to political talks. He later described in an interview a dramatically different power structure that would essentially sideline Mr. Arafat. 
In private, administration officials said they had no idea how much damage the bombing today did to the fragile movement in recent days to open up a political dialogue, or what kind of retaliation Mr. Sharon planned. But clearly the bombing was just the kind of incident White House officials feared would derail their nascent plans.
And tonight, at a news conference at which he vented his anger at the new attack, Mr. Sharon said "I did not tell the president and I did not tell the vice president what we are going to do" in response. "I have not gotten any approval whatsoever" from the White House, he said.
Israel, he said, "is an independent country -- we must exercise our right of self-defense," repeating one of Mr. Bush's favorite phrases from the days just after the last major attack on Israeli citizens over Passover.
Asked whether Mr. Bush had urged restraint, Mr. Sharon said: "This question was not raised. Nobody said it."
Despite the violence today, Mr. Sharon voiced continued support for a regional conference that "should create the needed atmosphere to continue talks." And he insisted that Mr. Arafat has the ability to halt the suicide attacks.
"I believe he's got the power to do it," he said, noting that Mr. Arafat's forces are intact in Gaza, and yet Israeli authorities have stopped two planned attacks from that area in recent days.
Even as Mr. Sharon pressed his case at the White House, Arab diplomats who have also been here for meetings this week said they were not sure the administration yet had a clear plan for moving the peace effort forward, or would press Mr. Sharon hard enough to do so.
Mr. Bush called two leaders today, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush is counting on the Arab leaders to restrain Mr. Arafat. It was unclear what was discussed in those phone calls.
But by the time Mr. Sharon arrived at the White House this afternoon, it seemed clear that Mr. Bush intended to mend fences with his Israeli counterpart, not return to open contention.
And Mr. Sharon had arrived to describe to Mr. Bush something approaching a plan -- but one that requires Mr. Arafat to relinquish any real power.
In an interview with Washington-based columnists this evening, Mr. Sharon provided some details of a peace plan he discussed with Mr. Bush.
The Israeli prime minister told William Safire of The New York Times and Jim Hoagland and Jackson Diehl of The Washington Postthat Mr. Arafat's role should be diminished within the Palestinian Authority to one of "symbolic leader," with real power turned over to a prime minister.
Mr. Sharon said a "precondition" to any political settlement would include the creation of what he called "a unified internal Palestinian security force under a suitable figure, and a prime minister, ostensibly subordinate to Arafat," but actually more powerful. He also stressed that the financial assets of the Palestinian Authority should not "be in the hands of one man."
He conceded that Mr. Arafat would likely only agree to such conditions "only if pressured" by the United States, the European Union, Russia and other Arab countries. Mr. Sharon said that he and President Bush had agreed "on the need for Palestinian reform" -- a point Mr. Bush returned to several times today -- and that the President had not urged major changes in Israel's approach. 
"I felt no pressure whatsoever," he said.
In their meeting, according to Mr. Sharon and American officials, Mr. Bush raised the issue of dismantling Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory. But the Israeli prime minister said he told Mr. Bush that such a discussion was "premature."
Mr. Sharon said his peace plan differed from previous proposals and rested on three basic principles: cessation of violence and terror, an interim phase of incremental steps before the setting of final borders, and the development of better relations between Israel and the Palestinians before any real peace accord was solidified. The Administration is taking a simiarly step-by-step approach, with officials saying there will be no major conference to set borders -- like the one President Clinton attempted at Camp David in the summer of 2000 -- anytime in the near future.
Mr. Sharon also expressed some optimism in building a new coalition for peace. He said he thought such a coalition could include Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, once that country ceased supporting what Mr. Sharon termed "terrorist operations." He said he also hoped that the coalition could include one or two of the Arab emirates and, perhaps, Morocco.
According to American officials, Mr. Sharon talked anew about the need for a regional conference to restart the peace effort. But a senior administration official who briefed reporters late this afternoon said the conference that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was trying to organize would be a modest one. 
"We see it not as a big peace conference, not as Madrid," said the official, referring to the 1991 conference that Mr. Bush's father organized.
The official said Mr. Bush "again urged the prime minister to as quickly as possible open" closed areas of the West Bank "so that the Palestinian people can go back to work and an economic life." 
The official added that Mr. Bush "talked a good deal about the promise that he believes comes with the deeper involvement of the Arab states," but Mr. Sharon's entourage had spent the last two days trying to discredit Saudi Arabia as a neutral player in these talks, saying it continued to compensate the families of suicide bombers long after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
With Mr. Bush under great pressure from the conservative wing of his own party to embrace Mr. Sharon and allow him to do whatever it takes to secure the safety of Israelis, the White House was careful to cast the two men today as the closest of friends, working through differences of tactics, not overall strategy.
But if that was the hope, the news of the bombing may well create a different reality. Even though Palestinian Authority leaders immediately condemned the attacks, any military response by Israel is bound to scuttle, at least for a time, talk of a cease-fire and the start of real political negotiations.
The two men did not discuss the attack during their meeting, an official said.
But minutes after the meeting, Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said, "Prime Minister Sharon received the word that it was, indeed, a suicide bombing" with "large-scale casualties." She said Mr. Bush was able to "personally convey his condolences to the prime minister and his party, and to register his disgust at this wanton taking of innocent life."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ENERGY MARKET; 
CALIFORNIANS CALL ENRON DOCUMENTS THE SMOKING GUN

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 7 

 BODY:
Documents showing that Enron manipulated California's power market were described today by politicians, lawyers and consumer groups as the smoking gun they needed to help recover billions of dollars they say the state was overcharged by Enron and other companies for electricity in 2000 and 2001.
 The documents -- Enron memorandums released by federal regulators on Monday -- were hailed as a windfall by state officials who have used regulatory and legal means to try to force half a dozen power-generating and marketing companies to refund at least part of the profits they made during a yearlong energy shortage. 
 Federal regulators also said today that they would investigate whether other energy-trading companies used the manipulative trading strategies described in the documents by lawyers for Enron, which is now in bankruptcy. Duke Energy, Dynegy, the Williams Companies, Mirant and Calpine were among the companies the regulators "put on notice that they must preserve all material that discusses such trading strategies, or similar trading strategies."
Enron is no longer in the trading business, but the documents and interviews with California officials indicate that when Enron was flying high, its trading strategies exploited weaknesses in the state's energy markets to the hilt. Page C1. 
The disclosure that Enron and perhaps some other trading companies used techniques that Enron code-named Death Star, Fat Boy and Get Shorty to inflate prices artificially in California's deregulated energy market appeared to vindicate a long campaign by Gov. Gray Davis. Mr. Davis, a Democrat, battled the Bush administration and federal authorities for months last year before regulators agreed to put caps on skyrocketing electricity prices.
"About $30 billion was extorted from this state," Mr. Davis said in an interview today. "Those who claimed that there was no price manipulation here were just plain wrong."
Mr. Davis said the state intended to press federal officials to use their jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act to order power companies to give back profits made from selling power and renegotiate long-term contracts signed with the state during the heat of the crisis. "I don't see how they can turn a deaf ear to our claims in light of these memos," he said.
Mr. Davis also joined California's two senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats, in calling on Attorney General John Ashcroft to start a separate criminal inquiry into Enron's trading activities. The company is already under investigation for the accounting fraud that led to its collapse late last year.
Other companies uniformly denied today that they had engaged in Enron-style trading practices. Spokesmen for several companies said that Enron was unique because it acted purely as an energy trader while other companies had made long-term commitments to build power plants in the state.
"We are confident our practices are well within all of the parameters and tariffs of the market rules," Duke said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for Williams said, "Enron and Williams are two entirely different companies."
But the Enron memos, written by an outside lawyer for the company's energy trading group, called the company's price manipulation "the oldest trick in the book" and said that "other market participants" had followed Enron's lead to inflate prices. And an official of the agency that operates California's power grid said the strategies described in Enron's memos matched suspicious behavior by many participants in the market that the agency has documented and submitted to federal regulators.
Joseph Dunn, a California state senator whose committee is investigating energy price manipulation, called the Enron memos "a jailhouse confession" and said that he would demand to see any similar memos at other companies. He said he now had fresh ammunition to refute the common claim by companies that such information must be protected under lawyer-client privilege.
Overlapping state and federal investigations and lawsuits and the possibility that regulators could order companies to return past profits sent share prices of energy companies tumbling. Shares of Dynegy, one of the largest traders and generators, fell more than 17 percent.
The major power marketers have struggled over the last few months to restore their reputations and shore up their finances, mainly by selling unprofitable assets and disclosing more about their often-opaque finances. But the Enron memos seem to have stirred doubts once more about the integrity and longevity of the industry -- and the way energy is traded.
"The whole reason for the existence of traders is to make as much money as possible, consistent with what's legal," said R. Martin Chavez, a former head of risk management in energy trading at Goldman, Sachs and chief executive of Kiodex, a risk management firm. "I lived through this: if you didn't manipulate the market and manipulation was accessible to you, that's when you were yelled at."
It was not immediately clear, however, how the Enron documents would help the state recover the billions it says it is owed. The state says its power bill rose fourfold in 2000 compared with 1999 and stayed artificially high in 2001, largely because of price manipulation.
UBS Warburg, the investment bank that bought the Enron trading operation in February, said it had no liability for any violations committed under former management.
"We did not inherit the liabilities," said David Walker, a spokesman for UBS Warburg. "What was pre-Feb. 11 is an Enron issue."
Moreover, some traders said today that the line between price manipulation and exploiting legitimate market opportunities was thin, particularly in California's nascent and flawed electricity trading market. The rules governing most electricity markets are enormously complex because they are intended to keep the power grid reliable at all hours of the day as well as to ensure low prices. Traders routinely seek to maximize their profits during periods of high demand.
"People are coming out and triangulating that through these memos the markets were manipulated," one former Enron trader said. "It's much more complex than that. California set the rules."
In fact, the California State Senate's investigation of price manipulation has uncovered evidence that traders who work for the state agency that handles the power grid, the Independent System Operator, also took advantage of market rules to move prices artificially.
"The bogeyman here is not just Enron and the power companies, but the system itself," said Jim Battin, a Republican state senator who has participated in the inquiry.
Still, people pursuing claims against the power companies greeted the Enron memos as hard, written evidence of the circumstantial suspicions that had guided their lawsuits for months.
"There has been a glacial change not only in the litigation but in the whole idea of deregulated energy markets," said Michael Aguirre, who is handling lawsuits against power companies on behalf of California's lieutenant governor and all state ratepayers. The legal actions are intended to force the return of at least $40 billion from power companies, he said.
More broadly, the Enron memos cast doubt on the skeptical approach that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney took to the state energy problems last year. Mr. Bush and his top aides repeatedly attributed high prices to regulatory and environmental barriers that they said made it difficult for energy companies to serve the market properly. They opposed any regulatory intervention to curb prices.
California's troubles were used as a prime exhibit in the administration's energy strategy, which was focused primarily on increasing the supplies of energy and which strongly endorsed deregulated markets for electricity.
Likewise, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission long played down the possibility that power generators had engaged in systematic price manipulation. The commission did two investigations of California's energy markets that produced no evidence that the companies manipulated the market.
Under its new chairman, Pat Wood, the commission began a new inquiry that has yet to reach conclusions.
Mr. Davis said today that Mr. Cheney and many other officials treated Enron "as the mothership of deregulation" and refused to look into allegations of abuse. Mr. Cheney was right that California made some mistakes in the way it managed its energy markets, Mr. Davis said. But he said that the administration took a laissez-faire approach to power markets for too long, worsening the blow to California's economy.
"It turns out we were right," Mr. Davis said. "Enron was manipulating prices to a fare-thee-well."

HEADLINE: British Start Push to Open Media Sector 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, May 8 

 BODY:
Judging by the lift that the shares of Granada and Carlton Communications got in the market today, investors like the look of the British government's proposal to scrap many restrictions on media ownership.
 The new legislation, proposed Tuesday and expected to become law within the next year, would for the first time allow owners outside the European Union, notably American companies, to buy British television and radio broadcasters like Granada and Carlton. The rules would make Britain one of the first European Union countries to open its media market fully to outsiders. 
 The government's proposal would also scrap rules that forbid joint ownership of television and radio stations. And it would pave the way for a single company to own ITV, Britain's largest commercial television network, removing the need for the present messy consortium structure, in which Granada and Carlton are the largest shareholders. 
Investment bankers said the new rules would probably touch off a heavy round of courting among media companies, both within Britain -- where a merger of Granada and Carlton is widely expected -- and across the Atlantic. AOL Time Warner, Viacom and Walt Disney have all said they want to increase their presence in Europe, and Britain would be a perfect launching pad, analysts said.
"It has always been perceived that the larger United States media groups would be interested in expanding into Europe, but have been precluded from doing so by regulation," said Mark Beilby of Deutsche Bank.
But courting is one thing and striking a deal quite another, bankers pointed out.
Many of the large American companies are feeling the pinch of tight balance sheets, and may have trouble selling multibillion-dollar acquisitions to shareholders in the current economic climate, analysts said.
The United States companies may also be preoccupied with a proposed relaxation of ownership rules in the United States, now being considered by the Federal Communications Commission.
Sooner or later, though, the new rules, which would amount to the biggest shake-up of British broadcasting ownership in decades, are sure to generate merger deals, analysts said.
How do the pieces stack up? ITV, which commands just over half of all television-related advertising, is an obvious target. But its complex ownership structure has put off past suitors. Granada and Carlton own over 90 percent of the licenses for stations that make up the network, but have been kept from merging by the existing rules.
If that ban is going to be lifted, the thinking goes, a smart acquirer would let Granada and Carlton merge and reap an estimated $:70 million ($103 million) in cost savings first, and then bid for the combined companies. Anticipating the new rules, Granada and Carlton held merger talks earlier this year; the talks broke down, in part, over issues related to ITV Digital, a unit that has since closed.
Granada shares traded in London climbed 9.6 percent, to $:1.39 ($2.04); Carlton shares climbed 7.5 percent, to $:2.72 ($3.99).
Representatives of Disney and Viacom each said their companies would look seriously at any opportunities the new rules create. AOL Time Warner declined to comment on its expansion plans in Europe.
If the Americans get to ITV first, they would sideline RTL, the large European broadcaster majority owned by Bertelsmann. RTL has had its eye on ITV for some time, and it considered making a bid for Carlton earlier this year, but the current ownership rules stood in the way. Under them, RTL would have had to sell its majority interest in Channel 5, the only other privately owned commercial television broadcaster in Britain, according to people close to the companies.
The proposed rules would spare RTL from having to choose between ITV and Channel 5, but would also let many more bidders into the game.
Any time that media ownership rules are on the table, Rupert Murdoch's name comes up. He and his News Corporation lobbied heavily for the new rules. 
Under the proposed rules, the company, which owns The Times of London and other newspapers, would be freed to own broadcasters as well. But unless RTL decides to part with its 65 percent stake in Channel 5, News Corporation's television options are few. 
United Business Media, which owns the other 35 percent of Channel 5, is a likely seller. Indeed, RTL almost bought out its partner last year, but balked at the asking price. While price is not usually a stumbling block when Mr. Murdoch wants an asset, gaining control is; a minority stake in Channel 5 would not be very attractive to him, analysts said.
That leaves radio. Again, the choices are limited. Capital Radio is the largest independently owned station in Britain; most others are part of conglomerates, or have large shareholders who are loath to sell. 
Mr. Murdoch does not appear to be concerned about the the prospect of added competition. "We welcome the overall deregulatory approach," a News Corporation spokesman said.
