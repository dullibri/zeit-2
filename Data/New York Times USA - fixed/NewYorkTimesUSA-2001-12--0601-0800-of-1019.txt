HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: POSTWAR AFGHANISTAN; 
U.S. Questions Its Share Of Reconstruction Costs

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
After bearing the multibillion-dollar cost of the war in Afghanistan, the Bush administration is now questioning how much it will contribute to the United Nations reconstruction effort in that country. 
 Officials said the administration was considering paying less than the United States has customarily contributed to postwar reconstruction costs in other countries, but members of Congress and the State Department are arguing to keep the American contribution as generous as possible. 
 Since the end of the cold war, the United States has underwritten large portions of peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts in the Balkans, Cambodia, Mozambique and many other countries. But the cost of fighting the war in Afghanistan has already cost tens of billions of dollars. 
"We will look at Afghanistan in its entirety -- the fact that we've made a uniquely large contribution so far -- and we will contribute appropriately," a senior White House official said.
He added: "We do have a role to play -- we do not want to be the people who do the bombing and leave the reconstruction to others."
The price, by World Bank estimates, could be more than $10 billion for the first five years alone, to rebuild schools and roads and communications systems, create a health system, attack the narcotics problem and underwrite the new government, especially the police and justice system to ensure the rule of law.
Typically, the United States contributes one-fourth of a peacekeeping mission's costs and has contributed up to one-third of reconstruction costs. Senior European and United Nations officials said they had assumed that the United States would pay up to one-third of the reconstruction costs, with Europe paying one-third and the rest of the world, led by Japan, picking up the final third. 
"It has been an unwritten assumption that this would happen, but we would not complain if the United States maybe gave less," said a European official.
As officials prepare for a top-level meeting later this week in Brussels to discuss reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, the federal Agency for International Development is drawing up the American plans that will be considered there. 
As a candidate and then as president, Mr. Bush has showed little enthusiasm for rebuilding other nations, an ideological bent that officials say plays into the debate within the administration over the American role in postwar Afghanistan.
For the president, the top priority of reconstruction is to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a terrorist haven. Officials drawing up the American plans say that means immediate assistance to demobilized soldiers, helping them return to the countryside as farmers and animal herders instead of reverting to lawlessness that would undermine the nascent Afghan interim government.
"We've already started planning to ship seed for the next spring planting and live animals to restore the loss of huge portions of the sheep and goat herds," said Andrew S. Natsios, administrator for the Agency for International Development.
After 20 years of war, the country is so threadbare that the United Nations put together an emergency $20 million fund to underwrite the interim government, providing desks, computers, telephones and salaries. 
"This is all part of a broader political message that however long it takes, we are committed to a stable, democratic government," said Mark Malloch Brown of the United Nations Development Program, who will oversee the reconstruction. 
The Arab and Muslim worlds, including many countries that are part of the coalition, are watching to see if the United States holds to its promise that it is fighting terrorism in Afghanistan and not fighting the Afghan people. 
And like a mantra, administration officials have said they have learned from the Soviets' war in Afghanistan and will not abandon the country this time.
To prove that point, administration officials point to the president's contribution of an additional $320 million in food and other relief aid to Afghanistan during the war and to the United States' record as the largest foreign donor to Afghanistan even before Sept. 11.
And at this stage of the conflict, the president plans to stay the course, even though he has yet to decide how much money the United States will contribute, said his spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
"Given how involved the United States has been in feeding the Afghan people, the president believes it is the right thing for the United States to remain politically engaged and to help with the reconstruction of Afghanistan," Mr. Fleischer said today.
Yet even as relief operations are spreading across Afghanistan and reconstruction plans begin, the administration continues to make the war effort its top priority. 
The Pentagon insists that Gen. Tommy Franks at Central Command has the ultimate say over coordinating civilian and military operations on the ground.
"This is going to be an overlapping effort," said Joseph J. Collins, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for peacekeeping and relief assistance. "Our first priority is to insure noninterference in the war."

HEADLINE: Terrorism and Poverty 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Give the Afghans a Hand," by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Dec. 14):
 Mr. Kristof has good suggestions for improving that impoverished war region to help stem terrorism, but he does not note that many of today's terrorists are not poor. 
 It is a myth that terrorism is born out of communities with hopeless economic opportunity. Timothy McVeigh was a middle-class young man in a country with a booming economy. Osama bin Laden's father built one of the largest non-oil businesses in Saudi Arabia and left his son millions. Many of Osama bin Laden's closest associates are from well-to-do families or are highly educated doctors, businessmen and clerics.
Will free trade help Afghanistan recover and remove one reason for its citizens' attraction to terrorism? You bet. Will it prevent new terrorists? No way. The way to do that is through vigilance, deterrence and better education of those likely to be lured into terrorism. If terrorists have no safe harbors, they will perish at sea.

HEADLINE: Energy Industry Shudders Again After Downgrade of Dynegy Debt 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
The financial crisis afflicting the electricity and natural gas industry deepened yesterday as investors were unnerved by a credit downgrade on Dynegy, a leading power trader.
 After markets closed Friday, Moody's Investors Service, a credit agency, lowered its rating on Dynegy's bonds to its lowest investment-grade rung. Hoping to restore Wall Street's confidence, Dynegy said yesterday morning that it would trim spending next year, reduce debt and raise cash by selling new shares. 
 Dynegy said it remained on firm financial footing, but warned that its earnings per share next year would be 10 percent lower than analysts had predicted. 
But investors remained concerned about the downgrade. Shares in Dynegy and other energy companies tumbled yesterday, continuing a slide that began last month with the collapse of Enron, once the world's largest power and natural gas trader.
Over the last two years, Dynegy and its peers have raised tens of billions of dollars to build new power plants, tapping investors giddy about high electricity and gas prices. Today, prices for power have plunged, and investors are worried about the possibility of an electricity glut and the heavy debt loads carried by many energy companies.
Wall Street's sudden wariness has led Dynegy and other independent power plant operators to cancel plans for new plants. More cuts from other companies may follow, analysts say, as the industry struggles to shore up its balance sheet.
"This is indicative of an industrywide trend," said Carol Coale, analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston. "For a long time, this industry has been carrying leverage that I have been uncomfortable with."
Already, Wall Street has almost halted the sale of stock by merchant energy companies. Since the end of August, this industry group has only sold about $500 million of equity, compared with almost $7 billion in the first eight months of the year, according to Thomson Financial. Last year, the sector sold about $6 billion in stock.
The long-term impact of the industry's capital squeeze is unclear. Despite widespread investor fears of a power glut, analysts say a few states, including New York, Florida and California, may eventually face a power shortfall if new plants are not constructed. Earlier this year, a severe electricity shortage in California led to occasional blackouts, but those prices collapsed this summer.
Analysts like Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Company in Houston had expected about 150,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity to be added nationwide from this year to 2005. But now he says that total will probably end up closer to 100,000 megawatts. 
Most plants not already financed and under construction have been taken off the drawing board, he said. Currently, the nation has close to 800,000 megawatts of capacity. One megawatt is enough to supply about 800 typical homes.
But the immediate crisis the industry faces is financial, not electrical.
Dynegy shares plunged $3.24, or 13 percent, to $21.70, yesterday. The company's stock has lost 21.9 percent of its value over the last week. Shares of Mirant, which owns independent power plants worldwide, fell 15 percent yesterday and have collapsed 40.5 percent over the last week. Other natural gas and electric companies, including the El Paso Corporation and Calpine, also fell.
Dynegy said yesterday that it would sell $375 million in assets next year and reduce its capital spending by an additional $375 million. The company also plans to sell $500 million in stock next summer. Dynegy said that dilution from the stock sale and lower natural gas and oil prices would cause its earnings to be only $2.30 to $2.35 a share next year, compared with a previous estimate of $2.50 to $2.60.
"Dynegy is moving forward with a permanent plan, utilizing our existing business model, that addresses market concerns, increases our capital strength, and reduces our debt," said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman, in a statement announcing the restructuring effort. Dynegy said that ChevronTexaco, its largest shareholder, supports the plan. ChevronTexaco, the second-largest United States oil company, owns 35 percent of Dynegy's stock.
Chris Gidez, a spokesman for ChevronTexaco, said ChevronTexaco does support Dynegy's effort. But he said ChevronTexaco has not decided whether to buy more Dynegy shares in the company's stock offering next year. Last month, ChevronTexaco injected $1.5 billion into Dynegy as part of Dynegy's failed effort to buy Enron.
"We're evaluating it," Mr. Gidez said of the offering.
After Moody's downgrade, analysts said they worried that Dynegy's credit ratings could be cut further, forcing the company to repay its debts early or post hundreds of millions of dollars in collateral to its trading partners.
"There's a risk that they could get downgraded to junk status," said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group in New York, who cut his rating on Dynegy from strong buy to hold yesterday morning. "It would be a pretty material event. The core trading business is very dependent on your credit rating."
Ms. Coale said she was concerned because Dynegy had said that it might have to pay back a portion of its debt immediately if its credit ratings were cut to noninvestment grade, or junk, status. Previously the company had said that it did not face a credit rating trigger, she said.
"Are there ratings triggers or aren't there?" she said.
Meg Nollen, Dynegy's senior vice president for investor relations, said Dynegy had one loan of about $250 million that it might have to pay back immediately if it received a junk rating from two of the three major credit agencies. The company has cash and credit lines of $900 million, more than enough to repay that loan.
Dynegy's stock was also hurt yesterday by an incorrect report from an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase, Ms. Nollen said. J. P. Morgan has withdrawn the report, she added.
The report mistakenly said that Dynegy's credit rating had fallen "below junk, which would mean we were bankrupt," Ms. Nollen said. "They made a mistake, they discovered it, and they're going to fix it."
Anatol Feygin, the J. P. Morgan analyst who covers Dynegy, did not return calls for comment.

Legislation on 401(k)'s
 In an effort to address another aspect of Enron's collapse, legislation is expected to be introduced in Congress today aimed at reducing how concentrated employees' 401(k) retirement plans can be in any single investment. The legislation is expected to be introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, and Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey.
As Enron's shares fell 99 percent this year, its employees' 401(k) plans lost, on average, over half their value -- a total of about $1.2 billion -- because of the high proportion of Enron stock in the plans. 
In the last two years, workers at other large companies who had much of their retirement assets in company stock have also seen their nest eggs shrivel.

 From a War to a Manhunt

TRACKING BIN LADEN -- Hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters have fled the caves of Tora Bora into the snow-capped mountains on the border with Pakistan, and Osama bin Laden may be among them, according to United States intelligence officials, who acknowledged that they had lost track of him. The officials thought they had a bead on Mr. bin Laden's location until sometime Saturday, when radio traffic and other communications they had been intercepting between Al Qaeda leaders dried up. A1

THE STRATEGY -- The United States' dependence on proxy forces in the Afghan war has been a calculated decision that has generally worked well. But the limitations of this policy are also becoming clear. The differing war aims of the United States and the anti-Taliban opposition, which have percolated below the surface, are now in the open. A1

CLEARING MINES -- More than 400 demolition specialists from Halo Trust, a British organization, are scheduled to resume mine-clearing operations on Wednesday in northern Afghanistan, where hidden explosives in the soil and roads make it one of the world's most heavily mined areas. B1

CAPTURING AL QAEDA -- United States officials identified a Saudi man as the highest-ranking Al Qaeda official to have been captured in Afghanistan and taken into American custody. The man, Abdul Aziz, is an official with the WAFA Humanitarian Organization, a Saudi-based Islamic group that the United States alleges has funneled money to Al Qaeda. B3

What to Do About Iraq

FROM KABUL TO BAGHDAD -- The State Department and the Pentagon are considering ways to drive President Saddam Hussein from power, as the notion of expanding the war on terrorism to Iraq gains ground within the administration and among some allies in the Muslim world. A1

ARAB HESITANCE -- Many Arab officials in the Middle East say an American attack on Iraq could enhance the perception in the Arab world that the United States was making Muslims its target and thus unravel the reluctant Arab support for dismantling Al Qaeda. B4

THE PRISONERS -- Officials of the International Committee for the Red Cross said visits to more than a dozen cities and reports from around the country suggested that thousands of fighters and Taliban members were being held prisoner in Afghanistan. B4

Fugitive Fighters

TALIBAN LEADER -- An intelligence director in southern Afghanistan said Mullah Muhammad Omar was hiding in mountains near the town of Baghran, about 100 miles northwest of Kandahar. The director, Haji Gullalai, said Mullah Omar was accompanied by at least 400 soldiers. B2

IN KANDAHAR -- Nine wounded foreign fighters escaped from a hospital and eluded Afghan militia and American special forces that were scouring the city. Officials said nine other fighters who remained at the hospital were still threatening to explode their grenades at the first sign of trouble. Doctors and nurses have been treating them, despite the threats. B2

Lawyers and the Accused

THE SUSPECT -- The two lawyers chosen to defend Zacarias Moussaoui, the only suspect indicted so far in the events of Sept. 11, said the case would probably mean upheaval in their professional lives, possibly for years. The lawyers, Gerald Zerkin and Frank W. Dunham Jr., also said they were girding themselves for a trial that had the potential to turn into a news media circus. B1

IN KOSOVO -- NATO troops raided the offices of an American charity that the Bush administration has said is linked to fund-raising efforts for Al Qaeda. The charity, the Global Relief Foundation, based outside Chicago, raises millions of dollars each year for Muslim nations and territories, including Kosovo. It has denied any connection to terrorists. B6

IN MICHIGAN -- A Muslim leader on the board of a relief agency accused by the government of contributing to terrorists was arrested on Friday in his Ann Arbor home on an immigration violation, his wife said. The I.N.S. would neither confirm nor deny that the leader, Rabih Haddad, was being held. The government has frozen the assets of the agency, Global Relief Foundation, based in Bridgeview, Ill. Mr. Haddad's tourist visa has expired, but his application for permanent residency is pending. B6

IN LONDON -- A Saudi businessman and two Egyptians lost a three-year battle to avoid extradition to New York to stand trial on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in bombing American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. B6

SMALLPOX THREAT -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began training state and local health officials on how to recognize smallpox and quickly contain an outbreak spread by terrorists. B6

Stability and Access

THE EMBASSY -- The American Embassy building reopened in Kabul, and James F. Dobbins, Washington's special envoy to Afghanistan, pledged the international community's support for reconstructing Afghanistan. The United States closed the embassy nearly 13 years ago because of safety concerns during the Afghan civil war. B1

THE REBUILDING -- After bearing the multibillion-dollar cost of the war in Afghanistan, the Bush administration is considering paying less to the reconstruction effort there than the United States has customarily contributed to reconstruction costs in other countries. Members of Congress and the State Department are arguing to keep the American contribution as generous as possible. B5

PEACEKEEPING -- Prime Minister Tony Blair told the House of Commons that the first of the 1,500 British troops that will lead the international peacekeeping force in Kabul should arrive on Saturday, when the interim government is to be inducted. B5

WALKER'S LAWYER -- The lawyer for John Walker Lindh, the Californian found with Taliban fighters, said the government was violating his rights by not allowing him access to his lawyer, and demanded to meet with his client. Walker is being held on a ship in the Arabian Sea. B5

Coping with Disaster

THE HOMELESS -- With unemployment rising and housing costs still high, cities around the country are experiencing a surge in homelessness. Some experts say some aspects of the problem seem related to the terror attacks. A1

HIT HARD -- Sixty people associated with Xavier High School -- alumni, as well as relatives of students, faculty and staff members -- were killed in the trade center attack. The school, on Manhattan's West Side, is a wounded place that is coping, in specific, regular and reliable ways. A1

IMMIGRANT VICTIMS -- A coalition of immigrant groups, labor unions and religious organizations is urging Congress to grant legal status to the widows and children of several dozen illegal immigrants who died in the trade center disaster. The families' undocumented status makes it hard to collect benefits. B7

LANDMARKS REOPEN -- Ellis Island and Liberty Island, closed since Sept. 11, will reopen on Thursday, though the Statue of Liberty will remain closed, at least until the end of the year. B7

LONE STAR SAYS IT CANNOT COMPLETE DEAL WITH CARGILL

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Lone Star Technologies Inc., a maker of pipe used in oil and gas drilling, said it had not been able to arrange financing for a $430 million purchase of the steel-tube-making unit of Cargill Inc. Investors are reluctant to buy the bonds and new stock that Lone Star planned to issue to finance the purchase because of falling demand for the company's seamless pipes among drillers, analysts said. 
Interest rates on some types of high-yield debt have soared 40 percent since the deal was announced four months ago, driving up financing costs. Cargill has filed a lawsuit charging Lone Star with breaching their agreement and seeking unspecified damages, said Greg Lauser, a spokesman for Cargill, which is based in Wayzata, Minn. Lone Star officials did not return calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Parties Press Effort to Pass Stimulus Plan 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats headed into the final steps of their negotiations over an economic recovery package today, seeking a final round of talks even as they pursued strategies to blame each other if they failed.
 Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the majority leader, called President Bush and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, in an effort to break the latest deadlock in the negotiations. 
 Representative Bill Thomas of California, a lead negotiator for Congressional Republicans, tried to split the Democrats in the Senate by negotiating with moderates like Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana. Mr. Thomas's aides said he was trying to come up with a compromise bill that could pass the Republican-controlled House and also command the 60 votes needed to overcome procedural hurdles in the Democratic-controlled Senate. 
Republicans are pressing for income tax cuts that Democratic leaders say would be fiscally irresponsible and overly generous to upper-income people. Democrats are insisting on expanded unemployment benefits, including new assistance to help jobless people retain or buy health insurance, that Republicans criticize as an expensive new entitlement program.
Democratic aides said Mr. Daschle told the president and Mr. Hastert that it was time for the two parties to compromise. Mr. Daschle made clear, they said, that the most important issue for Democrats was helping jobless people, and he said it was time for Republicans to make clear precisely which issues were vital to them.
Mr. Daschle and Mr. Hastert, along with Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the minority leader, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, planned to meet with the president at the White House on Tuesday.
Mr. Thomas hinted today that he would bring a new bill to the House floor this week if he thought it stood a chance of also passing the Senate with help from moderate Democrats.

HEADLINE: Britain Urges U.S. to Expand Worldwide Antipoverty Programs 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
As the war in Afghanistan nears a possible conclusion, Britain is putting increasing pressure on the United States to follow the fighting with a worldwide antipoverty program unmatched in scale since the rebuilding of Europe after World War II.
 Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, lobbied Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill today to increase spending on antipoverty programs globally by $50 billion annually. Mr. Brown said the increase -- a doubling of all foreign aid -- should underwrite a new Marshall Plan to improve education and health for the world's poorest people. 
 The United States spends much less on development aid as a percentage of its total economic output than Japan and European nations do. While the Bush administration is likely to devote hundreds of millions of dollars to support economic growth under a new government in Afghanistan, it shows no sign of backing a large-scale increase in foreign aid generally.
Mr. Brown said today that he was confident that he would be able to persuade both the administration and Congress to contribute more to antipoverty efforts because the terrorist assaults indicated a possible link between problems in the developing world and the safety of people in the industrialized countries.
"Today what happens to the poorest person in the poorest country can affect the richest person in the richest country," he said. "Peace in Afghanistan could be the opportunity for a new relationship between developed and developing countries."
Mr. Brown acknowledged that the United States had not offered much support for his plan. But he said he hoped to demonstrate that some well-crafted antipoverty programs now being carried out through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund could be good models for development assistance.
The idea of expanding development aid has gained modest support from some other wealthy nations, including several European countries and Canada, as well as from the United Nations. 
The movement has gained momentum, at least in part, because world development statistics show that the least-developed countries in Africa and Latin America have made relatively little progress toward eliminating poverty even as the economies of the wealthiest countries grew rapidly during the 1990's.
The Marshall Plan, proposed by former Secretary of State George C. Marshall in 1947, devoted about $13 billion in aid to help rebuild Europe after World War II. In current dollars, the program would amount to about $88 billion, or about the same amount the entire world spends on all kinds of aid programs annually.
Bush administration officials have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of many such aid programs and have often argued against providing more money through traditional lending agencies.
President Bush urged the World Bank to provide more grants instead of loans to the poorest nations, arguing that poor countries are overly indebted. But he declined to provide more money to finance the grants, which would reduce the amount of money the World Bank has to lend to other countries in the future.
Michelle Davis, a Treasury spokeswoman, said Mr. O'Neill was more focused on achieving results in development programs than increasing aid. "The entire nation will become more supportive of foreign aid when we see results," she said.

HEADLINE: Republic New York Pleads Guilty to Securities Fraud 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Republic New York Corporation pleaded guilty to fraud in federal court yesterday and agreed to pay $606 million in restitution for its role in a scheme that cost Japanese investors millions of dollars. 
 Lawyers for the Republic New York Securities Corporation, the company's securities arm, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities and commodities fraud before Judge Richard C. Casey of the United States District Court in Manhattan. 
 In its plea, the company acknowledged that some of its employees overstated the value of assets in the accounts of Martin A. Armstrong, the New Jersey investment adviser who is awaiting trial on charges that he cheated Japanese investors. Those fake account statements covered up huge losses and allowed Mr. Armstrong to commingle client money to advance his scheme, prosecutors contend. 
A grand jury indicted Mr. Armstrong in the fall of 1999, accusing him and his firm, Princeton Economics International Inc., of cheating Japanese investors out of about $750 million in the 1990's. 
Mr. Armstrong has been in jail since January 2000 on civil contempt charges stemming from a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The judge in the civil case ordered him held for failing to turn over all company assets. 
Republic Securities was fined $5 million yesterday by the C.F.T.C. for its role in the scheme. The S.E.C. revoked the firm's registration as a broker-dealer. 
Republic, which was sold to HSBC Holdings of Britain in 1999, was the custodian for securities that Mr. Armstrong's firm sold. The firm agreed to pay $606 million even though its securities unit generated only $35 million in revenue through the four-year scheme, which prosecutors say began in 1995 when Mr. Armstrong transferred his accounts from Prudential Securities. 
HSBC has set aside $654 million to settle claims brought by investors. 
News of the restitution payment cheered investors. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, HSBC's American depository receipts gained $1.03, to $61.60. 
As described in a 35-page court filing by prosecutors, Republic's role in the scheme began in March 1995, when Mr. Armstrong opened 36 brokerage accounts and deposited $350 million with the securities unit. It continued until September 1999. By then, Mr. Armstrong had deposited more than $3 billion with Republic in 450 separate accounts. 
According to the filing, investors received notes issued by Mr. Armstrong's firm on the belief that their money was being invested in United States government securities. In reality, Mr. Armstrong used the money to speculate in futures and commodities markets, where he lost millions of dollars. 
Soon, Mr. Armstrong was using proceeds from the sale of new Princeton notes to pay off old Princeton notes as they came due. Republic officials discovered the scheme and agreed to aid Mr. Armstrong by issuing bogus account statements.
Mr. Armstrong is the only individual who has been indicted so far in the United States. Two people face charges in Japan. 
The government's investigation is continuing. 
HSBC renegotiated the price it had agreed to pay for Republic after Mr. Armstrong was indicted, to $9.85 billion from $10.3 billion.
Republic New York was founded in 1966 by Edmund J. Safra, the Lebanese billionaire.

HEADLINE: Dimming Prospects for Farm Reform 

 BODY:
Next September the 1996 farm bill, the Freedom to Farm Act, expires. It was a failure in almost every respect. It promised to reform a system of federal farm subsidies that had grown larger, more complicated and less equitable with every passing farm bill. But the good intentions behind that bill were trumped every year by emergency appropriations that essentially continued the old way of doing business and in many cases made that old way actually worse. As it stands, the structure of farm subsidies in this country ensures that Washington will continue giving billions of dollars to large, wealthy farming corporations whether or not that is good for consumers, the soil, the water or the health of rural communities. 
 Both the House and Senate want to have the next farm bill done before the 2002 Christmas recess. In October the House, by a slim margin, passed its version -- a boon to big commodity farmers -- after narrowly defeating a bill that offered a real prospect of meaningful change in the way agriculture is supported. Now the Senate is in the last stages of passing its version. The bill most likely to succeed, sponsored by Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, contains significant new money for important conservation programs and nutrition. But unless amendments aimed at limiting federal payments win approval on the Senate floor, the subsidy machine that has rewarded America's biggest farmers and helped put smaller ones out of business will basically keep going without interruption. 
 The Senate is unlikely to approve sharp limitations on the old subsidies. But that is not out of the question. One reason is a Web site compiled by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization in Washington, showing in graphic detail how the traditional subsidy programs reward mainly the big farmers in a handful of states, with payments running into the millions of dollars. Average citizens who check the site might wonder why fewer than 10 percent of the farmers in California, New Jersey and Florida get help from federal subsidies, while 70 percent or more of the farmers in Iowa and North and South Dakota are taken care of. This has greatly embarrassed farm-state senators, who are suddenly showing concern for the little guy. Senator Harkin is attempting to protect the corporate farming subsidies by adding provisions that help the nation as a whole. But there is still a long way to go before the program is either fair or economically sensible.
Legislators who ordinarily view the farm bill merely as a test of party loyalty have begun to examine seriously the effects of farm subsidies. The conservation incentives in the Harkin bill reflect some of these new concerns. They would be available to farmers everywhere and not just the big players. Moreover, there is in both houses the beginning of a progressive coalition that may in time challenge the leadership of the entrenched warriors of big agriculture and big subsidies.
Whether the forces of enlightenment can prevail on the Senate floor this week, and turn the Harkin bill into something truly transforming, remains to be seen. But even if they fail, they will have produced a better bill than the retrograde measure passed by the House. Their obligation will be to make sure that their version prevails in the conference committee, and prepare to continue the fight for real reform in the future.

HEADLINE: Lobby Groups Find Congress In Giving Mood 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Congress is dispensing last-minute legislative favors before it adjourns for the year, and lobbyists for special interests have lined up with a long list of requests, some of which raise major questions about the proper role of government in a weak economy.
 Flight schools, skydiving companies, manufacturers of small aircraft and operators of small airports are seeking a $7.5 billion package of grants and loans to compensate them for business lost since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. A House subcommittee approved the legislation, the General Aviation Reparations Act, last week. 
 Shipbuilders, having just won an increase in the federal subsidies that President Bush tried to abolish, are now asking Congress to defer income taxes they owe on payments for the building of Navy ships. 
Not every proposal will become law, but some have been enacted and others are well on their way.
Boeing, for example, has persuaded the Senate to approve a plan under which the Air Force would lease 100 new wide-body Boeing jets for use as refueling tankers, at a cost of $20 million a year for each plane -- up to $20 billion over 10 years. House and Senate negotiators are expected to endorse the plan this week.
The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association is lobbying Congress to limit the liability of health insurance companies that review and pay claims for the federal Medicare program. The House last week passed legislation that grants some but not all of the insurers' request, and they are pressing their case in the Senate.
Southern growers of catfish have persuaded Congress to restrict imports of similar fish from Vietnam.
A cellphone company, NextWave Telecom Inc., is urging Congress to authorize a cash payment of $5.8 billion to the company to help settle litigation over cellular licenses that it obtained in 1996 and 1997. NextWave, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998, and its investors have deployed a small army of lawyers and lobbyists to persuade Congress to ratify the deal. Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, represents a large group of investors.
NextWave says Congress must act by Dec. 31 or the deal could fall apart. The Bush administration says the settlement is in the public interest because it would transfer the NextWave licenses to other mobile phone companies that could use them to improve wireless services. 
But Senators Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the panel, denounced the proposal as special-interest legislation.
"This thing is an outrage," Mr. Hollings said. "They've put a gun to our heads and said, 'Do it by Dec. 31.' " Mr. McCain said Congress was being asked to make "ransom payments" to benefit NextWave and its investors, executives and lobbyists. 
Several factors help explain the large number of proposals for aid. Congress is in session later than it has been in years and has become an inviting target for lobbyists. The economy was soft before Sept. 11, but the events of that day have galvanized industries into action.
The travel industry is one of many seeking federal aid in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Representative John Shadegg, a conservative Republican from Arizona, is pushing the Travel America Now Act, which would allow a $500 tax credit for personal travel expenses. Representative Patsy T. Mink, a liberal Democrat from Hawaii, has introduced a bill that would allow people to take tax deductions for travel to destinations at least 500 miles from home.
"People are not traveling," Ms. Mink said. "Congress needs to give the public incentives to travel."
The reparations bill, approved last week by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, would provide $2.5 billion in grants and $5 billion in loan guarantees for "general aviation entities," including aircraft manufacturers, flight schools and skydiving companies.
Lobbyists for these companies cite a $15 billion aid package for airlines, signed by Mr. Bush on Sept. 22, as a precedent, and their message is being heard on Capitol Hill.
"Congress acted swiftly to provide the major airlines with needed relief to keep that industry going," said Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, the author of the bill approved last week. "Now it should do the same for general aviation."
Edward Scott, director of government relations for the United States Parachute Association, said skydive operators suffered financial losses because they were grounded for more than a week in September. "They deserve eligibility for federal financial assistance," Mr. Scott said. 
Insurance lobbyists helped write the legislation that limits the liability of their employees, who review and pay Medicare claims filed by doctors and hospitals. The House Energy and Commerce Committee drafted the bill in September but made changes to address concerns of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
The legislation authorizes the government to reimburse insurance companies for damages, settlements and legal expenses incurred in lawsuits related to their work as Medicare contractors. The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, Janet Rehnquist, objected to some of the language in the bill, saying it "would not fully protect the Medicare trust fund from misconduct" by contractors.
At least eight Medicare contractors have paid more than $275 million to the government to settle charges that they made improper payments, altered documents, hid files and backdated records.
The new Air Force program to lease aircraft from Boeing is included in the Defense Department appropriations bill. "In this bill," Mr. McCain said, "we find a sweet deal for the Boeing Company that I'm sure is the envy of corporate lobbyists."
But Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, where Boeing has major production plants, said the arrangement was entirely defensible. She said the deal would not only help Boeing, which has laid off thousands since Sept. 11, but also enable the Air Force to replace an aging fleet of KC-135 tanker aircraft, used heavily in the war in Afghanistan. 
The agriculture appropriations bill, signed by Mr. Bush on Nov. 28, severely restricts the import of Vietnamese fish that compete with American catfish. Lawmakers from Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana say Vietnamese basa fish are being dumped on the market.
Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, said the Food and Drug Administration had improperly let basa fish be labeled and sold as catfish. "The American consumer is being purposefully confused, and our domestic farm-raised catfish industries are on the brink of bankruptcy due in large part to the massive exports from Vietnam," he said. 
Mr. McCain said the import restrictions had been slipped into the bill at the behest of "wealthy catfish growers" in the United States and were "a troubling example of the parochialism we have urged the Vietnamese government to abandon" in its trade policy.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Is Changing Strategies On U.S. Aid 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg has been quietly lobbying Republican lawmakers and the White House to sign off on financial aid packages to help New York recover from the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, even though the current mayor has said that New York does not need any more money this fiscal year. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's actions are striking because they demonstrate both how useful the New York delegation hopes this newly minted Republican can be to them and how the mayor-elect is subtly but pointedly parting ways from the sitting mayor, both in priorities and in management style. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said local lawmakers should stop trying to get more money immediately from Washington, saying enough has already flowed in from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, to reimburse the city for the current costs of cleaning up the attack site. 
Mr. Bloomberg has politely ignored Mr. Giuliani's views on the matter, just as he has courteously declined the resumes of many of the mayor's commissioners and key aides and chosen not to solicit much advice on policy and specific issues.
Last week, as he appointed his corporation counsel and a deputy mayor for legal affairs, Mr. Bloomberg said he would diverge from Mr. Giuliani's style in another key way. "I think some things that the past mayor took to court would not be things that I would take to court," Mr. Bloomberg said, declining to be specific. Although Mr. Bloomberg takes pains to praise the Giuliani administration for all the help it has provided on the transition, several people close to Mr. Giuliani say Mr. Bloomberg and his staff members have rarely called.
In Mr. Bloomberg, both Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have found a compelling ally, someone who shares their political tendencies but who can also call on lawmakers in his own political party, lawmakers who know the value of having one of their own in charge of New York City. "I am really impressed by his willingness to work with us and others before he is even sworn in as mayor," Senator Clinton said yesterday. "He is very persuasive."
As for Mr. Bloomberg's working relations with Mr. Giuliani, whose endorsement helped him win the election, his staff members are quick to compliment the mayor but say their man now has to go his own way, especially on matters of economic recovery for the city. "Rudy has to do what he has to do to balance this year's budget and shut down his administration," said one of Mr. Bloomberg's aides. "Mike is the one who needs the money."
To help the senators, whom he speaks with at least once a week, Mr. Bloomberg has placed calls to House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert; to his friend and ally, Senator John McCain of Arizona; to Trent Lott, the Senate minority leader; and to White House officials, asking them not to forget the city whose helm he is about to hold. He has also consulted a former senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, asking him to call leaders in the Appropriations Committee on which he served for more than 10 years. House Republicans, many of whom have grown skeptical about giving large sums to New York, are crucial to gaining the most funds. 
"They asked for ideas and they sought advice," said Mr. D'Amato, a Republican who is now managing director of Park Strategies, a business development and consulting firm. "I want to do everything I can. I think that is something every New Yorker wants to do." He said he also consulted his former colleague in the Senate, Bob Kerrey, because he knew Mr. Bloomberg's aides had asked him for advice as well. Mr. Kerrey is now president of the New School University, in Manhattan.
Mr. D'Amato said that he would advise on the city's priorities for spending and would help focus New York's request with his former colleagues but that he would not be paid for his help. 
Mr. Bloomberg has asked Republicans to be generous as they consider two economic aid bills currently in committee. The two packages -- one an economic stimulus bill and the other an appropriation that offers money to states where the terrorists attacked -- have been bogged down in partisan fighting and general disagreements about how much New York really needs. Currently, a Senate version of a bill that promised $20 billion to the victimized states earmarks $12.5 billion for New York; the House version comes closer to $10 billion.
It is not the first time Mr. Bloomberg has been in touch with Washington leaders. Right after he was elected, he flew to Washington and met with leaders from both parties, including Mr. Lott, Mr. Hastert and Vice President Dick Cheney, who was examining a map of Afghanistan when Mr. Bloomberg walked in. John Feehery, a spokesman for Mr. Hastert, said, "The speaker told him he would do everything he can." 
Mr. Bloomberg has also suggested to Gov. George E. Pataki that the city and state hire a lobbying firm to represent them in Washington. The Giuliani administration has been content to lobby more or less independently, which led to problems when the state sought far more aid than the city.
Further, the House and Senate were locked in what seemed to be intractable negotiations over tucking a clause into the airline security bill that would limit the liabilities against New York in lawsuits. Senator Clinton called Mr. Bloomberg at home at midnight, and, she said, he amiably agreed to make calls to Republicans to help get the matter moved along. The efforts of both senators, aided by members of Mr. Giuliani's team and by Mr. Bloomberg, yielded a 3 a.m. agreement limiting damages against New York City arising from the Sept. 11 attacks.
Whereas the current mayor tends to pursue his goals by rolling over anyone who gets in his way, Mr. Bloomberg uses a deal-maker's charm to try to build relationships, according to several of his aides and to Senators Clinton and Schumer. Although ideological Republicans may have no use for him, those who are simply trying to build up their party have been open and even welcoming to the former businessman. 
"I think him being a Republican probably has had an effect," Senator Schumer said yesterday. "He is a quick study and has spent a great deal of time on this, and I think especially to Republicans it makes an impression."

HEADLINE: The Hidden Enemies 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: ALI KHUJA, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Abdul Taher is a slight 14-year-old farm boy facing a choice that would baffle any grown-up: Should he risk starvation or risk having his leg blown off by a land mine?
 His family lives in this village 30 miles north of Kabul, in an area that is heavily mined, so it would be crazy to walk through the family's farmland, even after such primitive Afghan-style mine-clearing methods as driving a flock of sheep through first. (This is a tough country for livestock as well as humans.) 
 Yet the family has to eat, and the only way to get food is to work the land -- even if every step is dangerous. This makes the problem of land mines central to any discussion of Afghanistan's future, for the mines are a critical impediment to the country's recovery. Long after Osama bin Laden is buried, after a new government is presiding over Afghanistan's reconstruction, land mines will continue to haunt this country. 
The Bush administration is now conducting an interagency review to determine its policy on land mines, and every signal is that it will pull back from President Bill Clinton's quasi-pledge to join the international ban on antipersonnel mines by 2006. Instead of belatedly joining the Ottawa Convention to ban mines, we seem determined to walk away from it.
The outcome of the review on land mines will help determine how many children lose their legs and lives in the coming decades, how many countries find their economic recovery blocked by buried mines. This is an area where we have a strong national interest, as well as a humanitarian interest, in playing a leadership role to help evict land mines from the arsenal of wars, and yet Pentagon complacency and President Bush's allergy to treaties together make it very likely that we will be part of the problem rather than the solution. 
The laying of mines is the 21st-century equivalent of what the Romans did to Carthage: plow salt into the ground so that it could never again sustain a population. The number of mines in Afghanistan is usually wildly exaggerated, because estimates come from nongovernment organizations trying to raise money to clear them (figures of 10 million are sometimes thrown about, when a more careful extrapolation from areas that have been cleared suggests fewer than one million, perhaps only 300,000). But still, whatever the exaggerations, on average three Afghans a day are maimed or killed by mines.
To clear a mine, a worker waves a metal detector over the ground until it buzzes, then uses a metal rod to probe -- gently -- from the side, and then a trowel to uncover it. If it is a mine, he uses a charge to blow it up.
The job, which pays $105 a month, requires intense concentration. The Afghan who showed me how to clear mines recalled a colleague who had had a bitter argument with his wife one night and was still upset as he showed up for work the next morning. Distracted, he probed too aggressively -- and blew himself up.
Along roads and footpaths of Afghanistan, painted stones mark the safe zones -- white on the inner, cleared side, and red on the outer, dangerous side. And yet one constantly sees Afghans walking into the minefields to gather fuel or till their fields. It is not that they are stupid or oblivious; it is that they feel they have no choice.
New technologies and new kinds of wars have eclipsed the usefulness to us of land mines. They protect soldiers stationed for long periods in enemy territory, as Americans were in Vietnam and Korea, or as Russians were in Afghanistan, but they endanger our troops in modern wars like our deployments in Afghanistan or Somalia. Eight retired generals have written to President Bush saying that mines are not critical to our operations in Korea or elsewhere, and would slow a counter-invasion of North Korea in any war.
The nub of the problem is that it will be impossible to restrain irresponsible users of land mines unless the entire international community, including the United States, is four-square against them. The mines in this village, for example, were mostly laid by the Northern Alliance, our new ally. If its leaders feel threatened, their impulse will be to lay new mines -- and how can we tell them not to when we reserve the right to lay mines ourselves? 
This is an issue where the United States could and should get out front and lead the world, thus saving future generations of kids from the excruciating choices faced by Abdul Taher.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: KABUL; 
Unsealing Time Capsule at the American Embassy

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
A boombox played taps and "The Star Spangled Banner." Four marines marched out a flag that had been mothballed for more than 12 years, and raised it on a flagpole that had stood bare for just as long.
 With pomp and ceremony, and in considerable drizzle, the American Embassy building in Kabul reopened today, more than a decade after officials closed it with a promise to return. 
 "With the reopening of the United States Mission in Kabul today, America has resumed its diplomatic, economic and political engagement with this country," proclaimed James F. Dobbins, Washington's special envoy to Afghanistan. "We are here, and we are here to stay." 
The United States closed its mission here on Jan. 31, 1989, right after Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan. Officials then feared that the power vacuum would create a dangerous situation.
One longtime gate guard, Najibullah, said today that he had thought that the embassy would reopen in three months. Instead, as successive waves of conflict rolled over the capital and the country, it took nearly 13 years.
Mr. Dobbins expressed remorse over what he called the neglect of Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal. 
"Afghanistan was largely ignored not only by the United States, but also by much of the international community," he said. "Afghan factions and Afghanistan's neighbors pursued their own narrow agendas, without reference to the broader interests of the Afghan people." 
He said he was confident that a new era was at hand, describing a ceremonial Id-al-Fitr meal he attended Sunday night at which the departing president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, called for an end to warlordism, with the incoming chairman of the interim authority, Hamid Karzai, at his side. 
Mr. Dobbins, who has previously coordinated United States policy on Somalia and Haiti, pledged the international community's support for reconstructing Afghanistan, as long as the new government continued to be supported by "all factions." 
The United States has not had an envoy here since 1979, when Ambassador Adolph Dubs was kidnapped and killed. Technically only a liaison office was opened today; the actual embassy is still to come, possibly not until a more permanent government is in place.
 In Washington, Afghanistan's minister for women's affairs, Dr. Sima Samar, said in a speech on Monday that she had asked Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to appoint a woman as ambassador, The Associated Press reported. "He can't promise, but he would try," Dr. Samar said of Secretary Powell's response. "That's fair enough." 
When the staff left in 1989, they did so essentially in midsentence, and marines entering the embassy building last week found a kind of time capsule coated in thick dust. 
In the marines' quarters, there was beer and Coca-Cola in the refrigerator and a bottle of Jack Daniel's on the bar. There were pre-1989 videos (among them, "Mad Max") and a library of several hundred books, including Stephen King's "Misery," which one marine, Ray White, had already read this week.
There were photographs of President Reagan and Vice President George Bush on the wall. There were antiquated computer screens and what one Army officer called "State Department-quality 1980's furniture -- lots of Formica."
In a basement storage area were seven cars, include a light-blue Suburban with about 3,000 miles on it and several Volkswagen Jettas. 
The areas under the control of the Central Intelligence Agency were never touched.
The dust is being cleared away, but the embassy is far from fully functional. It has one working toilet for the dozens of marines and embassy personnel who have arrived.
The embassy entrances had been welded shut, and had stood largely untouched since 1989. But after the American bombing of Afghanistan began on Oct. 7, members of the Taliban entered the 14-acre compound to demonstrate and did some damage, breaking windows, tearing down ceiling tiles and setting fire to some storerooms. 
On behalf of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Mr. Dobbins today praised the Afghan staff members -- about 60 -- who had watched over the embassy for more than a decade, "enduring rocket attacks, riots and jailings in the execution of their office."
The jailing was not an exaggeration. Two retired assistant consulars said they had each spent five years in jail for criticizing the Communist government, and 12 other embassy employees were also jailed in the 1980's. They were still in jail when the Americans abandoned the compound.
Upon their release, they began coming almost every day to maintain the grounds and make sure the area had not been violated. 
"We just came here and drank tea and looked after the garden," said one, Hamid Mamnoon, who is 62 ("or 63, or 64, or 65"). "There wasn't much to do."
By the time he retired three years ago, after more than 25 years of service, Mr. Mamnoon was being paid $650 every two weeks. His son now has his old job at the embassy.
His retirement, and that of his colleague, Muhammad Sharif Qurbani, brought diplomats from Pakistan for a party on the embassy grounds and the presentation of a State Department plaque, which he kept hidden from Taliban eyes among his books.
Today he returned to see the raising of the same flag that had been lowered nearly 13 years ago, then locked in a State Department safe. The flag of the United States Special Forces was also raised, and another American flag was displayed.
The second American flag had been flown over the residence of the charge d'affaires in Kabul, then taken down and left behind along with a handwritten letter from Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. James M. Blake, commander of the last security guard detachment.
"Take care of it," he wrote of the flag. "For those of us that were here, it means a lot; for those of you yet to enter Kabul, it could mean a lot to you."
The letter, dated Jan. 31, 1989, concludes: "We Kabul marines endured, as I'm sure you will."

HEADLINE: Bonanza or Bust? Czech Sale Of Privatized Assets Fizzles 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
The Czech government's plans for a multibillion-dollar privatization bonanza ended in confusion and recrimination today. The country's electricity monopoly was left unsold, questions were raised about a winning bid for a petrochemical conglomerate, and analysts worried that a sudden inflow of capital to buy privatized assets would push the Czech currency up sharply and punish struggling exporters. 
 But one element of the plan worked out well, analysts said -- the auction of Transgas, the country's natural gas pipeline network, which was won by RWE of Germany with a bid of 4.1 billion euros ($3.7 billion). 
 "We are not a banana republic," Prime Minister Milos Zeman told reporters, responding to criticism that the privatization program was an embarrassing failure. "The government of the Czech Republic is no pushover that can be given undervalued bids," he said. 
The government, which is short of cash and hesitant to raise taxes at a time of economic slowdown, had hoped to raise 250 to 300 billion Czech korunas ($7.1 billion to $8.5 billion) from the sale of three major businesses.
Sale of the largest, the national electricity monopoly CEZ, was postponed until Jan. 7, the government said, because the only valid bid received -- 160 billion korunas ($4.54 billion) from Enel of Italy -- was too low. The government said it would open talks with Enel and with Electricite de France, which submitted a bid that was apparently late and was not published. 
The Transgas sale included majority stakes in the country's eight regional gas distributors as well as a 97 percent stake in the international pipelines that bring Russian gas to the Czech Republic and on to Western Europe. In addition to the RWE offer, it attracted bids from Duke Energy of the United States, E.on of Germany and a consortium including Gaz de France and Germany's Ruhrgas.
The third major offering was a 63 percent stake in Unipetrol, a group of petrochemical companies, some of which the government had seized back after buyers in previous privatizations ran them into bankruptcy. The Unipetrol stake was bought by a smaller domestic rival, Agrofert, for 361 million euros ($326 million), with backing from Conoco, the American oil giant.
Analysts questioned why the government did not accept a bid of 444 million euros from Rotch Energy of Britain. "For Unipetrol, it is very difficult to understand why the bid that is 80 million euros lower was chosen as a winner," said Pavel Mertlik, a former finance minister and chief economist at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment in Prague. "There is a clear necessity for the government to give an answer for that." Defending the decision, the prime minister, Mr. Zeman, told reporters that Rotch Energy had not persuaded the government that it was a serious strategic investor with a long-term plan for Unipetrol.
Miroslav Gregr, the industry and trade minister, said that he had invited Electricite de France to join a second round of bidding for CEZ, the electric monopoly, because Electricite de France had expressed willingness to take on the troubled Temelin nuclear power plant as part of its offer. Italy phased out nuclear power in 1987, and according to news agency reports, Iberdrola S.A. of Spain, which has nuclear experience, dropped out of an agreement to join Enel's bid for CEZ.
Libor Vinklat, an equity analyst at Ceska Sporitelna in Prague, said he was concerned about the way the CEZ privatization was being handled. He cited news reports here that the French bidders intentionally delivered their offer 10 minutes late, hoping to gain a tactical advantage.
"The government opened the envelope of the Italians, and published the price, but they did not open the French envelope," Mr. Vinklat said. "So now the French know the Italians' bid and the Italians know nothing. It is a very strange situation."
A spokeswoman for EDF denied press reports about her company's bid submission.
Since the fall of Communism, corruption and political favoritism have bedeviled Czech economic reform. Though Hungary worked to sell important industries to foreign owners and Poland developed a well-regulated domestic stock market, most major Czech enterprises were sold to local managers who borrowed heavily to buy them and then stripped assets to pay off their loans. Now, onetime industrial giants like Skoda, CKD and the Tatra truck works are all but bankrupt.
The Czech government, which wants to use sale proceeds to plug a budget gap, is at odds with the central bank, which says proceeds should be sequestered and used to pay off state debt, which would reduce the upward pressure on the Czech currency, the koruna.
Currency traders bid the koruna up to 35.2 to the dollar today, its strongest since January 2000. Unipetrol shares fell 13 percent, to 46.57 korunas ($1.32) each. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 20, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in World Business on Tuesday about auctions of state-controlled companies in the Czech Republic referred incorrectly to some losing bidders for Transgas, the country's natural gas pipeline network. E.on, Gaz de France and Ruhrgas submitted one joint offer; E.on did not bid separately.

HEADLINE: To Little Avail, U.S. Presses For Steel Output Cut Abroad 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Using a mixture of gentle persuasion and thinly veiled threats, United States trade officials pressed steel-making countries from around the world today to reduce production and lift prices.
 But although everyone agrees that the steel industry is in dire straits, few countries seemed ready to accept big cuts for themselves, and the European nations are outwardly hostile to American demands. 
 In meetings here held by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Bush administration is pressing countries like Russia, Korea, China and Japan to outline plans for shutting down inefficient factories that add to the glut of unneeded steel.
The gentle persuasion came in the United States' emphasis on "market-based" reductions rather than government-ordered factory shutdowns. 
The unmistakable threat in the background, though, was President Bush's coming decision on whether to impose heavy tariffs and other penalties on steel imported into the United States.
The International Trade Commission, a United States panel, has proposed a range of restrictions and will issue its formal report to Mr. Bush on Wednesday. Mr. Bush has two months to decide on the recommendations, and the domestic steel industry is lobbying hard for protection.
"This will help set the economic context in which the president can make his decision," Grant D. Aldonas, under secretary for commerce for international trade, said in an interview here today.
Steel prices have dropped by about one-third this year as manufacturing industries have tumbled into a severe downturn. United States steel makers have lost more than $1 billion this year, and 25 companies have declared bankruptcy.
Steel makers in most other countries are struggling, too, in part because steel prices have dropped to the point where most cannot turn a profit. Industry analysts estimate that steel costs $260 a ton to produce, but the market price now is about $200.
There is considerable disagreement about how much overcapacity exists.
American officials here said they did not expect to extract explicit commitments from other countries about reducing production. Rather, they hope to win agreement on the dimensions of the overcapacity and at least a general road map on how to reduce it.
But European officials are furious, arguing that the United States is reverting to protectionism while failing to push through the necessary restructuring at home.
Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's top trade negotiator, harshly criticized the International Trade Commission's recommendations last week and vowed to fight them at the World Trade Organization.
But Europe is not the main source of trouble for American steel mills. Their problem is huge exporters like Japan, Russia, China and South Korea.
American officials, though not accusing specific countries, insist that a big part of the steel industry's problems stem from inefficient factories that would not remain in business without government protection.
American officials predicted today that, based on moves announced by companies so far, United States steel capacity -- now 125 million tons -- would probably drop 14 million to 17 million tons by the end of 2002. 
But most other countries were reluctant to make comparable predictions for their own industry.
"Our factories are among the most efficient in the world," said Choi Hyuck, South Korea's lead representative in the talks here. He said South Korea planned to reduce its capacity, but he said he was "not optimistic" about reaching agreements that would satisfy American officials enough to prevent them from imposing new tariffs and import quotas.
"There is what we call an invisible linkage" between the talks here and President Bush's coming decision on trade restrictions, Mr. Choi said.
Almost every steel-exporting country has been hurt by the plunge in demand and price.
"We have lost 80 percent of our deliveries to North America," said Sergiy Gryshchenko, Ukraine's minister for industrial policy. Ukrainian steel exports to the United States have dropped to 300,000 tons this year from 2 million in 2000.
The Bush administration is in a difficult situation. In principle, Mr. Bush opposes government intervention on behalf of private industry. In practice, the steel industry is a powerful lobby that employs many thousands of people.
Mr. Aldonas, the top American representative here, said it was unfair to criticize American steel makers for failing to adapt to new competition.
"I don't want our European colleagues to misjudge the amount of restructuring that is going on in the United States," he said. "I don't think it is fair to isolate this as a U.S. problem."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE OTHER SHOE; 
Many Arabs Nervous About Attack on Iraq

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Most Arab governments share the American sentiment that removing Saddam Hussein could much improve the neighborhood. But there is little stomach for watching the United States take war to yet another Islamic nation.
 Indeed, Arab governments believe that the American priority in the Middle East should be halting the bloodshed between the Israelis and the Palestinians rather than trying to rewrite the end of the Persian Gulf war more than a decade after President Hussein's government survived in Baghdad. 
 The absence of any confirmed evidence tying Iraq to either the Sept. 11 or anthrax attacks increases the difficulty of convincing Arabs that it is necessary to strike now. An American attack could well enhance the perception that the United States was making Muslims its target and thus unravel the reluctant Arab support for dismantling Osama bin Laden's network of terror. 
"Most countries would like to see Saddam go," said one senior Egyptian official. "But attacking Iraq will not solve the problem of Saddam Hussein. It will just attract sympathy for him."
Many Arabs blame the United States for Palestinian deaths because Washington supplies weapons to Israel, and also see America as the prime mover behind the sanctions that have brought hardship to Iraqis. If more Iraqis die under American bombs, many in the region predict, radical Arabs will gain strength and American allies will feel undermined.
"It will add to the frustration and anger that is rampant in the Middle East," said Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League. "If you continue to pressure people and act regardless of the feelings of people, you shouldn't blame them if they oppose the United States."
People in the region draw a clear distinction between targeting the Taliban and targeting Mr. Hussein.
"The whole policy of the Taliban was opposed by the vast majority of Muslim and Arab countries," Mr. Moussa said, "so the cause of supporting bin Laden and so forth by the Afghan government was a strange cause, while the cause in Iraq is how to save the Iraqi people from the rigors of the sanctions, which has a very strong appeal in Arab public opinion."
The governments of American allies, notably Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, are already struggling to contain public outrage over their ties to Washington in light of its strong support for Israel. 
For the last 14 months, television screens across the region have been filled nightly with images of Israeli soldiers gunning down Palestinian protesters.
So far, Arab governments have contained popular dissent largely by banning demonstrations. But they are wary of their domestic constituencies.
Senior officials in Egypt and Syria have warned of the dire consequences of attacking Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Abdullah, who runs the country, has made a public display of trying to distance Riyadh from Washington.
For two months he has held almost weekly sessions with different groups of leaders -- teachers, military officers, businessmen -- to explain how the Saud dynasty is trying to put pressure on the United States to help the Palestinians.
"The Saudis are trying to calm down their own internal audience," said Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, editor in chief of the London-based daily Al Sharq al Awsat. "They need to take a break from American adventures that lead to nothing."
Any attack on Iraq would require at least tacit approval from the Saudis, not to mention logistical and other military support. They quietly allowed the Americans to use the technologically advanced command and control center at Prince Sultan Air Base south of Riyadh for the attacks on Afghanistan. But it would be far more difficult to maintain such a low profile in combat with an Arab nation right next door.
For Egypt, a new coalition against Iraq could be fraught with danger. Discontent is mounting on all fronts -- the economy is in tatters, unemployment is high and unhappiness over the plight of the Palestinians is rising -- and the time seems ripe for Islamic movements to flourish.
"It comes out in indirect ways, in creating tension with Islamic forces," said Bassma Kodmani, a political analyst with the Ford Foundation, speaking of the worries of Arab governments about Islamic movements. "In the inability to confront these forces, political assassinations can happen, radicalization.
"You have to look at the long-term trends. It is the bin Ladens and the Afghan Arabs. It is becoming more and more difficult to manage."
The American track record on Iraq makes governments doubly wary. Right after a cease-fire ended the gulf war fighting in 1991, Kurds and Shiites responded to Washington's call for an uprising, which was brutally suppressed without any American military support.
American-led bombing throughout the 1990's, usually over quarrels about United Nations inspections of Iraqi weapons programs, and the sanctions helped Mr. Hussein to consolidate his power. He portrayed himself as Iraq's savior from foreign marauders and ensured that only his friends were allowed to violate sanctions.
Gen. Wafiq Sumarahi, the former head of Iraqi military intelligence who defected in 1994 and now lives in Europe, said he thought the 400,000-member armed forces might rebel if there were clear-cut statements from the outset that Mr. Hussein, and not the military, was the target.
"When you declare this intention clearly, this would make most of the commanders cooperate with this plan against Saddam," the general said. "But if you say you want to destroy the weapons of mass destruction and some targets within Iraq and Saddam would remain after that, not one of the military commanders would help."

HEADLINE: Prada: Luxury Brand With World-Class Anxiety 

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY and GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Teetering on high heels at the top of a stair overlooking Mercer Street last Friday evening, the willowy Estee Lauder model Carolyn Murphy surveyed a crowd of fashion's elite and whispered, "This is so bizarre." 
 The occasion was a long-anticipated party celebrating the opening of Prada's 24,000-square-foot store in SoHo. Ms. Murphy could have been referring to the unseasonal December weather. But she could easily have been editorializing about the crowd, a throng drawn from a rarefied sphere where the worlds of business, fashion, film, art and architecture intersect. 
 Who else besides Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, her husband and the chief executive of the Prada Group, could lure Rudolph W. Giuliani, Kevin Spacey, Milla Jovovich and the sculptor Mark di Suvero to the opening of a dress shop? What other corporate magnates possess the vision and drive to defy a depressed market and to commission world-class architects like Rem Koolhaas to erect temples of retailing not just in New York but also in Tokyo, San Francisco, Paris and Los Angeles? Who, at this grim moment for local business, could propose anything approaching this couple's vision for a downtown renewal hinged on a distinctly 21st-century fusion of mercantile and cultural agendas? 
In a sense, the evening was a triumph for the owners of a privately held company whose fashions of the 1990's transformed a family luggage firm, founded by Ms. Prada's grandfather Mario in 1913, into a powerhouse with global sales of $1.4 billion last year. Yet for all the flashbulb excitement, there was a bizarre cast to the event, an anxiety detectible by anyone who has followed the fortunes of a seemingly unassailable firm. 
The finger-gnawing nervousness displayed by Ms. Prada and Mr. Bertelli on Friday could have been chalked up to social unease. But they also have ample cause to worry. Although Prada sales last year increased by 56.6 percent, and the company posted 24.9 percent sales growth in the first half of 2001, it continues to grapple with a $1.6 billion debt load. It was accumulated over a three-year acquisitions binge, when demand for its $375 shoes and $1,200 chemises seemed insatiable. Now it is struggling with the burden of prime real estate bought at market peak, and a sense in some quarters that the label is in danger of losing its cachet. 
Over the course of its buying spree, Prada acquired controlling interest in Jil Sander, Helmut Lang, Church's shoes, Azzedine Alaia, Carshoe and the Genny Group, along with a sizeable hunk of Fendi. 
But an initial public offering the company planned, to raise money to cover the debt of these acquisitions and to fuel expansion, was called off twice this year because of the global downturn, most recently after Sept. 11. Steven Greenberg, the president of the Greenberg Group, retail analysts, was not alone in noting that the expansions initiated by Mr. Bertelli would have been next to impossible in a publicly traded firm. "He has built himself a house of cards," Mr. Greenberg said. 
When the stock offering was indefinitely postponed for the second time, there was talk that Prada would be forced to sell some of its brands. And by the end of November, it did indeed sell a 25.5. percent stake in Fendi to L.V.M.H. Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton for $260 million, and the company was reported in the trade press to be shopping the labels of both Ms. Sander and Helmut Lang. Last week in New York, Mr. Bertelli, whose company had denied the brands were for sale, declined to comment. Two days before the gala opening of the resplendent SoHo store, Prada announced a $624.1 million bond to help offset its huge debt. 
As a luxury brand with democratic ambitions, Prada is caught in marketing limbo. Now that it has expanded to 150 stores worldwide, with five in Manhattan alone, its survival as a business is contingent on reaching a broad market -- while also retaining the intrinsic cachet of being the cognoscenti's chosen brand. Some industry analysts see these goals as conflicting. "They're never going to be the inner-circle kid anymore," said Donny Deutsch, the chief executive of Deutsch Inc., the advertising agency, and a longtime Prada customer. "By definition they're victims of their own success."
Perhaps too pervasive these days to excite the fickle appetites of the fanatical style makers who established the brand, Prada has yet to infitrate the consciousness (and pocketbooks) of a mass market. It is not alone in being an apparel company that cannot afford the luxury of catering to fashion insiders.
One measure of the extent to which the Milan-based company falls below the radar of many American women was provided last week when Women's Wear Daily published the results of a survey to determine the 100 most recognizable international fashion brands. The study found that, while Calvin Klein, Gucci, Christian Dior, Chanel and Givenchy were all ranked in the top 100, Prada's name was nowhere to be found.
At a news conference in June, Mr. Bertelli played down the effects of the American economic slowdown on a saturated high end sector. Quick reflexes, he said, "are essential." 
Yet it is those very reflexes that critics have begun calling into question. Among the problems that have beset Mr. Bertelli's expansion, the best documented are his creative disputes with Ms. Sander, who, to widespread astonishment, defected in January 2000 from the label that bore her name. Fashion insiders were surprised when Mr. Bertelli gave evidence of his management style by taking over not just the Jil Sander business but, for one season at least, the design of its clothes. 
There is also the question of whether the architectural grandiosity of Prada's retail expansion -- the SoHo store alone is estimated to have cost $40 million, and another Koolhaas-designed showplace in San Francisco has been delayed for expensive earthquake-proofing -- represents a lapse in business judgment, as some analysts contend. "These huge capital expenditures can be very telling on your net profitability," Mr. Greenberg said.
Prada opened 26 stores around the world in 1998 alone. And while the company shuttered its Prada Sport store on Wooster Street last week, it will maintain four emporiums and one outpost of Miu Miu, all within a two-and-a-half-mile stretch from upper Madison Avenue to the new Prince Street store, where its less than tony neighbors include Zale's and Ann Taylor Loft. 
"We don't feel we're overexposed," Mr. Bertelli said last week, when asked if Prada was in danger of glutting the luxury marketplace. "We have 150 stores around the world -- compare that to our competitors." Chanel has 105. Gucci, which has 153, maintains a single, hugely profitable outpost in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue. 
Despite the financial uncertainties, both Mr. Bertelli and Ms. Prada seem committed to the notion that experimental store design will keep vital the company's innovative image. "To go on being creative," Ms. Prada said, "that is the only way to fight overexposure."
As a strategy, the creation of elaborate retail stores is "high risk high reward or no reward," said Carol Murray, an apparel and footwear analyst in the equity research division of Solomon Smith Barney. "Successful retail strategies go back to germane, relevant, must-have products." Why, if its product is so robust, does the SoHo store bill itself as a purveyor of vintage Prada clothing? A part of the store has been turned over to the sale of Prada shoes, prints and handbags from earlier and more influential seasons.
Additionally, among retailers, shoppers and fashion observers interviewed, there was a sense that the Prada devotee is no longer as single-minded in her obsession as she was in the label's undisputed heyday, just a few years back.
"Prada developed the idea that you have to have that one single handbag each season or that important pair of shoes," said one major retailer whose store carries Prada. Once famous for their willingness to go lemminglike from floral appliqued Mary Jane shoes one season to a razor-toed Bond girl pump the next, the Prada fan may have moved on. "These women don't look at Prada and say, 'What do I have to have from Prada?' anymore," the retailer said. 
Not since the company engineered the design feat of transforming a clunky bowling bag into an $800 fashion essential in the spring of 2000 has Prada scored a major runaway success. If, as analysts suggest, accessories are the cornerstone of the luxury market, it is worth noting that it is Balenciaga's grommeted $950 shoulder bag that sold out all year at both downtown boutiques like Kirna Zabete and Barneys New York, while the widely copied Prada bowling bags turned up for $299 at Loehmann's, alongside other markdowns. 
"I don't want some brand trophy right now, especially one as easy as Prada," said Priscilla Glover, an avid shopper who lives in Paris and New York. "I want something original, special, beautiful, charming and even precious, and I haven't found that at Prada in over a year." 
Linda Dresner stopped carrying Prada at her store in Birmingham, Mich., 18 months ago because, Ms. Dresner said, "there was just too much of it around."
In response to the issue of keeping Prada fresh, Mr. Bertelli countered: "The novelty we've introduced is that instead of going on with uniformity, we have created unique and unusual environments," referring to the highly conceptual store designs. "The product now is so strong it no longer requires a sameness of spaces."
It would appear that the Prada strategy is to invigorate the act of shopping by creating museums of consumerism, which like all good museums today come complete with a self-critique. In an introduction to a specially published book documenting Mr. Koolhaas's architectural collaborations with Prada, he offers what could be read as an analysis of the philosophical problems underlying Prada's growing pains. "In a world where everything is shopping . . . and shopping is everything . . . what is luxury?" Mr. Koolhaas asks. 
"Luxury is not shopping," Mr. Koolhaas concludes.

An article on the Fashion page yesterday about the business of Prada, the Italian fashion house, misspelled part of the name of the company that bought its 25.5 percent stake in Fendi, the handbag maker. It is LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, not L.V.M.H. Moet Hennessey.

HEADLINE: In Tight Market, Toned-Down Resumes 

BYLINE:  By SHARON McDONNELL 

 BODY:
To underplay or not to underplay their qualifications to prospective employers -- that is the question facing many white-collar job hunters these days.
 In this recession, Frank Blazey of Los Angeles is all for playing them down. Mr. Blazey, 48, was laid off in August from a district sales manager job he had held since January at Thor Inc., a software-consulting firm in Manhattan Beach, Calif. Before that, he was vice president for sales for two years at Digital Venture Solutions, an educational-resources Web site in Newport Beach, Calif., that eventually went belly up, and before that district sales manager for six years at the Vantive Corporation, a maker of business software in Santa Clara, Calif. 
 "But you'll never see that on my resume -- it says 'sales leader,' " Mr. Blazey said. "I position myself as what's known in sales lingo as a 'bag carrier,' or regular salesperson, because there are so many more jobs for them than for V.P.'s of sales or district managers."
He also obscures his background in the military industry, where he was a marketing manager for Hughes Aircraft and held posts at two consulting firms in Washington, by limiting his resume to the last 10 years.
Divorced, renting a condominium, paying $2,500 each month to send two children to college, running out of savings and facing the end of unemployment benefits, Mr. Blazey is nothing if not eager to find work. In his most recent position, he earned about $7,000 a month just for making his quota and usually made a lot more by beating it. The next time around, he said, he will be willing to make do with a base rate of $5,000.
In contrast to Mr. Blazey's stance, David Hirsch of Berwyn, Pa., is against masking accomplishments. Mr. Hirsch was laid off in February, six months after becoming vice president for marketing at Millstar Inc., a start-up in Falls, Pa., that helps companies manage product data. Before that, he was director of marketing for two years at Synygy Inc., a software maker that helps companies manage variable salary plans, in Conshohocken, Pa., after nearly a decade in the broadcast equipment industry.
"I don't want to sacrifice the long term for short term, so I'm not downplaying my position or my salary," Mr. Hirsch said. His financial situation is not quite as dire as Mr. Blazey's -- his two young daughters attend public school and his wife is a self-employed violin maker -- but his severance pay ran out months ago and his unemployment checks will end soon. To help tide things over, he has been doing consulting work for a computer systems designer.
"As long as you can do it, you're better off holding out," he said.
Two job hunters, two approaches to coping with the toughest job market in over a decade. This year the number of unemployed professionals and managers soared 63 percent, to 1.2 million, and the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better.
Career consultants come down on the side of full disclosure -- to a point. John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm, is a purist.
"What you've accomplished gives you a track record, and downplaying it doesn't make sense," he said. "Sometimes people do it out of loss of self-esteem, a feeling of 'no one wants to hire me.' " But, he advises, "Don't sell yourself short."
But other specialists say it's O.K. to fudge the salary and title of your last job a bit, given the overinflated pay scales and titles popular in the go-go 1990's. Lura Pittman, president of Fletcher Frost, an executive recruiter for the information technology industry in Littleton, Colo., says she knows of co-founders of failed start-ups who omitted their former titles of chief executive or chief information officer in their resumes, stating instead merely that they had experience in business development and sales.
Greg Faherty, who helps job seekers write resumes for Resume.com in New York, has seen the same phenomenon. "I see major changes in financial and technical fields, where people who had jobs as C.E.O. and chief technology officer realize they can't go to larger companies and get the same position," he said. "So their cover letters say they are sales professionals with management experience."
Of course, employers frown on any fiddling of the facts, whether the inflated claims that they have always tried to ferret out or the new-found humility that they fear will evaporate once good times return.
And while exaggerations can sometimes be forgiven, leaving out your last job -- and extending the time you spent at the previous one to mask the omission -- is a no-no, career experts say.
"An extraordinarily dangerous practice -- if human resources does a reference check and dates don't check out, you won't get the job," said Arnold Huberman, who heads Huberman Associates, a New York recruiter for the public relations and marketing industry.
But some job seekers, faced with relentless stacks of bills and tremendous competition in the job market, disdain the ivory-tower mentality of career professionals.
"If you have over 10 years' experience, you're in trouble," said Mr. Blazey, a Persian Gulf war veteran with 10 years in the Marine Corps Reserves and 3 on active duty. "What they want is people with three to five years in a technology niche specialty, and the next category is six to nine years."
Stephanie Schroeder, 38, who was laid off in February by a New York public relations agency, may have hit on a solution to the quandary. She has written three resumes, each tailored to a separate set of expectations. Her "dumbed down" one, for lower-level openings, lists jobs as an editorial assistant instead of features editor at a trade association magazine, and as a junior account executive instead of director in public relations. A second lists her higher titles but leaves out her law degree so she will not have to answer questions about why she is not practicing. And the "full scale" one includes her legal background.
The dumbed-down resume gets the biggest workout. "I've been on so many interviews I know what they're offering, and it's mainly lower-level jobs," Ms. Schroeder said. Even for them, competition is fierce, she said, recalling the sting of receiving a group rejection by e-mail from a trade publication recently, which listed the e-mail addresses of all the rejected candidates.

GRAPHIC: Photos: To be considered for available, though perhaps lower-paying, jobs, Frank Blazey says he takes some of the gloss off his employment past. Stephanie Schroeder says she has three resumes, and uses the one most relevant to the job opening. (Above, Lee Celano for The New York Times; below, Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE BOSS; 
From a Factory to a Bank

BYLINE:  By TERRENCE MURRAY; Written with Jonathan D. Glater. 

 BODY:
When I was in college, I did not want to go into traditional banking; I wanted to be a stockbroker. I just thought that was the highest calling -- maybe because an older friend of mine talked it up.
 But I graduated from college just as the economy was falling in 1962, so I had 25 interviews with investment banks and brokerage houses and was rejected 25 times. My wife's parents lived in Providence, where we went after graduation, and there were two banks there. The first one turned me down, the second one, a predecessor of FleetBoston called Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island, gave me a job. 
 My first interview there was with a gentleman named Homer George. He asked me why I dropped out of high school, only to return and end up at Harvard. The answer was that I had spent a year working nights, 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., at a textile factory, and realized I did not want to spend my life doing that. The only reason I went to the factory was because my father told me to stop wasting time in school if I was not going to concentrate on it -- my grades had fallen during my sophomore year of high school.
Since then, I have tried to hire people who I thought had potential, a chip on their shoulder and maybe a resume that raises questions, too.
I collect American paintings from the period 1850 to 1930. There's something serene and beautiful about some paintings, whether they are still lifes or landscapes or portraits. I have one portrait of a little girl named Kathleen O'Malley by Robert Henri, and if all the lights are out in the room except for the lights on the painting, her eyes seem to follow you as you walk by.
Even though I often buy paintings at auction houses, I never go to bid on one myself: people get too caught up in the competition. I always tell someone else how much I am willing to pay and then send them to bid. Sometimes I win; sometimes I lose.
That's something I learned from investing in real estate, something my wife and I did as a sideline while I was pretty junior at the bank, in the early 1960's. Back then, you could buy a three-family house for just $10,000, and the down payments were very low. We rented apartments in a few buildings. My wife fixed windows, repaired doorbells and did other necessary odd jobs. My task was just to collect the rent, which was often a tricky business because I had to know when people got paid and when they would be home.
One tenant who worked as a shoe salesman at Thom McAnn in Providence had a drinking problem. I had to find out when he got paid and wait outside the store to catch him before he could get to a bar and spend all the money. Sometimes his wife would be there, too -- she wanted to make sure all the money was not spent on booze.
I always found out where tenants worked, which helped if I had to track them down on payday. Usually it was not that people did not want to pay rent, but that they simply did not have the money. Most people are good people.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
In the Sensitive Office, Laying Off Is Hard to Do

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
Anna Marie Teague thought somebody would start crying when the vice president of a media relations firm in Dallas summoned her and three co-workers to a meeting last April and dismissed them.
 What she did not anticipate was that it would be her boss who shed the tears. "It was bizarre," said Ms. Teague, who was an account manager at the firm. "First, she began whimpering and telling us it wasn't her fault. Then, she just started sobbing uncontrollably." 
 As her colleagues gaped, Ms. Teague put her arm around her supervisor's shoulders. "I said: 'We're going to be O.K. Don't be upset,' " Ms. Teague said. But the vice president could not be consoled. "She even tried to hug us as we walked out the door," Ms. Teague said.
Such displays of emotion by a manager during a layoff used to be unheard-of. But, in today's slackening economy, they are becoming more commonplace, career experts say. In an effort to appear more compassionate, many managers are taking a kinder, gentler approach, displaying emotions that range from empathetic to simply pathetic.
"Layoffs today have a different tone," said Maury Hanigan, chief executive of the Hanigan Consulting Group, a human-relations consulting firm in New York that urges managers to tell employees how bad they feel about dismissing them. "One of the things the labor shortage of the 1990's taught us is that employees are viable resources. The people you're laying off today are the same people you may have to rehire when the business cycle picks back up, so you've got to show some concern when you let them go."
The desire to maintain good relations with laid-off workers is what has driven Jay Moses, president and chief executive of UGO Networks, an online entertainment company in New York, to deliver the news gently. In the last year and a half, Mr. Moses has undertaken three waves of layoffs that have shrunk his company to 37 employees from 180. Each time, he said, he has tried "to establish an emotional connection with them."
"I've been moved to tears more than a few times," Mr. Moses said, noting that he has had to lay off friends whom he recruited away from other companies. "I'll hug people and spend as much time with them as they need."
Not only that, he invites all of his employees -- both those who are leaving and those who are not -- to a bar for drinks. And he writes personal notes to departing employees, thanking them for their hard work and commenting on how their efforts have helped the company.
"What's really been nice is that I've been able to retain my personal friendships with these people," Mr. Moses said.
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, too, have increased the need for managers to appear more sympathetic, said Andrew Birol, president of Pacer Associates, an executive-coaching company in Cleveland. "Managers are feeling guilty about letting people go, and they're doing their best to soften the blow," he said.
One company that says it made a concerted effort to be more empathetic during layoff announcements is Delta Air Lines, which after the attacks announced that it would have to let go at least 13,000 employees.
But affected workers did not receive the news through a company memo or a human-resources lackey. Instead, Delta deployed 35 executives to company offices, hangars, break rooms and other meeting spots throughout the country to explain the situation to workers and lay out their options, including a voluntary leave program, according to Bob Colman, Delta's executive vice president for human resources.
Each executive received intensive training on how to anticipate employee reactions, like anger, and handle them with compassion, Mr. Colman says. Surprisingly, most workers took the news in stride. "A lot of people came up to the executives afterwards and actually comforted them," he said.
Of course, managers who abandon the traditional tone of detachment for a more caring demeanor should take care not to overstep the boundaries of decorum, specialists say. Otherwise, they risk appearing maudlin or just plain ridiculous.
Mr. Birol of Pacer Associates recalls attending a layoff meeting at a telecommunications company that had hired him as a consultant. In an apparent effort to lighten the mood, the manager breaking the bad news belted out a few bars of "Smile Though Your Heart Is Aching" in the middle of his speech.
"Everyone had these really perplexed looks on their faces, and he's sashaying around the room with a grin on his face singing, 'There are clouds in the sky, you'll get by,' Mr. Birol said. "Some people didn't even realize at that point they were getting fired."
An even bigger danger than looking foolish is coming across as insincere -- a common enough risk for managers who are forced to deliver the pink slips.
Brian Flynn, president and chief operating officer of RLM Public Relations in Manhattan, remembers sitting through a layoff meeting at his former company, Citibank, in 1999 and listening to a senior manager's expressions of contrition. "Somebody next to me whispered, 'Listen, dude, you're making $300,000 a year, and you've still got your job -- I bet you're real sorry,' " Mr. Flynn recalled.
Since then, Mr. Flynn has vowed to handle layoffs the old-fashioned way: unemotional and to the point. Most recently, he used that approach when he laid off 10 members of his staff in August.
"I said, 'We've lost a significant number of clients this month, we're making significantly less money, and so it should come as no surprise to anyone that we have to lay some of you off,' " he said. "The meeting took no longer than 10 minutes."
Many workplace specialists prefer the traditional terseness to the newfound sensitivity. "Once a manager gets into apologizing, or talking on a personal level, it muddies the water for a departing employee," said Sherry Cadorette, president of Drake Beam Morin, an outplacement firm based in New York.
But Mr. Moses, the chief executive who hugs employees he is laying off and then goes out drinking with them, begs to differ. At the latest drinking session in October, he says, several departing employees came up to him and "said remarkably good things about the company."
"They didn't feel like they had been messed around with," he said. "I have no doubt that some of these people will work for me again some day."

HEADLINE: City Ticket Plan Grows; Off Broadway, Some Grouse 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Broadway officials yesterday announced a new group of shows, including a bevy of long-running hits, that would receive city aid through a mass public purchase of tickets in January, while some Off Broadway producers voiced concerns that their theaters were missing out on the city's largesse. 
 Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said that 10 shows had qualified for the second month of the three-month program of ticket purchases and giveaways devised to alleviate a post-Sept. 11 slump. To be included, a show must have low advance sales and demonstrate it won't meet its running costs. 
 The program, in which the Giuliani administration has agreed to spend $2.5 million on 50,000 tickets at a reduced price of $50, is meant to be a stimulus not only for the shows but to ancillary night life in Manhattan as well. 
The January list includes eight musicals -- "Beauty and the Beast," "Cabaret," "Chicago," "Contact," "Les Miserables," "The Full Monty," "Phantom of the Opera," "Urinetown" -- and two plays, "Proof" and "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife." 
"If you lost $5 for the week, you didn't qualify," Mr. Bernstein said. "The program is made for shows that could conceivably close because of weak advance sales." 
While Broadway has rebounded from the exceptionally dismal period following the World Trade Center disaster, many producers are afraid that the usually weak months of January and February could be exceptionally harsh this year, as tourism struggles to recover. 
But even as the measures to buffer Broadway were being announced, owners of smaller theaters across the city were increasingly upset about being left out. 
Scott Morfee, a downtown producer and founder of Downtown NYC, a promotional group formed last month, said he had fielded dozens of angry calls about the plan. 
"I think its boneheaded," said Mr. Morfee, whose show, "Underneath the Lintel," is struggling to survive at the SoHo Playhouse. "There's a lot of insulted theater owners downtown right now."
Some producers also said yesterday that they were upset by e-mail messages from officials at NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau, offering to help promote Off Broadway shows via newspaper advertisements and on the Web -- for a $300 fee. 
That figure, said Cristyne L. Nicholas, the president of the bureau, is necessary to cover marketing costs in a time of tight city budget. 
That was a price that Tom Smedes, the producer of "Naked Boys Singing," a long-running comedy revue, said he had no intention of paying. "We are insulted that New York City is buying $2 million in tickets for Broadway, which is not suffering compared to Off Broadway," he said in an e-mail message. "And the only way we can participate is if we pay."
After buying the Broadway tickets, the city is distributing them in two ways. Fifteen thousand tickets will be given to rescue workers and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. The remaining 35,000 tickets will be part of a promotional program called Spend Your Regards to Broadway, in which consumers who produce $500 in receipts from New York City stores, restaurants and cultural institutions dated between Jan. 1 and Jan. 16 would receive a free pair of Broadway tickets.
Ms. Nicholas said that Off Broadway shows would benefit from one element of the Broadway ticket program in that receipts for purchases of tickets to Off Broadway shows could now be used as part of the $500 total. 
Mr. Morfee, the downtown producer, however, said that offer was too little, too late. "If they thought it was such a good idea, why were we not contacted about this last week?" he said. "It was all after the fact. It just appears to be a mop-up of a mess."
Officials at larger, institutional theaters were more measured in their feelings about the plan. 
"On the one hand, we are very supportive of the Broadway community and very enthusiastic about the idea of the city pumping money into the community and into culture in general," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "On the other hand, we would like to see that largesse spread around the nonprofit community as well, especially as many of us are taking it hard on the nose right now."
The money being spent by the city is not insignificant, especially in tough economic times. 
For the January cycle, Mr. Bernstein said the city will spend $750,000 to purchase 15,000 tickets for the 10 shows. In December, the city purchased 14,000 tickets -- worth about $700,000 -- for six struggling shows. In February and early March, the city has agreed to purchase an additional 21,000 tickets.
Most of the 10 shows on the January list are commercial hits, including two long-running musicals, "Phantom" and "Les Miserables," which have earned tens of millions of dollars for their producer, the British impresario Cameron Mackintosh. The list also includes four more recent profit-makers: "Cabaret," "Chicago," "Contact," and "Beauty and the Beast," produced by Disney. 
The two plays, "Proof" and "Allergist's Wife," also have returned their original investments; both are produced by the nonprofit Manhattan Theater Club. Only "Urinetown," which opened shortly after the attacks, and "The Full Monty," which opened last year, are still working to earn back their investors' money. 
Four of January's shows -- "Les Miserables," "Phantom," "Contact," and "Beauty and the Beast," -- were also included in December. 
Mr. Bernstein defended Broadway's being singled out for help because of its role as a major economic engine in the city. 
"I would never say that Broadway is more or less worthy than anything else," he said. "But I can say very confidently that you put money into Broadway, you get multiple effect on other businesses in the area."

HEADLINE: To Jolt the Economy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It's not surprising that partisan bickering has prevented Congress from passing a bill that would provide a much-needed economic stimulus ("Government Fiddles and the Economy Burns," Week in Review, Dec. 16).
 That's why we need a system in place that goes into effect automatically any time the economy slips into recession. 
With unemployment insurance, we already have the skeleton of such a plan. 
 A modernized unemployment insurance system could automatically put money into the hands of many people who are currently ineligible for benefits -- money that the unemployed would spend, providing a significant boost for the economy.
With an improved unemployment insurance system, we wouldn't have to wait for our elected leaders to wade through a morass of ideology and special interests to deliver a jolt to the economy.

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Despite some improvem ents, post-Sept. 11 flying is still a chore, especially at security checks.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IRONY is supposedly passe after Sept. 11, so I had no reason to doubt the earnestness of the admonitions being displayed on a video screen at the security gate at Newark International Airport when I checked in for a flight to New Orleans early last week.
 "No Knives," flashed the screen. "No Guns," the next message said. "No bombs," said the next one, which depicted the familiar red-outlined circle and diagonal slash across a bowling-ball-shaped bomb with a sparking fuse sticking out of it. The cartoon bomb looked like something the Road Runner might hand to Wile E. Coyote. 
 "Over here," a security guard ordered after the metal detector went off when I passed through. In airport language these days, that means "Stick 'em up."
Under the steely gaze of a rifle-toting National Guardsman wearing camouflage attire that stood out startlingly against the airport beige, I obediently reached for the skies. Even though I had placed on the conveyor belt every imaginable possession having metal components, including my sports jacket and watch, the penitentiary-quality frisking soon discovered contraband in my pocket.
"Aluminum foil on those Tic Tacs!" the guard announced triumphantly. "You're not getting through here with anything metal."
Generally reassuring as that might be, there appear to be exceptions, by the way. On Sunday, aboard an American Airlines plane taxiing toward takeoff from San Diego, a passenger removed a jacket from what she thought was her carry-on bag -- and a dummy hand grenade fell out into the aisle.
After a three-hour delay back at the gate, it was determined that the hapless woman had evidently inadvertently fetched the wrong carry-on bag from the heap of bags and laptops that now routinely pile up on security belts, as passengers stand nearby being searched. The one she grabbed, similar to her own, had actually been sent through by guards who had placed the dummy grenade inside to test the system.
Loose carry-ons, especially laptops, have become a real concern for business travelers in the new security era. Laptops must be removed from cases and placed on the conveyor belt while their owners often wait to be frisked off to the side. With their owners otherwise engaged, computers and other valuables sit there at the end of the conveyor belt for anyone to grab.
"Someone accidentally picked up my laptop in Chicago," an airline executive told me at the National Business Aviation Association convention in New Orleans last week. Wisely, he had put his business card on the keyboard, and an overnight-express transfer was arranged.
Such, alas, is business air travel three months after Sept. 11. Airports are sometimes a mess and air fares range all over the board. Schedules have been slashed, yet seating is often more cramped than ever because the airlines are increasingly flying smaller planes.
To be fair, airlines have been doing a better job in recent weeks addressing some security check-in delays. On most carriers, you can now arrive 90 minutes or less before departure, rather than two hours.
On Monday, United Airlines said that it was increasing the number of "priority" security checkpoint lanes it maintains at several major airports for "premium" customers.
This highlights an issue that we will be hearing more about in the new year, as airlines scramble to address growing passenger unease over discourtesy, harassment and long lines at security checkpoints. Airlines are quietly trying to devise ways to expedite security check-ins for their most valued customers: first-class passengers and those in various elite-level frequent-flier programs. Of course, there are several potential big public relations problems with such V.I.P. initiatives, including the fact that many of the Sept. 11 terrorists flew first class.
More on that in a later column. For now, let me just describe my most recent experience with the new world of fares and schedules.
Three weeks ago, when I made arrangements for a four-day business trip from Newark to New Orleans, commencing Dec. 11, American Express quoted me a $1,478 round-trip economy fare on Continental Airlines. By comparison, Northwest Airlines had a $175 round-trip fare to New Orleans, out of La Guardia Airport at 7 a.m. Resigned to getting up at 3:30 a.m., I booked that one.
A few days later, though, my itinerary changed. I needed to be in New Orleans a day earlier.
Booking now through Orbitz, the online travel site, the best fare I could find to match my itinerary was $1,200 round trip on Continental -- a 7 a.m. flight out of Newark via Cleveland, with a return trip four days later from New Orleans to Newark via Manchester, N.H.
I booked that, but a few days later I called Continental itself to see if I could leave a little later than 7 a.m. "You have a fully refundable ticket, so it's no problem at all," the Continental agent said.
Good enough. But when I called Continental from New Orleans last week to see if I could fly to Newark by some way other than through New Hampshire, another agent had a different story. "You have a special fare, and that's the only flight available for you," she insisted.
Yet on departure day at the New Orleans airport, the ticket agent at the Continental counter, Michael Richardson, tapped on his keyboard a little and quickly found me a more direct flight that would arrive earlier in Newark.
It's good to know that sharp employees can still make a difference, whatever the air transportation industry does to make flying miserable.
"Glad to be of service," the amiable Mr. Richardson said.
"Glad to know somebody's paying attention to business," I replied.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Agencies add their creativity to the campaign to urge shoppers to return to Lower Manhattan.

BYLINE:  By Aaron Donovan 

 BODY:
WHILE most television advertisements try to persuade consumers that a product or service is superior to others and thus worth their hard-earned dollars, TV spots that began last week in the New York area seem to neglect the customer entirely. 
 One shows a bald man asking for a haircut; another shows a tough-looking gray-haired man receiving a manicure. In both cases, the men buy services not for their benefit but for the sellers'. 
 Using a hefty dose of humor but an underlying tone of urgency, the spots are part of a campaign to encourage consumers in the metropolitan area to visit the small businesses south of Chambers Street in Manhattan. Businesses there have reported a sharp drop in the number of customers since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. 
The TV spots, in addition to radio and print ads, were created free by Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network, for the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district for Lower Manhattan.
The ads are part of a campaign that agencies in New York have provided free to clients who are looking to help small businesses since Sept. 11.
The New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic, has created print ads about promotional weekends sponsored by the TriBeCa Organization, a coalition of businesses in the neighborhood north of ground zero. The group was formed days after the attacks as business owners noticed the drop in customers.
"I was really pleased that we were able to help out," said Austin Handler, the graphic designer at McCann-Erickson who worked on the project. "There are so many little organizations and groups that really were looking for pro bono help during this time. Like with every charity, you want to help everybody but you just physically can't."
Ziccardi Partners Frierson Mee created a print ad free for the Alliance for the Arts, a nonprofit organization that encourages people to patronize arts and cultural institutions in New York City. 
"It's something you feel really good about working nights and weekends on," said Heather Mee, a managing partner for strategic planning at Ziccardi, who worked on the ad. "This is a particularly important time to be able to do something good for our city."
Both large and small agencies have been asked to do pro bono work on behalf of small businesses in neighborhoods south of 14th Street, many of which rely heavily on tourism. Paul Perlow Design, a one-man graphic design firm in Midtown Manhattan, created a print ad free for the Asian American Business Development Center. Using the image of the actor Jackie Chan, the ad encouraged people to visit Chinatown.
Kirshenbaum was the first agency that the Downtown Alliance called when it was looking for help. 
"We feel that it's important for us to commit to this neighborhood," said Richard Kirshenbaum, co-chairman of Kirshenbaum Bond, which has its offices on Varick Street in the West Village. "We felt strongly about doing some work for some of these businesses that are suffering."
Underneath the humorous tone are hints of urgency that come through more in radio spots that will begin in January. In one, the announcer says that if you do not have your shoes shined at Bob's Shoe Repair soon, the store itself "won't last long."
"The tone was so important and so hard to really hit on the head, without depressing people, without making too much light of the situation," said Debra Simon, vice president for marketing at the Downtown Alliance. "They really got what we consider the hardest part of this, which is the right tone."
As for the selling point for Bob's Shoe Repair -- why you should go there instead of another repair store -- the ad appeals to that warm feeling one gets after helping someone.
While the Kirshenbaum spots are humorous, the problem they address is not. The downtown alliance reports that stores in the area have lost 20 percent to 80 percent of their revenues since Sept. 11. 
"Even if you don't need to get your hair cut or necessarily use a support service downtown," Mr. Kirshenbaum said, "we're trying to help people understand that downtown needs their support."

HEADLINE: McCall Sees $4.7 Billion City Budget Gap 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall issued a report yesterday warning that the budget gap that New York City would face next year would be even worse than other officials had predicted: $4.7 billion, which is more than $1 billion larger than the gap forecast by the Giuliani administration.
 It was the second ominous forecast about the city's finances this week. On Monday, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi cautioned that the city's economy would shrink by 3.1 percent next year, its first yearlong decline in more than a decade, largely as a result of the attack on the World Trade Center. 
 But while some of Mr. Hevesi's predictions were actually rosier than those of the Giuliani administration, Mr. McCall's were significantly grimmer.
The McCall report charges that "the city may be underestimating the magnitude of the problem" by counting on several sources of income that are by no means assured, including $250 million from the sale of the Off-Track Betting Corporation, which needs state approval; $238 million in increased state aid for education; and $175 million in higher airport lease payments from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
And it warns that the city may be underestimating the expenses it will face from rising health insurance costs, wage increases for municipal workers and lawsuits against it.
The report by Mr. McCall, a Democrat who is running for governor, repeats several criticisms that he made in past years of the Giuliani administration's budgeting practices. In particular, it charges that the city's failure to use its budget surpluses in the boom years that just ended to save for a rainy day and pay off debt has left it hard-pressed to face the coming fiscal crisis. 
"By irresponsibly using the surpluses to balance the budget a year at a time, instead of to build up a reserve fund and pay down debt, the city avoided making tough choices," Mr. McCall said in a statement. 
"With the surpluses now nearly exhausted and the economy slumping, the difficult decisions have been left for the next administration to make."
Adam L. Barsky, the director of the city's Office of Management and Budget, said that the city stood by its forecast that the budget gap for the next fiscal year, which begins in July, would be $3.6 billion.
He said that the city had always used the surpluses prudently, and added that if the city had done what Mr. McCall suggested, it could be facing an even bigger gap now.

HEADLINE: For Some Retailers, a Rescue By Buzz, Click, Point and Whirr 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Between the sputtering economy and the terrorist attacks, this holiday season was expected to be bleak for retailers. But stores selling consumer electronics have found a silver lining.
 Products like DVD players, big-screen televisions, video game consoles and digital cameras are selling exceptionally well. In the third week of November, which includes the all-important Friday after Thanksgiving, sales of home-theater systems leaped 173.2 percent over the period last year, according to a survey by NPDTechworld, a market information company. Sales of DVD players were up 53.1 percent, color televisions rose 23.1 percent and digital cameras increased 40.1 percent. Those trends have stayed consistent since then, the company said. 
 For people who have canceled trips and are worried about job security, equipment that makes home life more entertaining has significant appeal. In addition, prices have fallen on many products, and stores are making them easier to buy. 
"Consumer electronics are a good reward," said Burt Flickinger III, a retail consultant with Reach Marketing.
Prices range from $399 for a home-theater system with five speakers and a DVD player to $299 for the Microsoft XBox game console and $1,999 for a big-screen TV to go with them. Shoppers are also showing strong interest in flat-panel computer monitors, Compaq Pocket PC personal organizers ($499) and bundles of peripherals, extra memory and software, much of which is priced lower than ever.
The purveyors of consumer electronics, which were battered in the last recession but are proving surprisingly resilient in this one, include specialty chains like Best Buy and Circuit City as well as huge discounters like Wal-Mart and Target.
Other retail sectors are flat or in decline. Fashion is not a priority, and sales of clothing and accessories are down. Luxury retailers are having their worst year in a decade. Many families are fearful about terrorism and have canceled travel plans, while others see layoffs all around them and do not want to take on a large purchase like a car. 
The money they might have spent on those things in the past is flowing into consumer electronics stores instead. "You certainly did not see that in the last recession" in the early 1990's, Carl Steidtmann, the chief economist for Deloitte Research, said, noting that apparel purchases rose then. "Consumer electronics got beat up pretty badly. It's one of the dimensions of this recession that is different from the last one." 
Shoppers seem to be drawn to consumer electronics for several reasons. Price is a big one; a basic DVD player now costs less than $100, and prices have fallen on other products, too. 
"I just bought two music systems for my wife and my daughter, and they're so reasonable," said Steve Naru, a public relations consultant. "The one for my daughter was about $80." His wife also sent him out to buy a new VCR recently, he added, and told him to get a good one. "Don't come back with a cheap one," Mr. Naru said he was told. 
But that was easier said than done. "I couldn't find one for over $100," he said. "They must have eliminated a whole cottage industry of repair people."
Then there is the aftershock of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which is leading many people to say they crave more time at home. Restless teenagers can be drawn in with a souped-up family room, at least in theory, where they can watch movies and listen to music. That is where the popularity of the home-theater-in-a-box, which starts as low as $399 and escalates into the thousands of dollars, comes in. 
In addition, some new products, including the Microsoft XBox and Sony PlayStation 2 game consoles, just appeared last month and had been hotly awaited by adult and teenage shoppers. 
Most retailers are limping through this season, compared with the holiday period last year. "We saw very few bags this time around at the mall, with very few people carrying bags from more than one store, and almost no one carrying more than one bag from any one store," one analyst, Maura Hunter Byrne of Salomon Smith Barney, wrote in a note to investors describing a trip to the Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, N.J., and several Manhattan stores. 
But the consumer electronics stores are whistling a different tune. Circuit City, reporting third-quarter earnings yesterday, said sales in stores open more than a year dropped 4 percent, less than the 6 to 7 percent that analysts had predicted.
Best Buy, which also released third-quarter earnings yesterday, reported that same-store sales increased 1.6 percent, compared with a 5.9 percent jump in the period last year. The company exceeded analysts' estimates, and said earnings rose 40 percent, to 37 cents a share, in the quarter.
Chains like Target, Wal-Mart and even Ames, which is in bankruptcy, have also recorded strong sales from consumer electronics, Mr. Flickinger said. "It's the proverbial rising tide lifting all boats," he said. Many consumers used their federal tax rebates to buy digital cameras, he added, if they did not use them to pay down debt. 
The stores have reaped as much profit as possible from add-ons like service contracts and credit cards, said Michael Collins, a retail consultant with Bain & Company. So even as prices drop, "there are a lot of people who are getting a better understanding of these two other profit pools within consumer electronics," he said. Prices of DVD movies and other software have not fallen, leaving stores other ways to fatten profits. 
Still, not everything is selling well. The most expensive products -- deluxe flat-screen TV's, for example, priced at $3,299 for a 34-inch model at Circuit City -- do not exactly gallop off the sales floor. Personal computer sales have also slowed, although Marie Driscoll, a retail analyst for Argus Research, said that "the velocity of the slowdown is starting to ease." Digital TV recorders, which allow viewers to pause or stop their favorite shows and replay them later, have also sold more sluggishly than expected.

HEADLINE: LTV Seems on the Vergeof a Shutdown 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
After more than half a century in business, the LTV Corporation will soon shut its doors, barring a government-supplied miracle.
 One of the nation's biggest steel makers, LTV put its mills earlier this month on what is called "hot idle," which would allow the company to restart them quickly if a government-backed loan comes through at the last minute. 
 But if help does not arrive by today, the company will ask the bankruptcy judge to end its labor contract.
A shutdown would leave about 70,000 retirees and recent employees with no or reduced pensions and health care benefits, and force the government to pick up at least some of the tab for what remains. The pension costs alone would be at least $2 billion. 
LTV's predicament -- with creditors on one side saying life support no longer makes sense and workers on the other fighting to preserve jobs and benefits -- may become all too familiar in the future. More companies are liquidating in bankruptcy under pressure from creditors.
In the steel industry alone, 12 companies have shut down since 1998, according to the United Steelworkers of America, and 17 more are now in bankruptcy. The steelworkers union is lobbying for government assistance -- as are Bethlehem Steel, U.S. Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh, which want permission to consolidate in an effort to avoid LTV's fate.
LTV's decision to shut down, announced last month, comes a year into its second bankruptcy. In its first bout with Chapter 11, the company spent seven years in bankruptcy -- one of the longest reorganizations of any American company. Now, LTV's management has concluded that its losses, $2 million a day, are simply too large.
"The company was running out of cash," said James Bonsall Jr., chief restructuring officer of LTV. Unless it began to liquidate, it would be unable to pay off $100 million in bank debt due at the end of the year, he said. Officials at J. P. Morgan Chase, which provided LTV with $582 million shortly after the bankruptcy filing in return for first claim on LTV's assets, declined to comment.
If LTV closes, it will mean the end of a company with roots far from the steel industry. Founded by James Ling, a high school dropout from Hugo, Okla., the predecessor company, known as Ling-Temco-Vought, had interests in electronics and aerospace. An avid conglomerator, Mr. Ling's endless stream of acquisitions landed his company in 14th place on the Fortune 500 in 1967. The following year, he entered the steel business with LTV's $425 million acquisition of Jones & Laughlin Steel. (Mr. Ling was ousted in 1970 under pressure from LTV's banks and has since emerged as an oil industry entrepreneur in Texas.)
LTV sold off the other businesses during its first bankruptcy. "We tried to get rid of the steel business, but we couldn't," said Mark Tomasch, a company spokesman. The steel business was unattractive to buyers, he said, in part because of the large health care obligations.
With $5 billion in revenues last year, LTV was the third-largest integrated steel producer in the United States, operating steel mills in Cleveland and East Chicago, Ind.
LTV's employees, aware that jobs are hard to come by, are fighting to keep the company alive. Their situation has won them the support of members of Congress from the region. Analysts and investment bankers say the workers' expectations are unrealistic, and ultimately side with LTV's management. Demand for LTV's product is too meager to justify the company staying in business, these executives said.
 On Tuesday, the U.S. and 38 other nations agreed to reduce world output of steel by nearly 10 percent over the next decade in an effort to drive up demand. C8. 
"All these politicians want the steel mills to open or reopen, but they never look at the other side of the equation," said Charles Bradford, an independent steel industry analyst and consultant based in New York. "They say, 'Let's make steel,' " Mr. Bradford said, citing a rallying cry of the steelworkers. "But they never think about who's going to buy the stuff."
LTV's business, along with that of the other large steel makers, has steadily weakened in recent years, thanks in part to cheap foreign imports that have been flooding the United States since 1998. (Operators of so-called "mini-mills," which are not always small and recycle scrap steel into new products, have generally remained profitable.)
All the integrated steel companies, including LTV, are also paying benefits to a population far larger than their employees. At LTV, there recently were at least 10 retirees for every worker. The precise number is unclear because the union counts 10,000 more retirees than the company does.
Waves of layoffs beginning in the 1980's and continuing in the last 2 years have swelled the ranks of retirees at most steel companies. A provision in many steelworkers' contracts guarantees them the right to claim retirement benefits early if they are dismissed or if their mills shut down, said Cary Burnell, a member of the research staff at the steelworkers union. As part of their push for industry consolidation, U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel asked Congress two weeks ago to assume some of their health care costs.
LTV's workers are laboring furiously to pull off an 11th-hour rescue, but their prospects are dim. Their union is hoping for a $250 million loan backed by the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board, an arm of the Commerce Department. "We're going to fight like hell to get this loan, and fight like hell to save this company," said Leo Gerard, international president of the steelworkers union.
The company's banks, National City and KeyBank, suspended their efforts to secure such a loan last month, after deciding that they could not adequately demonstrate that the loan could be repaid.
Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota, was hoping to attach an amendment to the economic stimulus bill that would loosen such loan standards, but it is unclear when the bill will come to a vote, said a member of his staff. The union also delivered a letter, signed by 91 members of Congress, to the Commerce Department on Friday urging approval of the loan.
But with the union due to report its progress to the bankruptcy judge today, time may be running out for LTV's workers. Even if the loan is approved, the company says it will not be enough to keep LTV alive. "The company would need close to $1 billion to return to business," said Mr. Tomasch, the spokesman.
If the bankruptcy judge permits, LTV will soon stop paying retirement and health benefits. Some of these expenses will be assumed by the government. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will take over LTV's retirement plan, at what it estimates will be a cost of $2 billion. Retirees over 65 will qualify for Medicare.
Many of LTV's remaining employees will be out of luck. There are limits on the benefits the pension agency will cover, according to Mr. Burnell of the steelworkers. It will not cover, for example, a payment of $400 a month from the company to many steelworkers dismissed between the ages of 50 to 62, intended to tide them over until they qualify for Social Security. Someone with 20 years at LTV typically qualifies for a pension of $1,450 a month, including the $400 monthly payment, but the pension agency would exclude recent enhancements to the pension plan and probably pay about half that amount, Mr. Burnell said.
Employees younger than 65 will also be on their own for medical costs. A fund set up by LTV when it last emerged from bankruptcy to pay for employees' health care probably will be out of money in less than a year, said Mr. Tomasch, the LTV spokesman. Among the benefits that will be lost is a medical plan that covers 80 to 90 percent of the cost of prescriptions ordered by mail. Last year, the company paid $200 million in health care costs, he said.
If LTV's unions are unable to secure the loan, their best hope is to find a buyer for the mills. 
"Plan A is to keep LTV operating and to do our work in Washington, D.C.," said Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democratic representative from the Cleveland area, where LTV has it's biggest mill. "Plan B is to prepare our community to invite a new buyer for LTV, including providing incentives."
Finding a buyer for the Cleveland mill will not be easy. "There is excess capacity around the world, and the Cleveland mill is one of the highest-cost mills," said Mr. Bradford, the independent analyst.
Even if a buyer is found, that might not help LTV's current employees. The mills will be more attractive to a buyer without the workers, Mr. Bradford said, because then they would not be forced to assume the health care costs.

HEADLINE: Pataki Looks At the Past And Future 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Looking back on 2001, Gov. George E. Pataki said today that the horrific events of Sept. 11 had marked him and the entire state forever. Looking forward, the two-term Republican predicted the coming year would be one of the hardest periods in the state's history.
 "We are facing the most difficult financial situation in the state since probably before the Great Depression," Mr. Pataki said in a wide-ranging interview with reporters. "We are all going to have to tighten our belts. We are all going to have to understand when you talk the magnitude of six or eight billion dollars in lost revenues, it means the state is not going to be able to do some of the things we were able to do before Sept. 11." 
 Mr. Pataki has yet to officially announce his candidacy for re-election, yet he laid out in forceful terms why he wants a third term as governor, despite having said in 1994 that a governor should serve no more than two terms.
"There are many important decisions that have to be made, and I would like to be in the position to make those decisions," he said.
The governor maintained that he had made the right financial decisions over the last six years, restraining spending and setting aside large reserves. He argued that the state was better prepared to face this economic downturn than it had been in 1990, when a recession forced midyear cuts to school aid.
"We have changed this state's finances in a way that few would have thought possible in 1994, turning the record multibillion-dollar deficits into surpluses while at the same time being able to lead the nation in cutting taxes and having record investments in education and in the environment," he said. "All of this now is at risk."
Mr. Pataki has raised state spending about 34 percent since he took office in 1995, more than double the 16 percent rise in the cost of living over that time, state records show. He has also cut taxes dramatically. The booming economy made it possible to do both and still build up a $3 billion surplus in recent years, fiscal monitors say. The governor has also added about $10 billion to the state's debt load during his tenure.
But Mr. Pataki warned today that the state was entering into a more austere period. "We have to look at all new proposals in light of the new realities post-Sept. 11," he said.
For example, he declared that the state would not help finance new sports stadiums in New York City, though he said he might consider paying for improving the infrastructure around new arenas. He said many smaller restoration projects would not be financed. He said he was re-examining how to spend $150 million set aside for environmental programs.
The governor acknowledged that he had failed to reach an agreement with lawmakers on a number of important pieces of legisation. A bill that would compel insurance companies to pay for womens' cancer screenings, for instance, has stalled. So have several bills aimed at reducing the cost of auto insurance. Mr. Pataki also failed to reach an agreement with lawmakers on lessening the harsh penalties for drug crimes first passed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
He said that the idea of reaching a policy agreement on changing a law more than 30 years old was not "necessarily the most realistic."
For his part, he said Sept. 11 had caused him to re-examine his family life. He spoke about making time for movies with his family and to read "The Lord of the Rings" to his son.
"I think all of us just appreciate our families, our communities, our homes, more than we did on Sept. 11, because we can't take them for granted," he said.

HEADLINE: Panel Asks Raise for Low-Pay Harvard Workers 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
A study commission forced on Harvard University by protesting students recommended yesterday that the university sharply increase the pay of its janitors, guards and other low-wage workers. But the proposed raises would mean pay that still falls short of the "living wage" the students continue to demand.
 For three weeks last spring, nearly 40 students occupied the first floor of Massachusetts Hall, where Harvard's president has his office. Their noisy sit-in, the longest ever at a Harvard building, ultimately led Neil L. Rudenstine, then the president, to appoint the commission. 
 In acting yesterday, the 19-member panel approved the recommendations unanimously. But several members said Harvard's low-end workers had to earn at least $15 to $20 an hour, rather than the $10.83 to $11.30 that the commission recommended, to support a family in the Boston area adequately. Harvard now pays as little as $8.50 an hour to some of the 970 workers cited in the report.
In a statement, Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard's current president, indicated that he would act on the report in January. He called it a "very constructive document that outlines a promising direction."
The commission, whose members include 12 Harvard professors and administrators, as well as students and workers, decided against proposing a fixed "living wage." Instead, it recommended a floor of $10.83 to $11.30 an hour; increases above that level, for union and nonunion workers alike, would be determined in collective bargaining.
If Mr. Summers agrees, wages will rise immediately to the floor level, at a cost that the committee put at roughly $3 million. That comes to an increase of about $170 a year for each of Harvard's 18,600 students, for whom tuition is now $30,000. Or the money could come from Harvard's endowment, of $20 billion. 
The proposed $10.83 to $11.30 would have been the wage level today for janitors, security guards, cafeteria workers, gardeners and the like if employees of outside contractors had not increasingly taken over work once done by Harvard's own employees, said the commission's chairman, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist. In doing so, they drove down both Harvard and contracting workers' "real" pay, adjusted for inflation, by as much as 20 percent in the 1990's, the commission said. This erosion was pronounced among janitors but did not occur among clerical workers, for example, who did not face competition from outside contractors.
"The early 90's was clearly a time when the university had some financial issues, and it was looking for ways to cut costs," Mr. Katz said of the increased use of contractors. 
Unions represent nearly all the low-wage workers still employed by Harvard. The commission recommended that the pay levels reached in collective bargaining with these unions apply not only to the Harvard employees but also to nonunion workers furnished by contractors to do the same tasks.
"You use outside contracting for its good qualities -- the efficiency and expertise that it can inject," Mr. Katz said. "We don't want a lazy inside monopoly. But you have to pay the outsiders at least the same wages and benefits that you provide for inside workers."

HEADLINE: With Promise Of Rate Rise, Insurer Halts Plan to Leave 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
New Jersey insurance regulators said yesterday that they were permitting the American International Group, the state's sixth-largest auto insurer, to increase its rates, and the insurance company said it was suspending its plans to shut down operations in the state.
 The agreement, which permits A.I.G. to raise its rates by an average of 8.9 percent and to increase some by as much as 30 percent, was the latest of several steps by the regulators to encourage insurers to continue doing business in the state. 
 A.I.G., which insures 213,000 autos in New Jersey, announced plans to leave the state last June, shortly after State Farm, the state's largest insurer, said it was leaving. 
In another development yesterday, the regulators said that Ohio Casualty-NJ had decided to get out of the auto insurance business in New Jersey and turn over -- at no charge -- its 109,000 policyholders in the state to a relatively new and small company, the Proformance Insurance Company in Freehold.
Many New Jersey auto insurers, which were forced by the State Legislature to reduce rates by 15 percent in the spring of 1999, say they cannot operate profitably and, because of heavy regulation, lack the flexibility to cope with changing economic conditions.
In the last several weeks, the regulators have approved increases for several companies, including State Farm, and they permitted State Farm to shift drivers to more expensive pricing categories, sharply increasing costs for many drivers and increasing the insurers' revenues.
Chris Neal, a spokesman for State Farm, said the changes would allow his company to increase its annual revenue by at least 14 percent, or about 2.8 percent less than it had requested. He said the company's finances were still deteriorating and that it still intended to withdraw.
Under the agreement reached yesterday, A.I.G. will add a second subsidiary in New Jersey. The old one will increase rates an average of 8.9 percent; the new one, beginning with riskier drivers, will charge 10 percent to 30 percent more than its predecessor.

HEADLINE: Budget Talks Going Down To the Wire At City Hall 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
As night fell over City Hall yesterday, officials were still negotiating over the city's budget, unsure whether they would reach an agreement before the final voting session of the City Council, scheduled for today.
 Giuliani administration officials and Council officials were trying to reach agreement on cutbacks in city programs that could help close a projected budget gap of more than $1 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30. At issue are the depth of cutbacks in items like day care slots or AIDS prevention plans, or the hours at libraries and parks services. 
 "There are so many issues that we're trying to resolve," said Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Council Finance Committee, adding that discussions would probably continue into the night. Even though there was "a desire to reach an agreement," he added, it was impossible to say whether they would. 
Some officials were optimistic. Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the Council, said the two sides were close. "There is the framework of a deal, but the t's still need to be crossed and the i's need to be dotted," he said.
If an agreement is reached and the proposed modification to the budget comes before the Council for a vote today, it would have to pass by two-thirds rather than a simple majority, and Council officials were only cautiously optimistic that they could find the 34 supporters necessary. If the Council votes against the modified budget, then the books would be left unbalanced for the next administration to work out, Mr. Barowitz said.
A City Hall official said yesterday that the administration had been negotiating with Council staff members for several days, and that some Council projects that had been cut would be reinstated and that some substitute measures like leftover campaign finance money would be used to plug the holes.
The Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, is eager to come to an agreement, the official said, because failure to reach a deal would reflect poorly on his final year in office. Mr. Barowitz would say only, "Throughout his career, the speaker has always done what is best for the city."
Mr. Vallone clearly prides himself on his ability to negotiate with the administration. Throughout his unsuccessful candidacy for mayor this year frequently boasted of the Council's prowess under his leadership in budgetary matters, from accurate revenue forecasts to fiscal responsibility, and cited its record of passing balanced budgets by the mandated deadline, unlike legislators in Albany.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Vallone was hopeful he would be able to collect enough votes to pass a budget at this afternoon's session, but by last night, officials were somewhat less confident. 
"Peter knows it's very difficult to get members to vote on a budget 11 days before the end of office, and how hard it is to get a vote to cut the programs these people have fought for their entire careers," an official said.
Another official, agreeing that some Council members had been less eager to work with the mayor's office, said, "Peter wants to make sure he can get to members."
The cuts, made necessary by a projected $1.2 billion deficit caused by the terror attack and a weakening national economy, include financing for child care, library programs, mental health services for the elderly and school maintenance, as well as savings achieved through technical budget alterations.
Also targeted for reduction or elimination were various projects that had been financed by the Council but not yet started, including a $5 million program to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs, an infant mortality prevention program in the city's 10 poorest areas and a $5 million H.I.V. prevention program.
Recently, there have been almost daily protests or news conferences on the steps of City Hall by advocates whose programs are threatened. Just yesterday, members of the NYC Coalition for a Smoke Free City protested a Giuliani administration proposal to halve and eventually eliminate $13 million in tobacco settlement money earmarked for a smoking reduction program.
Already, said Joanne Koldare, a spokeswoman for the coalition, smoking cessation programs, run mostly by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation to serve poor New Yorkers, are being eliminated and workers are being told to find new jobs. 
"This is something that will have short and long and medium-term effects" on the city's health and its economy, she said.
Around midday yesterday, it had appeared that the two sides might reach an agreement before the day was out. Asked how close they were to a final budget, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said, "Close, but no cigar." The mayor made his remarks while in the light-bulb aisle of a new Home Depot store in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. "We've resolved a lot of differences, but we're not quite exactly there yet, although we've narrowed the gaps quite a bit."
Later yesterday, city and Council officials haggled over still more details but Council officials said they hoped to restore financing for about half of what the administration had wanted to cut from various programs, including libraries, cultural institutions, parks, infant mortality reduction and AIDS prevention.

HEADLINE: Talks in Congress Break Down Over Health Benefit for Jobless 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Talks between the two parties in Congress on a proposed economic recovery package moved to the brink of collapse tonight, with Democrats and Republicans deeply divided over tax cuts and how best to deliver health insurance subsidies to the unemployed.
 After another day of fruitless back and forth, House Republican leaders said tonight that they would bring their own stimulus bill to the floor on Wednesday to highlight their plan and what they say has been a substantial effort on their part to compromise. 
 Neither side declared the effort to address the recession dead. But Democrats had made clear that they would view a decision by House Republicans to bring up their own bill a political stunt that would undermine any remaining chance of a deal. 
"They have an open invitation to call me," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader in the House, referring to Democratic leaders.
But Mr. Armey said no further negotiations were scheduled. And throughout the day, members of both parties highlighted the depth of their differences rather than common ground.
Democrats and Republicans remained at odds over a number of issues, including tax cuts for individuals and businesses. But the most difficult issue remained providing health insurance coverage to people who have lost their jobs.
Republicans pushed an approach built on giving laid-off workers a tax credit that they would use to buy coverage from insurers. Concerned that such an approach would leave unemployed workers little leverage with insurance companies, Democrats demanded that the subsidies be delivered through existing health plans provided by employers.
"There's a real difference of approach here," said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, "and I'm not sure it's mendable." 
The bill the House intends to take up has almost no chance of winning the 60 votes it would need to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate, and members of both parties said they saw it as an opportunity to make clear the differences between them heading into an election year.
The new bill would cut the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent starting Jan. 1, scale back the corporate alternative minimum tax, provide breaks to businesses for investment and give low-income workers a one-time $300-a-person rebate.
The bill would not include some provisions included in the stimulus bill passed by the House in October, including full repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax and a reduction in the capital gains tax. It would provide $33 billion in assistance to unemployed workers next year, up from $13 billion under the original House bill.
Republicans said Democrats were obstructing a reasonable deal that would help laid-off workers and help generate jobs by cutting taxes for individuals and their employers. Republicans singled out Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader, suggesting that he was playing politics with the economy. 
Mr. Armey said Mr. Daschle, "more than any other single person, is the guy standing there with his foot on it." 
Mr. Daschle said Republicans were insisting on tax cuts that would primarily help upper-income Americans and businesses at the expense of people who were struggling after losing jobs.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FEDERAL AID; 
NEGOTIATORS BACK $8.2 BILLION IN AID FOR NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Negotiators for the House and the Senate agreed tonight to provide New York with an additional $8.2 billion in emergency aid to help recover from the World Trade Center terrorist attack and also approved billions more dollars for tighter domestic security nationwide as part of a broader defense appropriations bill.
 The negotiators planned to set aside slightly more, $8.3 billion, to pay for the domestic security provisions, including fighting bioterrorism, protecting the food supply and toughening security along the nation's ports and its borders. 
 The allocations for aid to New York and improving domestic security had held up passage of the far-reaching $317.5 billion defense legislation for days. 
The relief package for New York ends months of wrangling on Capitol Hill. New York lawmakers had become increasingly concerned that unless the city won a $20 billion allocation now, it would never get that amount of reconstruction aid promised by President Bush in the days after the Sept. 11 attack. 
Many New York lawmakers have argued that given Republican control of the White House and the House, the city's case has been growing weaker as memories of the attack fades and competing demands for federal dollars emerge from other states.
The $8.2 billion aid package for New York falls short of initial pledges after the attack, even when it is combined with nearly $3 billion in federal assistance that has already been spent to cover the costs of rescue and recovery at ground zero. The compromise will provide money for for grants and loans to small businesses, compensation for losses suffered by hospitals, and help for the disabled and displaced, among other things. 
But the White House and Republican leaders in Congress have said that they intend to deliver the rest of the money to New York -- though they have not said when, exactly, that will be.
Today, New York lawmakers sought to put the best face on the agreement, declaring it a victory of sorts. But they also vowed to return next year and press their colleagues to deliver the remainder of the $20 billion.
New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, called the $8.2 billion aid package just one more step toward getting the city the money it needs. "Every day, we make a little progress," he said. "It's like the Battle of Stalingrad. You fight house by house, but eventually you win."
Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from New York, put the matter more bluntly than her colleague. "It's deeply disappointing that we don't have the entire $20 billion," she said. "New York should have the money now."
For days, the negotiations over how much aid to provide for New York and domestic security had held up final agreement on the $317.5 billion defense appropriation bill. The House planned to vote on the package as early as Thursday, and the Senate may follow suit.
The additional money for New York and for domestic security will be included as an amendment to the annual spending bill for the Defense Department. Negotiators also agreed to provide $3.5 billion for defense, money that the Bush administration had requested.
Democrats had initially sought to spend far more on the reconstruction effort in New York and on domestic security than the $16.5 billion that was agreed upon today. But the president had threatened to veto a bill with that amount.
Democratic and Republican lawmakers predicted that Mr. Bush would seek additional money for New York in January when he submits his annual budget request to Congress.
Roughly speaking, the deal reached today on the New York aid package represented the middle ground between competing proposals approved by the House and the Senate. The Senate had sought to provide about $9.5 billion for the reconstruction effort in New York, while the House approved a smaller amount for that purpose, roughly $7 billion.
The $8.2 billion includes some money for relief efforts in the other areas that terrorists struck: in Virginia, the site of the Pentagon, and Pennsylvania, where one of the four hijacked planes went down. 
The overall aid package for New York provides about $4.3 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to spend on the debris removal and rescue and recovery efforts at ground zero.
More than that, New York lawmakers said, the package also includes about $2 billion in economic development money that that does not come with as many strings as other forms of federal aid.
City and state officials had been lobbying heavily for this federal money. They say they plan to use this money to, among other things, provide grants to small business owners and residents in Lower Manhattan who do not qualify for money from FEMA.
The New York rescue plan also envisions spending $140 million to reimburse New York hospitals; $175 million for workers' compensation insurance; $32.5 million for job training for displaced workers; $75 million for repairs on the West Side Highway; $120 million in loans from the Small Business Administration; $51 million for crisis intervention counseling; and $110 million to repair roads in Lower Manhattan.
In a statement issued by her office tonight, New York's junior senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called the agreement reached today a down payment by the federal government to help rebuild New York. 
"We are not letting up on our continuing battle to insure that resources continue to flow to the city and state, and we will begin the next session of Congress with new requests for funding, because the needs are great and time is of the essence," she said.
As part of today's overall agreement on defense spending, House and Senate negotiators approved a contentious deal involving Boeing. The airplane manufacturer persuaded negotiators to approve a plan under which the Air Force would lease 100 new wide-body Boeing jets for use as refueling tankers, at a cost of $20 million a year for each plane -- up to $20 billion over 10 years. 
Some members of Congress said it would have been less expensive for the Air Force to simply buy the planes.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
Recipe for Rebuilding: Afghan Muscle, Marine Planning, Lots of Dollars

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: KANDAHAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Afghanistan, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Marine C-130 cargo aircraft lumbering into the airport here in total darkness each night have carried in troops, equipment, water and, now, large amounts of American dollars.
 The cash -- the exact amount is something of a secret -- represents a new beginning in the American war in Afghanistan. After relentlessly attacking the Taliban's political and military stronghold here in Kandahar, the marine-led force occupying the airport has set about rebuilding it, providing a welcome boost for the desperate local economy. 
 The first investments arrived this morning at the heavily fortified base that the marines are establishing here: two new water pumps, made in Japan, bought in Kandahar and brought to the airport by six Afghans who immediately got to work installing them. 
They cost $325 each, "which is less than what we'd pay for them in the U.S.," said Master Sgt. Perry A. Toomer, an Army contracts officer and now the man with his hand on the military's till.
The marines who occupied Kandahar's airport four days ago now face a monumental task repairing it as they turn it into a hub for military goods and eventually for relief supplies.
The undulating fan-shaped terminal is aging and badly damaged. Most of its windows were blown out by the blast of an American missile just outside the main entrance. 
The runways are precisely pocked at each intersection by gaping craters, preventing larger cargo jets, like C-17's, from landing just yet. From one end to the other are mines, unexploded bombs and war debris, including the twisted remains of Soviet helicopters and transport planes.
As they begin their task, though, the marines have made clear that they intend to turn as much of the work as possible over to Afghans, a potential boon for an economy ravaged for years by civil war and international isolation.
"The first phase was winning the war," Lt. Cmdr. Glen Cooke, the commander of the Navy's detachment of Seabees, said today as a crew filled a 12-foot crater in the center runway. "Now we're here to support these people."
That support began almost immediately.
Sergeant Toomer arrived from Fort McPherson, Ga., on Saturday, a day after marines rolled into the airport in convoys of armored vehicles. On Sunday, three Afghans appeared at the base's wire gate, asking for a generator they had left here. 
Their generator had already been put to use, but Sergeant Toomer seized the opportunity and a new partnership was born. "I started talking to them," he said, "and found out they had knowledge of how to get this place started."
The three came back not long after daybreak today with three more -- all fighters loyal to Gul Agha Sharzai, the new governor of Kandahar Province -- and began the backbreaking work of removing a broken-down, American-made well pump and installing the two new ones.
"Because you are our guest, we should help each other," said one of the men, known as some in Afghan tradition by only one name, Gulalay, who serves as commander of Mr. Sharzai's forces around the airport. "We want to help you for a long, long time."
Around the airport, there is certainly plenty of work to be done.
For the American force here, the priority was the well; water is needed to make concrete and flush the toilets. Once the well is working, commanders plan to fly in a water-filtration system, easing the strain on cargo aircraft hauling in pallets of spring water. Next, the Seabees will work on electricity and permanent repairs to the runways. 
"Anything we can do to reduce the stuff we bring in here is a good thing," Commander Cooke said. "Not only does it help reduce our footprint here, it also helps the local economy."
Sergeant Toomer, the contracts officer, said he would negotiate contracts for work under the same guidelines the military uses everywhere else. Still, these are clearly not normal Pentagon procurement procedures. "I'm still getting into it," he said. "This is totally new for everybody here."
For the pumps, he simply asked for a receipt. By day's end, however, there seemed to be some confusion over pay for the six men laboring over the well.
"We're still working out the labor costs," the sergeant said, adding that it would be based on a fair local wage so as not to skew Afghanistan's economy with a flash flood of dollars.
The men, however, said they were happy to volunteer. In addition to the pumps, they even brought the local bread, dodi. "It is our happiness to fix the airport," said Assad Jan, an aide to Commander Gulalay who once worked for the United Nations. "It is our country. Money is nothing to us."
Later, he pulled out a scrap of note paper. "One of your commanders gave me a list," he said.
On it were a generator, a metric ton of cement, plywood, two-by-fours, 200 yards of electrical wire and a circular saw -- all of which he promised to bring, even though the Id al-Fitr holiday for the end of Ramadan had closed many stores.
"Today, we brought in bread," Mr. Jan said. "Inshallah, tomorrow we will bring everything, like Pepsi-Cola."

HEADLINE: Study Says a Slumping Economy Doesn't Mean Crime Will Rise 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
Higher unemployment and a faltering economy will not necessarily lead to higher crime in New York City if the police continue their effective enforcement efforts, according to a study released yesterday by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.
 In fact, the researchers found that many areas of New York that had higher unemployment in recent years actually had slightly sharper declines in crime, in part because of innovative patrol strategies by police officers. 
 "They really make a difference," said Prof. George L. Kelling, a criminologist at Rutgers University and a co-author of the study, titled "Do Police Matter? An Analysis of the Impact of New York City's Police Reforms." 
Professor Kelling is a senior fellow at the institute, a conservative research group, and is an author of the "broken windows" theory, which says that the key to fighting crime is to address all offenses, even seemingly minor ones. In remarks yesterday at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan, Professor Kelling said his study was intended to empirically test the assumption that the decline in the use of crack cocaine and the booming economy of the 1990's had more to do with the drop in crime than police enforcement efforts.
As part of the analysis, the researchers looked at crime statistics for all 76 police precincts from 1989 to 1998 and correlated them against data that measured the borough unemployment rates, the number of young men in the neighborhoods and the use of cocaine. They found that crime dropped sharply in nearly every precinct, including those that had widely divergent numbers of poor people or drug users.
In particular, the study found no evidence that the declining use of cocaine, as measured by hospital discharges for cocaine-related episodes, was associated with a drop in crime, or that the escalating use was associated with an increase.
More likely, Professor Kelling said, the declines were precipitated by the "broken windows" approach to law enforcement, in which the police made many more misdemeanor arrests for lesser offenses in hopes of creating a sense of social order that deterred crime.
Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University, said he was not convinced that the study had damaged the thesis that the economy and a drop-off in drug use were important contributing factors. For one thing, he said, the data used to measure unemployment was too blunt and unreliable.

HEADLINE: Pact to Cut Steel Production Doesn't End Risk of Trade War 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
After two days of talks here intended to ease the world's glut of steel, representatives from 39 nations announced an agreement in principle today to cut production by about 10 percent over the next decade.
 But the agreement is not binding, and it does not eliminate the risk of a serious trade war between the United States and other big steel exporters. 
 Last week, the United States International Trade Commission recommended tariffs of up to 40 percent on imported steel products and President Bush is supposed to decide on what action to take by the third week in February. 
Even as officials here were putting the final touches on their communique today, the European Union's top negotiator warned that the United States was dangerously close to inciting a spiral of trade sanctions.
"Those who have their finger on the trigger of protective actions carry a huge responsibility," said Peter Carl, the European Commission's director general in charge of trade issues.
The United States is pressing steel-producing countries around the world to lower output by closing inefficient and unprofitable factories.
United States officials contend that the world has an annual excess production capacity of 200 million tons of steel. European officials say the number is about 100 million tons, but virtually all countries agree that the glut of unwanted steel is huge.
Prices for crude steel have plunged about 30 percent this year and are at the lowest levels in two decades.
The United States is most worried about imports from the European Union, not Asia and Latin America. But European officials said today that the proposed tariffs would affect most if not all of their exports to the United States, and they have vowed to fight them in the World Trade Organization.
Pascal Lamy, the European Commission's trade commissioner, complained last week that the United States was making countries negotiate "with a gun at their head."
But Grant Aldonas, the United States under secretary for commerce in charge of trade issues, rejected European contention that a resort to "safeguard" measures like high import tariffs would violate laws of the World Trade Organization.
"I don't know how you draw the conclusion that somehow that the W.T.O. doesn't allow it," Mr. Aldonas said. "What they are basically asking us to do is give up our W.T.O. rights."
But while American officials deny any intention of using the threat of sanctions to press other countries into production cutbacks, bargaining is definitely under way.
In the meetings that took place here, sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, about 26 countries laid out forecasts that entail reductions in output of nearly 100 million tons of steel a year.
The forecasts are goals, not contractual commitments. The idea is that even in countries where steel mills are privately owned, governments can bring about reductions in output by removing subsidies and other public incentives that keep unprofitable mills going.
The United States predicts that American steel production will decline by 14 million to 17 million tons this year, based largely on announcements that American companies have made.
The European Union estimated that its production could drop by about 13 million tons a year. South Korea, one of the world's biggest and most competitive producers, said it could cut annual production by three million tons and Japan proposed about four million tons.

HEADLINE: Drive for More Mental Health Coverage Fails in Congress 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
A bid to give millions of Americans greater access to mental health care died in Congress tonight as House members rejected a Senate proposal to eliminate disparities in insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses.
 The action followed 45 minutes of impassioned debate over the rights of people with mental disorders. "This is one of the most important social and civil rights issues in the United States," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who had offered the proposal approved by the Senate in October. 
 Mr. Domenici, who has a daughter with schizophrenia, and Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, whose brother has severe mental illness, pleaded with House members to outlaw the widespread limits on treatment for psychiatric disorders. 
But at a meeting of House and Senate negotiators, the House members rejected the Senate proposal by a party-line vote of 10 to 7. The House Republicans all voted no. The House Democrats all voted yes.
Mr. Domenici and Mr. Wellstone said they wanted to require health plans and insurance companies to provide equivalent coverage, or parity, for mental and physical illnesses.
House Republicans, employers and insurance companies objected to the proposal, saying it would increase costs for employers in a recession, when many businesses are already cutting health benefits because of a resurgence in medical inflation.
The Senate had required "mental health parity" in an amendment to the annual spending bill for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education and Labor. Mr. Domenici, Mr. Wellstone and their supporters, including the American Medical Association and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, vowed to continue their efforts next year.
"We let insurance companies operate on the ridiculous presumption that people with schizophrenia are not sick," Mr. Domenici told members of the House-Senate conference committee. "I am begging you to use your influence to get a vote on this issue in the House."
Democrats described the question as a moral issue. "This amendment is directed against injustice," said David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, said, "If we pass this amendment, we save lives." Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said, "This issue is a challenge to the conscience of this committee and Congress."
But Representative Anne M. Northup, Republican of Kentucky, said the Senate proposal would force insurers to increase premiums, co-payments and other charges. "Insurance companies won't take in $1 million worth of premiums and pay out $2 million worth of benefits," Ms. Northup said.
Powerful House Republicans, including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and three committee chairmen, said the appropriations bill was not a proper vehicle for setting national policy on health benefits.
President Bush steered clear of the fight. In a letter to Senator Domenici, Mr. Bush said he wanted to "reduce the stigma of mental illness," and he noted that, as governor of Texas, he had signed a bill to reduce disparities in coverage of mental and physical illnesses.
But Mr. Bush said he had concerns about the effects of the Domenici-Wellstone bill on "employers' ability to provide benefits and coverage, particularly during a time of economic recession and rapidly rising health care costs." In particular, Mr. Bush said, "I am concerned that employers may scale back health benefits or that individuals will lose coverage because they cannot afford the premium increases that are expected for next year."
Mr. Bush said he would work with Congress next year to devise "a solution" that reduced disparities in insurance coverage without significantly increasing health costs.
At present, people who are treated for mental illnesses like schizophrenia or depression often face higher co-payments and deductibles than they would pay for the treatment of physical ailments, like diabetes or cancer. Likewise, many insurance plans cover fewer visits to a doctor, and fewer days in a hospital, when the patient has a mental illness.
The appropriations bill, which is expected to win quick approval from both houses of Congress and Mr. Bush later this week, provides a total of $123.8 billion, up 11 percent.
The bill would increase the budget of the National Institutes of Health by nearly 15 percent, to $23.3 billion in the current fiscal year, which began on Sept. 1, up from $20.3 billion.
Congress is in the fourth year of a bipartisan effort to double the budget of the N.I.H., which had a budget of $13.6 billion in 1998. But the agency has been without a presidentially appointed director since Dr. Harold E. Varmus left in December 1999.

 BODY:
 After Fighting, Fleeing

OVER THE BORDER -- Hundreds of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters have slipped across the Afghan border and evaded the Pakistani Army to disappear into remote tribal areas of Pakistan, Western and Pakistani officials said. A1

REBUILDING AN AIRPORT -- After relentlessly attacking the Taliban's political and military stronghold in Kandahar, the marine-led force occupying the airport has set about rebuilding it, providing a welcome boost for the desperate local economy. B3

CLOAK OF THE PROPHET -- In Kandahar, inside a shrine that is considered one of the most holy places in Afghanistan, lies an ancient, sacred robe. Said to be the cloak of the prophet Muhammad, it inspires so much awe among Afghans that it has caused the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, to tremble. B1

Fragile New Regime

UNCERTAINTY AT TORA BORA -- The commanders of an eastern anti-Taliban alliance have declared total victory over the final remnants of Osama bin Laden's troops in their midst. But a trek through Tora Bora reveals a more complicated denouement. A1

DEAL ON SECURITY FORCE -- After a week of intense negotiations, Afghan and British officials agreed that fewer than 100 British royal marines would deploy in Kabul before a new interim government takes power on Saturday, western diplomats said. The marines will be the vanguard of an international force that will expand to 2,000 to 4,000 soldiers in the next several weeks. B1

SUPPORT FOR NEW LEADER -- Hamid Karzai, who is to become Afghanistan's new leader on Saturday, received the blessing of his country's deposed king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, and a pledge of assistance from Italy's prime minister. Mr. Karzai said his government's first priority would be to combat terrorism "not only in Afghanistan, but everywhere in the world." B2

Redefining the War

NATO'S ROLE EXAMINED -- Declaring that the war on terrorism will not end in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld urged America's NATO allies to shift their focus and resources to fighting terror around the world. B1

DETAILS OF ANTITERROR EFFORT -- The United States will present to the United Nations today a detailed report of steps it has taken to combat international terrorism, hoping it will give teeth to a Security Council resolution requiring all nations to join in the struggle. B4

VIOLENCE IN YEMEN -- Yemeni special operations troops exchanged fire with tribesmen in remote parts of central Yemen as the troops tried to capture suspected members of Al Qaeda. Four tribesmen were killed and eight people, including soldiers, were injured. B4

Suspects and Inquiries

A DEFENSE STRATEGY -- A prominent San Francisco lawyer, James J. Brosnahan, is trying to alter public perceptions of John Walker Lindh, the American captured with the Taliban. But in trying to fend off a treason charge, he must persuade an audience of just one, President Bush, who will probably make the final decision on how the government handles the case. A1

QUESTIONS FOR PRISONERS -- Eight F.B.I. agents arrived at the airport in Kandahar to begin interrogating captured Al Qaeda fighters, including 15 prisoners in the custody of the marines, and hardened fighters from the battle in the mountains above Tora Bora. American officials hope for a potential investigative bonanza into the workings of the terrorist network. B5

ON THE MONEY TRAIL -- Interpol has reached an agreement with the United States to create a database to provide law enforcement agencies around the world with quick access to information for the crackdown on terrorist financial networks, Treasury Department officials said. B5

JORDANIAN EX-OFFICIAL DETAINED -- A retired Jordanian lawmaker, Sheik Dib Aneef Shihadeh, who was in Chicago to lead local Muslims in a celebration of the end of Ramadan, is being detained by the I.N.S. on accusations that his visa was revoked, his lawyer said. B4

Challenges of Recovery

PROGRESS ON AID PLAN -- Negotiators for the House and the Senate agreed to provide New York with $8.2 billion in emergency relief to help recover from the terrorist attacks. They also approved billions more dollars for tighter domestic security measures nationwide as part of a broader $317.2 billion defense appropriations bill. A1

EXTENDING ANTHRAX TREATMENT -- Federal health officials said they would offer the military's anthrax vaccine, as well as extra medicine, to thousands of workers on Capitol Hill and postal employees from Washington and New Jersey who were exposed to anthrax and remain at slight risk of developing the disease, even after a 60-day course of antibiotics. A1

FOCUS ON FIRE RADIOS -- New York Fire Department officials are investigating whether some firefighters engaged in rescue efforts at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 did not hear an order to evacuate the buildings because the handheld radios they were using did not function properly, officials said. B6

DEADLINE EXTENSION SOUGHT -- The airline industry is asking Congress for a 30-day extension of the deadline for inspecting all checked bags for explosives. B5

GOOD DEEDS, BAD INTENT -- Since Sept. 11, some investigators say, pickpockets are increasingly taking advantage of the good will scattered across New York City with a series of scams intended to prey on New Yorkers at their most vulnerable. And the holiday season may only make things worse. D1

ENTERTAINING THE TROOPS -- After a 60-year hiatus, the U.S.O. convened its first large-scale show on a military base in New York City. Bob Hope wasn't on hand for the show, held at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. But the audience of 300 veterans and National Guard troops got singing, dancing and plenty of patriotic eye and ear candy. B6

HEADLINE: All Alone, Again 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Anyone in Washington planning to take the war on terrorism to Iraq after Osama bin Laden is eliminated should not count on Russia's help -- at least for now. The word here when you ask about marching on Baghdad is very simple: "Nyet."
 In case you missed it, President Vladimir Putin of Russia told The Financial Times Monday that the next priority for the war on terrorism should be to "block the financing of terrorist activities. And so far I have no confirmation, no evidence that Iraq is financing the terrorists that we are fighting against." 
 Mr. Putin is not alone in this view. If one looks at the core U.S. coalition against bin Laden, what the different countries have in common is both outrage at the terror acts in America and their own national interest in seeing bin Laden and the Taliban defeated. When it comes to Iraq, that sense of outrage is missing for most coalition members, and more important, their national interests work against an anti-Saddam crusade.
Turkey, which does a big business selling smuggled Iraqi oil, is concerned that a war in Iraq could lead to the creation of a Kurdish mini-state in northern Iraq that would link up with Turkish Kurds. Saudi Arabia is unnerved by the thought of Iraq being weakened as the Sunni Arab counterweight to Iran and the possible creation of an independent Shiite enclave in southern Iraq that would stir up the Shiites of eastern Saudi Arabia. 
Jordan, which is badly infiltrated with Iraqi agents and depends heavily on trade with Iraq, fears being destabilized by any war over Baghdad. Egypt is not eager to see a "nice" leader in Iraq, which would fully reintegrate Baghdad into the Arab state system and enable it to resume its natural rivalry with Egypt for influence over the Arab world. Syria would never support a war on Iraq that, if it succeeded, could lead to Damascus's being targeted next. I could go on.
Russians were never keen on hitting Iraq, but since the Bush team embarrassed Mr. Putin by unilaterally pulling out of the ABM treaty, both he and Russians generally seem even less inclined to help the U.S. attack Baghdad -- absent a taped confession by Saddam. And without the Russians, many European and Arab allies would shy away too. 
"What America is doing in Afghanistan corresponds to our interests and understanding of the situation," said Aleksandr Bovin, a former Russian ambassador to Israel. "Iraq is a different matter. We had well-developed economic ties. We don't want to lose them, and we don't see any danger now from Iraq. Iraqi missiles won't hit either Russia or the U.S. I personally don't care for the ABM treaty, but Bush put Putin in a difficult position that was not necessary. He scrapped ABM right when Putin was saying to people here: 'Look, we're friends with the U.S. now.' It disappointed me and many Russians -- as if Bush wanted to offend someone on purpose. The next time there is a choice to help America, Putin may choose not to help." 
Mr. Bush looked into Putin's eyes, but he didn't look at the world through Putin's eyes. Shortsighted "R" U.S. 
Don't get me wrong. There is no love lost here for Saddam. The Russians could, at best, be brought around to what the foreign affairs analyst Aleksei Pushkov calls "a negative neutralism" toward any U.S. action against Iraq. But the rubles would have to be sorted out in advance. Iraq ran up an $8 billion debt with the Soviet Union that Russia wants paid. The Russians want assurances that Washington will back their view that this debt was incurred by Iraq, and not just by Saddam, in case he is removed and a new Iraqi government says it's not responsible. The Russians also want assurances that if a pro-Western regime is installed in Baghdad, Russian oil companies will not be frozen out of lucrative oil exploration there. With bin Laden, our allies said: "Show me the proof." With Saddam, they will say: "Show me the proof and show me the money. Then we'll think about it." 
Bottom line: the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel part of this antiterrorism war is over. Unlike the Taliban, Saddam has real money to buy off adversaries. Unlike Afghanistan, his country is strategically critical to all its neighbors, most of whom fear any change to the status quo. And unlike bin Laden, Saddam may not make himself an easy, obvious target. That doesn't mean America can't, or shouldn't, look for ways to oust him, but it does mean we should start by planning to do it alone.

HEADLINE: Deficits and Rate Cuts 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right for the wrong reasons in his contention that the Federal Reserve's cuts in short-term interest rates have not encouraged business investment because long-term rates have stayed up (column, Dec. 14). 
 Lower long-term rates would help little now. 
Business is not investing because entrepreneurs see few investment opportunities. Until they do, lower rates will have little effect.
In the meantime, federal deficits, which Mr. Krugman says are driving up interest rates, will fill the gaps left by lower private investment and stimulate consumer spending. At least that is true of the Democratic version of deficit spending, which stresses public investment in education and infrastructure and puts money into the pockets of lower-income recipients, who will spend it right away. Republican tax cuts for the rich and corporations are more questionable.

HEADLINE: Ballet Theater Drops Evening Of Stravinsky 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
American Ballet Theater will not perform its scheduled Stravinsky program at the Metropolitan Opera House in June, because of a revenue shortfall.
 "It's just fiscally prudent," Wallace Chappell, the company's executive director, said of the decision, which is to be formally announced today. 
"We're looking at the potential of a 5 to 10 percent problem on a $30 million budget. It's primarily a result of the recession that already existed before Sept. 11, but it's certainly been heightened since that time." The postponement of the program will save Ballet Theater about $400,000, he said. The company said it had saved an additional $600,000 through staff attrition and cutbacks in publications and the use of consultants. 
 Mr. Chappell said ticket sales were down about 10 percent for the company's fall season at City Center in October. The opening-night gala party raised about 20 percent less than projected. And the company lost much of its audience for its school performances at City Center, when schools did not come.
"We've heard that from other arts organizations in Manhattan as well," Mr. Chappell said. "A lot of the foundations we go to regularly are very preoccupied, and understandably so, with disaster relief. There haven't been too many riding to our rescue like the Mellon Foundation." Ballet Theater has applied for a grant from the $50 million fund created by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation last month for arts institutions affected by the attack. 
The Stravinsky evening, which was to include Glen Tetley's "Rite of Spring" and James Kudelka's new "Firebird" will be replaced by programs already in the company's repertory for the season at the Met.

HEADLINE: Battling for Bullion 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
In the high stakes struggle between Newmont Mining of Denver and South Africa's AngloGold for control of Australia's largest gold producer, Normandy Mining, Barrick Gold of Canada has so far been a silent spectator.
 But Barrick has the highest market value and the strongest balance sheet of any gold producer in the world. And last week, it completed a $2.3 billion acquisition of the Home stake Mining Company of Walnut Creek, Calif., a combination that made Barrick the world's second-largest producer, after AngloGold and just ahead of Newmont. 
 Now all eyes are on Barrick for clues about the outcome of what has become known as the Battle of Normandy, as well as the future shape of the gold-mining industry. 
"They have been the company that has been the most acquisitive," said Margot Naudie, vice president at TD Asset Management in Toronto, which owns about 4 percent of Barrick's stock. "The gold industry is in the throes of a major consolidation. Barrick has played a leading role in that."
AngloGold, which is controlled by the Anglo American Corporation, opened the battle for Normandy in early September. Then Newmont entered the fray with an offer for Normandy as well as for Franco-Nevada Mining of Toronto, which derives most of its income from mineral royalties and is already Normandy's biggest shareholder, with a 19.9 percent stake.
A series of sweetened bids followed.
This month, Normandy's board recommended Newmont's latest bid, valued at around 4.2 billion Australian dollars ($2.2 billion), compared with AngloGold's best offer of 4 billion Australian dollars ($2.1 billion) Both bids are a combination of stock and cash, and the value of both offers has climbed in recent weeks as the gold price has risen. Normandy's share price has risen, surging to a three-and-a-half year high yesterday.
AngloGold has not said whether it will proffer another bid. But last week it said that it would appeal a decision by Australia's Takeover Panel turning down its challenge to the terms of Newmont's offer, and on Tuesday it extended the closing date for its bid from Dec. 27 to Jan. 4.
Should Newmont gain control of Normandy, it would catapult over both AngloGold and Barrick to become the world's biggest gold producer, with 22 mines on five continents producing 8.2 million ounces of gold this year.
The addition of Franco-Nevada, rich in cash and with no debt, would also help put Newmont in a stronger position to challenge Barrick as investors' favorite gold stock. The three companies combined have a market value of $8.8 billion, about the same as Barrick after the Home stake acquisition.
But Barrick has other advantages, including more efficient mines, with total production costs averaging $215 an ounce in the third quarter, compared with $241 for Newmont.
Newmont has also sought to woo investors by pledging to unwind Normandy's hedge book, thereby giving it full exposure to day-to-day movements in the bullion price. Barrick takes a more cautious approach, hedging about a quarter of its reserves. With the gold market largely stagnant in the last decade, that policy has served the Canadian company well, enabling Barrick to receive a price higher than the prevailing market price every quarter for more than four years. But an unhedged company would reap a bigger windfall from an upturn in the gold price.
"If investors are looking for leverage to the gold price, they're likely to choose Newmont" if and when it gains control of Normandy, said Victor Flores, an analyst at HSBC Securities in Toronto.
It is an open secret that the Toronto-based Barrick would prefer to see AngloGold, rather than Newmont, in charge at Normandy. With the bulk of AngloGold's operations in a country with a weak currency and an uncertain political future, the South Africans are seen as a lesser threat. And Barrick's chief executive, Randall Oliphant, is good friends with Robert M. Godsell, AngloGold's chief. (Mr. Oliphant said in a recent interview that he also liked Wayne W. Murdy, chief executive of Newmont, but did not know him as well.)
Mr. Oliphant sees the tussle for Normandy as another stage in a long-overdue consolidation in an industry where 56 companies are significant players, each producing more than 100,000 ounces a year.
And citing Barrick's own recent forays into relatively unstable parts of the world like Peru and Tanzania, Mr. Oliphant said, "We're going to have to become larger to absorb these risks, similar to what oil companies have done."
Furthermore, large and liquid companies will be "more appealing to fund managers," he said, and in a better position to cooperate in promoting new uses for gold.
Experts differ about whether Barrick will turn its attention to Normandy, now that the Homestake deal is completed.
According to a manager of a gold fund in the United States that has equity stakes in all four companies involved, "Strategically, it makes a lot of sense for Barrick to step in, and it wouldn't surprise me if they did." For instance, Homestake and Normandy are already partners in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Mines in western Australia, known as the Super Pit.
But Barry Allan, an analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, said Barrick would be wise to "do nothing." Instead, he said, it would do better to wait for an opportunity to snap up Newmont. The two companies have operations in several parts of the world, including Australia, northern Ontario and Nevada, where they could reap sizeable economies of scale. "Every time they look across their property line, they see eyeball-to-eyeball," Mr. Allan said.
Barrick's chief is playing his cards close to his chest. On one hand, Mr. Oliphant said that "if anybody's got synergies with Normandy, it's Barrick." He added that, with the Homestake deal, "we're more knowledgeable about Australia than we've ever been before."
But he also said that Barrick would take "the traditional disciplined approach that we bring to everything."
"Producing lots of gold," he added, "is not the way to produce market value."

HEADLINE: Group to Give 150,000 Tickets To Victims' Families 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
As part of a continued push to provide emotional solace to victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 as well as economic stimulus to New York cultural institutions, two new plans to give away thousands of free and discounted tickets to cultural and other events are beginning this week.
 The first plan, to be announced today, is the Gift of New York and involves the donation of 150,000 tickets to families of victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and United Airlines Flight 93, the hijacked airplane that crashed in Pennsylvania. 
 The tickets, available through April 2003, are to a wide array of cultural and entertainment events and institutions, ranging from giants like the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, an 80-seat alternative comedy space on West 22nd Street in Chelsea. More than 100 organizations are involved, including the New York Yankees and the New York Mets, the 92nd Street Y, the Central Park Zoo, "Saturday Night Live" and more than a dozen Broadway and Off Broadway productions. 
"Nobody said no," said Andrew Tisch, the chairman of the executive committee of the Loews Corporation, who started the effort with Andrea Bronfman, who is the deputy chairwoman of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies of New York. 
"Nobody has talked about how do I get paid," Mr. Tisch said. "They just want to be a part of it."
The plan will begin shortly after New Year. Mr. Tisch said he expected 30,000 family members to be eligible for the tickets, which will be listed on a Web site, www.thegiftofnewyork.org. Organizers estimate the value of the tickets at about $6 million. Families will initially be sent a letter signed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor-elect, and they will receive a pass card listing the institutions that they can attend free. For ticketed events, like a New York Knicks game or a Broadway show, families can order seats through the Internet only. Tickets will be handled by the new, nonprofit Gift of New York organization rather than through a commercial tickets broker like Ticketmaster. 
While those tickets are being distributed, another plan to promote Broadway, one of the prime tourist draws in New York, will begin. Starting on Jan. 6, the League of American Theaters and Producers, backed by $1 million from New York State, is to deliver 3.4 million coupon booklets offering discounts on Broadway tickets, Midtown hotels, parking garages and theater district restaurants. The booklets will be in many Sunday newspapers throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
While winter discounts on Broadway tickets are common, such a widespread campaign is rare. The state money, from the Empire State Development Corporation, will cover the cost of printing and distributing the 28-page booklets. 
Nancy Coyne, one of Broadway's leading advertising executives, said the goal was to keep a flow of local audiences pouring into the theater district as the number of national and international tourists has dropped. A recent survey by the league found that since Sept. 11, half the Broadway audience has come from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, compared with about 43 percent last season. Over all, Broadway sales this season are about 85 percent of what they were last season. 
"The goal is to encourage the people who have come this fall to keep coming back," said Ms. Coyne, whose agency, Serino Coyne Inc., is leading the program. "They went all out to support us, so we wanted to make a concerted effort to thank them."
The plan is just the latest in a series of promotions to bolster Broadway, which has mostly rebounded from its post-Sept. 11 malaise but remains on shaky ground entering the tourist-starved winter. Last week, the Giuliani administration announced a $2.5 million stimulus plan to buy Broadway tickets to struggling shows.
That plan has drawn criticism from smaller Off Broadway theaters whose managements say that their economic concerns are being overlooked. Perhaps in reaction to that, the coupon book includes a page that entitles holders to a 25 percent discount on 28 Off Broadway productions. 
The league also wants to lure audiences from beyond the region with a U.S.O.-style tour of Broadway stars. Details were still being firmed up yesterday, but tentative plans have called for a 13-city tour beginning in late January, with about 15 performers in a musical revue. No actors have been announced. 
Stops would include Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Raleigh-Durham, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington. In each city, the troupe would give away Broadway tickets as well as discounts for flights and hotels.
As with many of the promotions, the New York Loves America Tour, as it is being billed, aims to entertain and entice the audiences that Broadway needs to survive. 
"We thought this would be a perfect way to give back to our country," said Jed Bernstein, the league president, "while helping build tourism at the same time."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Adcritic.com's creators say it is a victim of its own success.

BYLINE:  By Andrew Zipern 

 BODY:
ADCRITIC.COM, a Web site that gained a broad following among devotees of television commercials new and old, collapsed on Tuesday. The site, which offered streaming video versions of the ads, was a victim of its own success, its creators said.
 "AdCritic.com is offline until further notice," the site informed visitors. "Our business, although strong, has been unable to weather the current economic realities besieging the United States today. The short answer: we became so popular so fast that we couldn't stay afloat!" 
 Late yesterday, Peter Beckman, AdCritic's chief executive, said the company was engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of potential buyers, but that no deal had been reached.
Mr. Beckman, a computer administrator, was an amateur commercial enthusiast when he started AdCritic in January 1999. The site, with a collection of more than 3,000 goofy and sometimes rarely seen TV spots, quickly became a hit both inside and outside the marketing industry. Its popularity, media pundits observed, suggested that television commercials were more interesting than the programs they interrupted.
The company was done in by the high costs for the Internet bandwidth needed to stream the commercials to the throngs of visitors it attracted, said James Riley, AdCritic's president, and was unable to develop its research business quickly enough to cover its expenses.
Daniel Summer, the chief executive of DVLABS, the company that was the host of AdCritic's video, said that in the days immediately after last year's Super Bowl, 1.8 million users rushed the site and, at their peak, downloaded more than 12 terabytes of data -- equal to more than half of the entire Library of Congress -- in a single 24-hour period. The usual cost to stream that much data is around $120,000, he said. Even though DVLABS charged AdCritic about one-fifth of that, the debt from the January event plagued the company for the rest of the year.
"They still haven't been able to pay off their Super Bowl bill," Mr. Summer said. Nevertheless, he added that he was confident AdCritic had the potential to become a viable business. "AdCritic is the most popular broadband site on the Internet, bar none," he said.
"It is the largest focus group one can possibly imagine," Mr. Summer said, giving agencies and advertisers a quick way of judging a given ad's effectiveness.
AdCritic, which was started for just $7,000, was regarded as having a deeply irreverent attitude toward the advertising business. But it nonetheless became something of an industry favorite. The site offered a forum for commercials that were too risque for network television or that simply were not deemed effective. The site encouraged advertising agencies to post their "spec ads" -- commercials intended to get a client interested in a particular creative team.
One interesting thing about AdCritic, said Patricia Williams, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania, was that it was entertaining and refreshingly free of ad world protocol. "A lot of the things on the site weren't even ads," she said. "They really attempted to push things that were unusual."
Professor Williams said she was sorry to see it go. "I used it a lot in my classes," she said. "It was a great place to find ads to show students." But she was not surprised. "It clearly had really no revenue model."
Rob Drasin, vice president for United States sales at AdForum.com, another Web site that archives and streams TV commercials, said AdCritic's demise was inevitable given its decision to cater to a huge consumer audience. "It's a classic dot-com failure in that they had the assumption that if you built a lot of traffic, the money would just come."
He said that AdForum, which is based in Hoboken, N.J., but also has offices in London and Paris, workedmore like a business-to-business research library. "It's a dating service between advertisers and agencies," he said. "AdCritic was giving away spots for free. It was almost like free advertising for everyone. That's not our structure."
AdForum charges agencies $4,950 a year to post and update their creative material and related information like contacts and previous work. The company now has 750 member agencies in its database, slightly more than half of which are based in the United States. Its consumer audience is negligible, he said.
Mr. Riley, the AdCritic president, said his site had 500,000 visitors a month and 40,000 registered members who work in the advertising industry. Earlier this year, it began charging agencies to post their material and had signed up more than 100 paying clients, he said. But that was not enough to support the site's daily operation. "Compelling content alone can't change that," Mr. Riley said.
Predictably, AdCritic's many loyal fans are crestfallen. "Wait, a site that was 'All ads, all the time' became too popular," wrote one user on Slashdot, the technology discussion site. "And advertisers could track which ads were more popular than others objectively and exactly? I've always said most marketers wouldn't understand technology if it smacked them in the face. Guess I was right."
Mr. Riley said interest among potential investors was there. But it is unclear whether a buyer will emerge during a media recession. We "hope that we will be back in full swing someday soon," the Web site says now. "Interested in helping out? You could always just send us some money. . . or send your condolences."

HEADLINE: Galveston Rejects Houston Port Merger 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Residents of Galveston voted Tuesday to reject merging their port with the Port of Houston, 50 miles to the northwest.
 Though the deal would have brought needed repairs to the crumbling Galveston port and bailed it out of some $21 million in debt, inhabitants of the cash-poor island town resented what they claimed was an attempt by "nouveau riche" Houston to steal their history. 
 Galveston was the leading center of commerce and trade in Texas acentury ago.
The Port of Houston, meanwhile, has run out of docking space to serve its growing volume of cargo traffic. Shippers will soon be forced to anchor at ports farther away, like Charleston and New Orleans.
The defeat of the port merger is a blow to Houston's local economy, which is already reeling from the collapse of its largest corporate citizen, Enron, and layoffs at Compaq Computer and Continental Airlines.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Balloons Again, and Leadin g Indicators Rise 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened sharply in October as payments from foreign insurance companies, which increased after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, fell back to normal, below the level of premiums collected, the government said today.
 With sluggish demand keeping a lid on imports and exports of other goods and services, the trade gap grew $10.4 billion in October, to $29.4 billion, after narrowing in September to $19 billion, the Commerce Department said. 
 In a sign that the economy could climb out of recession in the first half of 2002, a closely watched forecasting gauge rose for the second consecutive month. 
The Conference Board, a private business research group based in New York, reported that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.5 percent in November after a 0.1 percent gain in October. It was the largest rise since a 0.6 percent increase in May.
The index has risen in four of the last six months, suggesting that "the recession could be losing steam," the Conference Board said.
The index was led higher by declining jobless claims, rising stock prices and improved consumer confidence. It was also buoyed by a greater spread between short-term and long-term interest rates. Building permits rose, and the money supply expanded.
The negative factors influencing the index were faster delivery times, a reduction in average weekly hours worked at factories and fewer expected orders for consumer goods as well as for nonmilitary capital goods.
The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, a measure of current economic activity, fell 0.2 percent in November after a decline of 0.3 percent in October.
The main force behind the ballooning trade deficit figure was an $11 billion month-to-month increase in imports of goods and services, to $106.8 billion. That change included $10.5 billion that mostly reflected a return to the normal relationship between premiums paid to foreign insurers and claims received. A sharp increase in claims received after Sept. 11 dwarfed premium payments to foreign insurers that month.
Imports of other goods and services in October were little changed from the previous month, reflecting the sluggish economic picture.
Exports in October totaled $77.3 billion, up only $500 million from the depressed September level as overseas demand remained weak.

HEADLINE: LTV Extends Benefits Through February 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The LTV Corporation reached a tentative agreement with its workers today to extend unemployment and insurance benefits for displaced workers through February. 
 The agreement was worked out during a United States Bankruptcy Court hearing that had been convened to consider the company's request to void its union contract. 
Voiding the contract would have eliminated health care and unemployment benefits for up to 100,000 workers and family members. 
 Instead, the company and the unions agreed in principle that the company would extend those benefits to some workers through March. 
The company has already agreed to keep its steel mills in operating condition until then. 
LTV, the nation's third-largest integrated steel company, produced about 5 percent of the nation's steel. The company has been in bankruptcy protection since Dec. 29.
Earlier this month it received permission to idle LTV Steel mills in Cleveland; East Chicago, Ind.; and Hennepin, Ill.

HEADLINE: A Stubborn Fight Revived 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The deadlock over the economic stimulus legislation makes one thing very clear: the health care wars have resumed with a vengeance.
 Washington policy makers are confronted with the dangerous combination of a recession, soaring health care costs and an uninsured population that was already close to 40 million last year and could grow substantially in the coming months, experts say. But the two parties are stubbornly divided over what to do about it. 
 The details of the dispute are complicated and arcane, and technically apply to just a small slice of the uninsured -- those who have recently lost their jobs -- for a limited period. The debate highlights one of those fundamental philosophical divisions that have so often blocked agreement on health policy. 
Republicans want to use tax credits to help individuals buy insurance in the open marketplace. Democrats want to shore up the employer-based system with federal assistance, a direct 75 percent premium subsidy, to help laid-off workers maintain the coverage that they had when they were working. Democrats also want to pump more money into Medicaid, the government health program for low-income people.
In short, the debate touches on some of the basic fault lines between the parties, the Republicans' faith in the virtues of tax cuts and an unfettered private marketplace and the Democrats' trust in the government as an instrument of social equity.
Republicans assert that their proposal would give individuals an empowering choice, the right to decide which plan meets their needs, rather than relying on former employers or government programs. Democrats assert that the Republicans offer just a false promise, that they will never deliver a tax credit large enough to make a decent plan affordable to average Americans. Nor, Democrats argue, will individuals have anything close to the bargaining power with the insurance industry that big employers or the government have.
Gail Shearer, director of health policy analysis for Consumers Union, said the tax credit proposed in the House Republican plan, intended to cover 60 percent of the premium cost, could still leave an unemployed family paying hundreds of dollars a month. Moreover, Ms. Shearer argued, "there's an awful lot you'd have to do" to make sure that people with health problems were not discriminated against.
Both sides have clearly come to see the health provisions in the economic stimulus legislation as an important early skirmish in a larger war. 
Stuart Butler, a health expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and an advocate of the tax-credit approach, argues that liberal opponents are holding low-income people "hostage to ideology." 
"They don't want anything other than an increase in the government programs," Mr. Butler said. "That's the consistent theme that runs through all of this."
Democrats and their allies argue that they are trying to preserve a private system; 65 percent of Americans younger than 65 have their health coverage through their employers. For those laid-off Americans who cannot preserve their employer-based coverage -- many work for small businesses and are not eligible -- many Democrats argue that Medicaid is the most efficient way to meet their needs.
Republicans argue that the Democratic plan is too bureaucratic, skewed toward workers at big companies and too slow to send the aid those who need it. 
Anita Dunn, a top aide to Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said, "The genuine sticking point is whether individuals are thrown out there to fend for themselves with a tax credit, which our caucus by and large finds abhorrent."
Health experts say the debate will intensify next year. Governors in both parties are warning that they need help to deal with the growing demands on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. A variety of health experts are warning that the substantial increases in health insurance premiums in recent years will put new strains on employers and workers.
The economic downturn will heighten the anxiety about health coverage for many more Americans. According to Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, more than half of those who lost their jobs in the downturn from 1990 to 1992 became uninsured.
The politics of the issue could become as powerful as they were in the last recession, which ultimately helped produce the Clinton presidency and his effort to create universal health insurance. That effort, of course, ended in legislative disaster and turned the problems of the uninsured into a political third rail for many lawmakers for many years.
The debate over economic stimulus shows, if nothing else, how much the issue has returned.
"It's the issue that won't go away, and the economy brings it four-square back to the front of the political agenda," said Diane Rowland, executive vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.
Of course, the new debate is rousing much of the passion of the last -- not an auspicious sign for producing actual legislation.

HEADLINE: Global Crossing Looks Overseas For Financing 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Seeking to prevent a messy financial collapse, Global Crossing is trying to reach a restructuring plan that would include large investments from Asian and European companies, people close to the companies involved said yesterday.
 The investments would allow Global Crossing, which led the late 1990's frenzy for globe-spanning communications systems, to avoid a protracted bankruptcy filing. But they hinge on delicate negotiations with its senior lenders, a group of about two dozen banks including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase. 
 The banks, which met with company officials yesterday in New York to discuss the plan, need to approve changes to their financing agreements before it can restructure with the new equity. Global Crossing and the lenders hope to work on the plan over the next month. 
Under the proposal, Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong businessman, would invest at least $1 billion, and Singapore Telecommunications is also considering a big investment, people close to the situation said.
Deutsche Telekom could also become a large shareholder through a complicated multiyear deal to acquire capacity on Global Crossing's network. As part of that agreement, which is potentially valued at several billion dollars, it would receive warrants that would allow it to buy a large block of Global Crossing shares, these people said.
The companies involved in the restructuring effort declined to comment. Dan Coulter, a spokesman for Global Crossing, said the company was working with the banks to reach a resolution to the looming violation of its financing agreements. 
Global Crossing, which lost $3.35 billion in the third quarter, is expected to be in technical violation of these covenants by next month. The breach is being attributed to weak sales and plunging prices for capacity on its network. 
Global Crossing had epitomized the promise of transmitting phone calls and Internet data over vast fiber optic systems, but the expansion of competing systems resulted not only in a glut of capacity but one of companies. Global Crossing cut 3,200 jobs this year and plans to lower capital spending next year to about $1.25 billion from $4 billion.
The company's greatest fear is if its creditors decide it is worth "more dead than alive," a person close to the situation said, an assumption that could push Global Crossing into liquidation, where its assets would be auctioned to the highest bidder.
So far, investors appear confident that Global Crossing is worth more alive. Since Gary Winnick, a former sales executive at Drexel Burnham Lambert under Michael R. Milken, founded the company in 1997, it has invested $15 billion to build a fiber optic network linking 200 cities in 27 countries in the Americas, Asia and Europe. 
With greater reach than its competitors, Global Crossing has a varied list of customers, including carriers like Deutsche Telekom, government institutions like the Navy and corporations like Microsoft and American Express. 
Its most prized possessions are transoceanic cables linking Asia and Latin America with North America and Europe, said Robert Rock, a debt analyst at John Hancock mutual funds. Less valuable are fiber optic holdings in the United States, where competitors operate similar systems.
The equity investments would give Global Crossing some of the capital it needs to restructure, allowing it to provide lenders with a combination of cash and equity worth pennies on the dollar compared with what the company originally borrowed.
Global Crossing has $10.9 billion of debt and preferred stock, including about $2.2 billion of bank loans and about $750 million of annual interest costs. 
Debt speculators have largely priced in a default, with Global Crossing bonds trading as low as 8 cents on the dollar yesterday and bank loans as low as 28 percent of face value. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's further downgraded Global Crossing's debt ratings below investment grade last week.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Winnick will retain control of his brainchild if it restructures. A person close to the negotiations said Mr. Winnick, through his investment firm, the Pacific Capital Group, might also be willing to invest more money in Global Crossing.
The interest of some potential investors may depend on Mr. Winnick's personal relationships, especially in the case of Mr. Li of Hong Kong. Mr. Li and Global Crossing operate a venture together in China. In this way, Global Crossing's restructuring effort is similar to a recent deal put together by the financier Theodore J. Forstmann.
Mr. Forstmann's buyout firm, Forstmann Little, may gain control of XO Communications, a telephone and Internet company based in McLean, Va., through a deal in which it and Telefonos de Mexico will each inject $400 million to rid XO's balance sheet of debt.
The essence of that deal is Mr. Forstmann's success in luring Telmex's chairman, the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, to take part in the transaction. If the XO restructuring succeeds, it will wipe out the existing value of the company's stock.
Depending how the Global Crossing deal is structured, there may be a similar fate in store for its shareholders, whose holdings could be drastically reduced or wiped out in value. Shares of Global Crossing, which rose as high as $61.38 two years ago, have plunged 95 percent in the last year. They rose a penny yesterday, to 73 cents.
Despite the decline, Mr. Winnick reaped more than $800 million from sales of his shares since Global Crossing went public in 1998. Other early investors that made money from stock sales are the Tisch family of New York, through its CNA Financial Corporation, and the pension fund for Union Labor Life, an insurance company controlled by a group of unions.
Of course, if Global Crossing revamps its capital structure, its current shareholders would be lowest on the totem pole seeking to recover value from the company. But what is perhaps more crucial to the process is the status of its senior lenders.
Unlike senior bank lenders for other companies in situations of financial strain, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and other banks may not, effectively, be senior over Global Crossing's bondholders. This is because these lenders may have received securities, which are now almost worthless, as collateral instead of network assets.
The distinction is important because the consent of the banks is crucial for a smooth restructuring. If the banks, already smarting from losses on loans and bonds, interpret Global Crossing's actions as particularly guileful, they could withdraw from talks and put the entire process in danger. A person close to the situation described the negotiations as "cordial."
In the meantime, Global Crossing has said it is not headed for a liquidity crisis, saying it has enough cash to remain in business through the coming year. At the end of September, it had $2.4 billion. A spokesman declined to say how much it now has.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: REDEVELOPMENT; 
Downtown Renewal Head Vows Independent Effort

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
John C. Whitehead, the newly appointed chairman of the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Commission, has been making the rounds of business and civic groups for a week assuring them that he will lead a politically independent effort to rejuvenate the area and build a monument to rival the Lincoln, Jefferson or Vietnam Memorials.
 Last week, he told a group of business executives at the Association for a Better New York that he was not beholden to Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official, executives at the meeting said. In an informal meeting with real estate developers Tuesday, he went further, saying he was seeking an executive director for the downtown group who would be independent of Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 To many who heard him, Mr. Whitehead, 79, seemed to be embarking on a bold, perhaps foolish, path. After all, it was Mr. Pataki who named him chairman of the corporation, which is charged with rebuilding the area. It is a subsidiary of Mr. Gargano's Empire State Development Corporation, although little is certain about the commission's powers, its financing or its relationship to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre site where the World Trade Center stood.
But then Tuesday night, negotiators for the House and the Senate agreed to provide New York with $8.2 billion in emergency aid for downtown, including $2 billion for Mr. Whitehead's Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation. State officials, who had expected the money to go to the Empire State Development Corporation, were stunned. 
The provision giving the commission the money may not survive a final Congressional vote on the aid bill Thursday, but it was what Mr. Whitehead called a pleasant surprise. He said the money would be "well spent no matter where it is lodged," adding that his remarks about Governor Pataki and Mr. Gargano had been exaggerated. But Mr. Whitehead, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company and a deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration, continued to emphasize his independence.
"I am independent," he said in an interview yesterday before the commission's first meeting. "This body is independent. At the session where the governor and the mayor introduced us, they made it clear that we were independent."
He added that he wanted the 11 directors of the commission to set aside partisan politics in the development of an overall plan for the redevelopment of downtown. "I believe that we have a marvelous opportunity to create a truly great center of the city."
Mr. Whitehead's remarks have caused more than one Pataki advisers to wonder "Why is this guy sticking his thumb in Gargano's eye?"
But Michael Marr, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, played down the matter.
"We recognize that this will be a cooperative effort with many parties at the table, including the Empire State Development Corporation, the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, the Port Authority, the M.T.A., local businesses and others," Mr. Marr said. "We look forward to working with all interested parties to ensure that Lower Manhattan's revitalization will help New York come back stronger than ever."
Mr. Whitehead describes himself as a conservative Republican, and no one thinks his overall vision differs from Mr. Gargano's. But people who have talked with Mr. Whitehead in recent weeks speculated that he may be positioning himself as a nonpartisan broker who can prevent the effort from being mired in politics and delays, and deal effectively with varied and competing groups. Those groups include the families of the 3,000 people killed Sept. 11 as well as real estate developers, local residents, people who work in the area and financial companies there.
Mr. Whitehead was selected by the governor because of the breadth of his contacts, from New York to Washington. He knew Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg; Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange; and Lewis M. Eisenberg, former chairman of the Port Authority, from his 37 years on Wall Street. He swore in Mr. Gargano as ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago when he was at the State Department in the 1980's.
The commission met for the first time yesterday in Lower Manhattan, where Governor Pataki addressed the group, saying they would help not only to rebuild downtown but also to create a place where people once again wanted to be. No decisions were made yesterday, but Mr. Whitehead said each director would work with a different constituency and relay his or her concerns to the board.
"The views of every citizen who has a stake in the area will be taken into consideration," he said.
It is still unclear how the development corporation, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, will function. Do its boundaries extend from the Battery to Chambers Street, or farther north to Canal? Where will its staff come from? How will it work with the Port Authority, which controls the trade center site as well as the PATH rail system that connects Lower Manhattan with New Jersey?
Some of the downtown redevelopment work is already in motion. The Port Authority authorized spending $540 million last week to build a temporary PATH station downtown to replace the underground network destroyed Sept. 11 and to plan a more ambitious permanent transportation terminal. The PATH trail will essentially create a development route, no matter what the commission decides. The building sites closest to PATH stations would become the most valuable.
Mr. Whitehead acknowledged the problems, but said he envisioned not only office towers, but also residential buildings, restaurants and cultural institutions on the site of the World Trade Center, while reaffirming Lower Manhattan as the financial center of the city and the region.

HEADLINE: Families Without a Beacon; 
Many Who Lived Near Trade Center Feel Extra Strain

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
If many outsiders saw the World Trade Center as a cold and sterile place for business, the children of 125 Cedar Street found it a magical playground with two looming giants.
 The high-speed elevators might as well have been seesaws. That odd bit of structural bracing in a bridge across West Street? A perfect slide. Cool parties and get-togethers at a sky-high observation floor. The daily cavalcade of hawkers and commuters -- "anonymous soldiers" and "corporate robots," in the words of one young tenant -- inspiration for essays and poems. 
 "No shadows are visible, no greenery, no semblance to the planet Earth -- only the piles of paperwork and the infrequent flash of color amidst the gray and brown of corporate business suits," David-Michael Cook, 15, wrote a few years ago as he stared out his window overlooking the trade center plaza. 
He hardly recognizes the view today, for 125 Cedar Street fronts Liberty Street, directly opposite the heaping ruins of the trade center. 
Their building is undamaged structurally, but the collapse of the towers produced a storm that filled the apartments with dust, debris and rubble. The tenants have not been allowed to return and, with a major cleanup planned and the building's location at ground zero, they may not be able to until September.
Today, David-Michael, a high school freshman, finds little will to write or focus on schoolwork because "I have this weird thing; I can't bring myself to accomplish anything." There are only a few families among the tenants of 125 Cedar Street, a loft building stocked mainly with artists and white-collar workers who, after renovating the former office building a quarter-century ago, stood at the vanguard of residential living in the financial quarter.
But in some ways they have felt the strain of dislocation more sharply than their fellow tenants. 
They have moved into temporary apartments much smaller than the spacious lofts of 125 Cedar, and in some cases had to buy or borrow furniture, clothes, toys and other articles to recreate a home. 
Anxieties are heightened over how the air around ground zero and the debris in their apartments may affect children, not to mention the shock of returning to an upended neighborhood once so familiar.
David-Michael's parents, Sandra Rubel and Michael Cook, both artists, have grown frustrated looking for an affordable apartment before the lease expires next month for their temporary, cramped apartment on the Upper West Side.
Gerald Pryor and Dawn Smith, the parents of Chance, 8, and Reed, 4, the youngest children in the building, said it was enough to have survived in light of the thousands who were killed.
But they have seen the toll on their children's psyches. Reed was with Ms. Smith in their apartment when the planes crashed into the towers with an unspeakable roar, and now when he sees steam he wonders aloud, "Should I run?" Chance grows anxious when he loses sight of his parents in public and in frustration asks: "Why can't it be the way it was? Why don't they put the towers back up again?"
Peter Wheelwright said he thought his family was pulling through well, but he noted his 12-year-old son showed little interest in seeing the building in its damaged state. "I think it's too overwhelming for him," Mr. Wheelwright said, "it looks too out of control."
And although he has e-mailed pictures of the apartment to Josephine, a teenage daughter studying in China, he cannot bring himself to show her pictures of her rubble-strewn bedroom, which bore the brunt of the damage in their apartment.
"She lost everything," Mr. Wheelwright said. "The rubble is piled up against her door."
The building always was an odd duck, a 23-apartment, turn-of-the-century building in the midst of the hurly-burly of commerce. The families found this a blessing and curse.
Cedar Street lofts are spacious, in the 2,000-square-foot range, with more than a dozen windows to accommodate curious young eyes. The relative isolation of the building among corporate towers made for a safe neighborhood that, after business hours, was generally quiet and peaceful.
The trade center in essence functioned as a barrier that kept people out of the neighborhood but also made it hard for Cedar Street tenants to venture north. The nearest schools were north of the towers, in TriBeCa. The construction of Battery Park City to the west brought traditional playgrounds to the area, but it was still another neighborhood, separated by busy West Street. 
"It was always a bit of a struggle where their pals were concerned," Mr. Wheelwright said.
The children, however, came to regard the towers as comforting beacons of home.
"Visually, those towers became associated with my house," said Lily Wheelwright, 19, who grew up in the building, even learning to ride a bike in the expansive trade center concourse. "I could see them from any part of the neighborhood. My dad would always say, 'Look up for the towers if you don't know where you are to get home.' From the subway, I would get out and follow the towers."
The towers became part of family traditions. Every year for Mother's Day, the Wheelwrights would go up to the top for a group snapshot. David-Michael recalled a birthday party one year at the 107th floor observation plaza and his fascination with crowds of commuters streaming out of 7 World Trade Center.
"There were so many things there that are not anywhere else in the world," David-Michael recalled. "There were millions of people, the strange reflective bars of the buildings and the shiny and shimmering towers that seemed like a fairy tale."
At Christmastime, streams of lights hung in the towers' lobbies, carolers drifted through the plaza, and the underground mall filled with holiday shoppers.
The Pryors' children took note of large toy soldiers taking up positions near the lobbies.
"That was how they knew it was Christmastime," Mr. Pryor said.
He and Ms. Smith cannot bear to bring the children to see the ruins. Their apartment is frozen in time, with breakfast dishes still in place and little removed or disturbed because they believe the debris is contaminated. 
Mr. Pryor said testing of dust samples in their apartment found levels of asbestos at 3 percent of the dust, not high enough to pose a short-term risk, according to scientists, but well above Mr. Pryor's threshold of concern.
"If you have the children in mind, you don't chance it," he said.
They try to keep their problems in perspective; the family is intact and they mourn for the thousands killed in their backyard. But Mr. Pryor said he and his wife had struggled to explain the disaster to their children, particularly Chance, who is certain the bad men hid in the airplanes' luggage compartments to pull off the strike.
Only in a few months, they reason, will he be ready to see the area.
"I want him to be whole again, but I don't know how to make him that way yet," Mr. Pryor said.
There is also reconciling the desire to move back to a place they regarded as special with the reality that the neighborhood will never be the same.
After much deliberation and negotiation, the landlord has agreed to clean the building and the apartments. But the work requires specialized treatment because of the asbestos contamination and, with the building in ground zero, the police still restrict access to the building to short, escorted visits of 15 minutes or so. The building management has told tenants not to expect to return until September.
Even so, some tenants are hesitant to move back until there are strong assurances that it is safe.
"When the cleanup is done and the building is ready to be inhabited, that's when I am interested in testing," said Mr. Wheelwright, an architect whose office was in his home at 125 Cedar Street.
Mr. Cook and Ms. Rubel, David-Michael's parents, are also concerned about contamination, but returning to 125 Cedar sooner than later would end a frustrating hunt for suitable temporary lodging for their family. 
A church near Cedar Street has allowed them to stay at a church apartment on the Upper West Side for much of the last three months at a reduced rent, but in January it will revert to market rates, and prospective landlords have not been sympathetic.
"We have been struggling with the bureaucracy," Mr. Cook said. "FEMA has sent some checks. But we lived and worked at Cedar Street, and now we are basically unemployed. So we don't look good on paper."
And their son, David-Michael, so taken by the trade center and its bustle, finds it hard to reconcile the new world sure to emerge there with the lost one that so entranced him.
"It's a weird feeling," he said, "to think of all those people who would run by you and hit you with their elbows. It's strange to think that a lot of them are gone."

HEADLINE: Chapter 11 Filings Point Fingers at Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The fallout from the World Trade Center terror attack has started landing in a new place: the Federal Bankruptcy Court at Bowling Green.
 In the last two weeks, companies that depend on travel and tourism have begun citing the events of Sept. 11 as reasons for seeking Chapter 11 protection from their creditors, saying the attacks pushed them over the financial edge. They include a hotel at Kennedy Airport, the coffee shop of a Midtown hotel and a company that rents audio-visual equipment for business meetings. 
 Analysts say this is probably only the beginning of a wave of travel-related bankruptcies. "I suspect this is not the end," said Arnon A. Mishkin, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, which has studied the effects of Sept. 11 on travel and tourism in New York City. 
While tourism was stronger than expected during Thanksgiving week, Mr. Mishkin said, the national economy remains weak and the outlook for travel remains uncertain. "That double whammy will probably cause additional stresses," he added.
To be sure, many travel-related businesses had problems well before the attack on the twin towers. One of the companies that filed for Chapter 11, the Best Western Carlton House at J.F.K., faces increased competition from new and recently renovated hotels at the airport. A few of those hotels are not unionized, and in its court filing, the Best Western blamed "a very onerous collective bargaining agreement" for some of its financial problems.
That is hotly disputed by the New York Hotel Trades Council, which represents the hotel's workers. "The union has already helped that hotel out on a number of occasions," said John F. Turchiano, a spokesman for the union. The contract allows any hotel that feels it needs relief to ask for an emergency hearing before an arbitrator, he said.
The union still has 4,000 members on layoffs citywide, he said, adding that the union's philosophy on hotels is, "If they're not in business, we're not in business."
The hotel's biggest problem is probably the customers it most often serves: international passengers who are stranded when airlines cancel or postpone flights, said Scott S. Markowitz, the lawyer who is representing the hotel in bankruptcy court. "I wouldn't be surprised if we see other hotels in the New York City area" with similar problems, he said.
Neither would John A. Fox of PKF Consulting, an expert on New York hotels. City hotels are likely to be only half full in January and February, he said, down from more than 70 percent in recent years. In November, 76 percent of rooms were occupied, down from 86 percent last year, and only because hotels offered large discounts.
The Audio Visual Services Corporation is not expecting a quick rebound, either. The company is based in Long Beach, Calif., but does business across the country, including at about 15 hotels in New York City. It has an office here, and filed for bankruptcy protection here because this is where its major lenders are.
The company took on heavy debt to buy small equipment suppliers in 1996 and 1997 and has been losing money for several years. "But the events of Sept. 11 gave us the final push," said Digby J. Davies, the company's president. While business improved in October and November, compared with September, he said, it has not returned to the levels of a year ago.
Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection does not mean a company is closing or liquidating; regulars are still filling tables in the back of Raffles, a coffee shop in the Radisson Lexington Hotel on Lexington Avenue at 48th Street.
But "a high proportion of its customers are visitors to New York City who take occupancy in the hotel," according to its filing, and their numbers have been few. As a result, according to the filing, the coffee shop lost $100,000 on sales of $683,000 in its latest year.
This has left it indebted to the hotel, which was already involved in an unrelated legal dispute with Raffles's owners, said Stephen H. Penn, the lawyer representing the coffee shop owners in the bankruptcy filing.
On a recent rainy day, only two-dozen or so people were eating grilled cheese sandwiches or burgers in the coffee shop at lunchtime. Down the block, some storefronts were vacant. A shoe store had only one customer. Only a few small groups of suitcase-towing tourists trundled down the stretch of Lexington Avenue known as hotel row, and none of them stopped to shop.

HEADLINE: Thousands on Welfare Face Face a Temporary Gap in Aid 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Several thousand of New York City's poorest families have been cut off all government assistance and are facing at least 45 days without benefits, falling into a gap between the end of their federal welfare benefits and the start of the state-financed alternative, known as Safety Net, city and state welfare officials confirmed yesterday.
 Neither city nor state officials would provide exact numbers, but officials at the city's Human Resources Administration confirmed that the city had cut aid to more than 3,000 families who would have been transferred into the Safety Net program after exhausting their federal welfare benefits this month. 
 Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city agency, said the 3,000 families had been cut off because, for unknown reasons, they had not responded to notices sent in October and November summoning them to apply for Safety Net. 
City officials said another group of welfare recipients were denied for refusing job offers, but would not say how many refused, or how many jobs were offered. 
Late last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani referred to 3,000 people cut off because they were "hard cases" who "either refused jobs, or failed to do anything in order to qualify."
But examples of people whose benefits were cut off in error have multiplied. They include James Howard, a workfare subway car cleaner and a father of three whose wife is disabled. They lost all aid, including the children's food stamps, despite rules that officials said should have maintained his aid until his appeal could be heard.
Advocates for the poor have criticized the Giuliani and Pataki administrations for requiring applications, rather than following the original plan for a seamless transition to Safety Net. Critics said that bureaucratic errors, compounded by damage to the welfare computer network in the Sept. 11 attacks, could interrupt basic aid to thousands. 
But Gov. George E. Pataki said applications were necessary to make sure that the families were still eligible. The state programmed its computers to transfer welfare cases automatically unless a city caseworker intervened to stop aid by entering a denial code.
Last month John B. Madden, a spokesman for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said that until Dec. 1, anyone who was denied could appeal and receive aid in the meantime. But Mr. Howard's experience bears out complaints by welfare lawyers that aid often ends prematurely. Likewise, though city officials said that food stamps were supposed to be continued automatically for three months, that measure did not work for the Howards either.
Robert Doar, deputy commissioner of the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said that 15,000 to 20,000 needy city families were automatically transferred to Safety Net this month without having to apply, because the city had not summoned them before their federal grants expired this month. But the city did summon 10,000 to 15,000 of the 30,000 families reaching the five-year welfare limit this month, and their fate remains uncertain. From scant city figures, it appears that about 1,600 of them took subsidized jobs, joining 3,100 other recipients placed earlier as seasonal parks laborers.
For 18 months, Mr. Howard cleaned subway cars in exchange for his family's welfare grant and the hope of being hired. He received the notice to apply for Safety Net in October. But he was told that he was to be hired as a regular subway employee with a salary of $30,000 a year. That prospect vanished later as the economy worsened.
His wife, Gaynell, said she went to the Safety Net appointment in October, tried to explain the situation and asked to reschedule the meeting. But she was denied, in error, Mr. Madden said, who promised last night to try to rectify the problem. Since late November, Mr. Howard has kept half a dozen appointments in an effort to activate Safety Net and restore food stamps, all without success. 
Mrs. Howard said the family, including two daughters, 17 and 9, and a son, 19, are being threatened with eviction from the apartment where they have lived for 17 years.
"The children's Christmas is gone," Mr. Howard said.

Like Avatars Of Crime, They're Back

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE statistics say New York just went through a spike in crime.
 Want to know what a spike feels like? 
 Come to East New York.
Walk around New Lots Avenue beneath the elevated subway station and look around. You'll see them. The unsmiling guys in the hooded sweatshirts and bubble jackets. The ones whose eyes never meet yours. 
They're back, blatantly back, milling about on the corner near the pizza place, up to no good in a neighborhood that, though still among the most dangerous in the city, has come far since the nadir of the early 1990's. Stores that had been boarded up reopened. Empty lots became two-story attached homes. Windows and doors guarded by iron cages of protection still are. But there are so many more of them.
Now the people in this Brooklyn neighborhood are nervous, fearful of a return to the past, when violence scarred the nights and drug dealers ruled the streets.
"As soon as they see the cops leave, they surface again, just like cockroaches," said Johnny, a storekeeper in the neighborhood for 30 years. Like most people encountered in East New York one afternoon this week, Johnny, fearful of the hooded drug dealers, agreed to be interviewed only if guaranteed anonymity.
"I don't care about the statistics," he continued. "It's the people on the streets. I see things I should not be seeing."
Like all statistics, the Police Department's numbers show many things.
They show that the 75th Precinct, which includes East New York and Cypress Hills, is still the homicide capital of New York. But so far, there have been 33 homicides in the precinct this year, compared with 40 in the same period last year. In 1993, there were 126 homicides. Reports of crimes in the seven major categories, from murders to auto theft, have gone down 56 percent in the last eight years (63 percent citywide).
The statistics also reveal a spike in murders and shootings citywide this fall. Police officials cite Sept. 11, which drew thousands of officers from their regular assignments. A few weeks ago, in response to the bad crime news, police officials returned many officers to their original duties. 
Murders and shootings began to fall again throughout the city the week ending last Sunday. That week in the 75th Precinct, major crimes -- 36 percent higher than last year in the five weeks that ended Dec. 9 -- dropped almost 10 percent from their 2000 levels. In other words, the trend is beginning to move in the right direction.
BUT it does not feel that way on the ground. Michael Mazzariello, who grew up in a gentler East New York and stubbornly refuses to give up, has been increasingly worried about backsliding, in part because of the impending departure of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who responded to his complaints about the neighborhood in the mid-1990's.
"Giuliani made quality of life in the neighborhood substantially better," said Mr. Mazzariello, who runs the nonprofit East New York Legal Services. "It all comes down to the cops."
Some people in the neighborhood say things started to feel more ragged than usual even before Sept. 11, maybe because of the economy and the related rise in unemployment or for reasons not yet quantified. Not everything is, after all, a statistic.
It is not a statistic that people avoid a known drug house on Cleveland Street. Or that there are more neighborhood drunks in front of a corner church. 
"They don't cause any problems, but the group has gotten larger," said Sebastian, a local merchant. "It's the sight. It's unpleasant. And there's the guys. You see them walking the streets. I have not seen open dealing, but we know what they are doing. They're not being harassed by the cops. If you don't have constant pressure, the problems magnify.
"Just last week, I heard this noise, I thought a car backfired," Sebastian continued. "It was a gun shot. A guy stole a car, someone pulled a gun out and shot at the ground. They let him live. At least nobody got killed. I've been here five years; I never heard a gun shot."
Deputy Commissioner Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for the Police Department, said people in East New York should soon begin to feel the impact of redeployed officers. "The numbers are reversing. When all is said and done, it's effective policing is what it is. It's not a mystery."
It's not. Neither is the reason those hooded guys get away with owning the sidewalk of New Lots Avenue. They stand there day and night, in the malevolent path of people who pretend they don't see them because, for now, they can.

HEADLINE: Hawaii's 2 Airlines to Merge via Stock Swap 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Hawaii's two airlines, battered by the steep drop in tourism after Sept. 11, agreed to merge yesterday in a deal that would place the former president of Continental Airlines in charge of the new combination. 
 Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines, which have competed for 55 years, never very profitably, said that they would merge their operations in an exchange of stock. Greg Brenneman, who helped lead the turnaround at Continental before resigning in May, helped broker the deal. He will receive an ownership stake of 20 percent in the new airline and become its chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Brenneman said in an interview that the proposed combination would generate $90 million in cost savings and create a flagship airline for Hawaii that would be able to grow. 
"If I do a good job of working with employees and pull this off, I will do very well," he said. "That was the kind of alignment of incentives I was looking for."
The deal is the first proposed airline merger since the terrorist attacks sent the industry into its worst downturn in history. In Hawaii, where the economy depends on tourism, the number of visitors fell more than 30 percent in October from the month a year earlier, according to the state's tourism office.
The proposed deal is likely to attract attention from the Justice Department's antitrust division because the two airlines dominate travel between Hawaii's seven main islands. In a bid to head off criticism, the new company, which will be called Aloha Holdings, has agreed to freeze interisland fares for two years and to work with state officials to guarantee levels of service and agree on a formula for future fare increases. 
Gov. Ben Cayetano, a Democrat, said yesterday that he would not oppose the deal, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Brenneman said that Senator Daniel K. Inouye, also a Democrat, was an early backer of the plan. Mr. Inouye did not return calls seeking comment. A spokesman for Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, said that the congressman would defer comment until he learned more about the deal. 
Three union representatives that sit on the Hawaiian Airlines board approved the merger proposal. But airline combinations are often messy because of the difficulty negotiating seniority among various employee groups. The deal could also lead to layoffs at the two airlines, which each have about 3,000 employees. 
Another challenge will be combining fleets. Aloha flies Boeing 737's while Hawaiian is in the process of introducing the Boeing 717 to replace its aging DC-9's. It is also phasing out the wide-body DC-10 in favor of the Boeing 767. Mr. Brenneman said he would have to meet with Boeing to work out a plan and might add some 757's. 
Under terms of the agreement, shareholders of Hawaiian Airlines, which trades on the American Stock Exchange, would receive 52 percent of the shares of Aloha Holdings plus a six-year, 8 percent note with a face value of $2 a share. Shareholders of the closely held Aloha, which is controlled by the Ching and Ing families, will receive 28 percent, while Mr. Brenneman's company, TurnWorks Inc., will get 20 percent. 
The current chief executives of both airlines agreed to resign.

HEADLINE: As Economy Slumps, Even Manhattan Rents Fall 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Rents on thousands of apartments in Manhattan have tumbled in the last few months as the economy has worsened and fallout from the terrorist attack has spread beyond Lower Manhattan.
 Rent reductions in the World Trade Center area have been widespread and deep since the attack on Sept. 11, as tenants have fled. But what is surprising now is how deep the rent cuts are in other neighborhoods of Manhattan. 
 Brian Edwards, director of rentals at Halstead/Feathered Nest, one of the city's biggest rental brokerages, said that half the rental properties coming on the market now above Houston Street that are unregulated have been marked down. Unregulated properties above Houston and below 96th Street are now renting for an average of 18 percent less than they were a year ago, Mr. Edwards said. 
These unregulated apartments, for which rents are not set by law, make up about a fifth of the total number of rentals in Manhattan, analysts say, but the trend of reductions carries over to rent-regulated apartments on a smaller scale. Low-income, subsidized housing is not affected. 
Although this is traditionally a slow time for rentals, brokers, apartment hunters and landlord representatives seemed to agree that negotiation over the price is more common today than it has been in almost a decade, and that new opportunities exist for those who are looking for apartments in Manhattan. 
"Some rents are off 30 percent in Battery Park," said Mr. Edwards, referring to a neighborhood abutting the World Trade Center site. "The Upper West Side is 15 percent off. The Upper East Side is 15 to 20 percent." 
While most of the cuts have been in the asking rents for vacant, unregulated apartments, landlords have also begun to reduce prices in hundreds of rent-stabilized apartments, both for new leases and in occupied apartments as tenants threaten to leave, rewriting leases at lower prices and granting free months of rent, said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a group that represents landlords. Many but not all of these are in the financial district, near ground zero. But throughout Manhattan, Mr. Strasburg said, landlords are finding that they need more tenants to fill their spaces.
After years of dictating take-it-or-leave-it terms in a skyrocketing rental market, landlords are now being forced to negotiate one-on-one with their tenants and are agreeing to monthly rent reductions and upgrades to bigger or more desirable apartments in the same building, for the same money. Landlords are also advertising anywhere from one to three months "free" rent, effective discounts of 9 to 27 percent. But in many cases, the landlords are refusing to write more than a one-year lease at the new lowered prices, hedging their bets that prices will rise again in a year.
The apartments affected span a broad range of neighborhoods and prices, from an $1,800 studio on East Eighth Street (now $1,450) to a four-bedroom $14,000 high-rise rental off Riverside Drive (now $8,900.)
The neighborhoods that have been affected the least, brokers said, are the so-called blue-chip neighborhoods: Central Park West, Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue, but there have been scattered rent reductions even there.
R. Kenyatta Punter, of the Central Harlem agency that bears his name, said rents on renovated brownstone apartments in Harlem had retreated to where they were two and a half years ago. "A two-bedroom that a year ago was $2,400 to $2,500 has dropped back down to the $1,800-to-$2,000 range," he explained. 
In Washington Heights, also in upper Manhattan, rents have fallen slightly less than 10 percent, said Gus Perry, of Stein-Perry Real Estate. A one-bedroom apartment there now goes for $1,200, compared with $1,300 a year ago. The reason for the relative stability? "We're much cheaper here to begin with," Mr. Perry said. 
Brokers attributed the rent markdowns primarily to the recession, with its job layoffs and fear of overspending, worsened by the construction boom of the last five years, which created thousands of new apartments.
"Clearly a lot of rentals are on the market now, in new buildings," said Paul Purcell, the president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, the city's largest real estate company. "And a lot are still trickling in."
Brokers, including Mr. Purcell, said that the diminishing pool of newcomers often prefer to buy rather than rent, taking advantage of lower interest rates.
After all, Manhattan rents still remain high; although apartments may have dropped, an entry-level, no-frills one bedroom can easily hit $2,000 a month. Two years ago, that was the going rate for a studio, said Stan Ponte, who handles downtown rentals for Stribling and Associates. "But a rare, beautifully finished, high-end one bedroom still go into the $4,000's -- and do," he said.
Scott Durkin, the chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group, predicted more drops in rents.
Mr. Durkin and his roommate got the rent on their own SoHo loft reduced in October by $500 when "we saw the same type of loft advertised for $500 to $700 less than we were paying," he said. Mr. Durkin, like many others, threatened to break his lease. When had he moved in? Only last May. That represented about an 11 percent cut, he said.
David Lowenfeld, an executive at World-Wide Holdings Corporation, which owns four buildings in Lower Manhattan, said he had received dozens of calls from tenants asking to break their leases or lower rents. Yesterday, Mr. Lowenfeld said that he let any tenant out of his lease who demanded it, and reduced rents of tenants who agreed to stay by 10 to 20 percent.
In Battery Park City, Julie Gaines, 38, and her husband, David Lenovitz, 42, were living with their two children in an 1,100-square-foot apartment when their landlord, Milford Management, sent out notices offering every tenant a 25 percent rent drop if they would stay -- at least until their leases were up. 
Nevertheless, Ms. Gaines said, a lot of renters left. "We know several couples who moved to their summer homes" in the Hamptons and New Jersey, she said. Yet even with the drop in rents, some Battery Park apartments are still standing empty. 
But Mr. Lenovitz and Ms. Gaines, who own Fishs Eddy, a domestics shop on Broadway at 19th Street, had another strategy. They offered to keep paying their old rent, $5,500, if they could move their family into a 1,900-square-foot apartment in Liberty Terrace, a neighboring high-rise owned by the same developers. That would give them almost double the space, for the same rent. The landlord quickly agreed. They moved 10 days ago.
Some developers and brokers said they believed that the rents have indeed hit bottom. But Bob Esnard, the president of the Zucker Organization, disagreed. "It's not like '93, when we hit the bottom of the barrel," he said. "We haven't gotten there yet." That year is generally considered the nadir of the last real estate recession.
Steven Schleider, a real estate analyst who helps prepares the statistics for the Real Estate Board of New York, dismissed doom-and-gloom predictions that rents were in free fall. 
Some new leases may be 15 percent less, he said, but he continued, the white-hot market of a year ago was "hyperinflated." After a meteoric rise, rentals leveled and began to decline gently last January, then dropped sharply after Sept. 11. "It was a straight line, slightly tilted down, since January," said Mr. Edwards of Halstead/Feathered Nest. "After 9/11, we really got kicked, it really got rolling."
While rents have fallen, the city's homeless population is still increasing, as the worsening economy strikes particularly hard at those at the bottom of the economic ladder. Also, the lower end of the rental market, where most of the poor live, is highly regulated and thus not affected by the new cuts in rents. 
Outside Manhattan, the softening of the rental market appears to have hit some neighborhoods harder than others. In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Suzy Klein, owner of Klein Realty, said the rental market is "very quiet." Landlords are reducing prices of rentals about 15 percent, she said.
In the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where demand is strong and inventory is tight, rents remain the same as a year ago.
That's not true at 200 Riverside Boulevard, at the corner of West 70th Street, where the owner of a condominium in one of Donald J. Trump's West Side high-rise has finally rented his apartment for $8,900. The original rent for the five-bathroom, four-bedroom apartment was $14,000. 
Mr. Schleider, the analyst, predicted that rents would rise again. Until then, he suggested there may be a silver lining. The areas affected by the biggest rental reductions may become affordable for young people, who, he said, "will be able to live in Manhattan again."

Lacking Suitors, Bonds Remains With the Giants

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In the nearly 30-year history of baseball's salary arbitration procedure, no arbitrator has been asked to decide the salary of a player who hit 73 home runs the previous season.
 Neither the San Francisco Giants nor Barry Bonds's agent expects that scenario to occur in February, but Bonds took the unusual step yesterday of accepting the Giants' offer of arbitration, ending his free agency and ensuring his return to the Giants next season. 
 The step was unusual because free agents of the caliber of Bonds seldom accept arbitration. They sign lucrative multiyear contracts instead. But no market appeared to develop for Bonds despite his astounding season at age 37, and he opted to remain with the Giants. 
Asked if Bonds's decision reflected the absence of a market for him, Scott Boras, his agent, said, "It's an indication that there wasn't anything there in Barry Bonds's mind to compel him to leave a situation in San Francisco he was very comfortable with."
One baseball official said Boras created a virtually impossible economic goal given that his client is approaching 40. "Scott set the bar so high," the official said, "he created a difficult situation for himself." The official said Boras had been seeking a five-year, $105 million contract for Bonds, who not only broke Mark McGwire's home run record but also eclipsed two of Babe Ruth's records with an .863 slugging percentage and 177 walks. The Giants offered Bonds four years for $72 million. No one else has admitted to offering anything.
Boras is not accustomed to falling short of his goals. A year ago he attained the biggest contract in sports history, the 10-year, $252 million package for Alex Rodriguez with the Texas Rangers. "Barry isn't looking to be the highest-paid player in the game," Boras said by telephone from his home in Newport Beach, Calif. "He just wants to be properly situated among his peers."
Translation: Behind Rodriguez but ahead of a group of six players, including Derek Jeter and Jason Giambi of the Yankees, whose contracts have annual values of $17 million to $19 million.
If he were to go before an arbitrator, Bonds, given his 2001 performance and his career statistics, could conceivably gain a salary for next season of more than $20 million. But Boras said: "That's on the back burner. Our goal is to continue discussions with the club for a multiyear contract."
Larry Baer, the Giants' chief operating officer, took a similar view of the Bonds development. "Might it go to a hearing?" he asked. "I suppose there's always a chance for that. But we've made some progress and we're continuing to work with Scott Boras on reaching agreement on a long-term contract. We'll work something out. It just gives us more time to work something out."
Players who were offered arbitration and rejected it by last night's midnight deadline have until Jan. 8 to negotiate with their teams. If they fail to sign, the teams lose rights to them until May 1. A player who accepts the arbitration offer is considered a signed player.
When he was in New York in August, Bonds said the money in a new contract was "not the issue"; winning and going to the playoffs were the important things. The Giants did not get there.
"This was a lot about what Barry's objectives were when he went into this," Boras said. "Unless it was overwhelming, I think Barry intended to exhaust things with the Giants. The arbitration process allows him to have a solid floor for a year."
Bret Boone and David Bell accepted arbitration from the Seattle Mariners. Boone's agent, Adam Katz, tried to negotiate a long-term contract yesterday but said the Mariners would guarantee only three years, not four. Katz said negotiations would continue.
Among the free agents who rejected the arbitration offers were Juan Gonzalez (Cleveland), Johnny Damon (Oakland) and Chan Ho Park (Los Angeles).
Four free agents joined new teams yesterday: Moises Alou and three pitchers. Alou agreed to an offer of $27 million for three years with the Chicago Cubs; John Burkett, two years, $11 million with Boston; Dave Burba, one year, $2 million with Texas; and Dennis Cook, one year, $1.25 million with Anaheim.
Sammy Sosa, a countryman from the Dominican Republic, heavily recruited Alou, an outfielder with a career .306 average. "Tell Moises he's got to pay me some interest, a percentage," Sosa said, joking.
The Yankees had been interested in Alou but opted instead to sign Rondell White, whose departure from the Cubs created the opening for Alou. The Houston Astros, concerned about their payroll, did not try to re-sign the 35-year-old Alou.

FLEETBOSTON LAYS OFF 700 AND WRITES OFF $650 MILLION

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The banking company FleetBoston Financial Corporation said yesterday that it would lay off 700 of its 55,000 workers and take hundreds of millions of dollars in write-downs for the job cuts, investments that have gone bad and exposure to the Argentine financial crisis. 
The company, which is based in Boston, said the charges would total $650 million after taxes in the fourth quarter. FleetBoston, the nation's seventh-largest financial holding company and the parent of Fleet Bank, said the largest component of the charge would be a $475 million write-down of investments. The charges will all but wipe out FleetBoston's profits in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: The Bank of Japan Moves to Halt Economic Slide 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan said today that it would greatly step up its purchases of government bonds and pump even more cash than before into the nation's money markets.
 The steps are intended to help combat Japan's mounting problems with debt and deflation by further easing monetary policy, at a time when short-term interest rates are already effectively at zero. 
 The bank also said today that it would consider accepting a broader range of financial instruments as collateral for loans, including commercial paper backed by real estate and mortgages, a policy change that might make it much easier for banks to unload their nonperforming loans more easily.
The decision was made at the central bank's final meeting of the year, after weeks of lobbying by senior Japanese politicians, American officials and others, who called on the bank to loosen monetary policy to brake the country's descent into recession. 
"Japan's economy is deteriorating broadly, and is likely to undergo a severe adjustment phase for the time being," the bank said. "Today's decision is intended to secure that the financial markets continue to work in a stable manner and to ensure that economic recovery will be effectively supported from the monetary side."
The bank said it would step up its purchases of government bonds, known as rinban operations, by one-third, to 800 billion yen ($6.25 billion) a month. And it will make up to 15 trillion yen ($117 billion) available for short-term loans to companies and banks; it had been keeping 6 trillion to 9 trillion yen available.
Investors and analysts had been expecting both steps, and there was little evident reaction in the stock market.
Japanese bank stocks have been deeply depressed recently by fears that one or more of the big lenders will exhaust its capital and collapse under the weight of nonperforming loans. Reports that bad loans are piling up faster than banks can write them off have heightened investors' alarm.
The central bank and the government have been publicly chastising one another for months for doing too little to address the banks' problems. Masaru Hayami, the governor of the central bank, has argued that pumping more money into the banking system will do little good unless bank managers rapidly shed their unprofitable assets and lawmakers give them the tools to do it. Today's decision signaled that the central bank would do its part to help.
"The Bank of Japan has taken pre-emptive steps to protect the banks and markets," said Akio Makabe, an economist at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Research Institute in Tokyo. "Now, the bank will look to see if government policy makers step forward, too."
The decision to accept real estate and mortgages -- which Japanese banks hold in abundance -- is "perhaps the most bullish part of today's decision," said Ronald Bevacqua, an economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo. "It opens the possibility that the stalemate on banking policy will soon be broken."
Representatives from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet, the central bank and the Finance Ministry have formed a committee to discuss reviving the economy.
More broadly, though, economists said that today's policy changes were not likely to have a major impact on Japan's $3.9 trillion economy, which sank this year into its fourth recession in a decade. The bank's near-zero short-term interest rates have yet to entice either businesses or consumers to borrow more and spend more; loan demand has not grown in nearly five years. "The economy will get very little short-term boost from the Bank of Japan's moves," said Soichi Okuda, senior economist at Aozora Bank. "But if the yen weakens as a result of the monetary easing, that will be a plus for exporters."
A weakening yen may indeed prove to be a byproduct of the central bank's monetary steps, with many analysts expecting a decline to 135 yen to the dollar by March.
"The yen will continue to deteriorate for fundamental reasons," said Haruya Ida, senior analyst at Thompson IFR in Tokyo.
A rising chorus of officials on both sides of the Pacific have said they are comfortable with a weaker yen if it gets consumer prices headed up again. Inflation has been almost wholly absent from the economy for the last four years, and Japan's already high-saving consumer population now feels little urgency to buy when prices are likely to be the same or lower tomorrow. 
Haruhiko Kuroda, the Japanese vice finance minister for international affairs, signaled he was happy with the yen's 7 percent slide against the dollar since mid-November, which he said "corrects its level, which was too strong" given Japan's weak economy.
Officials from the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund have said they will accept a weakening of the yen if it results from reforms that include a reorganization of the ailing financial industry.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
For too many people, including some of the rich, Social Security is the main retirement plan.

 BODY:
THE basic problem facing Social Security is that as the baby boomers age, there will be fewer workers to support more retirees. Either benefits have to be reduced or more money has to be found.
 The Commission to Strengthen Social Security focused on the latter approach, describing three plans to redirect Social Security contributions into individually owned, privately invested retirement accounts. 
 Regardless of one's views about the wisdom of private investment accounts, it is important to recognize that nothing prevents people from saving more than their Social Security contributions now. 
In fact, existing tax-deferred plans -- individual retirement accounts, Keoghs and the like -- offer attractive subsidies for private saving. Despite these significant incentives, a remarkably large component of the population saves almost nothing for retirement, making them highly dependent on Social Security benefits.
Why are personal savings so low?
Stephen F. Venti and David A. Wise, economists at Dartmouth and Harvard, respectively, recently released a fascinating glimpse of savings behavior based on data from the Health and Retirement Survey, a continuing study of approximately 7,700 households nearing retirement age. ("Choice, Chance and Wealth Dispersion at Retirement," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 7521.)
Mr. Venti and Mr. Wise started their analysis by estimating the lifetime income of each household, then sorted the households into 10 equal-sized groups based on their estimate. Their most striking observation was the extreme variation in total asset accumulation within each income group. For example, the wealth held by the top 10 percent of households in the group just below the median was 35 times the wealth held by the bottom 10 percent of that same income group. The dispersion of wealth for higher-income groups was slightly smaller, but still high.
(The authors consider various definitions of wealth, some limited to financial assets, some including housing, some including the actuarial value of Social Security benefits. I use the most inclusive definition, but the other definitions tell the same story.)
It has long been known that most Americans do not save much. What is more remarkable is that even a substantial fraction of relatively wealthy people do not save much. The bottom 20 percent of every income group has zero or negative wealth, with the only exception being the households with the highest lifetime income.
Just as some high-income households had minimal accumulated wealth, some low-income households had substantial wealth. The top 10 percent of the lowest income group had accumulated more than $150,000.
Even though nearly every group in the sample had the opportunity to contribute to an I.R.A. or a 401(k) plan, only about half the households did so.
Mr. Venti and Mr. Wise consider three explanations for the large variations in wealth accumulated for retirement: household wealth was significantly affected by chance events like illness or inheritances; household investments performed far differently; and some people saved substantially more than others.
They cannot offer a definitive answer, because their data was only a snapshot at a single point in time, but they offer suggestive evidence that the first two effects were relatively small. Even after one accounts for chance events and investment performance, the dispersion in wealth remains large. They concluded that most of the observed variation in retirement wealth is primarily a result of different propensities to save.
Reluctance to save is costly. In the data Mr. Venti and Mr. Wise examined, the middle-income households had, on average, financial assets totaling about $45,000. If these households had saved 10 percent of their income and invested it in a stock market index fund, they would have had more than $250,000 of wealth by retirement age. Even if they had invested in long-term corporate bonds, they would have accumulated over $100,000.
These households were generally aware that their savings were inadequate: over three-fourths of the respondents said they had saved too little, and virtually none said they had saved too much. Most people were worried by their minimal savings: only a quarter of them thought that "Social Security or employer pensions would take care of my retirement income."
It seems that people just have very different attitudes toward saving: some people do it, and some do not. I have my own theory about why there is such a low personal saving rate: I blame it on advertising. Businesses spend billions of dollars encouraging people to spend, and many people just cannot resist the temptation.
By contrast, only a pittance is devoted to advertising that encourages people to save. A typical ad for an I.R.A. shows a gray-haired middle-aged man playing golf. A more realistic ad might depict a bag lady sitting next to a grocery cart. O.K., that is a bit extreme -- but that sort of ad would send the right message: look what happens to you if you do not save.
Other analyses of consumer behavior show that I.R.A.'s and 401(k) plans have increased aggregate savings. But less than half the population takes advantage of such plans. There should be more plans aimed at the lower end of the income distribution.
It is not impossible to save $5 or $10 a day -- many people spend that much on lottery tickets and cigarettes. But $10 a day is $3,650 a year, and that amount can accumulate significantly over a lifetime.
As the Venti-Wise study shows, many low-income households save this much now. And many high-income households, to whom $10 a day is surely insignificant, do not bother to save even that tiny amount.
President Bush's Social Security commission was not asked to consider plans to encourage more voluntary saving. Instead, it focused on how mandated savings -- Social Security -- will be structured. One would hope that some part of whatever plan emerges from Congress's deliberations will offer better ways to encourage Americans to save more in addition to their Social Security contributions.

HEADLINE: White House Scuttles Plan For G.O.P. Ad Campaign 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Republican Party officials were on the verge of going forward with their first political advertising campaign since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but the White House scuttled the project more than a week ago.
 The centerpiece of the campaign, party officials said today, was a television commercial that upbraided the Democrats and called on them to work with Republicans on an economic stimulus bill. The commercial was to be supplemented by radio advertisements in House districts tailored to help -- or hurt -- specific candidates. The effort was so far along that party officials had already prepared a news release about it that was never made public. 
 Karl Rove, President Bush's top political adviser, said today that he intervened and concluded that the campaign would be "a waste of time and money." Mr. Rove said he had anticipated that the Democrats would have put more resources into their radio advertising campaign that they began last month, which castigated House Republicans for favoring "Washington special interests" in the stimulus package.
"The original intent was to run the ad if the Democrats got serious about their ads," Mr. Rove said in an interview. "If their ads were nothing more than slightly expensive news releases -- i.e. they bought a couple of dozen spots in a district -- there was no need to run it. So the reason that it didn't run was everyone agreed that the threshold had not been crossed by the Democrats."
Other Republican officials said another reason they decided against the commercials was that they did not want the party and the president to appear too political with the nation at war.
Trent Duffy, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said the party had broadcast only one commercial this year. He said it ran in late August and criticized Democrats on Social Security.
"You don't want to spend those resources in December," one Republican official said, "when there's no indication politically that the Democratic attacks have any traction."
Mr. Rove said the party spent three thousand or four thousand dollars to produce the commercial. But he said that broadcasting it for wide viewership would have been another matter.
"If you want to be serious about it, it will cost you," Mr. Rove said. "It takes real money to put it up."
The White House keeps a tight grip on the Republican National Committee. But the committee is in a transition because Mr. Bush recently named Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana, as chairman and he has not yet taken over.
Mr. Rove said plans for the advertising campaign were never as far along as some party officials believed. "Somebody over there who is not part of the process heard about it and started talking about it," he said.
Two weeks ago, House Democrats released radio commercials attacking three Republicans for contributing to the economic slump: Representatives John Hostettler of Indiana, John Shimkus of Illinois and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.
Democratic officials would not disclose the size of the advertising campaign, but Mr. Rove said the party spent "barely enough to be heard."
But in Illinois at least, the advertisement was potent enough against Mr. Shimkus that he responded with a radio commercial in which he defended his efforts to reduce unemployment.
Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that in not broadcasting the commercial, the Republicans had demonstrated that "in the House they have a big vulnerability on the economy." She said the commercial "would have made them look defensive."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Package Lifts FedEx Earnings 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation said today that its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 26 percent as the company received government aid after Sept. 11. FedEx said it might earn less than forecast this quarter. 
 Net income climbed to $245 million, or 81 cents a share, in the quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with $194 million, or 67 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 4.9 percent, to $5.14 billion. 
 Analysts had expected the company to earn 64 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
FedEx carried more mail from the United States Postal Service than expected in the first full quarter of a contract that Frederick Smith, the company's chairman, pursued to make more use of FedEx's jets. He created a home-delivery unit last year to stop customers from switching to cheaper, slower shipments at rivals like United Parcel Service Inc. The moves will not insulate profit in a recession, FedEx said.
"They expressed very reasonable caution regarding the business for the next quarter," said Nicholas Moore, analyst at Jurika & Voyles.
FedEx received $116 million in government aid before taxes after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks grounded planes for two days, help that will not be repeated this quarter, said Alan Graf Jr., the chief financial officer. The company does not expect the economy to improve until the second quarter of 2002.

HEADLINE: Senate Vote Rejects a Bid To Increase Aid to Farms 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans effectively killed the $171 billion farm bill today, blocking the Democratic measure for this session. 
 The wide-ranging bill, which covers food stamps, rural development, and conservation programs as well as crop subsidies, would have added billions to the current subsidy system. Those federal payments act as a safety net for thousands of American farmers, providing over $10 billion in direct payments every year. 
 A similar measure passed the House in October over the objections of the Bush administration, which had warned it was too expensive and gave too much money to commodity subsidies and not enough to conservation efforts. 
In response, the Democratic-sponsored measure in the Senate offered an additional $22 billion for conservation and environmental programs over the next decade.
But Democrats failed three times this week to win enough votes for their bill, underlining the deep divisions in Congress over how best to support American farmers who have been struggling with depressed crop prices and increasing competition in the global market.
After the vote today, the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, said he planned to bring up the measure again next month. But he warned that the deficits in next year's budget could mean there would be far less money for farm programs.
"The real losers today are not Democrats or Republicans," Mr. Daschle said, "the losers are hard-working family farmers and rural America." 
But Republicans themselves disagree over how to recast farm policy that dates from the Depression era. Especially contentious is how to alter the system that rewards a fraction of American farmers, those with large grain and cotton operations, with most of subsidies.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and ranking minority member of the Agriculture Committee, rejected the accusation that Republicans were blocking the bill and hurting farmers. 
Instead, Mr. Lugar argued, there was ample time to replace the current law, which will not expire until next October, with a bill that he said should cast the safety net of subsidies far wider to help all farmers.
"This bill was crafted to benefit a fairly small number of farmers in America," Mr. Lugar said. "It is not in the best interest of a large majority of farmers."
During the debate, lawmakers from both parties argued for payment limitations, spurred by growing complaints from smaller farmers. Farmers can now learn which of their neighbors are receiving subsidy money, and how much, on a Web site opened last month.
Republican and Democratic senators also disputed whether the measure provided enough money for the food stamp program.
With unemployment rising and welfare benefits running out for many families over the coming year, food stamps will become critical, lawmakers said.
The Senate bill would increase financing for food stamps by $6.2 billion. The House measure would add about half that amount, or $3.6 billion, to a program that suffered deep cuts in the effort to overhaul welfare in the Clinton administration.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee and sponsor of the bill, said these differences paled in comparison to problems in rural America that he said needed to be addressed urgently by the passage of a new farm bill.
"This is a really sad day for farmers and ranchers," Mr. Harkin said. "We've essentially said to them, Go take a hike -- we'll deal with you later."
But Democrats are as divided as Republicans over subsidies. Midwestern lawmakers like Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota were pushing for a ceiling on payments that would allow more farmers to receive smaller payments. But Southern Democrats opposed limitations because they would hurt large rice and cotton farmers who are among the biggest beneficiaries of the current system.
The administration has criticized both Senate and House measures, saying many of the price supports under consideration would encourage overproduction, which keeps prices low and pushes up land rents. 
Those subsidies, in turn, could be in violation of international trade agreements and undercut American farm exports. Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman has said the best hope for farmers is to increase their exports overseas.

HEADLINE: AT&T'S CABLE DEAL: THE REGULATORS; 
New Era in Washington Paves Way for This and Other Deals

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Beyond its business rationale, the proposed merger of the nation's largest and third-biggest cable television companies announced tonight reflects the sea change in the regulatory thinking of Washington policy makers.
 A series of favorable court decisions this year and the appointment by President Bush of senior regulators skeptical of the old rules have ushered in a new era of deregulation in telecommunications. As a result, the proposed deal between AT&T and Comcast, which would have been unthinkable only a year ago, is not expected to encounter any serious impediments here. 
 Analysts predict it will lead to other cable television mergers, as the losing bidders scramble to find new partners to compete with their ever-growing rivals. 
"This is only the starting point," said Blair Levin, a former top telecommunications official in the Clinton administration who is now a regulatory analyst at Legg Mason.
It will also give some legal ammunition to supporters of the proposed merger of EchoStar Communications and the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors, the two players in the satellite television industry, which have encountered significant criticism by some experts who fear that the deal would lead to a monopoly. The companies contend they need to merge to compete effectively with cable TV.
The change in policy is lamented by consumer groups, and others critical of industry trends toward greater consolidation who fear the consequences of too few players controlling programming decisions and access to viewers. The old restrictions on ownership were justified on a theory first enunciated at the dawn of the radio era in the 1930's that the control of media outlets should not be left to too few players because diversity of viewpoints is so vital to a democracy.
"I think it's sad we're losing so much diversity of thought and opinion," Ted Turner, the cable television pioneer and largest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, said last month in a speech in California before cable television executives. "We're getting to the point where there's going to be two cable companies left. I doubt the government will let the last two merge, but you never know."
A year ago, the proposed deal was unimaginable in Washington. The proposed merger would give the combined company control over more than 22 million subscribers, about 34 percent of the paid subscription television market, which includes cable and satellite, and nearly 40 percent of the cable market alone. 
A set of regulations prevented cable companies like AT&T from growing any larger, and antitrust and telecommunications officials who had already approved a spate of big deals that had catapulted AT&T to the top of the industry were growing fearful of the concentration of the market. Last December, the Federal Communications Commission went so far as to order the company to sell some cable assets. 
But three months later, in March, a Federal appeals court struck down the regulations that had prevented the largest cable companies from growing larger and broadcasting more of their own shows. The panel found that the rules violated the companies' First Amendment rights to reach new audiences and to control their programming, a decision that the Supreme Court declined to review last week.
At the same time, a new administration took over at the Federal Communications Commission led by Michael K. Powell, who has repeatedly voiced skepticism about concentration rules and has said they appear to have outlasted their usefulness. Mr. Powell has said that for all the concern about the concentration of media there is no shortage of diverse news and entertainment on cable television, and that the Internet also provides consumers with a virtually unlimited menu of choices.
The commission and a Federal appeals court here are in the midst of proceedings that many expect will lead to the repeal of a raft of restrictions on ownership in the broadcasting and newspaper industries. Still, consumer groups say that there are other problems with permitting cable companies from growing too large. 
"This deal puts AT&T and Comcast in a position of having undue power on the programming market," said Gene Kimmelman, a senior director at Consumers Union. "We are on a path of massive consolidation."
"Further consolidation generally means that the large companies can expand their dominance over the delivery of cable programming, slow down competitors and have greater control over what channels and programming the public receives," he said.
Mr. Kimmelman noted that since Congress approved cable deregulation in 1996, basic cable rates have risen an average of 38 percent, rising annually at a rate of two to three times the rate of inflation.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Fills Nine Posts With Government Veterans 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
With less than two weeks before he takes over as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday announced the selection of nine more people to serve in his administration, saying that he expected to have most of the senior jobs filled by the time he takes his oath of office on Jan. 1.
 The appointments by the Republican mayor-elect included five people who had served in the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, one who worked for Mayor Edward I. Koch, and one who worked for Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 Mostly, though, the choices announced by Mr. Bloomberg -- a business executive who is about to take his very first job in public service -- were notable for their extensive experience in city and state government. 
Mr. Bloomberg's appointments included a chief of staff and commissioners to run the Departments of Probation, Sanitation, Transportation, Correction, Records and Information Services, and the mayor's Community Assistance Unit.
He also reappointed Tino Hernandez chairman of the city Housing Authority, and appointed Vincent A. La Padula, an adviser to Mr. Giuliani with strong ties to the city's Republican Party, as his senior adviser. Mr. Bloomberg, who was a Democrat before changing his registration to run for mayor, had come under fire from some city Republican leaders for naming mostly Democrats to senior positions.
Mr. Bloomberg has now chosen 16 people to serve in his administration. A number of key positions remain to be filled, including a deputy mayor for economic development, a budget director and commissioners for the Human Resources Administration and the Health, Fire, Buildings and Parks Departments.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bloomberg made it clear that he was satisfied with the pace of his transition, and said he was confident that his government would be mostly in place by the time he took over. He said he had requested that commissioners in those agencies where appointments had not been made to stay in place until after the holidays.
The mayor-elect is expected to name another raft of commissioners, probably including a budget director and deputy mayor, on Dec. 26.
"Our anticipation is that we will not have everybody in place by Jan. 1, but no administration has ever done that," Mr. Bloomberg said. He then proceeded to make a comparison with past administrations, though characteristically, he took care not to be critical of his predecessors.
"Having said that, we think that we are as far -- if not further ahead -- than comparable periods in the past," he said. "We are pleased with our progress. The most important thing to do is find the best people -- the best and the brightest. And we will take whatever time is necessary to do exactly that."
Along those lines, Mr. Bloomberg said that he was not considering gender, ethnicity or political registration in making his selections. Nonetheless, he said he was confident that the ultimate makeup of his administration would reflect the city's population.
"When we're done you will find a group of commissioners that pretty much reflects the population of New York City," Mr. Bloomberg said.
He then paused and took note of the group around him, which included eight men, seven of whom were white, and one woman.
"It's an accident that today there was only one women, for example," he said. "There are others we are very close to appointing. It just happened to work out today, this way. I have no particular targets. I am not looking at race, ethnicity, gender, whatever."
The woman Mr. Bloomberg was referring to was Iris Weinshall, whom he reappointed as commissioner of the Transportation Department, and who is the third woman to take a major post in Mr. Bloomberg's administration. Ms. Weinshall is married to Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat. ("Iris, are you a Democrat, really?" Mr. Bloomerg said. "I'm shocked. Do you have any affiliation with the party that I don't know about?")
Similarly, Mr. Bloomberg said he had not asked the party registrations of this latest raft of appointments. "Well, I haven't asked anybody here who is what," he said. "But presumably, after we finish this, you'll be rushing to ask and trying to make something of it."
In response to questions from reporters, four of the appointees said they were Democrats, four said they were Republicans, and one said that he was not registered in either party.
Among the Democrats who received top positions was Peter J. Madonia, who worked as a deputy chief of staff under Mr. Koch. He has been running his family bakery in the Bronx since the death in 1998 of his older brother. He will be Mr. Bloomberg's chief of staff.
In addition to reappointing Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Weinshall, both Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg also reappointed William J. Fraser, a Republican, as commissioner of the department of correction. And he announced that John H. Doherty, a Democrat who had run the Sanitation Department from 1994 to 1998, would return to the post.
Mr. Bloomberg also appointed Jonathan D. Greenspun, an executive assistant to Mr. Pataki with extensive ties to the city's Orthodox Jewish community, commissioner of the mayor's community assistance unit. He also named Brian G. Andersson, now an assistant commissioner, commissioner of the Department of Records and Information Services.

HEADLINE: A Nation Challenged 

 BODY:
 Military Sweeps

SEARCH PROPOSED -- The American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, has proposed that United States troops be deployed to comb the wild terrain of Tora Bora to determine the fate of Al Qaeda leaders. The proposal stems from a recognition that the Afghan allies may not be able to establish control over Tora Bora, an untamed region that borders Pakistan. A1

FORCES IN YEMEN -- Troop reinforcements moved into the remote hills of central Yemen, where government forces have battled tribesmen in an effort to capture suspected operatives of Osama bin Laden. B2

Tracking Efforts

ELUDING CAPTURE -- Almost all the top leadership of the Taliban has survived the American bombing campaign and eluded capture by American-backed Afghan forces. A1

A DISAPPEARANCE -- Qari Akka, a militant mullah who harbored Al Qaeda terrorists at his compound outside Kunduz, has slipped from Northern Alliance detention and into the Afghan landscape. B3

BRITISH MOVE -- Britain told the United Nations that it would lead a security force in Kabul and that an advance contingent of 200 soldiers was expected to arrive in the Afghan capital by Saturday for the swearing in of the new interim government. B3

Looking to Future Threats

SECRET WORK IN IRAQ -- An Iraqi defector said he worked on renovations of secret facilities for biological, chemical and nuclear weapons in wells, private villas and under the Saddam Hussein Hospital in Baghdad as recently as a year ago. A1

CHEMICAL WEAPONS BAN -- Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi, has notified diplomats in the Netherlands that after two decades of building a stockpile of chemical weapons he is ready to sign an international treaty banning them. B1

WARNING ON IRAQ -- The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, said that an expansion of the United States' war on terrorism into Iraq would only increase tensions in the Middle East. B4

NEW POWERS -- President Bush has granted the secretary of health and human services the power to classify information as secret, a step that shows how the battle against terrorism is drawing domestic agencies into the security apparatus. B6

Arrests and Charges

DIPLOMATS FRUSTRATED -- Foreign diplomats in New York whose job it is to monitor the welfare of their citizens say that as terrorism investigations reach a fourth month, they are frustrated by a dearth of information available on many cases and concerned by reports of mistreatment of some detainees. B5

DECIDING ON WALKER -- President Bush is nearing a decision about what to do with John Walker Lindh, the Californian-turned-Taliban fighter. The White House review came as CNN broadcast an interview with Mr. Walker, in which he said the jihad was "definitely" the right cause. B5

TERROR SUSPECT -- The Belgian police have arrested a Tunisian-born man they say had contacts with Muslim militants across Europe and recruited men for training in Al Qaeda camps. B5

Preventive Measures

VACCINE QUESTIONED -- As dozens of Congressional staff members prepared to be vaccinated against anthrax, critics questioned the safety of the vaccine and complained about the failure of federal health officials to take a stand on whether postal workers who might have been exposed should get the shots. B1

A RARE LETTER -- Donna Snyder, a grocery store employee in New Hampshire, has discovered that she has one of only two pieces of mail known to have been recovered from one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center. B6

SURPRISE FOR DONORS -- Since Sept. 11, many people have given blood for the first time, and some of them are finding out through Red Cross blood screening that they have diseases like hepatitis. B6

The Aftermath

DIESEL TANK WAS HAZARD -- Fire Department officials warned the city and the Port Authority in 1998 and 1999 that a giant diesel fuel tank for the mayor's command bunker in 7 World Trade Center, which collapsed on Sept. 11, posed a hazard. B1

AID TO FAMILIES -- The overseer of a federal compensation fund for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks has reportedly decided that the charity the families have received will not count against them in the calculation of awards from the fund. B7

COUNT OF DEAD FALLS -- The official count of the dead and missing from the World Trade Center attack dropped below 3,000, meaning that the Sept. 11 death toll in New York is now less than half as high as was once feared. B7

VOWS TO REBUILD -- John C. Whitehead, chairman of the downtown redevelopment commission, is assuring business and civic groups that he will lead an effort to rejuvenate the area and build a monument to rival the Lincoln or Vietnam Memorials. B7

DISPLACED NEIGHBORS -- The people who lived in a loft building directly opposite the World Trade Center are feeling the strain and sadness of dislocation. D1

The Arts

PATRIOTIC FILM -- "The Spirit of America," a three-minute montage of clips from 110 American movies, will be the first fruit of the post-Sept. 11 collaboration between Washington and Hollywood to appear in theaters. E1

PLAY ON AFGHANISTAN -- "Homebody/ Kabul," a play by Tony Kushner that is a meditation on Afghanistan, opened at the New York Theater Workshop. E1

TICKET PROGRAMS -- In a continued push to provide emotional solace to victims of the terror attacks as well as economic stimulus to New York cultural institutions, two new plans to give away thousands of free and discounted tickets to cultural events are beginning this week. E1

HEADLINE: Council Cuts $766 Million From Budget 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The City Council approved $766 million in spending reductions yesterday to help the city close an estimated $1.3 billion shortfall in the current year's budget. The reductions were approved after the Council negotiated an agreement with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to restore some cuts to cultural institutions, libraries and social services.
 As city officials moved to deal with fiscal fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and a souring economy, they acknowledged that two planned tax cuts would not be taking effect, after all. A $100 million package of tax cuts that was put into this year's budget but never approved by the Legislature was declared dead for the year. Council officials also said that they would not extend the elimination of a personal income tax surcharge -- a move that would net the city an additional $181 million this year, and $362 million next year. 
 The Council voted unanimously to alter the budget for the fiscal year ending next June at its final scheduled meeting, just 12 days before more than two-thirds of its members will be forced by term limits to step down. Before they voted, the speaker of the council, Peter F. Vallone, praised them for taking action and not foisting the budget problem off on their successors. 
"They could have just said, 'It's your responsibility now; you do the cuts,' " Mr. Vallone told the outgoing Council members, and some of those who will replace them in January. "They didn't do that. And they're here today ready to vote on something that's not pleasant to do, but something our constituents know is necessary to do. There is no way this city will survive without making financial sacrifices."
The city typically modifies its budget in November to adjust for any changes that have occurred since the budget was adopted in June. But this year, faced with the attack on the World Trade Center and the recession in the rest of the nation, the adjustment took on new urgency.
The combination of the disaster and the sluggish economy led the city to collect $1.1 billion less than it had anticipated in taxes. That, combined with more than $200 million in other revenue that failed to materialize, had to be offset with spending cuts and additional revenue sources, including aid the city expects for the World Trade Center attacks, and money from the tax cuts that never took effect.
Many of the savings come from across-the-board cuts to city agencies, and some come from canceling plans to expand services, rather than from cutting existing services. But even with the $55 million in proposed cuts that council leaders were able to restore, and offset with other savings, the new budget plan will still hit cultural institutions, libraries and social services hard.
The plan also recognized $738 million in other sources of revenue, including $100 million in tax cuts that the Giuliani administration had put in the budget but which were not approved by the State Legislature.
One of the largest cutbacks in individual programs involved a $71 million plan to expand day care programs for 10,000 more children who are on a waiting list of 30,000. 
It will eliminate a $5.3 million program to pay for meals for elderly immigrants and a $6.5 million anti-smoking program. It will cut in half a $3.2 million public education program intended to reduce AIDS among minorities, and cut a third of a $3.2 million program to reduce infant mortality in the city. It drastically scales back a plan to put social workers in senior centers, and cuts all but $450,000 from a $5 million program called Promise, which was designed to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs.
The agreement calls for cutting $16 million in aid from libraries, $10 million less than the mayor had originally proposed. A further $12 million of that cut could be restored, though, through a program in which the city will agree to match private donations to the libraries. It calls for cutting $11.8 million in aid to cultural institutions, with the biggest cuts falling on the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History and the Wildlife Conservation Society. 
Although officials said that the modification that was passed yesterday should help the city end the current fiscal year with a surplus of at least $375 million, they acknowledged that it did little to help the city with the fiscal problems that it will face next year.
When Michael R. Bloomberg is sworn in as mayor next month, along with the new Council members, their first order of business will be to close a budget gap for next year that has been estimated at $3.6 billion to $4.7 billion.
The budget modification recognizes that several tax cuts that were supposed to be part of this year's budget will not take effect, after all. 
The budget had called for cutting the city's hotel tax, as well as taxes for co-op and condominium owners, reductions for first-time home buyers and for parents who use child care. But the Legislature never approved a bill that would have enabled the cuts to take effect. The package would have cost the city an estimated $100 million this year -- money that can now be used to close the budget gap. 
Separately, Council officials said that they would allow a surcharge on the city's personal income tax to be reimposed. The surcharge -- which officials said varied but averaged 7 percent -- had been temporarily eliminated until Dec. 31. The re-imposition of the surcharge will yield an additional $181 million in the current fiscal year, which ends in July, and $362 million in 2003. 
The passage of the budget modification -- 48 to 0, with three members of the Council absent -- ended two weeks of feverish negotiations.
When the mayor handed in his first proposal to modify the budget on Dec. 4, Council leaders were dismayed that he called for eliminating many of their favorite projects. After negotiating, the Council got the mayor to restore roughly $55 million of those cuts, replacing them with other cuts. One Council official said that it was a fitting farewell -- a compressed version of the usual budget back-and-forth.
"It was the annual dance," the official said, "but done quickly."

HEADLINE: His Term Ending, Giuliani Celebrates His Record 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
In the first of several farewell appearances yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listed many of the benchmarks of his administration, like crime reduction, in what seemed an attempt to cement his legacy beyond his much-heralded leadership since Sept. 11.
 In addressing hundreds of civic and business leaders at the Regent Hotel on Wall Street, Mr. Giuliani reminded his audience that the city had improved tremendously in myriad ways since he took office eight years ago, and he suggested that many of his policies would survive the current damage, both psychic and financial, of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. 
 Last night, the mayor, who has less than two weeks left in office, attended his last town meeting, at a catering hall in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Instead of the series of requests to solve intractable problems that took up much of the 95 earlier such meetings, though, Mr. Giuliani last night faced a string of tributes from an adoring crowd. 
A student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice gushed, "My question is, you were the strength for the whole country. How will you continue this after you leave office, and can I have your autograph?"
The mayor dutifully signed a baseball the woman handed to him, and told her: "I thank you very much for saying that, but I'll tell you my secret: People of the City of New York were my strength. You really are incredible. I don't know if you realize how strong you are."
Earlier, at the Regent, Mr. Giuliani extolled the city's enduring nature in the face of falling tourism, pessimistic economic data and thousands of people burdened by unimaginable loss. He said that New Yorkers worried about the spirit of the city or its future "should just stop worrying."
"They should just get their heads up, instead of looking down at the ground and worrying and sweating and perspiring. They should just look up and they should look around and they should take a look at how the response the city had to Sept. 11 has made New York City, the capital of the world, now the most popular, the best regarded, the most wonderful city on the planet that everyone wants to come to and be a part of," the mayor said. "So build on the positive part and the optimistic part, and then the city's future is going to be even better than we produced."
Mr. Giuliani began his remarks by projecting on two giant screens a Time magazine cover from 11 years ago that featured the headline "The Rotting Big Apple."
From there, the mayor did a play-by-play from his management report, which was prepared before Sept. 11 and disseminated with little fanfare a few weeks later. Standing in front of a giant twinkling Christmas tree, surrounded by grand Corinthian columns, the mayor seemed to be speaking extemporaneously, perhaps because he knows his favorite statistics like his beloved Yankees know their batting averages.
Factoring out the World Trade Center attack, the mayor said that crime was at its lowest in 30 years, with the number of violent and other crimes falling 7.6 percent even this year.
Since he took office, personal income is up 49 percent, taxes are lower, the city's population has swelled to roughly eight million and private employment reached an all-time high, he said. More children have health insurance. Capital projects for arts groups have increased. And the city budget, in his opinion, was managed in a way that helped the city absorb the tremendous losses of revenues after the terrorist attack better than it would have, he said, had the city listened to those who encouraged it to pay down long-term debt.
Back before he took office, "New York City was seen as a place that was a failure," Mr. Giuliani said, adding that many cities have come to New York now to review Compstat, its program of tracking agency performances through computer statistics, which the mayor cites as the cornerstone of his mayoralty.
Aside from his extensive presentation on crime statistics -- a presentation that he has given several times in the last year -- Mr. Giuliani took extra time to stress what he seems to feel are his key successes.
For instance, he noted the 59 percent reduction in the number of people on welfare during his tenure, and reiterated how important the policy of reducing the rolls was to him and his administration. "The Human Resources Administration used to exist for the purpose of putting you on welfare," he said. "And now, instead of encouraging people to be on welfare, it tries to find a job for someone, so that we can do something real for someone."
And he lambasted the school board, one of the few important areas that is not, in spite of his prodigious desire, under his control. "The Board of Education has gotten tremendous support under this administration," he began, like a doctor at a medical conference winding up to describe an intractable disease. "I can't say, I wish I could say to you, that they have used the money as efficiently and as effectively" as numerous other departments. "Unfortunately, they continue to have a structure that is totally and absolutely inconsistent with the principles we espouse: accountability."
In many ways, the mayor's speech was a thank-you note to his former and current administration. Former and current members, in fresh blue suits and decorated uniforms, sat in the front row. They stood when he walked into the room, laughed at his jokes and gave him a standing ovation when he concluded his remarks. "After Sept. 11 the whole world found out about how talented you are," he told them. "I think you can be very, very proud about the condition in which you are leaving New York."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS GIVES UP ON DEAL THIS YEAR TO HELP ECONOMY 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Congress gave up hope today of reaching a deal this year to help the growing ranks of the unemployed and hasten a recovery from the recession and along with the Bush administration turned instead to partisan finger-pointing over who was to blame for the impasse.
 Stopped by reporters tonight as he left the Capitol, a bag of Christmas wrapping paper in his hand, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader, was asked whether the economic stimulus package was dead. "Yeah," he replied as he went out the door. 
 Republicans did not dispute his characterization, even as they brought a new version of their plan to the floor of the House tonight to spotlight their proposals. And with neither side eager to be seen as walking away, mid-level administration officials negotiated into the night with senators from both parties on the off chance they could make a last-second breakthrough. 
Congress may tackle the issue again when it reconvenes next month. But the failure for now of the two parties and President Bush to agree on a legislative package to address the first recession in a decade led some economists to mark down their expectations for a comeback next year in business activity and job creation. 
Combined with the personal nature of the criticism that flew across partisan lines as negotiations ground to a halt, it also suggested that Democrats and Republicans in Congress would head into the 2002 election year more divided than ever over taxes, health care and other issues.
In many ways, Mr. Bush, the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate were not far apart. They had agreed to give low-income workers a $300 per person check, and Democrats had signaled a willingness to go along with Republican insistence that the current 27 percent income tax rate be reduced to 25 or 26 percent. Both parties favored tax breaks that would give businesses an incentive to invest in new equipment. And Republicans had conceded that the package would have to include a substantial amount of money for unemployment benefits, including a 13-week extension of the current 26-week limit for unemployment payments.
But the talks failed to bring the parties together on what emerged as the most contentious issue, how to provide health insurance benefits to people who lose their jobs. 
With hopes fading for a deal, both parties engaged in some political gamesmanship.
During a visit to Capitol Hill this morning, Mr. Bush stunned Democrats by saying that "members of both political parties and both bodies of Congress have come to an agreement." 
But the deal Mr. Bush referred to was with three Democratic senators -- John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Zell Miller of Georgia -- who had previously signaled their support for a compromise floated by the White House last week. White House officials quickly acknowledged that Mr. Bush did not have an agreement that would bring along enough Democrats to overcome the 60-vote procedural hurdle needed to pass legislation in the closely divided Senate.
The president's assertion of having reached a deal was part of a broader effort by Republicans to cast Democrats -- particularly Mr. Daschle, a potential presidential candidate in 2004 -- as obstructionist.
To hammer home the point that the problem was with the Senate, House Republicans took up an amended version of the economic stimulus package they had passed in October. The bill contained $46 billion in tax cuts for businesses in the coming year. It also contained $13.5 billion in tax cuts for middle- and upper-income individuals, mainly through a reduction in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent, plus $13.7 billion for low-income workers in the form of one-time, $300 per person payments and $39 billion for increases in unemployment and health care benefits. The bill also contained tax breaks intended to help the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan and to help the families of victims of the terrorist attacks.
The bill significantly scaled back some provisions in the earlier House stimulus bill, passed in October, that Democrats had attacked as a giveaway to big companies at the expense of workers. Instead of calling for repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax at a cost of $25.4 billion next year, as the first bill had, the new version would cut the tax by $1.2 billion next year.
But Democrats said the Republican approach did not go far enough in expanding unemployment benefits for part-time workers and others who do not now qualify for benefits. And they said the Republican approach to providing health insurance subsidies to laid-off workers through tax credits would leave many people unable to afford coverage. 
The House bill passed its main procedural hurdle in a largely party-line vote of 219 to 198.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, defended the bill as a good-faith effort to find common ground with Democrats.
"As the Congressional session draws to a slow and difficult conclusion, the rhetoric has grown more heated and less reasoned," Mr. Thomas said.
Democrats said the bill was too expensive, especially given the likelihood of budget deficits for the next few years. In bringing up the bill, they said, Republicans were trying to score political points rather than advance a bipartisan compromise.
No Republican, said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, "is so naive that he or she believes that what they are doing tonight is going to become law."
Mr. Daschle said he would not bring the House bill before the Senate because its focus was on companies rather than workers.
"We regret very much that our Republican colleagues, at least so far, have refused to come to the table to negotiate seriously on health and unemployment benefits, in spite of the fact that millions of people are unemployed today," Mr. Daschle said at a news conference.
Economists said the lack of a compromise would not change the forecast for a recovery in the first half of next year.
"It will not affect the timing of the recovery, but it will affect the strength of the recovery during the second half of next year," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo, the banking company.
On the assumption that Mr. Bush would sign into law a stimulus package valued at $75 billion to $100 billion in tax cuts and new spending for next year, Mr. Sohn had projected that the unemployment rate would rise to a peak of 6.3 percent in June from its current 5.7 percent.
Without a deal, he said, the rate will probably peak at about 7 percent, with 140,000 additional jobs lost.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: LIBYA; 
In Changed World, Qadaffi Is Changing, Too

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qadaffi has notified diplomats in the Netherlands that after two decades of building one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the Middle East he is ready to sign an international treaty banning them.
 Colonel Qadaffi's decision -- which would open his extensive underground desert facilities to outside inspectors for the first time -- followed private consultations with intermediaries to the West. Among them were the former South African president, Nelson Mandela, who visited Colonel Qadaffi in October, and Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, who traveled to Tripoli this month after earlier talks in London with Libya's chief of intelligence. 
 Diplomats who have been in recent contact with Colonel Qadaffi said that in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks he has accelerated his efforts to improve his standing in the West.
He was among the Arab leaders who denounced the Sept. 11 attacks as "horrible," and he publicly stated that the United States had a right to pursue the perpetrators. When anthrax attacks followed, Colonel Qadaffi said, "It is a cowardly, evil and irresponsible action putting in danger the whole of humanity."
With the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Libya in 1999 and a subsequent upsurge in European business, he seems eager to win the removal of the United States trade and arms embargo that has been in place for more than two decades.
Fifteen years ago, Colonel Qadaffi was at the center of America's campaign against terror. His intelligence organization was accused of planting the bomb that killed two American servicemen and a Turkish woman at a Berlin nightclub on April 5, 1986. Ten days later, President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing of Libya, reportedly killing one of the colonel's daughters.
Then, in December 1988, a bomb aboard a Boeing 747 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. The bombing killed 270 people and Libyan agents were suspected.
Now, as part of his consultations with intermediaries, Colonel Qadaffi was said to have offered intelligence information on members of Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorist organization, including a number of Libyans who are said to have served on Mr. bin Laden's personal protection force. 
Another possible reason for his willingness to cooperate with the campaign against Al Qaeda is that Colonel Qadaffi sees Mr. bin Laden as a threat, intelligence officials and diplomats say. A new French book, "Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth," by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, cites plots to kill Colonel Qadaffi by members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which has been linked to Mr. bin Laden and listed by the Bush administration as a terrorist group whose assets should be frozen worldwide.
The diplomats who related Colonel Qadaffi's conversations said that he had seen the benefit in cooperating. An earlier decision to provide Britain with intelligence information about members of the Irish Republican Army who had trained in Libyan camps and purchased Libyan weapons and explosives became a critical factor in Britain's decision to normalize relations with Libya.
That occurred in July 1999 after Libya accepted responsibility for the 1984 killing of a British policewoman by shots fired from the Libyan Embassy in London.
Britain restored full diplomatic relations without waiting for the outcome of the complex efforts to bring the suspected perpetrators of the Lockerbie bombing to trial. 
The United States appears to be awaiting the final outcome of appeals in that prosecution.
Last January, a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands convicted a Libyan intelligence operative, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, for his role in planting the bomb. Another defendant, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was acquitted. 
An appeal is due to be heard in late January. The disposition of the case is expected to clear the way for a final compensation offer from Libya to the families of the passengers, crew and Lockerbie residents who died in the crash.
Jose M. Bustani, the Brazilian diplomat charged with implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention, said today from his headquarters at The Hague that he had received a private commitment from Libya that it would sign the accord in coming weeks. 
"I can confirm that this process has been cleared by Qadaffi, so it is a matter of time," Mr. Bustani said. "I believe the Libya development is very important, because by acceding to the convention and opening its chemical industry for inspection, that will have an impact all over the Middle East."
Mr. Bustani said that he had been trying to bring Libya "into the fold" for several years, if only to weaken the resistance of Arab states that say they will only join the 145 nations who have signed the chemical weapons pact once Israel signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Sudan and Jordan have recently signed the chemical weapons convention, but Egypt, Syria and Lebanon continue to hold out.
Last month at the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York, the Libyan envoy, Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalghem, caught delegates by surprise when he said, "My country is a party to most international agreements in the field of disarmament, and is in the process of acceding to the rest, including the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
As recently as 1996, the United States publicly threatened to attack a chemical weapons production facility at Tarhuna, about 60 miles southeast of Tripoli, where Colonel Qadaffi had constructed a huge underground complex. 
In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in February of that year, the director of Central Intelligence at the time, John M. Deutch, called Libya's facility "the world's largest underground chemical weapons plant."
The secretary of defense at the time, William J. Perry, said Washington would not allow the plant to become operational, thus putting Mr. Qaddafi on notice that the facility would become subject to military strikes. 
Still, Libya is reported to have stockpiled 100 tons of chemical weapons agents at the Tarhuna facility and at a sister facility constructed with German assistance during the 1980's in Rabta, about 75 miles southwest of the Libyan capital.
"Libya's chemical weapons program is considered to be its most successful effort in weapons of mass destruction," said Joshua Sinai, a specialist on Libya with the Analytic Services consulting firm. He said that Libya's accession to the treaty would be a "significant and welcome development," but that Washington would have to insist on "complete access" to what he said was a complex system of underground tunnels big enough to accommodate vehicles and modeled after similar tunnels in North Korea.
The United States and Russia have the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, about 70,000 tons in total, and both have committed to destroying them over the next decade.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CLASSIFIED INFORMATION; 
Bush Gives Secrecy Power To Public Health Secretary

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
President Bush has granted the secretary of health and human services the power to classify information as secret, a step that shows how the battle against terrorism is drawing domestic agencies into the national security apparatus.
 William A. Pierce, the spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, called the new authority a recognition that the agency was now in the forefront of preparations to fight bioterrorism and is sitting in on White House sessions on domestic security. 
 "The bottom line is relatively simple," Mr. Pierce said. "We are now a homeland security agency, part of the homeland security council." 
He said he expected a "narrow subset" of agency documents to be classified, those relating to bioterrorism and the nation's preparedness to respond to it. 
Officials said the kind of information that might be classified would be storage sites for vaccine stockpiles, certain laboratory floor plans or some details about emergency medical stocks. Mr. Pierce said the secretary, Tommy G. Thompson, had not used his new authority.
Experts on government classification said they believed it was the first time in several years that a new agency had been given the right to stamp information as secret. The trend had been toward less secrecy.
In 1995 President Bill Clinton issued an executive order that overhauled government secrecy rules, reducing the number of documents made secret and shortening the time such documents were kept classified.
While the health department was the lone agency to get new classification powers, the government has generally been rethinking the balance between security and the right to know since Sept. 11.
Much of the federal government already has the power to classify information. The agencies with such powers include the pillars of national security, like the Pentagon, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, and agencies dealing with energy and nuclear plant regulation. Also on the list are agencies that deal with sensitive economic and trade issues, like the Treasury and Commerce Departments and the United States trade representative.
Officials said that until the Sept. 11 strikes and the subsequent anthrax attacks, it had not been widely assumed that the nation's public health department needed such authority, But that attitude has changed.
"They clearly are a national security agency," one White House official said. "They clearly are a homeland security agency." 
He added, "One of the things you do in the homeland security business is deal with classified information."
The president's designation of the department's new classification authority was printed in the Federal Register on Dec. 12 without further explanation from the White House. Mr. Bush cited President Clinton's 1995 executive order on classification, which said classification authority would be held by agency heads and officials designated by the president.
The secretary was granted the right to classify information as secret, but he was not given the power to brand information as top secret. The government defines information as top secret if its disclosure could cause "exceptionally grave damage to the national security."
Secret information is that which could be expected to "cause serious damage to the national security" if disclosed. In general, the higher level of classification means that fewer officials have access to it.
Until now, the department had to turn to other government agencies for assistance if it wanted information in its domain to be classified. 
Critics of secrecy policies called the change relatively modest. 
"One would have liked to see some explanation of why it was necessary," Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists said.
But Mr. Aftergood said he did not think the order would greatly expand the scope of government secrecy.
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican and chairman of a House subcommittee on national security, said the department should use the power judiciously. But Mr. Shays said the classification authority was needed "to make sure we don't provide a road map to terrorists" of the nation's vulnerabilities.
Representative Jane Harman of California, the ranking Democrat on a House subcommittee on terrorism, cautioned that information sharing among agencies should be "the crux of any homeland security effort," and that classifying too many documents could hinder the transfer of information among agencies and levels of government.
Under the current secrecy rules, which were put in place by Mr. Clinton, agency heads are required to establish procedures under which employees can challenge classifications that they believe are improper.

HEADLINE: Japanese Budget Would Cut Spending, Even inRecession 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
At a time of mounting pressure to spend freely in hopes of stimulating a moribund economy, the Japanese government introduced a budget for the next fiscal year today that moves sharply in the opposite direction. It calls for unprecedentedly deep cuts in spending, in an effort to tame the country's already immense public debt.
 The government announced plans to spend 47.6 trillion yen ($370 billion) in the fiscal year starting April 1 -- 2.3 percent less than the initial budget it presented this year. If things go as planned, the government will hold its borrowing to 30 trillion yen, or about $233 billion, in new bonds, fulfilling a promise made by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
 Even so, with the nation's long-term debt expected to swell to nearly 140 percent of the gross domestic product, interest payments are taking a growing share of the budget. At the same time, the economy will yield less tax revenue next year than it has in any year since 1987, the government forecast.
"We are not optimistic at all," said Masaki Omura, an economist at the Japanese finance ministry. "The situation is serious."
Recognizing the severity of the current downturn, Japan's fourth in the last decade, the government said it is basing its plans on the assumption that the economy will not grow next year and that prices will continue falling. Japan may get some help from a recovery in demand overseas, expected by officials late in 2002.
Mr. Koizumi appears willing to let the economy slide further into recession rather than risk pushing the national debt higher, a policy that has come under widespread attack. His critics say the prime minister's first priority now should be to spur growth, not impose austerity.
"Forecasting zero growth and making no attempt to stimulate the economy is worrying," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities in Tokyo.
Under pressure from lawmakers in his own party who hold that view, Mr. Koizumi grudgingly assembled two supplementary budgets with extra spending after Sept. 11, at the risk of muddying his reputation as a reformer.
Having given that much ground, analysts said, he is likely to face pressure in coming months to set aside more of his reform agenda and assemble more spending packages.
The nation's central bank is also worried about the economy, but has little room left to maneuver. Today, for the seventh straight month, the bank lowered its assessment for the outlook of the economy, using unusually gloomy language not heard in three years. In this latest phase of the downturn, the bank said, consumers are now starting to acutely feel the pinch of wage cuts and layoffs.
In response, the bank took what steps it could to ease monetary policy, given that short-term interest rates are already effectively zero. The bank said it would pump more cash into the money markets to ensure that ample credit was available to banks and borrowers. And it said it would step up purchases of government bonds.

HEADLINE: Diagnosis of World's Health Focuses on Economic Benefit 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
For $101 billion a year in medical research and treatments, eight million lives could be saved annually in the developing world, and $186 billion a year in world income now lost to illness could be recovered. So concludes a report on economics and health released yesterday by the World Health Organization.
 The committee that drafted the report, led by Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, studied how a combination of foreign aid and impoverished governments' own funds could improve the health of people in emerging economies. The initiatives would tackle AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases common in developing countries. 
 "There is no way these diseases can be addressed without international assistance," Professor Sachs said in an interview.
He said he hoped the United States would pledge about $10 billion a year, more than one-quarter of the amount the committee said would be needed from donor nations. Such a pledge would double foreign aid spending, to 1 percent of the federal budget.
"In Europe, this is no hard sell at all," Professor Sachs added. "The rest of the world gets this."
Most European nations spend proportionally more of their budgets on foreign aid than the United States does. So do Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. In absolute terms, America dispenses more aid than any other nation, but only one dollar in 20 finances health programs.
In all, the report calls for wealthy donor countries to contribute $38 billion a year by 2015, with the developing countries that would benefit putting up $63 billion of their own. New international agencies would administer the donated funds.
Giving priority to health aid makes sense, according to David Dollar of the World Bank, because it is easier to deliver than other types of assistance. "There are certain types of health interventions that work even where other types of aid don't work," Mr. Dollar said.
Health aid need not be in the form of easily squandered cash, he said, and it can be applied effectively even where there is no infrastructure or stable government.
"In the case of vaccination, you can deliver the aid as physical vaccines, and it's a one-time intervention in many cases," Mr. Dollar explained. In the long term, vaccinations may help people more than projects like new roads, which soon fall apart if not maintained. 
Among the report's more disputed proposals is "a cooperative and voluntary arrangement" among the pharmaceutical industry, governments and the World Health Organization to cut prices on drugs and vaccines.
"We share the overriding goals of the report, but we have a lot of questions about specific strategies," said Rachel Cohen of Doctors Without Borders. "Relying on good will or charity is a very frightening way to move forward. Companies can have their priorities change overnight."
The plan will probably meet strong opposition in the United States, where foreign aid has many enemies in Congress and health aid, especially, is fraught with controversy.

HEADLINE: Protecting Steel: An Economic War That All Could Lose 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE late 1990's boom was something like a great party. Not only did the party make people feel good, it made them forget their other troubles.
 But even great parties must end. On the morning after, the hangover arrives. Then the partygoers recall what was worrying them before the party became so much fun. 
 One thing that worried Americans in the early 1990's was the specter of overcapacity in a series of important industries, among them steel and cars. The fear was that the United States, as a relatively high-cost producer, would have a difficult time competing.
Now those issues are coming back. We've gotten used to the hangover -- the immense overcapacity left when the telecommunications and Internet bubbles burst -- and are starting to remember what we used to be unhappy about. Unfortunately, the solutions being proposed for the first economic crisis of this century have a 1930's ring to them.
Take steel. The simple solution, of letting markets weed out the least efficient producers, is not even being considered. The Bush administration, which seems to be a strong believer in free trade so long as it does not cost any votes in swing states, is pushing for an international deal to cut production and thus raise prices. In other words, it thinks an international cartel would be just fine.
It has gotten other countries to agree on some vague goals for cutting capacity that will probably not have much impact. So the administration may carry out its threat to impose tariffs of up to 40 percent on imported steel.
Which brings us to cars. "What happens to Ford, General Motors and Chrysler if the cost of steel goes up dramatically compared to what it costs elsewhere?" asked William Dudley, an economist with Goldman, Sachs. "Are you really making yourself better off?"
Of course not. Nor would the American auto industry be helped if Japan's recent successful efforts to drive down the value of the yen continue. If so, there will be demands for some kind of protection for automakers. Even before the recession was officially announced, numerous industries were calling for the dollar to be devalued to make their products more competitive.
Competitive currency devaluations and tariff barriers, collectively known as "beggar thy neighbor" policies, were tried during the Great Depression and made matters worse. That history is known to policy makers, but such steps are taken one at a time, often in retaliation for something another country has done, and are often popular.
The current recession remains a mild one. While demand has collapsed for those industries that expanded most in the bubble, overall industrial production is off just 7.4 percent from its peak. In part that is because of surprisingly strong auto sales, which reflect a combination of consumers who do not fear they will be laid off and automakers willing to battle for market share even if they lose money on every sale. No postwar recession, except for 1990-91, has ended with such a small decline in production.
Wall Street seems to be confident that the recession will soon end. The collapse of the latest economic stimulus bill was received with a yawn.
But even if the recession is almost over, there are few prospects for a surge in any sector. Cars and housing will be lucky to hold their own, and companies continue to announce cuts in capital spending. Without an engine of growth, the pressures for economic warfare, 1930's style, will intensify, and could make a bad situation much worse.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports 5-Month Low In New Claims From Jobless 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The number of United States workers filing new claims for unemployment insurance dipped to a five-month low, suggesting the worst of the layoffs seen after the terror attacks may be over.
 But economists warned that the country is still in for a period of rising unemployment because of lingering weakness from the recession. 
 For the work week ending Dec. 15, new claims for jobless benefits dipped by a seasonally adjusted 11,000, to 384,000. It marked the third consecutive weekly decline and pushed claims to their lowest level since July 28, the Labor Department reported today.
Jobless claims fell by a sharp 85,000 for the work week ending Dec. 8, and dropped by 13,000 the week before that. In fact, new claims have fallen in seven of the last eight weeks.
The more stable four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, also declined last week to 438,000. 
Economists were encouraged by the declines, saying they may signal that the level of layoffs, which rocketed after the Sept. 11 attacks to a nine-year high, is stabilizing.
"It's starting to become more convincing that the drops in layoffs are for real and that the worst of the layoffs may be behind us," said one economist, Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates.
To cope with the sour economy, which slid into recession in March, companies have cut production, trimmed hours and let workers go.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
The Postal Service, lightening up, sends a thoughtful holiday greeting by way of a TV spot.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
MAIL volume and revenue were declining for the United States Postal Service even before the Sept. 11 attacks because of the economic slump; since then, of course, the post office has also been battered by anthrax scares and anthrax-related deaths among its workers.
 These woes have been reflected in recent advertising, most notably a television commercial, "Pride," which features real postal employees carrying out their duties with determination and enthusiasm, notwithstanding snow, gloom of night and, presumably, bioterrorism. That spot was introduced in November; at the time, Larry Speakes, the advertising manager for the Postal Service, said that it would probably be the only commercial the service would run until next year. 
 But times change. The anthrax threat seems to have eased. The national mood, while still subdued, seems less bleak. And postal officials have decided to lighten up, at least for the holidays. So they have introduced a 30-second spot called, appropriately, "Holiday." The ad, which began running on Wednesday night, is intended to remind viewers that the mail is about not just duty but also "bringing people together," Mr. Speakes said. 
"Holiday" was produced by Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group, the Postal Service's lead agency. "Pride" was created by Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, another agency used by the service. Like "Pride," "Holiday" shows real postal employees doing their jobs. As a piano tinkles "Auld Lang Syne," they recite fictitious names of the people and companies they are supposed to be connecting -- a cross section of the American populace, from the look and sound of it.
"From Claudia Rodriguez to her childhood friend," says an Asian clerk seen standing behind a post office counter, accepting a package. A male Hispanic letter carrier is then shown walking and talking about connecting a construction company and its "No. 1 supplier." His image is followed by one of an older, black male clerk who delivers a package while speaking about "Grandpa William and his grandson Billy."
A white male letter carrier is shown helping to unite the hearts of "Sgt. Peter Kozak" "and his fiancee, Deb." A black female employee makes the link between "Chang Lin and her great-great aunt." And, finally, another white male letter carrier brings together "Timmy Welsh and a Mr. S. Claus."
That is when the spot ends and a voice-over narrator is heard intoning: "To all the people who can't be together from all the people who bring you together. Happy Holidays." 
Lisa Bennett, executive vice president and executive creative director for Leo Burnett, explaining the rationale for the spot, said: "There are 800,000 employees in the Postal Service. We really wanted to represent the people who make up the Postal Service and, with the names of the senders and receivers we mentioned, to be inclusive of all kinds of people and relationships in the country." The spot was cast from a group of postal workers in the Chicago area who auditioned for the parts.
"Holiday" will run through early January on programs including "60 Minutes II," "E.R.," "Law and Order" and "Providence." It will be shown for football fans during the Independence Bowl on Thursday and the Holiday Bowl next Friday. "Pride" will continue to run, on a reduced schedule, on programs including "20/20," the network morning news programs and various end-of-the-year sports telecasts.
Mr. Speakes declined to disclose spending for either spot but said the Postal Service's total ad budget for fiscal year 2002, which ends in September, was about $112 million.
Will the spots work? The volume of standard mail -- formerly called third-class mail -- is down about 2 percent this year, as is first-class mail, Mr. Speakes said. Given current economic conditions, he does not expect "Holiday" or any other spot to able to remedy that problem immediately, or even at all, he said. Instead, the spots are meant more as a "branding message."
Which is?
"That the Postal Service really champions relationships," Ms. Bennett said. "And that it is the support system for all sorts of them."

HEADLINE: Bill Will Cut Fees to Regulators 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
A proposal to cut fees paid to federal regulators for corporate registrations, transactions, and mergers by an estimated $14 billion over the next decade was headed to the White House after lawmakers approved it today. 
 Overcoming a final obstacle before reaching President Bush, the Senate approved without debate the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act, which aims to reduce fees paid to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 "This is it. It's off to the President now," said Craig Donner, a spokesman for Vito Fossella, a Republican representative from New York and one of the principle authors of the measure. "It's our understanding that the White House is supportive." 
The bill also includes a provision to raise salaries at the S.E.C., the investor protection agency, and bring them in line with other financial regulatory agencies. "With the passage of this legislation, and assuming its enactment into law as well as its full funding, we believe we will be able to continue to attract and retain outstanding staff," Harvey Pitt, the S.E.C.'s chairman, said. 
Wall Street's trade groups applauded the Senate, saying the bill would eliminate a hidden tax and focus on the main role of the fees, which is to finance the regulatory activities of the S.E.C. 
The Senate approved the measure by unanimous consent amid a flurry of proposed legislation Congress is trying to tackle before it leaves for the year. The bill intends to cut fees and other charges the S.E.C. collects through securities transactions, which amount to more than five times the agency needs to fund its operations. The measure also seeks to retain lawyers, accountants, and examiners the agency has been losing in recent years.

HEADLINE: ConAgra's Earnings Decline by 18% 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Profit at ConAgra Foods fell 18 percent in its most recent quarter as the company struggled with the recession and incurred additional marketing expenses. 
 However, strong sales of major brands like Butterball turkey, Hunt's tomato products and Banquet and Healthy Choice packaged dinners helped ConAgra Foods beat Wall Street's expectations. 
 ConAgra, the nation's second largest food company, said it earned $231.6 million, or 44 cents a share, down from $28.2 million, or 54 cents a share a year earlier. 
Its results beat Wall Street's expectations of 43 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
"Our company has weathered one of the most difficult quarters in history, marked by recession and war," ConAgra's chairman, Bruce Rohde said. "Our ability to perform well in this environment reflects momentum that is building for some of our key products." 
Sales in the period, which ended Nov. 25 and was the second quarter of ConAgra's fiscal year, grew to $7.36 billion from $7.23 billion in last year's second quarter. Four of the company's largest brands, Butterball, Hunt's, Banquet and Healthy Choice, posted sales gains of more than 5 percent. 
Sales of other brands, including Armour and Chef Boyardee, Swiss Miss, Peter Pan and Parkay also showed gains. One reason for improvement was bundling complementary products around specific themes, such as "back to school" and "holiday," the company said. 
Shares of ConAgra fell 7 cents to close at $24.24 in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Sept. 11 Keeps 8 Million Home for Holidays 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Government surveys show that about eight million adults decided not to travel during the Christmas and New Year holidays because of the Sept. 11 attacks.
 About 1.4 million changed the way they planned to travel. 
Two-thirds of those switched to car from plane. A few switched to car from train, and a small number switched to plane from car, perhaps drawn by bargain fares. 
 The figures are projections from a survey of 1,000 randomly selected households by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, part of the Department of Transportation. The survey predicted that air travel would be down 20 percent. This is consistent with a survey by AAA.
Before Sept. 11, about 47 million adults planned to travel during the December holidays, the bureau said. After the terrorist attacks, the number was about 39 million, it said.
Both numbers are much smaller than those in December 2000, when, the bureau said, 62 million to 66 million adults traveled. Travel experts say the recession has cut travel even more than the fallout from Sept. 11.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Jumps to 6.9%, the Highest in Nearly 3 Years 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Fewer people were flying to New York City, which meant fewer jobs at airlines. With less business being done, fewer people were needed to work as security guards and office temps. The decline in travelers meant that hotels and retailers did not hire as much seasonal help as in years past. 
 All of which contributed to another significant decline in jobs in New York City in November and a sharp jump in the city's unemployment rate. 
 Including adjustments for seasonal factors, the unemployment rate rose to 6.9 percent, the highest rate in nearly three years.
"In the New York City economy, it's clear these are difficult times," Stephen Kagann, the chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki, said yesterday. "The job losses are widespread in key industries," like finance, tourism and media.
Normally, total employment rises in November and December because of seasonal traffic in the retail and tourist industries, analysts said. And in fact retail and tourism jobs rose significantly in November. But other industries lost enough jobs that over all, private-sector employment was almost flat.
After adjusting for seasonal factors, private-sector jobs in New York City fell by 22,500. 
While that was not quite one-third as many private-sector jobs as the 72,200 lost in October, in the wake of the World Trade Center attack, the loss of jobs over the last two months was the largest two-month decline on record, according to City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi -- larger even than the 69,900 private-sector jobs lost during the recession in the first two months of 1991.
Some economists saw bright spots in the report. "I think some people were expecting the report to be as negative as last month's," said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist for The New York Stat, a monthly newsletter covering the state economy. 
Among the few bright spots were industries that benefited from the aftermath of the attack, namely heavy construction and telecommunications, both of which added jobs. 
Government employment also surged last month. Including that sector, the total job loss in New York City last month was 18,800, compared with a revised total of 78,800 jobs lost in October. 
Financial companies recorded a net gain in November, with the securities industry alone adding about 700 jobs, seasonally adjusted. Most of the increase, however, could be traced to the return of some American Express and Merrill Lynch employees to their New York City offices from temporary space elsewhere.
Employment in New York in the securities industry remains 15,000 jobs below the level in September and 22,000 below its recent peak in March, Ms. Denham said.
While retail stores and hotels also added employees, the number of private-sector jobs fell for the seventh straight month. 
The city's unemployment rate, when adjusted for seasonal factors, was the highest since February 1999, rising to 6.9 percent from 6.2 percent in October. One year ago, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent. Statewide, unemployment rose to 5.4 percent from 5 percent in October and 4.5 percent in November 2000.
Though the rate of decline in jobs slowed last month, that does not mean that the contraction in New York City employment is over, analysts warned.
In the airline industry, for example, 5,000 jobs were lost last month and 8,700 jobs disappeared over the last year. "But we still haven't reached the numbers that the airlines announced immediately after Sept. 11," said James P. Brown, an analyst with the New York State Department of Labor, which released the employment statistics yesterday. 
When large companies announce plans for layoffs, the actual jobs are often not eliminated for several months, as employees ponder their options in taking buyouts or early retirement packages, Mr. Brown said.
"The overall picture is one of weakness," Mr. Brown said. "We are not getting a lot of the seasonal hiring that we would expect." And after adjusting for seasonal factors, he said, "the picture is still of a continued weak economy."
Even with the recent increase, the unemployment rate is well below the rate experienced in the early 1990's, after the last recession. New York City's unemployment rate peaked at 11.6 percent in September 1992, about 18 months after the national recession ended. It fell to a low of 5 percent in July 2001.
And some economists note that the percentage of state jobs lost since March, when the latest recession began, was only about half the percentage lost in the first eight months of the 1990-91 recession.
Mr. Kagann, the governor's economist, noted that the state has lost 1.9 percent of its jobs since March. That compares with a 3.7 percent loss in private-sector employment in the 1990-91 recession.

HEADLINE: More Muted Talk About Help for Economy 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Nine months after the official beginning of the recession, the inability of Congress and the White House to agree on a stimulus package no longer has economists as worried that the economy will stumble without additional tax cuts or spending.
 "It's strange to be talking about stimulus at this point, because it's so late," said Edmund Phelps, an economist at Columbia University. "There are signs now that gross domestic product is about to turn around." 
 This week, for example, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic indicators rose for the second consecutive month, and by more than investors were expecting. New claims for unemployment benefits, the Labor Department said yesterday, dropped for the third consecutive week. 
Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, said that if the economy was already recovering, a stimulus package could do more harm than good. He warned that billions of dollars in tax cuts and spending could shorten the time before the Fed must again raise interest rates to fight inflation. 
"Anything that hastens that date," Mr. Bartlett said, "is bad news for the economy and worse news for the administration."
Do not forget, he said, that the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates 11 times this year and that Washington plans to spend billions of dollars to pay for disaster relief and to fight terrorism.
"It's important to remember," Mr. Bartlett said, "that there's already a lot of stimulus in the pipeline."
John Lipsky, the chief economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, said the best-timed stimulus may already be in place, somewhat unintentionally, thanks to the tax cuts and rebates enacted earlier this year. 
"They appeared at the exact right time," Mr. Lipsky said.
But he argued that Congress could still help the economy. "There are many reasons to believe that the recovery will be fairly muted," he said. "Fiscal action strikes me as potentially helpful in encouraging both the speed and vigor of the recovery."
But it may be too late, Mr. Lipsky said, to achieve those goals by expanding jobless benefits and health coverage for the unemployed. "If the idea is to provide potential fiscal stimulus that is fast-acting," he said, the government should focus on tax cuts rather than new spending.
The Republican-controlled House passed legislation yesterday that would have provided additional tax breaks, but Democrats -- led by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader -- rejected the measure as too stingy to the unemployed. Moreover, most of the tax cuts in the House bill were aimed at spurring investment by businesses, a focus that was misplaced, Professor Phelps said. He added that spending by companies had declined to historically normal levels and was unlikely to rise soon.
"A huge part of the downturn is not the classical recession, in which you expect to retrace your steps a year or two later," Professor Phelps said. "Most of this downturn is simply the end of an unsustainable investment boom that got started in 1996 and ran out of gas in 2000."
Mr. Bartlett criticized the House's stimulus bill for being heavy with pork-barrel programs, influenced more by politics than economics. 
"There's a lot of stuff in the bill," he said, "that may or may not be good things to do as a matter of policy, but you really can't say that they're stimulative."
Despite these elements, several Wall Street analysts said that the stimulus package would have provided at least some spark for the economy. Yesterday, at least three said they would cut their forecasts for the economy's growth next year.
Though the stimulus plan has received the most attention in Washington, other bills stuck in Congress could be of equal importance to businesses.
Politicians seem to have given up until next year on a bill meant to set up a nationwide system of commercial insurance against terrorism, even though insurance policies for many companies will expire on Dec. 31.
John Berardi, the chief financial officer of Farmland Industries, said the failure to act on the stimulus plan, the new farm bill and an energy bill would slow recovery in the farming industry. 
Agriculture has been hit particularly hard this year because commodity prices have dropped at a time when credit became harder to obtain.
Mr. Berardi said he hoped a stimulus package would still be on the agenda when Congress returns in January. "There's still an opportunity," he said.
Professor Phelps said he hoped Congress would shift its attention to long-term strategies to improve the economy, like programs to create jobs.
"A lot of economists wish that there had been a debate about permanent changes in economic policy," he said. "We should be worried more about how high the normal unemployment rate is, especially for low wage workers."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN ARGENTINA: ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE; 
U.S. Says It Favors Deferring Argentine Aid

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Despite Argentina's severe economic and political crisis, Bush administration officials said today that they were unlikely to support any new aid until the country adopted an economic course that had a chance of lifting it out of a four-year recession.
 What administration officials are not saying publicly is that Argentina will almost certainly have to devalue its currency and default on its debt before it has a chance of restarting the flow of loans from a $22 billion aid program administered by the International Monetary Fund. 
 In the eyes of many officials, the resignation of President Fernando de la Rua today increases the chances that a new government will adopt a better approach to managing the economy. 
"They're working through the difficult options that a sovereign nation has to look at to put itself on a sound financial footing," said Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. "And that initiative has to come from the leadership of a country. It's not something that can be imposed from outside."
Asked if Argentina could expect any new aid to help grapple with unrest, Mr. O'Neill replied, "I think not."
Any new government in Buenos Aires is expected to abandon the policy of fixing the currency, the peso, to parity with the dollar, and to delay or cancel payments on its $132 billion foreign debt.
The United States and the monetary fund had supported Argentina's bid to defend its currency with several loans. But Mr. O'Neill has expressed skepticism about bailouts, and fund officials have been hinting in recent weeks that Argentina is unlikely to get any more support unless it takes a new approach. 
The fund rejected Argentina's urgent appeals to release a $1.24 billion installment of a loan arranged earlier this month, setting up the events that led to the fall of Mr. de la Rua's government. 
The fund generally allows member countries to decide how to manage their currencies, but Argentina's collapse appears to bolster the view -- already ascendant in the I.M.F. -- that it makes little sense to provide large aid packages to support fixed currencies. The preferred alternative is to let currencies float and adjust to market conditions. 
Riots in Argentina's major cities could also add momentum to a push within the monetary fund to find a more orderly way for governments to renegotiate their debts when their policies fail.
Some economists say the Bush administration and the monetary fund are partly to blame for Argentina's problems. 
Critics contend that an earlier aid cutoff might have forced the government to scrap damaging economic policies earlier. Instead, it imposed an austerity program and limited consumers' access to their bank accounts in a fruitless effort to meet financial goals set in conjunction with the monetary fund last summer.
"The fund gave them one too many bailouts," said Morris Goldstein, a former monetary fund official who is now at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The best hope is to get a new team there that has a credible plan, and then give them some money to help."

HEADLINE: Regents' Plan Would Alter Aid to Schools 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
The New York State Board of Regents yesterday proposed cutting state aid for education by 5 to 15 percent a year in some of the state's wealthiest districts and sending more money to school systems with high concentrations of poverty and poor performance.
 The plan was outlined yesterday by Carl T. Hayden, the Regents chancellor, and Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner. If passed by the Legislature, the measure would primarily benefit New York City and the other four big urban areas -- Yonkers, Rochester, Syracuse and Buffalo. Some rural school districts and small urban districts, like Roosevelt and Wyandanch on Long Island, would also benefit. 
 Mr. Hayden acknowledged that the plan would probably face resistance from upstate and suburban legislators who were likely to lose state aid. To blunt such opposition, the Regents, who set policy for schools statewide, called for lifting many restrictions on the way school districts can spend state aid, freeing them to shift money from one category to another. The plan would consolidate 18 of the biggest restricted categories into four more flexible ones: operating aid; gap aid, intended to close the achievement gap between districts; instructional materials aid, for textbooks, computers and libraries; and computer hardware aid. Some categories, like aid to special education, would remain unchanged.
This unrestricted approach to spending has been a perennial favorite of Republican lawmakers, and it was greeted positively yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki and Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, even as they chided the Regents for proposing what Mr. Pataki called a "major increase" in spending for education: $599 million, an increase that would constitute 4.7 percent of the current $12.7 billion budget. 
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno declined to comment on the proposal to reduce the share of aid going to wealthier districts. But Mr. Bruno said the Republican-dominated Senate was "wide open" to a more equitable way of distributing aid. "These things need to be negotiated out," he said. "Until we see the ramifications, it's hard to predict."
In defense of the plan, Mr. Hayden stressed that all districts would get some of the increase, even if not as large a share as in the past, and he noted that the increase in aid the Regents were asking for this year was about half what it was last year, a nod to the troubled economy. "This is not a Robin Hood scheme," Mr. Hayden said at a news conference in Albany to announce the plan. "More aid needs to flow to the children who need it most."
The Regents' drive to shift aid to poor and low-performing districts and to streamline the state aid formula comes as the state is under pressure to comply with a ruling in January by Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He found that state aid to New York City schools was so deficient that the state was not meeting its constitutional requirement to provide a sound, basic education to all students.
Mr. Mills said yesterday that the Regents proposal was not a direct response to that court ruling, but Mr. Hayden interjected, "It certainly speaks to some of the observations contained in the decision." 
Steve Allinger, the Albany lobbyist for the New York City Board of Education, said yesterday that he saw the Regents' proposal as in the spirit of bipartisanship that President Bush used to win approval of his education plan in Washington. 
Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor, who harshly criticized last year's Regents plan for not directing enough money to the city, declined to comment in detail, though a spokeswoman said he liked this year's plan better than last year's.
Of the $599 million proposed increase to education, $388 million, or about 64 percent, would go to New York City, higher than the 40 percent proposed by the Regents in last year's plan. James A. Kadamus, a deputy state education commissioner, said, however, that that did not necessarily mean that New York City would get the most money per pupil, as other districts also have high needs. Over all, the proposal would give 87 percent of the increase to all so-called high-needs districts, 10 percent more than the share they received last year.
Mr. Kadamus said school districts in some wealthy suburbs, like parts of Westchester County, stood to lose little if any aid, because they already had extremely high education tax rates and their school populations were growing. The plan also recognizes the higher cost of doing business downstate, Mr. Kadamus said.
In contrast, he said, some upstate districts that are quite wealthy but shrinking have, under the existing state aid formula, been unfairly protected from reductions in aid.
Wealthy districts would lose as little as 5 percent of their present share of state aid if they are levying local taxes for education at or above the state average. The loss could grow to a maximum of 15 percent if their local contribution to education is below the average.
New York City, Mr. Kadamus said, has increased its local tax levy for education over the past two years so that it is now $16.14 per $1,000 of actual value, just below the state median of $17.58. Rochester is at $22.82, Yonkers at $18.09 and Buffalo at $11.24.
Noreen Connell, executive director for the Educational Priorities Panel, a budget watchdog group, said yesterday that while she supported the reallocation of resources to needy districts, the amount New York City would gain was not enough of a benefit to justify lifting some of the restrictions on state aid.
She said ending the restricted funding for the state's class size reduction program would encourage districts to make classes bigger once again and put money into other programs, like teacher training and remedial education. Studies have shown that smaller classes are more effective than teacher training in improving the achievement of poor children, Ms. Connell said, and with smaller classes, children would not need as much remediation.
"If overnight this proposal rectified all the underfunding in New York City, that would be different," Ms. Connell said. "But they're taking out something good at the school level that is going to be thrown into a pot which could go into any number of dysfunctional programs that are maintained year after year."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN ARGENTINA: THE REGION; 
Despite Sneezes, No Cold Yet in Brazil

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
As a rising tide of popular frustration with the precarious state of the Argentine economy swept away the government of President Fernando de la Rua today, the financial markets of Brazil and neighboring nations took the turmoil in stride, suggesting that the damage may not spread much beyond Argentina.
 Analysts, investors and executives said that for today at least, the problems seemed largely limited to Argentina, in part because most lenders to the government are Argentines themselves rather than foreign banks. Moreover, the crisis had been developing for so long, they said, that most businesses with exposure in the region were prepared for trouble. 
 And while speculators bid down currencies in neighboring countries and in vulnerable nations as far away as South Africa and South Korea, there was little sign of the rapid financial contagion produced by currency crises in Asia and Mexico in the late 1990's and in Brazil last year. 
Investors were treated to the counterintuitive sight of Argentine stock prices shooting upward as the political situation crumbled. The most widely followed indicator, the Merval index, rose an unheard-of 17.49 percent today, and has gained 58 percent this month. 
Analysts said the market surged because investors saw blue-chip stocks as a safer place to keep their savings than the country's banking system, which is widely expected to be hurt badly by a devaluation of the peso and a default on government debt that many people in South America now see as all but inevitable. Stocks were also seen as a way to move money out of the country legally after the government imposed controls on cash withdrawals and transfers at the start of the month. 
"No foreign investors are going to be putting money into Argentina right now," said Bill Rudman, who is head of the Latin America group at WestAM, a money management company in London. "It's the Argentines who are looking for financial assets in anything other than a bank account."
The frantic stock trading today produced a gap of about 30 percent between the peso price of Argentine stocks and the dollar price of equivalents traded in the United States, known as American Depository Receipts. The gap suggested that investors expect the peso to be devalued by about 23 percent. Before resigning today, Mr. de la Rua said for the first time that the government was considering releasing the peso from its firm peg to the dollar.
Neighboring Brazil has the most to lose in an Argentine economic collapse. About one-seventh of its trade is with Argentina. Its weaker currency, the real, has given Brazilian goods price advantages over Argentine competitors in both countries, an advantage that will shrink or vanish if Argentina devalues.
With an eye on Buenos Aires, Brazil's central bank decided Wednesday not to change short-term interest rates for the coming month, despite improvements in Brazil's trade balance and external deficit that might otherwise allow a cut.
The credit markets have been factoring the growing risk of devaluation and default into the prices of Argentine government bonds for weeks. Bond trading today was thin and erratic, but generally headed lower. The benchmark Global 2008 bond's price fell 11.6 percent, to 24.75 cents per dollar of face value; the yield on government bonds rose to 44 percentage points over comparable United States Treasury securities.
With the economy stalled and little new financing available to Argentine companies, corporate debt defaults are rising. "We are seeing a trend of second-tier companies calling in the chips," said Laura Feinland Katz, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, the debt-rating agency.
Ms. Feinland Katz said most of Argentina's major corporate groups still have investment-grade ratings and sufficient cash on hand. But if the government tightens restrictions on capital outflow in an effort to shore up dollar reserves, companies might be unable to meet obligations.

HEADLINE: Meatpackers' Profits Hinge On Pool of Immigrant Labor 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The indictment of Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest meat processor, on charges that it conspired to smuggle illegal immigrants to work at its plants, is a sign of how dependent theAmerican food and agriculture system has become on foreign-born workers, many of them here illegally.
 Because of this heavy reliance, agriculture experts say, a major effort to crack down on the hiring of illegal workers could disrupt the nation's food industry. 
 "This would really cripple the system," said William Heffernan, professor of rural sociology at the University of Missouri who has studied immigrant labor. "In the communities where these plants are located there isn't an alternative work force. They'd have to raise wages and improve the conditions." 
Until 15 or 20 years ago, meatpacking plants in the United States were staffed by highly paid, unionized employees who earned about $18 an hour, adjusted for inflation. Today, the processing and packing plants are largely staffed by low-paid non-union workers from places like Mexico and Guatemala. Many of them start at $6 an hour. 
The shift in the economics of the food and agriculture industry has made such jobs unappealing to Americans, but highly enticing to immigrants.
Companies like Tyson, Smithfield Foods and Conagra have profited from paying low wages, pushing production lines faster and hiring workers who are much more willing to endure the hazardous conditions of a meat-processing plant, industry experts say.
"This is certainly not unique to Tyson," Professor Heffernan said. "This has been around for a long time in the meat-processing industry. And employers can take advantage of these people because they can threaten to send them back."
The companies can also benefit from high turnover, which means workers often do not qualify for insurance or vacation time.
But high turnover means the companies face constant pressure to find new workers. That pressure may have been at the heart of the actions Tyson is accused of in the indictment, which was unsealed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn. 
The government charged the company and six of its employees with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants across the Mexican border and help them get counterfeit work papers for jobs at more than a dozen Tyson poultry plants. The indictment said that, to meet production and profit goals, Tyson officials would contact local smugglers near its plants to get more workers. 
Industry experts said it has long been believed that American food companies recruit in Mexico and knowingly hire illegal workers. Some said the companies advertise on the radio in Mexico, distribute leaflets, show videos and hire immigrant smugglers, or "coyotes."
Eric Schlosser, the author of "Fast Food Nation," which chronicled changes in the food industry, said that the recruiting and hiring of illegal workers had been widespread for some time, and that big companies had used it to their benefit.
"For me, I don't care if those workers are from Mars," Mr. Schlosser said in a telephone interview. "It's the way in which using illegals allows them to do all the other practices, like speeding up the production lines, not listening to workers and having a high turnover rate which reduces the power of the workers."
Professor Heffernan, at the University of Missouri, said it was simple: "It's the race to the bottom; it's just the race to the bottom. Companies started breaking the unions, moving the plants to rural areas and hiring immigrants a long time ago."
The same foreign-born workers harvest fruits and vegetables in Florida and California, they milk cows on giant dairy farms in Wisconsin and Oregon and process and pack potatoes in Idaho.
"Immigrant labor, whether it's legal or illegal, is critical," said Keith Esplin, president of the Potato Growers of Idaho. "Most Mexicans here will have papers, but the farmers won't have any idea. There is real good counterfeit stuff out there." 
Of course, because of the widespread use of counterfeit documents, no one knows for sure how many of them are working illegally. But industry and government officials say that, for better or worse, foreign-born workers are now one of the most vital elements in the American food and agriculture system.
About one million farm laborers are on the job at any one time, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. And a government study estimated that nearly 40 percent are illegal. A few years ago, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that about 25 percent of meatpacking workers in the Midwest were probably illegal.
"We have enormous segments of agriculture that are critically dependent on hired farm labor," said Keith Collins, the chief economist at the Agriculture Department. "They are needed, particularly for harvesting perishables, like fruits and vegetables in Florida and California." 
Asked whether many of the foreign-born migrant laborers were illegal, Mr. Collins said, Absolutely.
"It's in the hundreds of thousands," he said. "No doubt."
The government, though, has had little success in stemming the flow of illegal immigrants to food and agriculture companies. Federal raids on meatpacking plants sent many illegal workers back to their countries. But it outraged food companies, who complained of disruptions. Civil rights officials accused the government of harassing Mexicans and others from Central America. And Midwestern politicians sometimes complained that slowing down the work at meatpacking plants increased the supply of livestock and thereby harmed hog and cattle farmers, who had already been suffering from low prices for their goods.
The big meatpacking companies said today that they would work to ensure that they were not hiring illegal workers. But they have long maintained that it is a difficult thing to achieve. There is a complicated network of smugglers and a huge trade in the trafficking of fraudulent work documents.
Janet Riley of the American Meat Institute, which represents the big meat processors, said it would be hard to root out illegal immigrants because it was difficult to know how many were working at plants. The institute does not even have estimates on foreign-born workers.
"We don't know the number," Ms. Riley said. "But we do know it's significant."

HEADLINE: South Korea Reports a Widening Income Advantage Over North 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The people of South Korea are more than 12 times richer on average than those of North Korea and are steadily widening the gap, according to statistics released today by the South Korean government.
 The statistics provided startling evidence of how far the South has advanced since the Korean War compared with the North. 
 They were released in the midst of efforts by the South to persuade North Korea to return to negotiations aimed at reconciliation that were broken off last month. 
North Korea's economic troubles, as dramatized by some of the statistics, were expected to persuade North Korean leaders of the need to resume talks. 
Negotiations halted when South Korea refused to yield to the North's demand to call off a military alert that was ordered after American forces began operations in Afghanistan.
The South has promised to send 300,000 tons of food aid provided the North agrees to another round of visits by members of families divided by the Korean War. 
One factor that may influence the North's position was an event not included in the report -- preparations for the 60th birthday in February of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. 
South Korean officials believe the North will need an extra supply of food to distribute in connection with observances of an occasion that Koreans view as the most significant birthday in a person's life.
The income disparity, now 12.7 to 1, has increased significantly since 1995, when the statistics showed the average South Korean earning 10.5 times as much as the average North Korean.
Although the gap decreased slightly in 1998, the height of the South Korean economic crisis, it has widened since then, said Chon Sin Ae, director of economic management at the National Statistics Office, which released the report.
Overall, the report said, North Korea showed signs of a slight recovery floods and famines that have devastated its economy for the past six years. North Korea's economy grew by 1.3 percent last year after having fallen steadily through the previous decade.
That figure, however, was still far less than South Korea's 8.8 percent growth rate in 2000. The gap was expected to grow this year even though South Korea's economy is estimated to have increased by only 2.8 percent since last Jan. 1. 
The report found that the average South Korean's income was $9,629 in the year 2000, compared with an average income of $757 in North Korea. South Korea's overall gross national income last year was $455 billion compared with $17 billion in the North. 
The North, at the end of Japanese colonial rule over the Korean peninsula in 1945, was ahead of the South industrially and maintained that lead after the Korean War ended in 1953. Then in the 1960's, the South entered an era of rapid industrial expansion.
South Korea, for instance, produced 3,115,000 motor vehicles in 2000 while the North produced only 6,600 vehicles, almost all of them trucks that were largely for military use. All told, more than 12 million motor vehicles ply South Korea's often crowded streets and highways. By comparison, only 262,000 vehicles operate on the North's largely empty roads.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers in New Jersey Move on Tax Amnesty Plan 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
As they approach a deadline for addressing New Jersey's growing fiscal problems, state legislators are backing a tax amnesty that they say will bring in millions of dollars in back taxes next spring.
 At the same time, however, a proposed change in the corporate tax formula, which even its supporters concede would cut into next year's revenues, is also moving quickly through the lame-duck Legislature. 
 The amnesty plan, extending to the end of June, would forgive all interest and penalties and would apply to individual income, corporate and sales taxes. 
The last time New Jersey offered amnesty to delinquent taxpayers, in 1996, the results exceeded the best projections. The Treasury Department projected then that the state would collect $80 million in delinquent taxes; the plan netted about $250 million altogether. 
This year the proposal arose quickly, as its sponsors said it had to, to make sure that people did not put off paying taxes. The Assembly Appropriations Committee approved the measure today, and its sponsors say they believe that it can be passed by both chambers before the Legislature adjourns on Jan. 7.
As the legislators fight over spending in their final days, with Democratic leaders trying to stop new expenditures and Democratic and Republican legislators angling for favorite projects, this unexpected source of revenue has bipartisan appeal.
The amnesty plan is also appealing to those who dismissed it earlier this year. "Nine months ago I didn't believe it was wise," said Assemblywoman Barbara Buono, a Democrat and a sponsor of the measure. "But much has happened in the last nine months."
Treasury officials have yet to calculate the damage from the recession and the Sept. 11 attacks, but most estimates of the shortfall in this fiscal year exceed $1.4 billion. Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, who had maintained for many weeks that he would leave office next month with a surplus, has concurred in predictions of a shortfall. 
Several Democrats expressed reservations about an amnesty, arguing that it would chiefly benefit high-income taxpayers, or at least those able to pay their full bills, and that it would effectively reward them while other delinquent taxpayers would have to negotiate payment plans not exempt from interest or penalties.
Leonard Lance, the committee chairman and the other sponsor of the bill, said he was also concerned about possible inequities, but added, "Very few people would come forward except through amnesty."
Mr. Lance was sanguine, too, about the prospect of collecting back taxes from the late 1990's, when the state was enjoying a surge in personal incomes. 
The committee also approved a bill today to change the way corporate taxes are calculated, to base the charges only on sales. That would cut taxes for corporations with headquarters in New Jersey and the bulk of their sales in other states. 
Business representatives have estimated the cost to the treasury in the first year at $12 million, but contend that the money saved by large employers will result in many new jobs. They also say that other states are adopting similar "single sales" formulas, and that New Jersey must follow suit to attract new employers and investment. 
Opponents of the measure say the revenue losses would be much higher. In testimony before the committee, Jon Shure, the president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal research group, said the losses could reach $250 million a year.
Opponents also argued that of the eight states -- including Connecticut -- that have adopted the same kind of formula, few have seen the employment gains predicted, and some have lost manufacturing jobs. 
But the proposal has been approved by comfortable margins in both the Senate and Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committees.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: FUND-RAISING; 
Striving to Fill Stockings in Hard-Hit Town

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: NEVADA, Mo., Dec. 20 

 BODY:
James McKenzie's Christmas list this year is as long as ever: 17 10-year-old girls, 16 7-year-old boys, 20 infants, 49 toddlers -- 314 children and counting. But his budget hardly matches: Days before the deadline, the toy drive that Mr. McKenzie runs here in this haggard town of 8,500 had collected only half its $5,000 goal.
 "People are thinking the same, 'I am tapped out,' giving 5 bucks where it may have been 10," Mr. McKenzie, director of the county ambulance service, shrugged as he sorted stuffed animals in the room he calls Santa's little workshop. "The only people that we rely on -- that we can rely on -- is our own community. If their revenues are falling short, it's going to affect us." 
 Call it charity fatigue. With widespread layoffs and a spiraling recession after the national outpouring of more than $1 billion in donations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Christmas do-gooders across the nation are struggling to stretch scarce resources for an ever-growing number of applicants, many of them fresh out of work and asking for help for the first time. 
The United Way and Salvation Army do not tally donations until their holiday campaigns are over. But Maj. Bill Grein of the Marine Corps' Toys for Tots program, which collected 15 million toys last year, said donations were "significantly down" in 40 percent of the 380 divisions. In a recent survey, one in four people said their contributions to Sept. 11 charities would hamper their holiday giving, and half said the economic downturn meant they would cut back on their charitable giving.
Donations to Watershed Inc., which provides food, clothing and toys to poor people in central Arkansas, are about 60 percent off from last year. The "Angel Trees" in Marysville, Calif., north of Sacramento, have yielded only about 1,500 presents this season, less than half of last December's total. Near Daytona Beach, Fla., volunteers are as rare as cash: The Salvation Army found only enough bell-ringers for 26 spots instead of its usual 42. 
Here in Nevada (pronounced nuh-VAY-da), a 150-year-old railroad town 100 miles south of Kansas City, Mr. McKenzie's "Share the joy, give a toy" banner went up at precisely the wrong time. Honeywell International announced in November that it was moving its Nevada operation to Mexico, taking 200 jobs. Key Industries, a manufacturer of work clothing, just closed its 50-worker plant. The payroll at FirstStar Bank's loan processing center in town has gone from 200 employees to about 50 this year, the bulk of the cuts in recent weeks. 
"It all came down pretty hard last month," said Craig Hubler, the city administrator.
But you cannot reschedule Christmas. So Mr. McKenzie and his emergency-services crew made the annual siren-free ambulance run to Wal-Mart, filling eight shopping carts with Hot Wheels Hyper Cycles and Tonka trucks, Fashion Polly purses and Diva Starz dolls. All eyes were on price tags.
"When you're buying one or two, you don't think so much about it," said Tina Werner, a paramedic, surveying Playskool's Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head Silly Suitcase with 3-year-olds in mind. "Add $14.88 up 13 times, the money doesn't go very far."
Mr. McKenzie, who has spent all but one of his 37 years in Nevada, the last 12 as one of five elected members of the Town Council, lacks a paunch, and only a handful of whiskers in his trim beard are white. But for the last decade, he has played Santa Claus to poor children scattered around Nevada and surrounding Vernon County. 
Children from families with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines -- $25,575 for a family of four -- qualify for the toy giveaway, as well as a food basket prepared by Community Outreach, a pantry that was handing out dried milk and donated venison this morning. Barbara Long, director of the program, spent $3,519.29 on apples, oranges, carrots, potatoes, bread, milk and hams, though she has only $3,000 to pay for it.
What is worse, Key Industries said it could not provide excess clothing as it had in the past. Instead, a local church ran "undie Sunday," collecting $250 "to buy all the underwear left in Nevada," Ms. Long said. 
The toy drive also lost a sponsor. Last year, Mr. McKenzie drove to Springfield, about 70 miles away, to pick up bicycles and basketball hoops from Toys for Tots to add to the locally collected loot. But this month, the program sent a letter saying that "donations of funds are way down this year," meaning "we have less and less to divide between too many areas." Nevada's toy drive was on its own.
The middle school came through as it had before, collecting $520 at its fall dance. The ambulance service added a dessert auction to its annual Christmas party, netting $244. (Mr. McKenzie's apple pie drew only $4, but Tricia Baldwin, an emergency medical technician, baked $22 cinnamon rolls.) A local businessman gave 18 scooters.
On Wednesday night, Nancy Kerbs and her daughter Katherine, 10, stopped by the office with a Barbie and a Matchbox Splash 'n' Dash Car Wash. Ms. Kerbs's husband was just laid off at Honeywell, but she is giving instead of getting.
"We're O.K., but we know that there are people who aren't," said Ms. Kerbs, who does statistical research for a nearby college. "We've always had good intentions, but we thought this year we better do it."
After Sept. 11, Mr. McKenzie and his crew, whose five ambulances average eight calls a day, collected nearly $5,000 in the historic town square and at the high school's homecoming football game. Now he is asking again.
The goal is to give each child a sack of at least three items, starting with the stacks of Monopoly and Peek-a-Boo Peggy that donors dropped off in recent days. Then on to Wal-Mart, where each medic adopts kids from a certain age group and storms the aisles with them for items under $10. Mr. McKenzie is partial to the search and rescue figurines, miniature fire engines and, of course, ambulances.
He charged up $2,282.03 on the first shopping spree, and that does not include diapers, wipes and rattles for the youngest children. If he runs out of money, Mr. McKenzie said he would borrow from the ambulance employees' fund. Or make a last-minute appeal to his neighbors.
"It's a small town," he explained. "I can call up the owner of the radio station and say we are desperately short, we need $1,000 by tomorrow. They'll crank it up."

HEADLINE: KILLINGS INCREASE IN MANY BIG CITIES 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Homicides have increased sharply this year in many large cities, a development that troubles law enforcement officials and experts who fear it may signal a return to rising crime rates after a large decline in the 1990's.
 The rise in homicides was led by Boston and Phoenix, which had increases of more than 60 percent through Dec. 18, compared with the same period last year, according to police figures in a survey of 18 major cities. 
 Homicides jumped 22 percent in St. Louis, 17.5 percent in Houston, 15 percent in San Antonio, 11.6 percent in Atlanta, 9.2 percent in Los Angeles and 5.2 percent in Chicago, the police departments in those cities said. 
However, even the sharp increases this year leave the big cities far below the peak in homicide in 1991.
The rise in Chicago, which has had 644 homicides this year, compared with 612 in the same period last year, means that it will probably pass New York for the first time as the city with the most homicides, though Chicago has 2.9 million people and New York has 8 million.
New York is an exception to the big cities with rising homicides, with 617 through Dec. 16, compared with 651 in the same period last year -- a drop of 5.2 percent.
Several other cities also had small decreases, including Washington, with a decline of 6 percent. But in most cities with fewer homicides, the decrease was so slight that experts said it was not statistically significant.
Homicide has long been considered the bellwether crime, the one that most worries the public and therefore the one that police chiefs watch most carefully.
A jump in homicides in the big cities led the crime wave of the late 1980's, and a homicide decrease in the big cities started an eight-year decline in overall crime beginning in 1992.
Charles H. Ramsey, Washington's police chief, pointed to two possible explanations for the increases this year: the downturn in the economy and an increase in family killings after years of declines driven by greater attention to domestic violence. 
The economy is the best indicator of whether crime will continue to increase, Chief Ramsey said. 
"More pink slips mean more crimes," he said. "It doesn't take long before you start seeing that impact at street level."
Chief Ramsey said he was especially concerned about the impact that a prolonged recession would have on poorer neighborhoods and low-income workers. "It reaches everyone; it just reaches them first," he said. "If this becomes long term, believe me, you will see the difference." 
Another factor in the increase in homicides, police officials said, is the rising number of prison inmates being released, the flip side of the prison building boom of the last two decades. The number of inmates released from state and federal prisons is projected to reach 635,000 this year, up from 474,300 in 1995, Alan Beck of the Bureau of Justice Statistics said. 
Newly released prisoners are a particular problem in Los Angeles, because California, with the biggest prison system, accounts for one in five of all released inmates, the majority of whom return to Los Angeles.
"Prison is basically a place to learn crime," Sgt. John Pasquarello of the Los Angeles Police Department said, "so when these guys come out, we see many of them getting back into drug operations, and this leads to fights and killings."
James Alan Fox, the Lipman family professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University, pointed to another likely cause -- the cyclical nature of crime. "To some extent, these cities were victims of their own success," Professor Fox said. "The levels of homicides that some of these cities had at the turn of the millennium were unusually low and unlikely to be sustained." 
In addition, the number of teenagers, the age group most prone to crime, is growing by 1 percent a year after years of shrinking. But the homicides now do not seem as connected to the combination of young people with drugs, gangs and guns as they were in the crime wave of the late 1980's, police executives in several cities said.
In Boston, for example, the city with the largest percentage increase this year, 67 percent, the average age of those arrested on homicide charges is 25 and the average age of the victims is 30, far higher than average ages a decade ago in the crack cocaine epidemic.
"I don't think there is any one particular reason for the jump in homicides," said Paul Farrahar, Boston's deputy police commissioner in charge of homicides. "Where we know the motivation for the killings, they have been kind of across the board this year. I wish there was one single motive we could see, so we could address it and go back to a lower figure." 
But, Mr. Farrahar said, the most surprising increase in Boston this year has been killings involving family members.
Another possible factor in the increase this year, officials said, is the impact of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, as the police in many cities were diverted to other duties like guarding bridges and water supplies, and people suffering from depression may have turned to alcohol or drugs to medicate themselves.
But of the 16 cities surveyed, only New York, Baltimore and Washington reported a jump in crime after Sept. 11. Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said most of the increase in homicides, in those cities with upturns, occurred in the first half of the year.
In New York, crime dropped sharply after Sept. 11, followed in October and November by a surge in violence, as many police officers were deployed to other duties, Bernard B. Kerik, the police commissioner, said.
After he spotted the sudden rise, Mr. Kerik said, he ordered several of his special units back to their crime-fighting jobs, including narcotics detectives, the gang intelligence unit and the warrant squad that tracks down parolees who commit offenses. As a result, shootings and homicides dropped last week to levels below what they were in the same period last year.
Professors Fox and Blumstein said Mr. Kerik deserved credit for introducing policies to help bring New York's crimes down again this year, about 12 percent over all, in the face of the upturn elsewhere, showing that it could be done through innovation and good management. 
In Washington, Chief Ramsey said the 6 percent drop in homicides for the year would have been larger if not for the Sept. 11 attacks. "We were doing much better than that before Sept. 11," he said, "but we've had a spike since then and we're trying to figure out if that's related."
"I don't know if anxiety has anything to do with it or whether there's the impression out there that the police are busy doing other things," he said. But Washington has had a marked increase in domestic killings and others traceable to "plain old arguments." 
"That motive category is always significant, but it seems like, from Sept. 11 on, the majority seems to be that," Chief Ramsey said. "I don't know if people have shorter fuses or what; it's just too early to tell."
In one city, San Diego, the events of Sept. 11 may have led to a sharp drop in homicides. Before the terrorist attacks, the police were projecting that San Diego would have 70 homicides this year, a 40 percent increase from the 50 homicides the city had in 2000. But since Sept. 11, there have been only 5 killings, and San Diego is now likely to have no increase for the year, Lt. Jim Duncan of the homicide division said. Because San Diego is a military town, with large Navy and Marine bases, Lieutenant Duncan said, people have been focused on the war and their family members overseas, and this has helped reduce crime.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about an increase in homicides in several United States cities referred incorrectly to the comparison between Chicago's number and New York's. If Chicago, as expected, finishes the year as the city with the most homicides, this will be the second time it has surpassed New York City's total. The first occurred in 1998.

HEADLINE: Two Ways to Defy a Recession 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
"Ma'am, you're on the wrong side of the glass," Ben Carter-Allen said to the woman in the leather jacket who was peering through the yellow-framed window. "Come on in and squeeze the bears."
 A divinity school student moonlighting at the Teddy Crafters store here in the brand-new Polaris Fashion Place indoor mall, Mr. Carter-Allen, 24, catcalls to young couples in the corridor, "She needs a bear." And it works. The Happy Hugger ($36), the Lucky Dog ($23) and the Wise Old Bear (on sale for $16, from $22) seem recession-proof as they move out the door in crowds of 200 to 300 a day, many wearing $10.95 fatigues or firefighter's uniforms. 
 While the National Retail Federation is reporting the worst holiday shopping season in a decade, and the International Council of Shopping Centers says sales are down 3 percent from last year, there are few signs of the troubled economy or any threat of terrorism amid the shopping bags here at Polaris. From its Oct. 25 opening through 10 a.m. on Monday, 1,286,935 shoppers had strolled the mall's 1.5 million square feet, and several of the 150 stores and kiosks say they are leading their national chains in sales this season.
"You build it and they'll come," said Vicki Peppard, manager of Teddy Crafters, where the sales clerks ask customers to make a wish and then drop a satin heart -- symbolizing love or happiness or courage -- into the toy animal's belly before it is pumped up with fluff.
Still, many merchants are worried that Polaris's popularity will not stretch past New Year. They fear a fading of the novelty here at the first mall in the nation with seven anchor stores -- big department stores that serve as a foundation of a mall's business -- and the first in central Ohio with Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. Even as older malls die, Polaris is among 11 large shopping malls that have opened around the country this year, up from six in 2000, and one of three to have opened since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Though many worry that Columbus, the nation's 15th-largest city, is "overstored" -- Easton Town Center just doubled in size, to 1.6 million square feet, and there are four additional malls nearby -- other people are banking on the city's becoming a regional shopping destination. Polaris, which cost nearly $300 million and was built in a warp-speed 388 days (most malls take two years), has drawn 20 to 40 percent of its traffic from outside Columbus, its managers say, with shoppers crossing state lines from Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky. (Hotels across the street have been booked on weekends.)
The mall offers $4 valet parking with electronic retrieval from any of Polaris's four exits, as well as rooms, complete with glider chairs, where mothers can nurse their babies. Huge kilim ottomans and leather love seats placed around the mall make it feel like a living room.
The only reminders of the trouble beyond its parking lots are the American flags painted on the few yet-to-open storefronts. Sure, some workers called in sick on Halloween, when rumors that terrorists would attack a mall somewhere in the United States were rampant, and others were scared last week when a nearby construction crew caused an hourlong loss of power. But mostly, Polaris offers an escape. 
This morning the mall's managers stalked its halls, straightening chairs as if expecting guests for a house party. By walkie-talkie, they reported lights out on the awning at Sole Outdoors, dust on the sign of Gymboree, cigarette butts outside the California Pizza Kitchen.
"Every day at 10 o'clock is like a Broadway opening for us," said Linda Wardell, assistant general manager. "I can't go over to Afghanistan. What I can do is make sure that we have the best Santa in town."
How it's going depends on whom you ask.
Kristi Burns, whose Victoria's Attic kiosk offers scented candles, rag dolls and ornaments in the image of polar bears, says she expected Polaris to yield four or five times the sales of her other location, in Lancaster, 30 miles southeast. Instead, it is barely keeping pace.
"There's been a lot of people in this mall disappointed," said Ms. Burns, 33, a hairstylist who used her savings to pay for the $12,000 seasonal lease on the kiosk. "The good news is I was able to cancel merchandise."
Rodney Wilson, a salesman at Curio a Go-Go, said the $72.95 photo album had been a hard sell, but people were grabbing at the peculiar $3.99 greeting cards adorned with other people's castoff snapshots.
Dave Lewison, chairman of the marketing department at the University of Akron and author of a retailing textbook, says new malls typically enjoy a honeymoon of at least six months, particularly when they open, as Polaris did, on the eve of the Christmas shopping season.
"The question isn't whether they're going to do well," Mr. Lewison said of Polaris. "It's if they do well, who's going to pay the price for that?"
The answer seems to lie eight miles away, at the Northland Mall, vintage 1964, which appears to be taking its last breaths. Some 300 malls around the country have died since the mid-1990's, and experts say that up to 500 more may be on the verge. 
At noon today, Northland's concourse was as quiet as a library, save for a bleating siren from the empty miniature ride-on fire engine. The gates were down at Trends, lights out at Claire's Accessories. Santa was gossiping with a janitor because no one was in line to sit on his lap. A visiting student choir sang to mostly empty folding chairs.
All three of Northland's anchor stores -- Sears, J. C. Penney and Lazarus -- are shuttered. And all three chains have glittering new outlets over at Polaris.
In addition to its seven department stores, Polaris has such mall staples as the Gap, Stride Rite and Starbucks, along with some Ohio originals. Among the more surprising storefronts is In Your Image, where six digital cameras scan your head, creating a three-dimensional blueprint for a personalized bronze or wax bust.
"It's a keepsake, it's something you might want to wait to buy until you had more money," Bryan Taylor, the manager, admitted, though 60 to 70 people a day have been purchasing the merchandise, priced at $29.99 to $899.99. "I haven't had one person come in and say this is too expensive."
At Teddy Crafters, which has five other stores and opened here in Polaris on Nov. 17, customers have bought bears for children who lost parents in the terrorist attacks, and bears to send overseas to American soldiers. An extra $4.95 puts an electronic "I love you" in with the stuffing. (Personal messages can be recorded for $8.95.) 
"Now I'm going to put him in a bag," Ms. Peppard, the manager, cooed to a customer. "But when you get home, you get him out of there."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: COMPENSATION; 
Victims' Fund Likely to Pay Average of $1.6 Million Each

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and DAVID BARSTOW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The overseer of the federal fund set up for the families of those killed or injured in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks estimated today that the fund could cost taxpayers as much as $6 billion and would provide tax-free awards, on average, of approximately $1.65 million for the families of those who died in the attacks.
 Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master of the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, offered the estimates as he unveiled the regulations that would guide the fund's work when it opens for business on Friday. Those rules allow Mr. Feinberg to grant larger awards if evidence shows they are justified by "extraordinary circumstances." 
 The likely awards by the fund, based on the economic assumptions Mr. Feinberg has adopted, range from $300,000 for an unmarried 65-year-old who earned $10,000 a year to $4.35 million for a 30-year-old who had a spouse and two children and who made $175,000 a year. 
The estimated price of the no-fault compensation fund, the first of its kind ever created in the aftermath of an American disaster, is considerably lower than early, unofficial legislative forecasts, in part because the number of victims has shrunk to roughly half the number first feared lost in the attacks. Moreover, Mr. Feinberg has clearly put limits on how much the families of very high-income victims will be able to recover from the fund.
By law, the fund's awards must be reduced by whatever life insurance, pension payments, death benefits or government assistance victims' families have received -- a step that could pare the public cost to roughly $4.8 billion. Charitable contributions received by the families will not be deducted from the awards, however. To seek an award from the fund, claimants must waive their right to sue over the disaster, a requirement intended to limit airline liability for the attacks.
"I have met with hundreds of claimants, families who have suffered, and I am absolutely of one mind on this," Mr. Feinberg said at a news conference at the Department of Justice. "Whatever we do is of small comfort, and I realize that. We do, however, aim to provide some appropriate compensation, some limited measure of comfort."
The fund, he said, would pay the awards within four months and would spare families the need to "revisit the tragic events of Sept. 11 over and over again during the pendency of a lawsuit in our courts." 
Victims' families, lawyers and public officials, who have been waiting for months for some indication of how the fund will operate, gave the new rules and the projected payouts a widely mixed reception.
The president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which is providing free legal help for families that file a claim with the fund, applauded the program, noting that the procedures allowed families unsatisfied with a potential award to argue for more.
But some victim representatives said the estimated awards were far lower than they had hoped for, particularly with regard to the compensation for pain and suffering, which they say is much lower than they might have won in court. Mr. Feinberg, whose awards are not reviewable by any court, determined that an unmarried victim without children should get $250,000 for pain and suffering. He decided that an additional $50,000 each would be awarded for any surviving spouse or child.
"It's an absolute disgrace, and as I read it, it only gets worse," said Michael Cartier, who lost a brother in the disaster and who is a member of Give Your Voice, which represents some families of civilians killed in the attacks.
The fund, which makes its awards based largely on the lost earning power of those who died, is also likely to be of little satisfaction to the families of the uniformed rescuers, about 400 of whom died at the Trade Center. Because the families of firefighters and police officers who die in the line of duty receive generous lifetime pensions and a $250,000 federal award, it will be difficult for them to argue that they have suffered great economic damage. Mr. Feinberg acknowledged that the fund's treatment of the families of some uniformed services personnel "is a big question mark" but said he would take a fresh look at the rules if it appeared that such families were "walking away with nothing."
The fund's new rules also drew strong criticism from Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York State Attorney General, who said they were "unduly restrictive and subvert the intent of Congress, which was to fully compensate all victims of the tragedy." Mr. Spitzer said he was particularly concerned about the limits the rules put on who was eligible to file a claim for physical injury.
Mr. Feinberg yesterday defended his efforts, saying that the fund was a much more attractive option for families than the uncertainties of costly, protracted litigation.
Even for wealthy people, the awards contemplated here are substantial and far better than going to court, he said. "I am hard pressed to accept the argument that these awards are too low," he added. "This is a classic trade-off between administrative speed and efficiency and rolling the dice in court and going for the proverbial pot of gold."
Although the federal statute that created the fund did not explicitly require him to do so, Mr. Feinberg has clearly tried to address the disparities between the awards made to the families of the wealthiest victims and those made to families whose lost breadwinner earned far less.
The awards increase steadily as the victim's income increases from $10,000 a year to $225,000 a year -- but after that, substantial increases in income do not produce substantially larger awards. Thus, the award for a victim who earned $2 million a year is not appreciably more than the one for a victim who earned $225,000 a year.
Although Mr. Feinberg insisted that he had not set a limit on the awards the fund would make, he warned that awards of more than $3 million "will rarely be appropriate." Similarly, although he said that there was no official minimum award, the rules are aimed at ensuring that -- between the fund's award, life insurance, death benefits and other noncharitable compensation -- no victim's family would get less than $300,000 for those without dependents, or $500,000 for those who were married with children.
The most contentious issue Mr. Feinberg faced was the task of putting a dollar figure on the "pain and suffering" and other noneconomic losses sustained by the victims and their families. Some victims' advocates had argued that this component of the awards should vary depending on how each had died -- instantly and without warning, or after nearly an hour of choking smoke and fear. Such factors usually play a significant role in the determination of jury awards in court cases over wrongful deaths.
Mr. Feinberg acknowledged that "each person experienced the unspeakable events of that day in a unique way." But, he said: "I will not play Solomon. I cannot make those distinctions, and I will not make those distinctions. Every life is valuable." Instead, he said, "the most rational and just way" to deal with these variations in personal tragedy was to establish a single, uniform amount of compensation for everyone -- in this case, $250,000, plus $50,000 for a spouse and for each minor child left behind.
He said he was willing to listen to arguments that this element of the awards should be higher, but he noted that this figure conformed roughly to the amounts paid under existing federal programs that compensate the families of police officers and military personnel who are killed in the line of duty.
Mr. Feinberg has clarified some uncertainties that stemmed from the hastily drafted airline bailout legislation that created the fund.
The fund is open to claims filed on behalf of anyone -- other than the terrorists -- who died on the hijacked jets, at the Pentagon, or at the World Trade Center, including illegal aliens. But Mr. Feinberg has now defined who can file a claim for "physical harm."
Such claims may be filed only by those who were "present at the site" -- defined as any area where Mr. Feinberg concludes "there was a demonstrable risk of physical harm" -- during the "immediate aftermath" of the attacks. For civilians, the immediate aftermath means within 12 hours of the attacks. But for rescue workers, that period is extended to 96 hours.
However, Mr. Feinberg defines physical harm to mean an injury that was "treated by a medical professional within 24 hours" and "either required hospitalization as an in-patient for at least 24 hours or caused, either temporarily or permanently, partial or total physical disability, incapacity or disfigurement."
Mr. Spitzer, the New York Attorney General, argues that this definition would bar claims by those who continued to work despite severe pain, by those who deferred medical treatment for more than 24 hours so that they could reunite with their families, and by those who were treated, without documentation, at the emergency triage centers that sprang up the day of the attacks.
Families seeking to file a claim have two options under the rules. They can submit documentation supporting their claim, await a decision, and then seek a hearing to argue for a higher figure. Or they can seek a hearing first, make their arguments, and then await a decision, which would be final.
Moreover, anyone eligible to file a claim can immediately apply for emergency awards of $50,000 for death or $25,000 for serious injury.
The rules permit a single claim per victim, but Mr. Feinberg declined to determine who should file that claim, deferring instead to state probate and inheritance laws. Thus, he did not specifically invite claims filed by same-sex partners, fiances or fiancees, and others lacking a clear, documented relationship to the victims, although he did not rule out such claims.

HEADLINE: Argentina Unraveling 

 BODY:
With severe economic troubles, weak leadership and a restive population, Argentina has been courting trouble for months. It arrived with the collapse of the elected government and a second day of deadly rioting yesterday in the streets of Buenos Aires and other cities. Whether Argentina comes out of this crisis as a stable democracy will depend on the restraint of its army, the patience of its people and steady leadership by the successor to President Fernando de la Rua, who resigned yesterday. 
 The sight of a democratically selected Latin American leader, however unpopular, departing so hastily from office is troubling for a country still trying to build democratic institutions and practices. Instability and dashed hopes have haunted Argentina since military rule ended in 1983. Raul Alfonsin, who oversaw the transition, did not finish his presidential term, resigning in 1989 during another economic crisis. His successor, Carlos Saul Menem, steadied the economy for a time but never addressed the country's fundamental problems. 
 Mr. de la Rua was an ineffectual leader. Given Argentina's chronic instability, however, the country might have been better served if the Peronist opposition had entertained his offer yesterday to create a national unity government to confront the economic crisis. Domingo Cavallo, the powerful economy minister, who was responsible for imposing a punishing austerity program and a currency board that maintained an artificial one-to-one rate of exchange between the peso and the American dollar, resigned late Wednesday. The Peronists, who control Congress, could have helped to construct a new bipartisan consensus on how to proceed. 
Instead they chose to take advantage of the crisis, forcing Mr. de la Rua to resign. In the absence of a sitting vice president, Ramon Puerta, the Peronist leader in the Senate, will become president. It is not yet clear whether he intends to complete the last two years of Mr. de la Rua's term or call for an earlier vote. He should schedule elections as soon as possible.
Argentina is beset by a 20 percent unemployment rate, growing poverty and a bankrupt financial system. The Argentine economic miracle of the 1990's was a mirage created by foreign creditors enamored of the country's monetary policy. The currency board allowed foreigners to invest without having to fear devaluation or inflation. 
This allowed Argentina to go on a $130 billion borrowing binge without addressing longstanding shortcomings, especially the corruption of its public finances and the nation's uncompetitiveness as an exporter. Predictably, the time has now come when Argentina can no longer make its debt payments, and foreign investors have lost confidence in the country. The usual stern prescriptions from the International Monetary Fund for greater austerity to weather the storm only made matters worse. 
Like other nations that have reached this crisis point, Argentina will most likely have to devalue its currency and pass through even rougher economic times before it can begin a recovery. It is a painful process, and one that can be managed only if political stability is restored and maintained, and if the army stays out of politics.

HEADLINE: Police and Firefighters Win Court Victory in Seeking Raises 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES 

 BODY:
The State Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the city's police and firefighter unions may ask a state panel to help resolve contract disputes. Union leaders had long sought that change in the hope that they would win significant raises that would make their pay comparable to that in suburban departments.
 The Giuliani administration, arguing that its labor costs would skyrocket and bankrupt the city government, had challenged a state law giving the unions that right. The state's highest court unanimously turned back that challenge yesterday. 
 The law, passed in 1998, allows unions representing police officers and firefighters -- like the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the Uniformed Firefighters Association -- to appeal to the state's Public Employee Relations Board to step in on stalled negotiations. It effectively takes arbitration of contract disputes out of the hands of the city's Office of Collective Bargaining.
While that office tries to resolve disputes by comparing police and fire contracts to those of other city unions, the state's Public Employees Relations Board uses the contracts of police and fire unions in neighboring communities as a standard. Police officers in some counties near New York City are paid as much as 35 percent more than those in the city.
The court ruling could also have a significant effect on negotiations with other city unions.
Because it allows the city's fire unions to appeal to the state board, a spokesman for the firefighters union said, many firefighters might re-examine a contract tentatively agreed to this summer that is awaiting a formal ratification vote.
Furthermore, the police contract often sets the upper standard against which other city union contracts are measured. Any substantial increase granted by the state board would be likely to lead other unions to seek comparable raises. While a 1 percent raise for police officers would cost the city about $15 million a year, city officials have estimated that a 1 percent raise for all city unions would cost $100 million.
Since the city faces budget problems as a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, it was unclear how much latitude the state panel might have in granting a raise to officers, who have been working without a contract since July. Since the the attacks, the police union has argued that its members' heroics should be rewarded with sharply higher pay.
"Before Sept. 11 or after Sept. 11, it didn't make sense for New York City police officers to be paid substantially less than their counterparts," said Robert Linn, the union's chief negotiator. "What Sept. 11 did was show that New York City has a real need to have and retain highly trained police officers."
The union, which represents about 26,000 of the department's rank-and-file officers, has long argued for a "market adjustment" raise to bring city officer's salaries closer to suburban pay. In the early stages of negotiations, the union requested a 39 percent increase over two years, which it has lowered to 23 percent. The city has offered a raise of 10 percent over two years. 
Mr. Linn said he hoped the court's decision would lead to a timely resolution of the negotiations. "Having an external board that looks at police salaries all over the state really gives an opportunity for a full and fair hearing, and I don't think that was possible before," he said.
The court's ruling alters more than three decades of city contract negotiations with its Fire and Police Departments. Under the 1967 Taylor Law, police officers, firefighters and other essential government employees are prohibited from striking. In return, they can seek binding arbitration from the state board, or from local labor boards created by municipalities, including the Office of Collective Bargaining.
In 1996, after heavy lobbying by the police union, the State Legislature overrode a veto by Gov. George E. Pataki to pass a law giving the state board jurisdiction over city contract disputes. After a judge struck that law down because it focused solely on New York City, the Legislature passed a new version, extending the state board's jurisdiction to contract disputes between all local governments and their unions.
In a statement, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani continued to defend the Taylor Law and expressed concern that the ruling might further dampen the city's budget outlook. "The law that created the Office of Collective Bargaining was written by, with and for all of the unions in the city," he said. "It is a law that has worked well for both sides for more than 30 years. The court did not agree."
The mayor also said the city's offer to the police union was fair. "We hope that the arbitrators will recognize the generous nature of the offer and appreciate the fiscal constraints now facing the city in light of the events of Sept. 11th,' he said.
In its court challenges, the city argued that extending the labor board's jurisdiction was a violation of home rule, the city's right to govern itself. But in upholding lower court decisions yesterday, the Court of Appeals ruled that because the 1998 law was a "special law" that serves a substantial state concern, the state panel has jurisdiction.
"We conclude that under the present statutory scheme, once a police or fire union pursues impasse resolution assistance" from the board and the board "declares an impasse, it has jurisdiction over scope of bargaining issues" with the city, the court wrote.
Labor experts said the ruling could significantly alter the landscape for contract negotiations in the city.
"It's a breakthrough for the union," said Eli B. Silverman, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who has studied labor relations in the department. "You've got to keep in mind that since '93, '94, they feel they've been unrewarded. You can get all the pats on the back you want, but you've got to pay the mortgage."
He added, "Inherently, they felt it was unfair, because if you believe the mayor's own claims that the police were the main propellant that has driven crime down, why not reward them more?" 
Some, however, said it was premature to assume that the state board would do just that.
Daniel G. Collins, a professor at New York University who serves on the Board of Collective Bargaining, cautioned against any higher hopes for the new police pact because of the decision yesterday. He said he did not believe there would be any difference in rulings between the city and the state boards. 
Mr. Linn, the police union negotiator, acknowledged that the state board might also consider the city's current economic woes, especially a projected $1 billion budget deficit. "The city's current budget does not make hard choices easier," he said.

DOLLAR THRIFTY TO CUTSALARIES OF 40 TOP EXECUTIVES

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group plans to reduce salaries for executives and suspend 401(k) contributions and pay raises in 2002 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks reduced demand for rental cars. 
Wages for the top 40 executives at Dollar Thrifty, the owner of Dollar Rent a Car Systems and Thrifty Inc., will be pared as much as 22 percent, a spokeswoman said. Dollar Thrifty said in October that it would eliminate 1,200 jobs and reduce its rental-car fleet about 20 percent. Dollar Thrifty, based in Tulsa, Okla., had an 83 percent decline in third-quarter profit, and said the attacks deepened a slide in travel and rental-car demand caused by the recession.

Red Sox Accept Bid From Group Headed by Marlins' Owner

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
A group led by John Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins, won the Boston Red Sox yesterday in a unanimous vote of the team's majority owner and limited partners.
 The vote came during a meeting of the limited partners at Fenway Park that lasted longer than a doubleheader. When the nine-hour session ended, John Harrington, the Red Sox' chief executive, said he was confident the Henry group would continue the "tradition of fielding a competitive team and contributing to the community" established under the Yawkey family's ownership, which began in 1933. 
 The Henry group bid $660 million for the team, Fenway and 80 percent of the New England Sports Network. No baseball team and its assets have sold for even half that amount. 
Justin Morreale, the lawyer who handled the sale for the Red Sox ownership, said the winning bid also assumed debt that took the value of the sale to approximately $700 million.
Others apparently submitted higher bids, but Morreale said no bid was higher "that was not subject to very significant contingencies that ranged from impractical to one which violated Major League Baseball rules."
The winning group includes The New York Times Company, which owns The Times and The Boston Globe.
Russell T. Lewis, president and chief executive of The New York Times Company, said in a statement: "We are extraordinarily pleased with the outcome. John Henry and all the other members of our group care deeply about the Red Sox and Boston and will proudly continue the stewardship of the Yawkeys."
One of the losing bidders was Charles Dolan of Cablevision, who has made unsuccessful efforts to buy the Yankees, the Mets and the Jets. There had been speculation that the other owners would not approve Dolan because his brother, Larry, owns the Cleveland Indians.
Perhaps with that concern in mind, Charles Dolan flew to Milwaukee on Wednesday to meet with Commissioner Bud Selig, a person familiar with the meeting said. Selig, the person said, told Dolan he saw no reason that Major League Baseball would not approve him.
But the Henry group had been considered the leading contender for the Red Sox because of its baseball connections. It is expected to have no trouble gaining the three-fourths approval it needs from owners of the other teams.
Harrington, the Red Sox chief executive, said the goal was to have the new owners in place by the start of next season.
Henry has owned the Marlins for three years. The winning bid group also includes Tom Werner, who was once the managing partner of the San Diego Padres; George Mitchell, the former United States senator from Maine, who was a member of the commissioner's blue ribbon panel on the game's economics; and Larry Lucchino, who has had vast experience as president of the Baltimore Orioles and the Padres and has recently worked closely with Selig on economic matters. Lucchino is expected to become president of the Red Sox.
The groups bidding for the team were initially supposed to be buying only the 53 percent owned by the Jean R. Yawkey Trust, but the limited partners indicated a willingness to sell once they saw the money that was being offered.
The sale of the Yawkey share was subject to approval of the limited partners. Twelve of the 23 limited partnership shares were needed to accept Harrington's recommendation, but all shares were voted for the Henry group.
Henry, who is expected to be the managing partner of the Red Sox, was part of the bidding group with Selig's permission. 
"The commissioner has a great deal of respect for John as an owner," Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief lawyer, said. "To force him to sell on an off chance that he might get the Red Sox wouldn't be fair."
Werner, who was also close to Selig when he operated the Padres, was initially the lead member of that bidding group, but Henry recently assumed that role. A baseball official said Werner would be active with Henry.
Henry is believed to have a contingency deal to sell the Marlins to Jeffrey Loria, owner of the Montreal Expos, one of the teams believed to be a target for elimination. If baseball is unable to eliminate two teams before next season and Loria buys the Marlins, Selig is expected to appoint someone to operate the Expos.
Subsequent to the submission of bids last Monday, the Henry group, with the Red Sox' permission, joined forces with one led by two Boston entrepreneurs, Joseph O'Donnell and Stephen Karp. But problems over control of the merged group arose, and the two camps did not pursue the Red Sox jointly.

HEADLINE: Cadillac, Too, Shifting Focus To Trucks 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Cadillac has built a pickup truck the Cadillac of pickups, nearly three tons worth, available in sable black, white diamond or silver sand, with the familiar Cadillac coat of arms stretched across its hulking grill.
 By rolling out an 18-foot-long Cadillac Escalade EXT pickup last month, with a sticker price of $50,000, General Motors is acknowledging, to some degree, that the Cadillac sedan's place in popular culture and its long hold on the aspirations of the affluent has been lost. It is also sanctifying America's love affair with trucks. 
 On the basis of present trends, sales of light trucks -- the category including sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups -- will exceed sales of passenger cars this year for the first time. Two decades ago, fewer than one in five vehicles purchased was a truck. Through November, automakers sold 7,963,427 light trucks compared with 7,848,180 passenger cars, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank of Southfield, Mich. 
This bulking up of the American fleet has reversed the gains made in automotive fuel economy since the oil supply crises of the 1970's while reshaping patterns of auto accidents and injuries. And from Detroit's perspective, it has turned the passenger car into an ugly stepchild, with some saying there is little money to be made in cars and few resources to spare for them.
These days, when American cars appear on television or in movies, they are often classics, like the vintage Camaro in last summer's "Charlie's Angels" film or the 1971 Plymouth Barracuda driven by Don Johnson in the recent CBS program "Nash Bridges."
As General Motors is painfully aware, no car seems to have lost so much of its cool as the Cadillac sedan, which once held popular culture in its thrall. Jimmy Durante, Bing Crosby, John Wayne and Roy Rogers drove Cadillacs. For Elvis, buying them seemed something of an addiction. Long ago, the Sedan de Ville and its cousins were supplanted in drivers' psyches by imports. The most popular luxury import brands -- BMW, Lexus, Mercedes -- helped lead the way in developing luxury S.U.V.'s.
After many false starts at reviving Cadillac -- like the ads for the Catera with Cindy Crawford in a short, skintight skirt and knee-high boots -- Cadillac has lately regained a measure of chic by taking the same route.
First, in 1998, came the Escalade, a giant sport utility vehicle that is the forerunner of the new Escalade EXT pickup. An Escalade, for instance, fills much of the TV driveway of Bernie Mac, the comedian with a popular new Fox sitcom; the vehicle figures in songs by artists like Jennifer Lopez, Outkast, Jay-Z and Jermaine Dupri, who included the lyric "gotta have me an Escalade," on one song.
"Cadillac was frozen in time," said Ilsa Schumacher, an anthropologist whose Westport, Conn., consulting firm, Cultural Dynamics, helps G.M. get in touch with cultural trends. "It was in a huge time warp from the 50's. It was like an embryo in a time capsule."
"The S.U.V.," she added, "has been able to cross a lot of boundaries that the sedan has not." 
G.M. hopes that some of Escalade's cachet will extend to the EXT pickup; the company said that Brian Jordan, the Atlanta Braves outfielder, was among the first 160 buyers.
Cadillac is not alone in stretching boundaries. Automakers now talk about a whole new category of S.U.V. progeny that some call the S.U.T., for sport utility truck, and others term the S.U.P., for sport utility pickup. There are middle-brow versions, like the Chevrolet Avalanche, and Grey Poupon ones, like the Lincoln Blackwood. 
With its 345-horsepower engine, leather interior and Bose sound system, the Escalade EXT embodies the crossover quality of these trucks, filling a sort of restoration hardware-meets-big gulp niche. 
Susan Docherty, who manages the Cadillac brand for G.M., described the target customer for luxury pickups as a slightly earthier version of the likely buyer of a luxury S.U.V.
"They both have $2 million homes next door to each other," she said. But the prototype luxury S.U.V. driver is about 50, "has an M.B.A. from Harvard, has the golf club membership. He's the person keeping up with the Joneses."
General Motors sees the luxury pickup driver as roughly five years younger. He "might have inherited his father's construction business," Ms. Docherty said, "and has been in the construction business since he was 18, 19 years old." He may or may not have attended college, and he "is absolutely still connected to his high school friends, whereas the S.U.V. buyer is connected to his college friends."
The company expects that about 80 percent of luxury pickup buyers will be men, compared with 55 percent for luxury sport utilities.
Next month, Cadillac will roll out a reinvented luxury sedan, to be called the CTS, that it has high hopes for. Still, like the rest of the industry, it also plans to keep reinventing the truck. In 2003, Cadillac will introduce a cross between an S.U.V. and a station wagon that is tentatively called the SRX and is considered still something else -- an L.A.V. To the uninitiated, that's a luxury activity vehicle.
"The 90's were about minivans and S.U.V.'s," Ms. Docherty said. "This decade is definitely a truck decade that is about S.U.V.'s and crossovers."
Last year, truck sales pushed the fuel economy of the average new vehicle to the lowest point in two decades, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and environmentalists want an immediate toughening of federal fuel economy standards.
All the major automakers, except Honda, openly oppose that. While they are working on technologies to improve mileage, like hybrid gas and electric engines, they argue that pushing for too much too fast will be costly and slow the development of breakthroughs, like hydrogen-powered fuel cells.
The EXT averages about 13.5 miles per gallon of gas, according to Cadillac.
Auto executives say they make what people want to buy. A recent test drive of the Escalade EXT demonstrated its capacity for head turning, whether in envy or horror. On a highway, a police officer cruised alongside just to take a long, longing look.
Cadillac has sold trucks before. Founded in 1902, it made ambulances and paddy wagons in its early days, emblazoned with the family crest of Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, the Frenchman who founded Detroit. 
The latest Cadillac crest, however, is rendered without six tiny ducks that it included until recently. Though Cadillac now is trusting its image to a pair of off-road vehicles equipped for the discerning sportsman, the ducks seem to have left the roost.

Shares Fall on Lower Forecasts for Telecommunications

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after Juniper Networks Inc. and Jabil Circuit Inc. lowered profit forecasts, tempering optimism for a rebound in demand for telecommunications gear that helped drive the Nasdaq composite index up 35 percent the last three months.
 "Whatever kind of rebound we have will be farther out and not as strong as the majority of people were expecting," said Howard Kornblue, who helps oversee $20 billion at ING Pilgrim Investments in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
 The Nasdaq declined 64.35 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 1,918.54, led by Microsoft and Cisco Systems. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,139.93. 
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 85.31 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,985.18, with financial shares, including J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, declining. It was the first drop in five days for the Dow and S.& P. 500.
Some investors said the Nasdaq's three-month advance has left stocks expensive given the outlook for profit growth. Companies ranging from Ciena to Lucent Technologies have reduced earnings forecasts, and the Nasdaq has slid 5.1 percent in the last two weeks.
Analysts expect companies to report falling earnings this quarter and next, extending the string of declining profits to five quarters. For the year, the Nasdaq has lost 22.3 percent, the S.& P. 500 has fallen 13.7 percent and the Dow has dropped 7.4 percent.
While corporate profits are dropping, evidence is mounting that the economy is not deteriorating further. A government report showed the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in five months and a separate report indicated a slowdown in manufacturing in the Philadelphia region is abating.
Juniper plunged $4.08, or 18 percent, to $18.85. The company, the second-largest maker of gear for Internet traffic, halved its fourth-quarter revenue forecast as sales declined more than expected. The company projected earnings of 5 cents a share on sales of $150 million to $155 million, below its previous estimates of 10 cents a share and $200 million.
Telecommunications companies such as WorldCom Inc. and Qwest Communications International Inc. are spending less on networking gear to save money during the recession.
"The thing that bothered people is they didn't miss by a little bit, they missed by a lot," said Andrew Abrams, who manages $100 million at CWH Associates Inc. "When you are off by that much it says, 'I really don't know what my business is,' and that means a lot of other guys don't know what their business is and that scares people."
Cisco, the largest maker of computer-networking gear, lost $1.06, to $18.29. Foundry Networks Inc., which makes computer-networking switches, dropped 29 cents, to $7.69. 
Jabil Circuit slumped $3.50, to $21.25. The maker of electronic equipment for brand-name companies reduced its 2002 earnings forecast as it reported that its first-quarter profit plunged 82 percent. The company cited declining demand for its manufacturing services as reasons for the shortfall. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Reuters)
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after reports showing a drop in jobless claims and a big improvement in mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity raised hopes the recession-bound economy is laying the groundwork for a rebound next year.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to a price of 99 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.04 percent from 5.05 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 99 11/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.42 percent from 5.45 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A No-Win Outcome 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom asserted that in the end Congress would pass an economic stimulus bill. I was one of the few skeptics. Why was my skepticism vindicated?
 It helps to recall an observation that Gail Sheehy made last year: "The blind drive to win," she wrote, "is a hallmark of the Bush family clan. One thing that G. W.'s childhood friends told me repeatedly was that he has to win, he absolutely has to win and if he thinks he's going to lose, he will change the rules or extend the play. Or if it really is bad he'll take his bat and ball and go home." 
 Now consider this: More than two months ago George W. Bush endorsed a "stimulus" bill so tilted toward corporate interests that even many conservatives were startled. This left only two ways a bill could pass the Senate: Either the Democratic leadership would collapse, or Mr. Bush would accept something that didn't look like a personal win. It didn't, and he wouldn't. 
 The struggle really began less than 48 hours after the terrorist attack, when Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, tried to ram through a sharp cut in the capital gains tax. Even opponents of the capital gains tax generally acknowledge that cutting it does little to stimulate the economy in the short run; furthermore, 80 percent of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers. So Mr. Thomas signaled, literally before the dust had settled, that he was determined to use terrorism as an excuse to pursue a radical right-wing agenda.
 A month later the House narrowly passed a bill that even The Wall Street Journal admitted "mainly padded corporate bottom lines." It was so extreme that when political consultants tried to get reactions from voter focus groups, the voters refused to believe that they were describing the bill accurately. Mr. Bush, according to Ari Fleischer, was "very pleased" with the bill.
 Wednesday Mr. Thomas finally offered what he considered major concessions. "Republicans have given a lot," he declared. And Mr. Bush urged the Senate to pass this new, "bipartisan" bill.
 What, exactly, did Mr. Thomas concede? Here's a comparison that may help you feel his pain.
 The original bill, though sold as a short-run stimulus package, was actually a long-term tax cut in disguise; it would pump less than $100 billion into the economy in its first year, but would cost about $250 billion over the next five years. By contrast, the new bill -- well, actually the numbers for the new bill are just about identical. 
 The original bill consisted almost entirely of tax cuts -- 95 percent of the total cost -- with virtually nothing for the unemployed. The new bill offers slightly more to the unemployed, enough to reduce the share of tax cuts in the bill's total cost to a measly 92 percent. 
 In the original bill 69 percent of those tax cuts were for corporations; in the new bill this is reduced to a mere 63 percent.
 In its most controversial provision, the original bill retroactively eliminated the alternative minimum tax on corporations, refunding $24 billion in past corporate taxes. The new bill doesn't entirely eliminate the alternative minimum tax -- but it still offers corporations about $16 billion in refunds, spread out over time instead of all at once.
 To console himself for all these compromises, Mr. Thomas added a new individual tax break, useful only to very affluent families. 
 Strangely, these awesome sacrifices didn't impress the Democratic leadership. And so we have no stimulus bill.
 The question the American people ought to ask is why the Bush administration, given the deadlock in Congress, didn't push for a minimalist package -- rebate checks for those who didn't get them last summer, plus extended unemployment benefits, and a temporary investment tax credit. This would have disappointed Democrats who also wanted medical coverage for the unemployed, but it would surely have passed, and it would have been better than no deal at all.
 But such a package would not have lived up to the hopes of administration strategists, who thought they could use Sept. 11 to advance their long-run domestic agenda. It therefore would not have counted as a personal win for Mr. Bush. And so he took his bat and ball and went home.

HEADLINE: Both Parties Deflect Blame For Stalemate On Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Acknowledging the risks of their failure to settle on a recession-fighting package, leaders of the two parties in Congress said today that they would take up the issue again next month when they return from their holiday recess.
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, said he would like President Bush to call Congress back into session on Jan. 2, three weeks earlier than scheduled, to deal with the economic recovery plan. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader, said he, too, was willing to get right back to work on the issue. 
 "Our hope is that it can be revived early next year," Mr. Daschle said. 
But there was no indication that the two sides were any closer to a deal. After the House passed a revised version of a Republican stimulus plan in the pre-dawn hours on a largely party line 224-to-193 vote, Republicans tried unsuccessfully to bring the bill up as part of a last-minute flurry of legislating in the Senate this afternoon, officially burying it for the year.
The collapse of the effort to reach a compromise reduced the chances that Congress and the administration could inject $75 billion to $100 billion of tax cuts and new spending into the economy next year, as most economic forecasters had assumed they would. But continued paralysis would also leave that $100 billion in the government's coffers for other purposes when tax revenues are drying up and analysts are predicting a return to budget deficits.
Intent on deflecting blame for the deadlock, Democrats and Republicans exchanged another round of accusations about which side was responsible for the inability of Congress to address the needs of laid-off workers and give the economy a lift.
Administration officials and Republicans in the House and Senate stuck to their line that the problem was intransigence on the part of the Democratic majority in the Senate, particularly Mr. Daschle.
"There's a line in a country western song that says you've got to know when to hold them and when to fold them," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. "It is time for Tom Daschle to fold them. We are talking about people who cannot wait until the end of January to get the help that they are looking for."
Democrats said that for all the talk from Republicans about helping the unemployed, the main thrust of the House Republican bill was to cut taxes for businesses and for middle- and upper-income people.
Democrats said the Republican plan was too expensive, bloated by special interest provisions, unfair to laid-off workers and likely to be ineffectual in pulling the economy out of the first recession in a decade.
"We've looked at the compromise one last time and have concluded that it's wrong on all counts," Mr. Daschle said.
Democrats said that they would like to move quickly next month on one element of the stimulus package, extending the current 26-week limit on unemployment benefits by 13 weeks. Hinting without subtlety at his party's political strategy, Mr. Daschle said, "We extended those benefits three times during the last Bush recession, in the early 1990's, and I think it's important for us to extend them this time."
But it was not clear that Republicans would be willing to separate an extension of unemployment benefits from their tax-cutting proposals, a step that might give them less negotiating leverage.
In abandoning negotiation for confrontation this week, the two parties were in effect treating their differences as the kickoff to the 2002 mid-term Congressional elections. 
With new budget projections next month likely to show the government running deficits for the next few years, Democrats are hoping to deny Republicans a chance to enact another round of tax cuts. Determined to keep domestic spending in check to help pay for the war on terrorism and modernizing the military, Republicans do not want the recession to become an excuse for the Democrats to create entitlements like a right to health insurance subsidies for the unemployed.
"They believe there has to be a tax cut for the common cold," Mr. Daschle said. "Our view is that tax cuts have merit and ought to be examined, but there's a lot more to economic and fiscal policy than tax cuts, and that we have to take into account the budget and other needs."
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said his party had made many concessions to the Democrats in trying to negotiate a bill, including more money for unemployment benefits and health insurance subsidies. But Mr. Nickles said there continued to be fundamental differences in approach.
"We're not just interested in just paying more people not to work," he said. "We want to create jobs and put people back to work."

HEADLINE: Thwarted Hopes in Congress 

 BODY:
In a disappointing conclusion to its 2001 session, Congress has adjourned in a blaze of partisan recrimination over the failure to pass a measure to stimulate the economy. Though President Bush and Republican leaders made some last-minute concessions on the bill, their final offer was too costly, too unlikely to help the economy and too unfairly weighted toward corporations and rich taxpayers to be acceptable. On a separate issue, Congress passed a spending bill to provide significant help for Lower Manhattan. But in a last-minute setback that was discouraging, a bipartisan agreement to provide tax incentives to help rebuild the area was blocked by two Republican senators. 
 In the closing hours of work yesterday, Mr. Bush accused the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, of blocking the stimulus bill by using a parliamentary rule that required 60 votes for passage. But it was Mr. Bush who failed to reach across the aisle and negotiate a bill that could be acceptable to more than three conservative Democratic senators. Genuine bipartisanship means working with the Democratic leadership and caucus as a whole, not trying to lure a few members with individual deals. 
 Mr. Daschle went far to try to make a deal with the White House. He even signaled a willingness to consider additional cuts in corporation taxes and income taxes for the wealthy, in return for Republican concessions on the structure of health benefits for unemployed workers. He was rebuffed. Mr. Bush and the Republicans insisted on enacting an ideologically driven measure on health benefits geared to individual tax credits rather than subsidies to health insurance programs. The Democrats were right to reject that approach, which would put older and less healthy people at risk.
The failure to pass a $100 billion stimulus bill is not likely to have much impact on the $10 trillion economy. But it was disheartening to see Congress leave town without extending unemployment and health benefits for those thrown out of work in the recession. 
Before adjourning, Congress approved an emergency spending measure that brought aid to New York to a total of $11.1 billion this year, only a little more than half the $20 billion that Mr. Bush promised after Sept. 11. The same bill also increased the amount that the administration had initially sought for so-called homeland defense, including the effort to combat bioterrorism. There is every reason to hope that Congress will add spending in these two vital areas next year. 
There was a breakthrough yesterday on one important measure for New York, providing tax relief for victims of the World Trade Center attacks. A welcome concession by Representative Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, extended the tax relief to lower-income victims, not just those with higher incomes as originally called for in his bill. The victims' measure passed in the closing hours of the session.
Unfortunately, a separate bill pushed by Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York to provide $5 billion in tax benefits for Lower Manhattan businesses was derailed in the Senate. The two senators who blocked it, Phil Gramm of Texas and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, objected to learning about its provisions at the last minute. In coming weeks the measure should be revised so that it helps large as well as small businesses. Mr. Gramm and Mr. Nickles should understand that it is consistent with their philosophy and help move the bill quickly to passage.

Argentine Financial Crisis Leads to Resignations
President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina resigned, a casualty of a deepening four-year-old recession that has brought the country to the brink of financial collapse and a social explosion rooted in unemployment and desperation.
 Demonstrations and looting also prompted the resignation of the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, above. The coffers are empty and the country is on the verge of a halt of payments on its $132 billion debt and a devaluation that could bankrupt much of the private sector. Page A1. 

Bill to Protect Insurers Dropped
Congress abandoned efforts to protect insurers from losses from future terrorist attacks when the Senate failed to bring a measure to the floor at the end of the session. B1.

Lobbying Hinders Tracking of Drugs
Public health and law enforcement officials have long argued that drug-tracking programs can save lives by identifying doctors who overprescribe narcotics as well as patients who forge prescriptions or con unsuspecting doctors. But just 15 states have such programs because of decades of lobbying. A1.

Juniper Lowers Profit Forecast
Juniper Networks, the second-biggest maker of networking equipment that directs Internet traffic, cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast in half and lowered its sales estimate as customers like WorldCom and Qwest pared spending. Juniper shares fell $4.05, to $18.85. The stock, which more than doubled last year, has dropped 85 percent this year. C10.

Juniper led the market lower. The Nasdaq declined 64.35 points, or 3.2 percent, to 1,918.54. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,139.93. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 85.31 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,985.18. C10.

Stimulus Plan Seen as Less Vital
Nine months after the beginning of the recession, the failure of Congress and the White House to agree on a stimulus package no longer has economists so worried that the economy will stumble without the extra boost. C2.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SUBSIDIES; 
Insurers Fail To Gain Help In Terror Costs

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Congress abandoned efforts today to protect the insurance industry from losses in any future terrorist attacks when the Senate failed to bring a measure to the floor in the final hours of the session.
 Bush administration officials, industry executives and analysts predicted that the refusal by Congress to act would prompt insurers and business lenders to increase their rates sharply as terrorism coverage was reduced or eliminated. Over time, they argue, economic harm would result. 
 "This won't cause bank runs or panics in the street, but it will cause something much more insidious, an added cost and slowing down of the economy at the worst possible time," said Under Secretary of the Treasury Peter R. Fisher, a former senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who has overseen crises including the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. 
Insurers, administration officials say, will not extend adequate coverage to building owners, developers, manufacturers and energy companies, among others. They add that lenders will be reluctant to provide financing for new and existing projects, or will do so only at substantially higher rates.
While the insurers hope that Congress will act next year, the prospects for this remain highly uncertain. A consensus emerged in the weeks after the September attacks that the insurance industry needed assistance, having lost $50 billion from the attacks. But the measure stalled over a number of matters including regional politics, financing methods and proposed changes in the nation's tort-law system. 
Legislators from the Northeast and big cities elsewhere, areas considered the most vulnerable to terrorism, generally supported aid for the insurers more strongly than those from other areas. House Republicans wanted big government payouts in future attacks to be repaid by either the industry or policyholders instead of by taxpayers.
At White House urging, the Republicans tried to limit lawsuits over damage from terrorist attacks, but the Democrats refused to go along with this.
American military advances in the war in Afghanistan and the absence of new, widespread terrorism also made the legislation appear less urgent.
And while his top aides worked on the legislation, President Bush did virtually nothing to push for it in Congress.
The legislation that died today would have done nothing to compensate insurers for their losses from Sept. 11. Those losses, while steep, still left the industry in a relatively healthy condition. 
Three weeks ago, the House, voting largely along party lines, adopted a measure to provide as much as $100 billion in government loans to the insurance industry to cover losses from future large-scale terrorist attacks. The money was to be repaid by insurers, policyholders and, if the administration wanted, taxpayers.
But comparable measures repeatedly stalled in the Senate. Late attempts by Democrats to revive the legislation were blocked this afternoon by an objection from Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.
A growing number of state insurance regulators have said in recent days that if Congress did not adopt a financial assistance package by the end of the year, they would permit property and casualty insurers to exclude coverage for terrorist attacks. But the Consumer Federation of America has asked the state regulators to continue requiring insurers to provide this coverage. 
Mr. Fisher, the Treasury Department official, said that as terrorism coverage declines, people ranging from real estate developers to utility plant owners will begin to see their lenders charging more because their property, which serves as collateral for loans, will face greater risks. He also said the costs of insurance coverage would continue to rise, even as coverage shrank.
"Exclusions will be out there, and price shocks are going to happen," he said. "I've talked to people who have already seen a threefold increase in their premiums without the exclusions. They anticipate they will now see this in their costs of borrowing."
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, agreed and said that the failure of Congress to adopt legislation "will hurt the financial markets, particularly since bonds and bond covenants require adequate insurance, and it is not going to be there."
"The problems that will occur are going to be insidious," he said, adding that "they will be real and they will be deep."
Reinsurance companies -- which enable primary insurers to spread their risks by taking out their own insurance policies -- have warned that they no longer intend to offer coverage for losses from future terrorist attacks. About 70 percent of the contracts for property and casualty coverage expire at the end of this month.
With the bulk of commercial insurance policies expiring then, negotiations for coverage have been going on for several weeks. Not knowing whether Congress would provide help, most insurers have agreed to provide a wide range of coverage for everything but losses from terrorism.
Steve Wechsler, chief executive of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, said that his 200 members would see the effects as their policies come up for renewal next year. "Congress will increasingly be hearing from people with problems as the new year begins," he said.
The matter is most pressing in about a dozen major cities, like New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles, that are considered prime terrorist targets. In these cities, the demand for terrorism coverage is greatest and insurers are refusing to provide it.
In much of the country, including small towns and rural areas, some insurers have agreed to sell terrorism coverage. But many business owners seem to feel little need to buy it. 
The insurers maintain that since they have no way to calculate how often or how forcefully terrorists may strike, they have no way to calculate how much to charge. 
"What we have here is an emergency in slow motion," said Steve Bartlett, the president of the Financial Services Roundtable, a group of the 100 largest banks, insurance companies, investment banks and brokerage firms in the country. "The economy won't fall off a cliff in January. But what we will see is a slow, extraordinarily powerful avalanche."
Mr. Bartlett, saying that the lack of terrorism coverage would be felt outside the big cities as well, cited the case of a trucking company owner in North Carolina, who had been turned down for a loan to buy more trucks because he could not obtain this coverage.
"He has a profitable company and an existing relationship with a lender," Mr. Bartlett said. "But he couldn't get a loan because some terrorist might decide he was a target."

Argentine President Quits As Deadly Violence Rises
President Fernando de la Rua resigned halfway through a four-year term amid violent protests and looting brought about by his government's failure to reverse a deepening economic crisis. At least 21 people have been killed in protests. A1

Analysts, investors and executives across Latin America said that for now, the turmoil seemed largely limited to Argentina. They said the crisis had been building for so long that businesses were prepared. A6

Bush administration officials said they were unlikely to support any new aid until Argentina adopted an economic course that had a chance of lifting the country out of recession. A6

Hamas Rebuffs Arafat's Plea
Dr. Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, a top political leader of Hamas, said the group would continue sending suicidal attackers against Israel, ignoring Yasir Arafat's appeal to end such attacks. For a second day, Palestinian Authority forces trying to arrest Dr. Rantisi clashed with his supporters. A3

At a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo, foreign ministers lashed out at Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel for his bombardment of Palestinians and offered support for Mr. Arafat's effort to quell violence on the Palestinian side. The nations pledged to cut all ties to Israel and Mr. Sharon, but there are few ties left to cut. A5

HEADLINE: Our Friends the Terrorists 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Just to puncture our hypocrisy for a moment: We've been battling terrorism by bolstering backers of terrorism in Pakistan.
 Pakistan, our new ally in the war on terrorism, has a long history of supporting indiscriminate attacks in India and especially the disputed territory of Kashmir. The latest, headline-grabbing attack was the assault on the Parliament building in New Delhi that now threatens war between two nuclear powers, but many thousands of civilians have been killed over the years by Pakistani-financed terrorist organizations. 
 All in all, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, or I.S.I., is responsible for many more killings than Osama bin Laden. 
But however hypocritical it may be to bolster one government that harbors terrorists while overthrowing another, there is no good alternative. The Bush administration is exactly right to be simultaneously supporting Gen. Pervez Musharraf and twisting his arm to fight terrorism, for he may be Pakistan's last hope to rescue his country.
Pakistan today is not only a catastrophe for Pakistanis but a threat to the entire region. Its economy is quasi-feudal, some 55 percent of adults are illiterate and more than 10 percent of children die by the age of 5. Pakistan now has more drug addicts than college graduates.
In the last 20 years public schooling has been partly replaced by madrasas that preach extremism, the pursuit of nuclear weapons has isolated the government, and foolish policies have crippled the economy. The I.S.I.'s installation of the Taliban in Afghanistan has backfired, and now there is a risk of the "Talibanization" of Pakistan, as religious extremists return from their "crusades" in Afghanistan and Pashtuns perhaps revive their quest for an independent Pashtunistan.
In Pakistan earlier this month, I flinched whenever I read the newspapers. Guerrillas in Kashmir were "freedom-fighters" if they lived, "martyrs" if they died. And on The Nation's editorial page appeared this rant: "The Christian world has not accepted us Muslims as human beings even. These nations are determined to exterminate the Muslims." 
General Musharraf is in charge of this morass, and -- under strong pressure from President Bush, and less visible nudging from China -- he has acted decisively to pull his country toward reality. He ousted the head of the I.S.I., permitted the entry of U.S. troops to oust the Taliban, and sent troops for the first time into tribal areas to capture Taliban escapees. He has moved to sideline the religious fanatics, close the extremist madrasas and deport foreign religious students. Next he must clamp down on the Kashmiri fighters.
Over the last two years General Musharraf has shown himself capable of brutally tough decisions, and there is some reason to think that he can regain control of the I.S.I. (which may have run the latest Indian attack as a rogue operation), cut off state support for Kashmiri terrorists, nurture a growing market economy -- and prepare for democratic elections. The religious parties get less than 5 percent of the vote in Pakistan, and so democracy can delegitimize extremism as well.
When I first traveled around Pakistan as a student backpacker two decades ago, I sneaked into closed tribal areas and visited a village that was a center for heroin and gun-running. One gunsmith tried to sell me a pen that could not only write but also shoot a .22 bullet out the end. Not even a Palm Pilot can do that, and it was only $7! This incredibly nifty gadget enthralled me as a symbol of Pakistani ingenuity -- and it's also apt because Pakistan has squandered its considerable potential and excelled far more at things destructive than constructive.
Now Pakistan is at a moment of maximum danger, threatened by the instability caused by returning Taliban fighters on the west and by the risk of war with India on the east. Similarly, it was at a time when India was near economic collapse, in the summer of 1991, that New Delhi moved decisively toward a path of economic reform -- and toward more sensible domestic and international policies across the board.
Pakistan, after so many wrong turns in its history, has tentatively taken a right one in the last few months. Now it must build on that by clamping down on its own terrorists. And, whatever the stench of blood in Islamabad, we Americans must hold our noses and do all we can to help General Musharraf hold his course.

HEADLINE: A Private Fortune to Further a Public Agenda 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
He will be sworn in by the departing mayor on New Year's Eve in Times Square. That is free. The next day, Michael R. Bloomberg will foot the bill for the inaugural reception, a modest affair of wine and cheese at the renovated Tweed Courthouse in Lower Manhattan.
 The festivities will be just the latest example of the mayor-elect's beneficence toward municipal government. Since he was elected two months ago, Mr. Bloomberg has been willing to draw on his personal fortune to help him begin to build the broad base of support he will need in the face of a looming economic crisis, much as he did to get himself elected. 
 Last week, he held a cocktail reception for incoming City Council members in his Upper East Side town house, complete with fine wines and a humble speech, and held a sit-down dinner for borough presidents. A few weeks ago, he took an official trip to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, taking along newly elected officials on his private plane, and paying for their stay at one of the most expensive hotels in the commonwealth. His private plane also ushered elected officials and others to Israel to meet with government officials. 
Not since the early 1970's, when New York State was governed by Nelson A. Rockefeller, has there been an elected official in the state who has been able to tap into his own wealth in ways that benefit his political and policy agendas. 
Mr. Bloomberg, who spent $69 million on his mayoral campaign, bristles at suggestions that he spend portions of his own fortune to shore up the Parks Department or plug the city's enormous budget gap. But he has, as mayor-elect, been able to draw on that fortune to build good will among elected officials with whom he has had little or no contact in his life as a private businessman. His aides suggest that dinners with everyone from rank-and-file workers to foreign dignitaries will be the norm in his administration. 
The unusual juxtaposition of Mr. Bloomberg's wealth and public service has forced the city to examine ethical areas that have not been explored since Mr. Rockefeller was supplementing the salaries of his subordinates, political experts said. That practice came under fierce scrutiny by the Senate when Gerald R. Ford chose him as vice president. The Conflicts of Interest Board has privately been considering new recommendations, which are likely to be issued sometime over the next few weeks, said people with knowledge of the discussions. By law, the board cannot reveal what it is reviewing until it publicly releases an opinion.
"The notion that you can't have people you work with over for dinner seems odd," said Wayne Hawley, a lawyer with the board. "Though possibly at some extreme it would raise the sorts of issues that expensive gifts would. These things are, perhaps unavoidably, pretty fact-specific."
People close to Mr. Bloomberg say that they expect his personal style, which relies heavily on relationship-building and personal salesmanship, to extend into his mayoralty, during which he will continue to entertain public officials much the way he used to play host to socialites and television personalities. Much of the wining and dining, however, will probably take place at Gracie Mansion, which he plans to use as a clubhouse rather than as his home.
"It is more and more likely that his social life will be entertaining City Council members and the borough president and the district attorney and corporate C.E.O.'s who we are trying to woo and legislators from Buffalo," one aide said. "His social life will be aggressively business. Not unlike Rockefeller, where you use your wealth to benefit the agenda of the city."
And like Mr. Rockefeller, who also had a private plane which in fact he used to usher officials to Israel, Mr. Bloomberg may find the approach has its merits. "On one level, his wealth is a measure of his past leadership," said Bill de Blasio, an incoming council member from Brooklyn who served in the Dinkins administration and managed Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign last year. He was one of the guests who enjoyed tartar rolls, wine and museum-quality art at Mr. Bloomberg's Upper East Side home. 
"But he has to be careful about being sensitive about it," Mr. de Blasio added. "It was a smart move to invite us over, because there is a lot of mystique surrounding him, and for most of us, they don't have a lot of experience with people on his economic level."
Joel Rivera, an incoming council member from the Bronx who benefited from a free plane ride and a room at the Ritz-Carlton in Puerto Rico, said he found that the time spent with Mr. Bloomberg in the air was very useful because they were able to talk about higher education. And the gesture made an impression. "We've all been waiting for quite some time for a hand to be extended," he said. "I think there will now be two sides to City Hall."
Mr. Bloomberg seems to be somewhat aware that he must avoid creating uncomfortable class gaps or seeming impervious to the city's troubled times. He has taken pains to say that his inauguration will be low-key. One of the few foods served will be peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. He even decided against live music, and except for the last-minute addition of a stereo in the corner, the event may be soundless save the voices of revelers. 
But like Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bloomberg brings more than a large bank account as one of the city's wealthiest residents. Wealth and social power inevitably lead to business and social connections that can be useful, particularly when the city needs to press the private sector to help with its recovery. 
"Rockefeller had the trappings to make him useful," said Ronald Maiorana, who was the governor's press secretary his entire term. "He had his own helicopter to go back and forth to New York and Albany. It was a matter of convenience, and he was being magnanimous and generous when the elected official would ask for a ride."
Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said that Mr. Rockefeller's prior relationships, which were like the ones Mr. Bloomberg has had with business leaders, medical experts and philanthropists, served the state well. "He came with all sorts of social relationships already formed," Mr. Carroll said. "Mike Bloomberg is also plugged in. He can talk to bankers, appoint business people who will help and things like that."
But he and others added that money alone was not the lure, a view echoed by others who knew Mr. Rockefeller. "His was an incredible personality," Mr. Maiorana said. "People were drawn to that as much as his wealth. You hear the term that someone really loves people. In his case it was not a cliche; it was a fact."
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg constantly say that he is also a man who likes to negotiate hard deals and troubles over bread and wine, and that people will be charmed by this as well. 
But no matter what the city's fiscal shape, no matter that he will hold the most modest inauguration in decades, Mr. Bloomberg will remain a very wealthy man, and the city will probably continue to see him through the prism of his planes, homes and the accouterments of a life well led. Former Mayor Edward I Koch said, "I think he is going to keep drinking expensive wines."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 21 about wealthy politicians who have used their fortunes to advance a public agenda misstated the period in which Ronald Maiorana worked as press secretary to one such figure, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. It was 1970 to 1973, not the governor's entire term.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: IN BEIJING; 
Pakistan's Leader Reassures China of Their Special Bond

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan received an unusually lavish welcome here on Thursday, as the two countries sought to reaffirm their longstanding friendship amid the shifting Asian alliances brought about by the United States-led war on terrorism in Afghanistan.
 "The cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy is its close association and relationship with China," General Musharraf told China's president, Jiang Zemin, after arriving at the Great Hall of the People in an immense motorcade. 
 Mr. Jiang called Pakistan an "old friend," adding, "I trust that your visit will serve to vigorously advance our comprehensive partnership or collaboration." 
The five-day state visit was one of a series of events to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. In that time, China has become an important source of both economic aid and military technology for Pakistan. China's support of Pakistan in part has been as a counterweight against India, which fought a war against China in 1962.
But the friendship between Pakistan and China has recently been shaken a bit by the introduction of a third party -- the United States -- which has adopted Pakistan as its closest ally in the region in its war against Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers and Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorism network.
While China has generally supported the American war effort, the new cooperation between a nation it views as its primary global competitor, the United States, and its old friend, Pakistan, was bound to raise concerns.
In general, China wants to make sure that it remains the power to be reckoned with in the region. Beijing has nurtured economic and security relations with the new Central Asian states that ring its western frontier, and it does not want to see an American military buildup there.
A second Chinese concern is maintaining stability in South Asia, especially avoiding a war between Pakistan and India over Kashmir, which abuts China. Chinese officials have stressed the importance of reaching a diplomatic solution.
"Pakistan's political stability is not only in the interests of the Pakistani people, it also concerns regional peace and stability," Mr. Jiang told the Pakistani leader, according to China's Xinhua News Agency. 
General Musharraf reassured his hosts that an old friendship would be given priority. 
"China has been our trusted friend and our relationship has remained time-tested, and we are very positive that in the future also this relationship, this strategic association and relationship, will continue," he said.

HEADLINE: Budget Battle Ends in Congress Without the Usual Brouhaha 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The often contentious process of deciding how much to spend on activities of the federal government came to a close today on Capitol Hill, with few of the fireworks and none of the presidential vetoes that had become common in recent years.
 Congress cleared the last three of the 13 annual appropriations bills, for the Defense Department, health and education programs and foreign aid. The Defense bill included $8.2 billion for disaster relief in New York and $8.3 billion to tighten domestic security. 
 The first session of the 107th Congress ended when the Senate adjourned today at 10:06 p.m., five hours after the House wrapped up its business. Congress is scheduled to reconvene on Jan. 23.
Lawmakers had many disagreements over priorities, but none deep enough to force a shutdown of federal agencies, as in 1995-96. Congress did not resort to the messy device of a catchall spending bill, as it had often done when it failed to pass separate bills for major operations of the government.
But agreements may be more elusive in 2002, an election year. The political environment will be more partisan as lawmakers use the budget to contrast the positions of the two parties. Moreover, the budget will be extremely tight. Congress will face the prospect of deficits because of the recession and the tax cuts enacted this year. And the government will need more money to fight terrorism.
Congress was late in finishing its work this year. The spending bills provide money for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. But the appropriations process generally followed the civics textbooks.
Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the process worked well.
"We stayed within the budget numbers, but we still reacted and responded to the terrorist attacks," Mr. Young said in an interview. "Most of the 13 bills passed with huge majorities."
The spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, often the most contentious, won broad bipartisan support. The House approved it on Wednesday, 393 to 30, and the Senate followed today, voting 90 to 7.
Mr. Young, a Florida Republican, said he and the senior Democrat on the committee, David R. Obey of Wisconsin, "set out early in the year to make sure that the bill did not become a political football."
Democrats said they were extremely pleased with the increases in spending for education and biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health is getting an increase of $3 billion, or nearly 15 percent, to $23.3 billion.
Education programs will receive $48.9 billion. That is $6.7 billion (16 percent) more than last year and $4.4 billion (10 percent) more than President Bush requested.
The spending bills are among the few measures that Congress must pass each year, because under the Constitution, "no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law."
Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, said he regretted Mr. Bush's insistence on "an arbitrary number" -- $686 billion -- as the limit on spending subject to annual appropriations, known as discretionary spending. Because of that insistence, Mr. Dicks said, "lots of domestic security needs will go unmet," and the Pentagon will get much less than it needs to buy weapons and equipment.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Mid-Atlantic: Delaware: Order For Budget Cuts 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 With revenue projections battered by the slowdown, Gov. Ruth Ann Minner on Wednesday ordered state agencies to trim almost $24 million from their budgets this year. 
The move followed a meeting of the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Committee, which lowered its revenue estimate for the current fiscal year by $17 million. Over all, revenue estimates are down almost $31 million since June, when lawmakers passed a $2.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that started on July 1.

HEADLINE: United Airlines Mechanics' Strike Is Blocked by Bush 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
President Bush blocked a strike yesterday at United Airlines, the second time this year that the White House has intervened to prevent a walkout at a large carrier. 
 Mr. Bush signed an executive order creating a three-member emergency board responsible for studying the contract dispute between United Airlines and its mechanics and making a settlement recommendation. 
 The appointment of the board bars a strike for 60 days by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 13,000 mechanics at United, the nation's second-largest carrier after American Airlines. Had the White House not acted, United workers would have been free to walk out beginning today, effectively shutting down the airline right before the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 
The move had been expected for weeks because of the precarious financial condition of the airline industry and the weak economy and because of the prospect of a serious disruption during a peak travel period.
The machinists union, which is a member of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., lashed out at the White House, accusing the Bush administration of "declaring war" on American workers. 
"The right to win better wages and working conditions came at great cost to workers in this country and will not be given up or taken away without a fight," R. Thomas Buffenbarger, the president of the union, said in a statement.
United said that it had met with union leaders in Washington yesterday and agreed to continue negotiations. "We all recognize that the very unusual circumstances in our industry have made contract negotiations much more challenging than usual," the airline said in a statement. 
They are especially challenging at United, where a majority of the parent company, the UAL Corporation, is owned by employees, including a large stake held by the machinists. 
The union agreed to wage concessions in 1994 in exchange for its stake in the company. After returning to 1994 wage levels, the mechanics were poised to receive a large pay increase in line with a generous new contracts signed earlier this year by mechanics at American Airlines. 
But United lost nearly $2 billion so far this year because of the weak economy and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 that crashed two of its jets.
John W. Creighton Jr., the former paper company executive who took over as chief executive in October after his predecessor was forced to resign, is now seeking concessions from all employees to stem the losses. 
The airline acknowledges that United mechanics are now paid roughly one-third less an hour than their counterparts at American. The union is also upset because United's pilots succeeded in negotiating a generous new contract last August. 
But giving mechanics any pay increase is difficult at a time when United is receiving $800 million in direct government assistance and may have to apply for a federally backed loan. 
The airline and the union are struggling to come up with a formula that would somehow satisfy the workers' demand for a raise without raising United's costs. "To date, we are not asking for concessions from the '94 rates," William P. Hobgood, UAL's senior vice president for people, said in an interview. 
The discussions are further complicated by the fact that a rival union hoping to win the right to represent United's mechanics is waiting to seize on any perceived failure by the machinists.
Mr. Bush's appointees to the emergency board are three experienced labor arbitrators. Under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations in the airline industry, Congress has the right to intervene if a settlement is not reached in 60 days. It could extend the strike moratorium or impose the emergency board's proposed settlement. 
Mr. Bush has been more aggressive about blocking airline strikes than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson. In March, he appointed an emergency board to prevent a walkout by mechanics at Northwest Airlines. The two sides reached a settlement before the board made its recommendation. 
The White House was poised to intervene again in April, when pilots at Delta Air Lines were threatening to shut down the airline. But the two sides reached an agreement before the strike deadline. 
Unions accuse the White House of removing the pressure on management to settle. But airline executives say that government intervention only rights the balance because airline strikes are so expensive that management has no choice but to give in to the workers' demands.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Pushes to Make Daschle Appear a National Villain 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
When President Bush's push for an economic stimulus package collapsed in a partisan heap early this morning, Republicans from the White House down left no doubt about where they thought the blame lay.
 "Fundamentally, it still remains the job of the Senate leadership to complete their business," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, solemnly intoned. 
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert was blunter: "The Senate has turned its back."
The object of their ire was Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader, who has emerged as the Republicans' devil du jour. 
Senator Daschle, 54, is the most powerful elected Democrat in the country, but he speaks so softly that reporters strain to hear him. He is as partisan as anyone in Washington, but manages to disguise it beneath his mild manners.
Republicans contend that Mr. Daschle is the man most responsible for blocking major elements of President Bush's domestic agenda, from the stimulus package to Republican appointments.
One conservative group ran newspaper advertisements in South Dakota last month picturing Mr. Daschle side by side with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, accusing the senator of helping keep Mr. Hussein in power by opposing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Vice President Dick Cheney called him "an obstructionist" and declined to criticize the advertisement.
Another conservative group has run radio advertisements in Mr. Daschle's hometown, Aberdeen, S.D. -- with a media buy so heavy that typical listeners hear them two dozen times a week -- blaming him for blocking the president's plan to "extend unemployment benefits to those most affected by the Sept. 11 tragedy." Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, likened Mr. Daschle to a "rabid dog."
"I keep finding amusement in their imagination, in the different references they're making to me," Mr. Daschle said, allowing himself a faint smile in an interview on Wednesday, sandwiched between procedural wrangles on the farm bill and the collapse of negotiations on a stimulus bill. "Who knows what tomorrow brings, but they seem to have an unlimited supply."
If Mr. Daschle can shrug off the attacks, it may be because it is far from clear they have hurt him, among fellow Democrats or the public at large. In June, just after Democrats took control of the Senate when Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont switched from Republican to independent, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 68 percent of Americans had not heard enough about him to even have an opinion. 
Now, just weeks after Mr. Daschle became a household name and face in the trauma of a deadly anthrax-laced letter sent to his office, the political attacks have increased his prominence even more. 
"This makes Tom Daschle the man to see," said Jennifer Palmieri, the spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. "His life was threatened. The American people know who he is because of the anthrax letter. They're not going to buy that he's a firebrand."
But Grover Norquist, an influential Republican strategist and president of Americans for Tax Reform, which is helping sponsor the radio advertisements against Mr. Daschle, said: "He is not going to be a senator from South Dakota in 2005. He will either run for president and give up his seat, or if he tries to run again having been the leader of the left wing of the Democratic Party, we'll beat him."
Indeed, Republicans leave little doubt about their strategy, or its antecedents.
"It's time for someone, everyone, to start using the phrase 'Daschle Democrats' and the word 'obstructionist' in the same sentence," the Republican strategist Frank Luntz wrote in a memorandum of suggested talking points to the Senate Republican caucus on Wednesday.
"It's time for Congressional Republicans to personalize the individual that is standing directly in the way of economic security, and even national security," the memorandum added. "Remember what the Democrats did to Gingrich? We need to do exactly the same thing to Daschle."
Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledge, however, that the low-key Mr. Daschle can hardly be compared to Newt Gingrich, the former Republican Speaker and theorist who often seemed to go out of his way to be provocative, even polarizing.
By contrast, Mr. Daschle has offered virtually unstinting support to the White House in its war on terrorism abroad and at home, ignoring the objections of some liberal senators who raised questions about the administration's requests for sweeping new law enforcement tools. Only on domestic economic questions where polls suggest Democrats have an advantage has Mr. Daschle challenged the White House.
"Newt was a lot easier" to caricature, said Senator John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat from Louisiana whom the White House has tried to co-opt in its search for a compromise stimulus plan. "It was not a lot of heavy lifting. Tom is not a good target. He's not someone you can put up on a wall like Osama bin Laden. He's nice, he's likable, he's genuine."
To Republicans, Mr. Daschle's calm demeanor masks a partisan determination that reminds them of the former Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell, the former senator from Maine, who was one of Mr. Daschle's mentors. Bush partisans still blame Mr. Mitchell for forcing President George Bush to abandon his "no new taxes" pledge in the 1990 budget deal.
"He's so nice, so unassuming, that you'll never see the knife until it's in your back," Mr. Luntz said in an interview.
Addressing the future of an economic package, Mr. Daschle insisted he was not trying to block passage, only "redirect" priorities away from the president's proposed tax breaks for businesses to greater medical insurance coverage for unemployed workers, and said he hoped a deal might still be worked out in January.
"We want to pass something," he told reporters today, "but we don't want to pass anything."
Mr. Daschle, who is in his third term and up for re-election in 2004, said he would not make any decisions about a presidential race until after next year's midterm elections, though some people close to him seem to think he may be seriously considering it. He said he thought Democrats would be well advised not to try to pick a nominee too early.
"I don't think that we know who will be a strong candidate in 2004 in part because we don't know what the circumstances are going to be," he said. "I think it is too early."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Aides Lay Plans To Repair a Battered Image 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Even after Bill Clinton was elected president, his campaigning never seemed to stop. In the White House, he was always keenly attentive to polls and political calculations and presided over what became known as a "permanent campaign."
 Now, Mr. Clinton is trying to extend the permanent campaign even beyond his presidency. 
 Frustrated that his image has been battered since he left office, Mr. Clinton summoned several of his aides and advisers on Wednesday to devise ways to remind the public of his accomplishments and defend his legacy against criticism on matters including his role in the current recession and his failure to strike a fatal blow against Osama bin Laden or his terrorist network after the embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998.
Several participants at the meeting in Mr. Clinton's Harlem office said in interviews that they had agreed to compile a list of the Clinton administration's achievements that his supporters could have handy when defending the president. They hope to build a staff that will coordinate efforts to enlist former cabinet secretaries and other Clinton surrogates to appear on television talk shows and deliver speeches. And they are making plans to raise Mr. Clinton's profile on the lecture circuit, particularly before college audiences, which are most receptive.
Participants in the session said Mr. Clinton was concerned that Democratic leaders had not sufficiently spoken up for his administration, especially his centrist policies on health care, welfare, crime and education. As part of the campaign to refurbish his image, Mr. Clinton wants to play a central role in setting an issue agenda for the Democrats and for the party's aspiring Congressional and presidential candidates, his advisers said.
No modern president has ever mounted such an aggressive and organized drive to affect the agenda after leaving the White House.
"It's important that the president's legacy not be squandered because his own people remain silent and scattered," said Bill Richardson, Mr. Clinton's energy secretary, who like many others took part through a telephone hookup. "It's important that the Democratic Party not turn away from Clinton's centrist legacy that brought us economic prosperity."
Several participants said they did not want to discuss the meeting out of respect for Mr. Clinton's privacy. Others also acknowledged that they were worried that Mr. Clinton could be portrayed as preoccupied with his reputation and not conducting himself appropriately for a former president.
"I feel very uncomfortable talking about these meetings," said Sandy Berger, Mr. Clinton's former national security adviser.
"As far as I'm concerned, it was a private meeting, so I'm not going to say anything," said Al From, the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council.
Others, insisting they had nothing to hide, were not so reluctant.
Rodney Slater, Mr. Clinton's transportation secretary, said an impetus for the meeting was to make sure that the former president's policies were still in the public discourse.
"As much as anything, it was to recognize that we were part of something special," Mr. Slater said, "that there were still opportunities out there for us to express opinions about things and professional judgments."
Douglas Sosnik, who was Mr. Clinton's political director and later one of his most senior aides, put it this way: "Under President Clinton's leadership, we accomplished a remarkable amount in the last eight years, and his friends feel we should be doing a better job of getting that out proactively. Since he left office, we've spent too much time on the defensive, reacting to stories."
Gene Sperling, who was Mr. Clinton's top economic aide, said, "Most of the conversation was really about what kind of things he should be doing with his time, what his long-term service contributions should be."
Julia Payne, Mr. Clinton's spokeswoman, said she would have no comment about "a private meeting."
While Mr. Clinton had held meetings with advisers before, participants described this one as having a special urgency.
Mr. Clinton dominated the session, which lasted nearly two hours, participants said. They said he was careful not to criticize President Bush. And they said that while he expressed concern that he was being blamed for not catching Osama bin Laden, most of the discussion was about how to raise his profile and press his case on domestic matters.
Even during his presidency, Mr. Clinton was deeply interested in how he would be perceived by history. Now, the efforts to deploy surrogates to speak out for him are reminiscent of his vaunted war rooms in the White House, which were established for him to seize the political offensive on matters that included Whitewater and health care.
"He basically said our legacy is being pummeled and we have to find ways to revive it," said one participant, who described it as if it were a meeting of the top lieutenants of a political campaign. "We concluded that the Clinton hard core were not on message, and we had to develop a center of gravity. We have to remind people of what we did on the economy, what we did with the crime bill, what we did with terrorism." He added, "They're trying to pin the bin Laden thing on us."
Participants said that while some nice things were said about the Democratic leaders in Congress, Senator Tom Daschle and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, there was a view that they would only do so much to press the Clinton agenda. "The view was that House and Senate Democrats were too preoccupied with their own re-elections and their own deals," one participant said.
Other participants included Maggie Williams, Mr. Clinton's current chief of staff; John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff; Bruce Lindsey, Mr. Clinton confidant; Eli J. Segal, the former head of Mr. Clinton's national service organization; Steve Richetti, who was a deputy chief of staff; Maria Echavesta, a former deputy chief of staff; and Cheryl Mills, a deputy White House counsel. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York did not take part, nor did former Vice President Al Gore or any of his advisers.
Mr. Clinton's advisers said part of the discussion was over how active the former president should be in stumping for Democratic candidates next year. They said they had not reached a determination.
"He does not want to appear to be upstaging Bush," said one participant. "But the alternative to that is to continue to see his legacy vanish. Clinton said he was getting more of a positive response about his legacy with younger people."
Mr. Richardson, for one, said it was appropriate for Mr. Clinton to have a more public role.
"I'm pleased that the president will be more active in ensuring his legacy," he said.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Friday about a meeting of former President Bill Clinton and some supporters to devise ways to defend his legacy misstated the title of one participant, Al From, at the Democratic Leadership Council. He is chief executive, not executive director.

HEADLINE: A Fairer Sort of Harvard 

BYLINE:  By Richard Freeman; Richard Freeman is a professor of economics at Harvard and co-director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. Frank Rich is on vacation.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Last spring protesting students at Harvard demanded that the university pay all of its workers at least a living wage and that it stop contracting with outside companies for low-wage work. Faced with unflattering national publicity, Harvard set up a committee of faculty members, administrators, students and employees to look at the situation of its low-wage workers and make recommendations. The protests had raised a fundamental question: Does a major employer like Harvard have a responsibility to be a good employer to workers, or should it seek to get by with the least it can in the labor market?
 The last time Harvard faced this question was in December 1929, when the State of Massachusetts ordered it to pay female building cleaners the state minimum wage of 37 cents an hour, 2 cents above what the university had been paying. Choosing to get by with the least it could, Harvard fired the cleaning women and directed other workers to do their jobs. 
 This time Harvard is going in a very different direction. Its committee's report, which came out this week, documents the substantial decline in the real wages of custodians and other low-paid employees. It describes how the threat that work would be contracted out has put pressure on unionized workers to accede to low pay. If the committee's recommendations are adopted next month by Harvard's president, Lawrence Summers -- as is likely, given his positive reaction to the report -- the university will be committed to treating its lower-wage workers as full members of the university community and to giving them decent wages, respect for their work and opportunities for further training.
The committee also recommends pay increases that would take the lowest wages to between $10.83 and $11.30 an hour from $8.50. These rates are based on what the committee felt collective bargaining would have produced absent the threat of outsourcing to lower-wage contractors. The recommended pay levels exceed the levels in the living wage law that the City of Cambridge applies to municipal employees and city contractors.
Contrary to the fears of some alumni, students and administrators, the committee did not cave in to student demands for setting low-level pay according to a living wage formula, about which there could be considerable controversy, or to end outsourcing. Though it recommends a wage floor for the present, the heart of its proposal is something else: a parity wage and benefits policy for contractors, based on collective bargaining. Companies under contract to provide workers at Harvard would have to pay wages equivalent to the wages for Harvard's unionized employees doing comparable work. The Harvard unions would be bargaining, in effect, for minimum wages and benefits for the employees of contractors as well as for themselves, even though those outside workers might not be union members.
This policy has greater applicability to other major employers than a living wage would. And it does not lead the university into the difficult task of regularly evaluating living standards for workers with different family structures.
Falling real wages for low-paid workers are not unique to Harvard or to universities. Failure to spread prosperity widely has been the major failure in America's economic success. Treating low-wage workers as hired hands rather than as part of the work community is also not unique to Harvard. Many employers use contractors for low-wage work to avoid being responsible for what they know are abysmal wages, benefits and working conditions.
The Harvard committee's response of parity in compensation and working conditions between union and nonunion workers shows one way to deal with this problem. Other major employers, particularly those without unions, might find different ways, like committing to a definition of a living wage and paying accordingly.
For the United States to come together in the face of economic disparity, it is important to recognize that there is virtue as well as economic sense in being a good employer. Harvard December 2001, not Harvard December 1929, should be a model for the American economy.

HEADLINE: Spending Rate Is Pointing To a Rebound 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Consumer optimism rose to a four-month high this month, and Americans have been spending at a pace that suggests they will help the economy rebound during the next three months, reports released today showed.
 The University of Michigan's final index for December jumped to 88.8 from 83.9 in November. The preliminary December figure was 85.8, and the revision exceeded analysts' expectations. 
 The index marks "a significant shift in consumer attitudes," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York. "This is further support for a first-quarter recovery."
A rebound in stocks, low oil prices, fewer job cuts and American military success in Afghanistan are helping restore optimism after Sept. 11.
The Michigan survey helps predict spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy, and a report from the Commerce Department today suggests that consumers passed more time in malls and auto showrooms during the final three months of this year.
While personal spending fell 0.7 percent in November, that came after a record 2.9 percent jump in October, the Commerce Department reported today. The decline was slightly smaller than economists had expected.
The two months combined suggest that spending may grow at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, which ends this month. That contrasts with a 1 percent rate, the lowest in eight and a half years, that the Commerce Department reported today for the third quarter.
Gross domestic product, the sum of goods and services produced in the United States, shrank at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the department said today in its final estimate. The third quarter's performance was the weakest in more than a decade.
The pace is slower than the 1.1 percent rate of decline reported last month. The revision largely reflected new construction data and new export information.
A third report showed that personal incomes fell 0.1 percent in November, matching decreases of the prior two months. Analysts had expected a 0.2 percent increase.
Consumers have adjusted by shopping at discounters and taking advantage of no-interest financing at auto dealers. Recent numbers from the Labor Department also suggest that the worst layoffs have passed.
The personal savings rate was 0.9 percent after registering 0.2 percent in October. The indicator weighs current income from wages, salaries, businesses and government payments against spending. It does not account for borrowed money, income from investments or withdrawals from prior savings.
The report on gross domestic product showed that businesses reduced inventories at an even faster pace than previously estimated. The lower number subtracts from G.D.P. At the same time, the depletion of stockpiles may lead to increased factory orders and production next year, which would help drive growth.
Investors are growing more optimistic that corporate profits may rebound. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 10 percent since the beginning of October after falling 21 percent in the first nine months of the year. The Nasdaq composite index is up about 30 percent.
Oil prices have fallen more than 25 percent this year, contributing to gasoline prices at the pump that have fallen below $1 a gallon in some regions of the country.
The latest employment figures offer reason for optimism. The number of workers filing new claims for state unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week, to the lowest level in almost five months, government figures showed on Thursday.

Rise in Consumer Sentiment Sends Share Prices Higher

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday as an unanticipated rise in consumer sentiment and heartening forecast by the telecommunications equipment maker Nortel Networks put investors in a buying mood.
 "The consumer confidence data are heartening," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "That is one positive sign that 2002 will be a recovery year. Combined with other indicators, it makes for an easier decision-making process." 
 The University of Michigan's key gauge of consumer sentiment rose for the third consecutive month in December, as buyers demonstrated confidence in the economy's prospects, even as personal income declined during October. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Better-than-expected outlooks from Nortel and Nike lifted hopes that the economy and corporate profits would turn around next year. Wall Street was hit by a string of corporate earnings warnings this week, but investors are betting the market hit bottom in September and is poised to rise further.
"The market is looking forward," said Peter Gottlieb, portfolio manager at First Albany Asset Management. "We're looking forward to a recovery in the first or second quarter of next year, and we need numbers that are going to confirm that idea."
The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 50.16 points, or 0.5 percent, at 10,035.34. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,144.89. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index added 27.29 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,945.83.
For the week, most major indexes advanced solidly. The blue-chip Dow gained more than 2.3 percent, while the broader market rose by 2 percent. Technology stocks faltered after a promising start, finishing the week 0.4 percent lower.
Wall Street was watchful of fallout stemming from Argentina's deepening political and economic morass. The nation's president, Fernando de la Rua, stepped down amid the worst civil unrest in a decade, prompted by anger over Argentina's worsening financial problems and efforts to avoid the biggest debt default in history.
But traders focused on positive news from several companies that either met or beat analysts' forecasts in spite of the halting economy.
Canada's Nortel warned it would post a quarterly loss because of weaker sales, but its stock rallied nonetheless on relief that the loss was lower than Wall Street analysts had expected.
Nortel gained 77 cents, to $7.13, dragging many networking stocks up in its wake. Ciena, for instance, rose 42 cents, to $14.43.
Nike, the maker of athletic shoes and clothing, announced that it expected modest earnings and revenue growth for the balance of its 2002 fiscal year. Nike surged by $2.51 on the news, to $56.30.
Weakness in the financial and pharmaceutical sectors helped constrain share price gains. J. P. Morgan Chase declined 77 cents, to $35.75, on continued problems stemming from its loan exposure to the bankrupt energy trader Enron.
Pfizer fell 40 cents, to $41, after a Texas jury awarded plaintiffs $43 million in compensatory damages from injuries arising from the company's recalled diabetes drug Rezulin. Pfizer rival Eli Lilly dropped $1.63, to $78.40.
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note lost 11/32 , to a price of 99 12/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.08 percent from 5.04 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 , to 98 30/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.45 percent from 5.42 percent on Thursday.

To the Editor:
Re "Grounded by an Income Gap" (Arts & Ideas pages, Dec. 15):
 It astounded me that almost nobody quoted in the debate over income disparity cited the degree to which institutionalized racism accounts for this disparity. 
This is true worldwide, in terms of rich and poor countries, as well as within our own society. And the disparity is all the more potent when it comes to wealth, as distinct from income. 
 The economists you quote, as well as society as a whole, simply fail to consistently understand the role of racial hierarchy and subjugation as explanatory factors for so much of our economic, political and social life. Until we can come to grips with this reality, we will forever fall short of our democratic ideals -- and possibly forever face angry, degraded people in the rest of the world.

Japan and China in Pact On 8-Month Trade Dispute

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Japan and China said today that they had settled an eight-month dispute that threatened to seriously disrupt trade between them, an $85 billion relationship fraught with an unusual degree of political testiness.
 China agreed to withdraw 100 percent tariffs it had imposed on Japanese automobiles, mobile phones and air-conditioners. Japan backed down from threats to impose very low ceilings on imports of Chinese agricultural goods. 
 It took a high-level face-to-face meeting to complete the deal. Takeo Hiranuma, the Japanese trade minister, met in Beijing today with his Chinese counterpart, Shi Guangsheng. 
"Both governments will work together to strengthen orderly trade between our two countries," the Japanese Trade Ministry said today in announcing the deal. It mentioned plans for future talks and for a joint crackdown on smuggling.
Powerful domestic political sensitivities were at play on both sides. Resentment of Japan's conquest and occupation of much of the country in World War II remains alive in China, and though it is modernizing and growing fairly rapidly, China's economy is still much the smaller and more backward of the two. In Japan, the inefficient but politically powerful farm sector whips up nationalist sentiment to win protection from cheaper foreign competition. 
At the farm lobby's behest, Japanese lawmakers set off the dispute by imposing high duties on Chinese-grown mushrooms and leeks. 
Contributing to friction in the trade relationship has been Japan's direct loss of manufacturing jobs to China as companies shift production to take advantage of lower wages there. In part because Chinese factory workers are paid as little as 5 percent of what Japanese workers earn, Japanese companies now own more manufacturing capacity in China than they do in the United States. 
But there is little that lawmakers can do to stop the manufacturing exodus to China, analysts said, noting that the two economies will become increasingly intertwined in the coming years. 
"Concluding the trade argument is very positive for both sides," said Mamoru Yamazaki, an economist at Barclays Capital Markets in Tokyo. "Japan needs China as an export market and a manufacturing base."

HEADLINE: Thomas Gulotta's Irresponsible Exit 

 BODY:
In his last major act before leaving office, Nassau County's departing Republican county executive, Thomas Gulotta, extended his record of fiscal mismanagement and made the job facing his Democratic successor, Thomas Suozzi, a lot harder. Making last-minute changes to the budget approved by the County Legislature's narrow Democratic majority, Mr. Gulotta rejected its core idea of accelerating three planned 5 percent tax increases into a single 15 percent increase next year. Instead Mr. Gulotta lowered next year's tax increase to 9 percent, relying for superficial balance on the same sort of phony assumptions and gimmicks that led the populous suburban county -- one of the nation's wealthiest -- to pile up huge public deficits in the midst of an economic boom. 
 Among other things, Mr. Gulotta optimistically recalibrated the county's sales tax projections to forecast a 3 percent increase in sales tax receipts over the coming year. Westchester County is predicting that sales tax revenues will remain essentially flat, and in New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has projected a 5 percent decline. 
 The Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state oversight board that monitors Nassau County's finances, hurt its own credibility as an independent watchdog by approving Mr. Gulotta's revisions instead of demanding another round of tweaking by county officials. The board itself acknowledged that the budget contains big risks that will have to be closely monitored. But having rejected several previous versions, the board decided to accept the large remaining flaws, and put its faith in Mr. Suozzi to straighten things out once he takes office on Jan. 1.
Mr. Suozzi was on firm ground in complaining that saddling him with such a precarious budget will make it more difficult to achieve the fundamental reforms of county government he promised voters. For his future effectiveness, though, Mr. Suozzi needs to ditch his immature habit of venting disagreement by tossing off intemperate remarks that risk alienating people whose cooperation he badly needs.
The oversight board has given Mr. Suozzi a deadline of April 1 to come up with a responsible four-year fiscal plan that will lift Nassau out of the red. That is a very short time to accomplish the required top-to-bottom restructuring of Nassau's bloated government bureaucracy, flush out patronage and waste and achieve realistic labor agreements that allow for overdue personnel reductions and improved productivity. But the severity of Nassau's financial problems makes prompt action mandatory. Mr. Gulotta's mendacious final budget only adds to those problems.

I.M.F. and U.S. Are Blamed For Argentina's Collapse
With riots in the streets, the collapse of a government and another multibillion-dollar bailout deemed a dismal failure, Argentina's woes have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the financial policy of the United States, the fund's leading shareholder.
 Latin American and European government leaders joined protesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial experts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's problems on the I.M.F. and the Clinton and Bush administrations. Page A1. 

Microsoft Asks for a 4-Month Delay
Microsoft asked a federal judge to delay by at least four months hearings on the proposed remedies of its antitrust case, pushing the proceeding to August at the earliest. The company also announced that one of its witnesses in the hearing might be its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, left. The scheduling request was the latest in a series of motions and legal jockeying over the final phase of the case. C2.

HEADLINE: Median Income Drops Are Tied to Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Median household income dropped between 1989 and 1998 in Queens, Brooklyn, Suffolk, Fairfield and many other counties across the nation that experienced a large influx of immigrants, according to new census data.
 The data indicate that even as the economy in the New York region and the nation rebounded after the recession of the early 90's, figures for median household income, adjusted for inflation, failed to climb in many counties because of the increase in low-income immigrant workers. 
 The new data show that in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx -- counties with a major increase of immigrants -- median income fell sharply. More surprising, though, was the marked income drop in some of the region's wealthiest suburbs, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York and Fairfield County in Connecticut. 
"Immigrants are jumping immediately into these inner-ring suburbs, which is a change from the past 300 years, when the first generation lived in inner-city neighborhoods," said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a civic group that works to improve the economy of the New York region. "This new phenomenon is reducing household incomes in some of the well-to-do suburbs as immigrants move into Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk. It's consistent with the national phenomenon of the suburbanization of poverty."
The new data show that median income also fell in many counties in other states attractive to immigrants, including Los Angeles County and Miami-Dade County.
In Queens, according to the data, the median household income fell to $36,480 in 1998 from $44,938 in 1989, a drop of nearly 19 percent, while in Brooklyn it fell by 18 percent, to $27,556 from $33,762.
In Los Angeles County, where there has been a surge of immigrants from Mexico, median income fell in constant dollars to $37,655 in 1998 from $45,962, a decline of 18 percent, according to the census data.
Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College, prepared the analysis that compared the Census Bureau's median income estimates for 1989 and 1998.
Many economists view the median as the best figure for assessing income trends since half the incomes are above it and half below. 
Several economists and sociologists, however, argued that the new census data exaggerated the income drop from 1989 to 1998. They said that although median household income might have fallen in many counties, it did not fall as much as the new data suggested. 
These economists questioned the new computer model developed by the Census Bureau, and they noted that there was a higher margin of error in analyzing small areas like counties. In addition, critics argued that the way inflation was adjusted might have exaggerated the drop in median income.
Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki, said the estimated declines were not credible.
"They use an inappropriate starting point, 1989, which was a cyclical peak, thereby ignoring the deep recession that occurred afterwards," Mr. Kagann said. "And they use an inappropriate inflation adjustment that overestimates inflation and thereby underestimates the growth in income."
He said that if the analysis had taken 1993 as its starting point, when New York's economy was near the bottom, the study would have shown a 7.9 percent increase in median household income statewide.
Jared Bernstein, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute, also said that the new census data painted too gloomy a picture. Pointing to another census study, from last March, he noted that median household income for New York State dropped by 7 percent from 1989 to 1998. He added that a 5 percent increase in income in the two boom years, 1999 and 2000, meant a decline of just 2 percent from 1989 to 2000.
Still, he saw economic problems in the state. "In New York, you've had an amplified version of the expanded income gap we've seen nationally," he said. "Folks in the high end -- in law, high tech, financial markets -- were in a good place to ride the boom. Meanwhile, the huge supply of low-wage workers who were serving these upper-end workers during the boom didn't do nearly as well."
Mr. Beveridge's analysis estimated that median income in Nassau County fell by 14 percent ($61,096 in 1998 from $71,202 in 1989), 16 percent in Suffolk ($54,008 from $64,580), 11 percent in Westchester ($56,865 from $63,629), 12 percent in Fairfield ($57,389 from 65,583), 12 percent in Hudson County ($35,743 from $40,641), 17 percent in Passaic County ($40,923 from $49,421) and by 10 percent in Essex County ($40,595 from $45,375).
While critics derided the numbers, Mr. Beveridge defended them, saying the arrival of immigrants in Bridgeport, Yonkers, Paterson, Hempstead and other communities could have caused a double-digit decrease in income.
In the preponderance of counties nationwide, median household income rose from 1989 to 1998. The counties with declines were often in metropolitan areas with the greatest surges in immigration, including New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego and Washington.
Roger Waldinger, an immigration expert at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the decline in household income could have been fueled by factors having nothing to do with immigration, like the increase in one-member and single-parent households. 
Economists have pointed to other reasons for stagnant or declining incomes, including pressure from import competition, the declining power of labor unions, automation that pushes workers out of jobs and poor schools that churn out students who lack job skills.
Dr. Waldinger has conducted studies showing that in many communities, immigration affects income levels and the gap between rich and poor. He said income levels were dragged down by unemployment, not immigrants, who he said usually worked long hours. But many economists say limited skills and inadequate English relegated many immigrants to low-paying jobs.

HEADLINE: As the Travel Rush Begins, Patience Is a Must-Have 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
On a stage, Mariachi Allende, a Mexican-style band in colorful charro outfits, set the crowd dancing and clapping with its rendition of "Feliz Navidad."
 The band was among a string of performers that included an Elvis impersonator and country-and-western bands. 
 Muganza Nyota was watching the show, in the international terminal at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport as it slipped into the busiest season of the year.
"This is the first time I've flown since before September," said Ms. Nyota, who was changing planes en route to Paris from Phoenix. "Seeing this band and hearing their music makes me much more confident and relaxed about it all." 
Mariachi performers and Elvis impersonators were among the novel reminders that the Christmas travel rush at airports, bus terminals and train stations around the country this year was different from the rush in years past.
Air traffic is expected to be down 15 percent to 20 percent compared with last year, partly because of fear after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and partly because of the weaker economy.
But the waits to check in at airports are significantly longer this year -- up to three hours in Los Angeles, for example -- because of tighter security. Travelers were warned, for example, not to carry wrapped gifts, because security officers might want to inspect them.
But air, road and rail traffic moved relatively smoothly, and when problems arose, people tried to make the best of them.
At the American Airlines terminal at La Guardia Airport in New York, some passengers had to wait four hours or longer to check in, causing scores to miss their flights. The airline said passengers not prepared for the heightened security caused the delays.
"It's terrible, because I've been standing on line for more than four hours, and I'm tired," said Wesley Jean-Louis, who was trying to rebook a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after missing one because of the long wait. "I didn't expect it; I thought everything would go smoothly."
Nearby, Richmond Punch, 21, a student at the Juilliard School, tried to lighten the mood by playing the violin. That earned Mr. Punch some change and a cookie from a happy father for playing the theme song from the television show "Barney" for the man's son.
Concerns about delays prompted airport officials to make extra efforts to keep tempers from flaring. In Denver, for example, after drivers approaching the terminal endured random car searches, an airport employee dressed as Santa Claus handed out candy canes and maps of the airport.
But most passengers seemed to come armed with the best ammunition against the long waits, patience.
"This is the longest queue I've ever been in," said Rod Mabin, 31, who works for an advertising agency in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, as he looked at a line of at least 300 people at Los Angeles International Airport. But Mr. Mabin said he was very patient, adding, "Nothing bothers me anymore."
The concerns about safety and airport lines led many people to take to the highways, although traffic was expected to be slightly less than the record of last year because of the weaker economy. The plunge in gasoline prices has also encouraged some people to travel by car.
"A lot of people are saying, 'Let's just drive rather than take a plane,' " said Don Furlong, a division manager for AAA South, in Georgia. "I think the fear of flying is gone, but the fear of hassle at the airport is still causing trepidation."
Some bus companies said ticket sales for long trips were up this year, in part because of concern about the safety of air travel, but sales for short trips were down.
Kajal Jhaveri, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said that the decline in the economy was hurting business over all but that premium train service and sleeper cars were selling out.
Even train passengers were encouraged to prepare for the worst at stations.
"Anecdotally, you can see the crowds, and we're advising travelers to purchase tickets in advance to avoid a last minute rush," Ms. Jhaveri said. "And we recommend that they get to the station an hour early."
Officials of Greyhound Lines said they had increased security at 33 major transfer points, checking bus passengers with metal-detector wands. All drivers have cellphones for use in emergencies, the officials said.
Myron Watkins, a district manager for Greyhound in Atlanta, said traffic was down before the holiday but was picking up. Mr. Watkins said he anticipated a brisk but smooth flow about equal to traffic last year.
The specter of Sept. 11 influenced the travel plans of some people who decided to stick with air travel.
David Vaillancourt, 23, who was on his way from Los Angeles to visit his family in Providence, R.I., said he would normally change planes in Boston, the airport used by some of the terrorists, but he was going through Pittsburgh this year.
"My parents thought it would be easier for me to fly in and out of Providence than Boston, what with all the security there," said Mr. Vaillancourt, an actor who has lived in Los Angeles for three years. "But it means I have a three-hour layover in Pittsburgh. It'll take me all day to get home -- so I brought a good book."

HEADLINE: The Economy May Be Facing More Hurdles 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
At first glance, the economy seems primed for a speedy revival from recession.
 Since the beginning of the year, the Federal Reserve has slashed short-term interest rates more aggressively than ever before. Oil prices have fallen to under $20 a barrel. The stock market has rebounded, companies have slimmed down their bulging warehouses and consumers can look forward to lower tax rates next year. 
 So it's clear sailing ahead, right? Not necessarily. As it turns out, some of these signs are not as favorable as they sound, and lurking behind them are financial imbalances that threaten to retard the recovery. 
Indeed, while many on Wall Street are counting on a solid rebound next year, Main Street is still looking for signs of improvement. Take Rodney McMullen, an executive vice president at Kroger, the nation's biggest grocer-retailer. He said purchases of discretionary items, like flowers and jewelry, had stopped sliding but showed no hint of a revival. Because those items are not necessities, their sales tend to be the most sensitive to buyers' finances.
Consumers, it appears, have not felt the full impact of all those supposedly positive factors.
For starters, the deterioration of the federal budget outlook may have neutralized much of the Fed's rate-cutting. "On net, those two wash out," said David Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
The cushy surpluses once projected for the next few years have virtually disappeared, thanks to income-tax cuts, depressed tax revenues and billions in unexpected spending on disaster relief, domestic security and the war in Afghanistan. If the government issues more debt to pay for these things, businesses will have to offer higher interest rates to compete for investors' financing.
"Long-term rates have not fallen, even though short-term rates have come way down," Professor Romer said. In past recessions, the two have tracked more closely. This time long-term rates took a while to respond, then fell, but have since begun to climb again. Since the Fed began cutting rates in January, its key short-term rate has fallen from 6.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Meanwhile, 10-year bond yields, which closed at 5.08 percent yesterday, are little changed from January levels. Long-term interest rates generally have to fall to convince businesses to ramp up investments.
That is not to say that the Fed's actions had no effect. "Monetary policy is a powerful tool, and that's still true," Professor Romer said. "If we hadn't had the monetary policy, long-term rates might be a lot higher than they are."
Cheaper oil may also offer a disappointingly small jolt to the economy. "Certainly it's good news," said James Hamilton, an economist at the University of California in San Diego. But he warned that oil prices' capacity to spur growth had little to do with how much they had apparently stifled it in the past. "Oil prices have much more potential to disrupt the economy when they go bad," he said.
An even deeper problem for the economy, however, could arise as businesses and households come to grips with their balance sheets.
"Businesses are not wanting to take on some more debt even though the rates are lower, unless they're refinancing something they already have," said Patricia Marquez, a business banker at Wells Fargo in El Paso, Tex. 
Since April, for example, El Paso has been battling a cash shortage among new businesses with a federally supported program that injects low-interest seed money to back up commercial loans. Ms. Marquez said that without the program, several businesses would not have been able to get loans.
And the full force of a credit crunch may be about to hit small businesses in the next few months, said Cap Willey, who owns an accounting firm in Rhode Island and chairs the economic development committee of National Small Business United, a lobby with more than 65,000 members. Mr. Willey said banks were likely to clamp down on lending after receiving their borrowers' annual financial statements, which are typically due 90 or 120 days after the year ends. A sudden tightening would be a nasty surprise for those who expect the economy to recover in March or April.
The retrenchment comes less than a year after corporate borrowing reached its highest level in two decades. "After 1995, there was an expectation of ever-higher growth," said Bill Martin, an economist with UBS Warburg. When the rosy future turned bleaker late last year, and companies seemed likely to have trouble meeting earnings expectations, the rationale for easy credit disappeared.
But it will still take a while before the gap between corporate spending and cash flow narrows enough to lay the foundation for revival, said John Youngdahl, an economist with Goldman Sachs. He says the gap has already dropped to $170 billion from about $250 billion. "Progress has been made by the sharp cut in capital spending," Mr. Youngdahl said, "but we still think there's a way to go in 2002."
In previous recessions, Mr. Youngdahl said, the gap typically closed to a level that would be equivalent to roughly $100 billion today before the economy revived.
To lay the groundwork for sustainable economic growth, households may also have to move away from borrowing to rebuild their savings. Like companies, consumers added about $250 billion to their debts in the last year. The trend away from saving has been going strong since the last recession ended in 1991. Back then, the situation was reversed: private saving exceeded borrowing by about $360 billion.
Saving could already be on the rise. In El Paso, Ms. Marquez said business had dropped in local restaurants. "People are staying home, they're saving their money," she said.
The behavior of Americans who received tax rebates also hints at more saving. "The fact that such a low percentage of those rebates were spent in the short term was a collateral signal that the saving rate was going up," Mr. Youngdahl said.
At least initially, however, all that could be bad news for the recovery. Mr. McMullen of Kroger said he could not recall a recession when sales of durable goods -- cars, refrigerators and the like -- had not led the recovery. But Christopher D. Carroll, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said the rise in saving virtually always went along with a fall in purchases of durables. "It seems very unlikely to me that we'll see a big surge in durable goods spending to help pull the economy out of recession robustly," he said.
Bill Dunkelberg, who conducts a monthly survey of small-business owners for the National Federation of Independent Business, which has about 600,000 members, was more hopeful. "To stop growth, you really need the consumer to give up the ship, and I don't see that happening," he said.
Hiding in the shadows of corporate balance sheets is another potential drag on the economy: the crippling of corporate pension funds by the stock market's fall.
"The last time we had such a major dip in the stock market was 1973 and 1974," said Ethan Kra, the chief retirement actuary at William M. Mercer. In the 1970's, Mr. Kra said, holding half a portfolio in stocks was considered aggressive. "Today there are pension funds that are 70, 80, 90 percent equities," he said.
The losses are severe. "We're talking tens and tens of billions in the economy," Mr. Kra said. "It's hitting companies of all sizes."
Disappointing returns spell danger for companies whose pension funds pay a fixed benefit to retirees. The companies will have to top off their pension funds using earnings.
Mr. Kra predicted that these unanticipated contributions would continue for years. That means the worst pension expenses might not surface until late in 2003.
Will these hindrances keep the economy from recovering on time? According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the unofficial arbiter of the business cycle, an average recession lasts about 11 months. On that schedule, the recession could end sometime in February. Yet this has been no average recession.
Professor Romer pointed out that unlike most recent recessions, this one had not resulted from the Fed's efforts to head off inflation. "You would expect a different set of patterns in a recession that's got a different cause," he said.
"We know this is a very unusual recession," Mr. Martin agreed. Since forecasters did a poor job of predicting the recession's onset, he said, they should not necessarily be trusted to predict the timing or strength of a recovery.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN ARGENTINA: INTERNATIONAL FINANCE; 
ARGENTINA'S CHAOS RAISES NEW DOUBTS ON MONETARY FUND

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
The deadly riots in Argentina, the collapse of its government and another multibillion dollar bailout gone awry have raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund and the financial policies of the United States, the fund's leading shareholder.
 Latin American and European government leaders today joined protesters in Buenos Aires, Wall Street traders and financial experts in putting at least part of the blame for Argentina's problems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush administrations. 
 Some say the monetary fund showed callousness by failing to give new aid to Argentina early this month, as the country's economic program, designed with I.M.F. approval, was forcing painful austerity measures on its citizens. Others say the fund made the opposite mistake, repeatedly offering loans to Argentina despite indications that the country's policies had become unworkable, delaying the day of reckoning. 
These criticisms, even if contradictory, increase pressure on the I.M.F. and the Bush administration to articulate a clear policy toward financial rescue efforts, which often come under fire even when they are judged successful.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill came into office publicly denouncing multibillion dollar bailouts, saying that either they fail outright or they allow foreign governments to get away with bad policymaking and investors to get away with bad bets.
In practice, however, the Bush administration has yet to take a clear stance on such bailouts and has made international financial policy a low priority.
Peru's finance minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, complained today that the fund bungled its dealings with Argentina by adopting inconsistent policies that were at turns passive and inflexible. "The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when things were incredibly difficult," he told Peruvian radio.
Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, assailed the I.M.F. for abandoning a longtime client and imposing "demands that have been excessive or at the wrong time." The French, who like the United States are significant fund shareholders, have called on the lending agency to step up its involvement to help Argentina recover.
After some hand-wringing about jeopardizing the money of American "plumbers and carpenters," Mr. O'Neill supported a multibillion loan for Argentina in August. He has also backed two large rescue packages for Turkey, a strategic ally that has faced tough financial problems.
When Argentina's crisis worsened in recent weeks, Bush administration officials did not take a firm position, allowing the I.M.F. to make the call on withholding additional loans, people involved in the fund's deliberations said.
Even the harshest critics of the I.M.F. put most of the blame for Argentina's current plight on a succession of governments in Buenos Aires. But many say the monetary fund should have called government officials to account sooner.
Argentina adopted a strict fixed-currency regime and overhauled its banks in the early 1990's. It tamed inflation and became, for a spell, a glowing economic success story.
But subsequent governments allowed spending to grow out of control, building up a foreign debt that became impossible to maintain. Argentina also fell into a deep recession four years ago. The government beseeched the I.M.F. for help to stay solvent as it tried to work through its problems.
Backed by both the Clinton and Bush administrations, the I.M.F. twice came to the rescue, beginning late last year.
The idea was to help the country defend its fixed currency, which had become a political touchstone, while avoiding default on $132 billion in foreign debt, allowing it to continue good relations with foreign investors.
The terms of the aid program were wrenching. The government agreed to slash spending during a deep recession to increase the chances of making debt payments on schedule.
"If Argentina got its core economic policies right, it would have avoided this problem," said Charles Calomiris, a finance and economics professor at Columbia University who has been sounding the alarm about Argentina for months. "But the I.M.F. and both the Clinton and Bush administrations let them stay in denial. They all wanted the problem to fall on someone else's watch."
It is always a tough call to cut off aid, Mr. Calomiris said. But he argued that by delaying, the fund helped Argentina dig itself into a deeper hole.
"If you do not show leadership and make it happen early, then you face a catastrophe," he said.
Michael Mussa, the I.M.F.'s chief economist until last spring, said the fund was justified in providing aid to Argentina late last year.
But he said that he disagreed with the decision by the fund and the Bush administration to continue the aid program in August, when he said the situation in Argentina had likely deteriorated beyond repair.
"The fund made a mistake in not saying no in August," Mr. Mussa said. "The situation might have been more controllable then."
The difficulty, of course, is that such calls are much easier to make in hindsight. Mr. Mussa acknowledged that even when the political and economic situation in Argentina was more stable, a move to delay debt payments or devalue the currency ran the risk of rattling financial markets and even causing a financial implosion in the region.
In contrast, by watching Argentina wrestle with its finances over a period of months, financial markets anticipated the possibility of a default. The chances of contagion are now viewed as minimal.
Moreover, it is difficult to place blame for Argentina's economic program squarely on the fund when much of the policy was designed by Argentina itself, sometimes over the objections of the fund's economists.
At an August meeting at I.M.F. headquarters, fund officials told Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, that the country would be better off delaying debt payments.
Argentina, however, was determined to pay its debts in full and keep its fixed currency in place, fulfilling what it viewed as a promise to its citizens and creditors who had been told for years that pesos were as good as dollars. It outlined strict fiscal policies that it claimed would allow it to meet its obligations.
But by December, as Mr. Cavallo resorted to freezing bank accounts and raiding pension funds to find enough hard currency to make debt payments, collapse looked imminent. The fund decided to suspend aid for a program that appeared to have little chance of success.
Though there were unique elements, Argentina's demise seems certain to add to the doubts about the wisdom of bailouts, doubts that have grown in recent years. Nearly every major financial rescue effort, including those in Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, has come under intense scrutiny from the left and the right, albeit for widely varying reasons.
Fund officials say privately that they cannot avoid financial bailouts altogether. The lesson of Argentina, they say, is that they need to find a way to say no before the people they are supposed to be helping take to the streets.

HEADLINE: Tennessee Town Loses Allure for Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: SHELBYVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 21 

 BODY:
In the 1990's, they came here by the thousands from Mexico and Central America, making their way across the border and traveling by van to this rural town in horse country. 
 They found jobs easily at the Tyson Foods chicken-processing factory on the edge of town, often without working papers or, perhaps, using counterfeit Social Security cards, current and former workers say. 
 Shelbyville, 60 miles south of Nashville, became a magnet for Mexicans and Guatemalans who found shelter at the trailer parks that sprang up near the plant and in cottages and shanties not far from the town square. 
The immigrant community and the Mexican grocery stores and taco stands that have opened helped transform Shelbyville's identity. 
But now this town of 16,000 people is at the center of the largest immigrant-smuggling case that involves a major American company, government prosecutors said. 
An investigation that started four years ago here, when the Police Department heard about immigrant smuggling that prosecutors said involved a Mexican grocer and Tyson executives, has led to the indictment of Tyson and six managers.
The company and the executives are charged with arranging to transport illegal immigrants across the border and helping them obtain counterfeit work papers for jobs in Shelbyville and more than 12 other poultry plants in nine states. 
The company said the case involved a handful of employees who were acting against policy.
Since the investigation began, Tyson, the largest poultry and meat processor in the nation, has cracked down on illegal workers at its plant in Shelbyville, the largest factory in town, former and current workers said. 
With the national economy in a slump and the local economy reeling from layoffs at other companies in the region, many of the Mexicans and Guatemalans are leaving.
"There's no work here," said Rene Gaspar, 23, a Guatemalan who arrived six months ago with no working papers and no money and is sharing a heatless shanty with three other unemployed Guatemalans. "We were looking for work and looking for a life here. But what we are is poor and ashamed."
Among those who were dismissed from the factory that drew them in the first place, some have found seasonal work in the nearby tobacco fields. 
Others have taken the few jobs available at factories that are not too strict about working papers, and a few are working as grooms for the stables of walking horses for which the region is known.
For those who want to go back home, the Mexican grocery stores display signs that advertise van trips to the border. 
In 1990, according to Census figures, Shelbyville had 92 Hispanic residents. 
A decade later, in 2000, it had 2,343, although those figures are considered low because they are unlikely to reflect many of the illegal workers. 
For those who remember Shelbyville from long ago -- who might have seen Mexicans arriving in town as grooms for the annual Tennessee Walking Horse Celebration over the years but never expected a large enclave -- the influx has required an adjustment. 
"It is quite a different place," said the city manager, Ed Craig, who grew up here, left for 35 years and returned three years ago. 
The schools have enrolled thousands of Spanish-speaking children over the last few years, starting programs in English as a Second Language. A Hispanic church, Iglesia de Cristo, opened on Madison Street, a main road, a few years ago. Bank tellers are taking Spanish courses, and drugstores sell Glamour magazine in Spanish.
Last year, The Shelbyville Times-Gazette added two pages in Spanish, which are published on Fridays. The editor, Mark McGee, said some readers called to cancel their subscriptions in protest.
At the trailer park near the Tyson plant, which was crammed with factory workers until last year and now has several vacancies, residents said, there are still a few residents who work for Tyson. But those who do not have legal papers said they expected to have to leave at any time. 
None said they knew of Tyson's involvement in smuggling workers, and all the workers interviewed said they had made their way to Tennessee on their own. 
But they said that starting about a year ago their supervisors began selecting employees whom they knew were working illegally and firing them. 
"I don't know if I'll lose my job this week or next week," said a man who identified himself only as Alfonso, who traveled to Shelbyville in 1998 to work for Tyson after having paid a man $1,000 to help him across the Mexican border into Arizona. 
Alfonso, 35, who has no working papers, shares his trailer with Jesus Gonzalez, 19, who was discharged from Tyson last year because he was working there illegally. Mr. Gonzalez now works a few days here and there for a company that delivers the live chickens to the Tyson plant, he said.
Alfonso said he would probably leave if he were caught for working illegally at Tyson and, perhaps, go to South Carolina, where he heard that there was farm work.
"I don't think it will be long," he said. "And there are no more jobs here for me."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN ARGENTINA: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Argentina's New Chapter In an Epic of Frustration

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Argentina has some of the world's richest agricultural and cattle lands and a good deal of oil, an educated and cultured population, and a mere 36 million people sprinkled over a land mass nearly the size of India. At the turn of the last century, its economy was comparable to that of the United States.
 So why is the country today in such a mess? And why has it met similar crises at so many points in its modern history? 
 Most of Argentina's presidents in the past seven decades have either resigned or have been overthrown in military coups. Their demises have often come in the midst of economic crises, and after the discontented filled Buenos Aires' broad, Parisian-style boulevards to battle the police. 
When President Fernando de la Rua resigned this week halfway through a four-year term, he followed a script written by a long string of failed predecessors, leaving a country lacking political consensus, a government on the brink of bankruptcy, an economy in a nosedive. 
Indeed, Mr. De la Rua seemed to be revisiting an article published in the British magazine The New Statesman in 1978 that commented: "The failure of Argentina as a nation is the biggest political mystery of this century." 
The unfulfilled promise of this New World country with European aspirations is rooted deep in its history of civil wars, military and guerrilla uprisings, and dishonest government. But there are many other reasons, too, why the present situation is so unsurprising and the future so uncertain. 
Forty percent of Argentines do not pay their taxes, penalizing those who do and leaving the government perpetually short of cash. The economy is led by a business class that has trouble competing in international markets and has traditionally shielded itself through tariffs and depended on handouts from the government. The political system is characterized by corrupt, machine-led parties whose loyalties shift carelessly among ideas and agendas. The electorate is fickle, and tends to look for quick fixes without sacrifice. 
The dominant political organization, the Justicialist Party, was set up by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940's as a populist quasi-fascist party that took from the rich and gave to the poor and big unions. The party today has no guiding ideology and is deeply divided. 
Some members want to open the economy, and others would set up high tariff walls and reject the globalization that neighboring Chile has thrived on for much of the last decade. 
The demonstrations of the last few days had no leaders and few slogans beyond a desire to throw all politicians out of office. "They are pigs and prostitutes who have failed," chanted a crowd that gathered outside the presidential palace in the Plaza de Mayo on Thursday.
This sorry panorama has inspired a series of new best-selling books by Argentine writers who launch the most withering criticisms of their own country. 
"I don't remember a single moment in my life when you could say we were not in a crisis," wrote Mariano Grondona, a veteran journalist, in a new best seller. "Ever since the 1930 coup, when the state lost its legitimacy," he added, "the Argentine state has declined to the point of impotence." 
He had little better to say about business or labor. Mr. Grondona noted that Argentina's productivity is exactly the same today as it was in 1970, while the United States is 80 percent more productive than it was 31 years ago. Argentina exports only 8 percent of what it produces, he said, while neighboring Chile and Mexico export 30 percent.
"We don't have the quality of life that we want, nor the efficiency, nor the decency, nor the security that we require because we Argentines have failed," wrote Marcos Aguinis, a literary critic in a book published early this year. "Only if the society develops a decisive diagnosis can we come closer to selecting good leaders and create a climate of rationality, strength and hope."
But the diagnosis of the present -- the unsustainable debts, the hobbling economy, the unstable government -- can only begin with a look at the past. 
Argentina was a colonial backwater in the 16th through the 18th centuries, when all legal regional commerce with the Spanish motherland passed through distant Lima, Peru, the colonial capital for southern South America. That left Argentines far from the main trade routes, and Buenos Aires, the capital, got its start as a smuggler's port. 
Making get-rich-quick deals, evading taxes and paying off corrupt customs officials became standard operating procedure, and remain so.
Even today, few Argentine companies have gone public because executives are reluctant to open their books to regulators who might question their tax receipts.
The Buenos Aires stock exchange rarely does more than $15 million in stock trading volume a day, limiting foreign capital flow into local companies. This was true even in recent years, when the last government of President Carlos Saul Menem sold off much of the state to foreign, particularly Spanish, enterprises. 
Much of that money ended up in the pockets of government officials rather than going toward social services, as a series of recent corruption investigations have shown.
Paltry tax revenues have expanded government deficits and debts. So have free spending and an inefficient government that divides overlapping responsibilities between Buenos Aires and the 24 provinces.
The cumbersome division of powers is the product of a series of indecisive 19th civil wars, and it has contributed to the creation of more than $152 billion in central government and provincial debts. 
Mr. De la Rua's predecessor, Mr. Menem, said he would change all that. He privatized, deregulated and pegged the value of the peso to the dollar.
For a while the strategy worked spectacularly. Annual inflation dropped from the thousands of percent to nearly zero. Between 1991 and 1997, the gross domestic product grew by 52 percent, as $13 billion in foreign investment poured in.
But Mr. Menem and Mr. De la Rua after him used the currency peg as a crutch. With no inflation, there was no need to balance budgets to keep interest rates down, and government deficits skyrocketed. Meanwhile, as the dollar grew stronger, Argentine products became even more uncompetitive on world markets. 
Now unemployment has risen to one in five workers. The current recession is nearly four years old, and it is deepening. If the government defaults on its debts and devalues its currency, as most economists expect, things probably will only get worse and the national decay of the last seven decades will continue.

HEADLINE: After Twists Of a Novel, Congress Goes Home 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Congress snarled its way out of town today, after a session as remarkable for its mood swings as the laws it passed but ending with dramatic inaction on the economy.
 Although the first midsession switch of control of the Senate in history slowed legislative action, the first session of the 107th Congress passed more legislation than first sessions usually do. That record was spurred by a rare month of bipartisanship after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 But the mood evaporated, and now lawmakers look toward a second session dominated by tight spending decisions, as looming deficits replace the land of plenty they thought they had in 2001. Next year will also be colored by midterm Congressional elections, bound to be bitter since control of each house is shaky. 
But it is unlikely that things will change as often as they did in 2001. Ross Baker, a Congressional scholar at Rutgers University, said that observing Congress this year was like "watching a play in which they are constantly replacing the leads with understudies."
"You don't know if you're watching Shakespeare or Strindberg -- or sometimes the Marx Brothers," Mr. Baker said.
This session could be measured in four chapters. At the outset, Republicans basked in controlling the presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower was president. 
Their major accomplishment was a $1.3 trillion tax cut, President Bush's first priority, which they passed in May, and they seemed poised to do much more, confident that budget surpluses could pay the bills. Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the majority whip, called on Republicans to push their own agenda, not compromise.
But time ran out suddenly. Republican control of a Senate divided 50-50 was tenuous, and in June Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont startled his colleagues by leaving the Republican Party to become an independent, caucusing with the Democrats and giving them control. 
From June to September Congress buzzed with talk of a Democratic agenda, and the Senate passed a strong patients' bill of rights. In the House a campaign finance measure banning the unrestricted donations known as soft money seemed close to final passage in July.
The terrorist attacks ended that chapter and dashed Democratic hopes, while opening a third phase, as the parties worked together to a degree unseen for decades. Congress passed a use-of-force resolution, an airline bailout, a vast increase in federal criminal powers against terrorism and money-laundering, and after weeks of squabbling, a bill enhancing airport security. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, called that period of cooperation "the pinnacle of our legislative achievement."
But for politicians used to condemning each other over basic economic differences, bipartisan cooperation proved an unnatural act, and it dissolved in October. The basic party differences overcame efforts to adopt an economic stimulus bill and a measure to protect insurance companies against potentially enormous bills for terrorist attacks.
Oct. 10 probably marks the end of the honeymoon. That was when Representative Bill Thomas of California, the combative chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, announced that he was abandoning bipartisan talks on a stimulus and would draft a Republican bill. 
In this last chapter, the only major measure salvaged was an overhaul of federal aid to education, which involved billions more for poor children and annual testing to see if the money was doing any good. 
The bill, Mr. Bush's other top priority, was nurtured yearlong with a degree of bipartisanship and compromise seen nowhere else but in the legislation that followed the terrorist attacks. The president made allies of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative George Miller of California, the leading Democrats on education. Hailing the cooperation that brought agreement as the bill was passed last week, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said the process was "marked by the courage of legislators on both sides of the aisle to challenge conventional thinking and party orthodoxy for the sake of meaningful change."
Because of the coup that brought Mr. Jeffords into a Democratic majority, and even the 50-50 party split beforehand, the Senate attracted more attention than the House. 
But the reality was that the steadiness and effectiveness of House Republicans was even more notable. With a slim majority that meant six defections could bring defeat, House Republicans lost only one vote all year -- a July procedural vote on campaign finance that they were perfectly willing to lose since that meant the bill could be put off.
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, outgeneraled the Democrats at every battle and boasted that he never lost a vote that he tried to win. And while Democrats had no trouble breaking with President Bill Clinton in his first year, Republicans stuck with Mr. Bush in 2001. He lobbied effectively when asked but also had good will behind him.
Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, said in May, "It's very important to us to make him succeed."
When Congress returns next month, it will inevitably start a fifth chapter, conditioned less by the strength of the parties than by the weakness of the economy. Where last spring's budget resolution found lots of money for tax cuts, farm aid, education and even an expansion of federally aided health care, next year's will see a return to the deficit financing that posed hard choices for Congress in the 80's and 90's. 
Mr. Daschle said on Thursday, "All of the domestic priorities that we care a great deal about are usually the first to be put on the table when cuts need to be made."
On their way out of town, House Republicans joined in a chorus of complaint about Senate inaction, not just on the economic stimulus and insurance protection, but on President Bush's religion-based initiative, farm legislation and a ban on human cloning. While some of his colleagues personalized the issue by calling Mr. Daschle names, most commonly an obstructionist, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said on Thursday, "The biggest disappointment I have has been the lack of being able to see our bills taken up and passed by the Senate."
That is a two-party street, of course. It takes 60 votes, not 51, to get most bills passed in the Senate these days, and if Democrats stalled the cloning ban, Republicans blocked the farm bill. President Bush and his House backers contended this week that if only the Senate would vote, a stimulus bill they backed would get a majority. Perhaps, but the only stimulus bill the Senate voted on had 50 backers and 48 opponents, and that was not enough to get it through procedural thickets that would also have confronted the president's bill.
But second sessions are usually more productive. When elections loom, incumbents usually want to be able to say they have accomplished something. Big-money items like a prescription drug benefit for the elderly are unlikely, but the patients' bill of rights, which languished in a House-Senate conference this fall, could re-emerge if President Bush seeks action. An increase in the minimum wage could become a priority for Senate Democrats, and voting against it is hard in an election year. 
Still, as Senator Nickles noted, once-cooperative Senate committees like Finance and Agriculture are now passing major bills on party-line votes, which means they are instantly in trouble on the floor.

(Associated Press) Chart: "AGENDA -- To Bipartisanship And Back Again"A look at what the first session of the 107th Congress passed and what awaits further action. PASSEDTAX CUT: Lowers taxes by $1.3 trillion over the next decade by cutting tax rates, doubling the child credit, reducing the estate tax and providing relief to married couples. EDUCATION: Sharply increases federal aid to schools with large numbers of poor students and requires annual testing in reading and math. RELATED TO SEPT. 11 ATTACKSUSE OF FORCE: Authorizes President Bush to use "all necessary and appropriate force" against nations, organizations or individuals who were involved in acts of terrorism or harbored people who were involved. DOMESTIC DEFENSE: Provides $40 billion in emergency spending, earmarking $8.3 billion for domestic security and $8.2 billion to help recovery in New York. ANTITERROR BILL: Expands the government's surveillance and detention powers and its ability to penetrate money-laundering banks. AIRLINE BAILOUT: Provides $15 billion to compensate airlines for grounding of flights and drop in passengers after terrorist attacks and provides that victims may collect benefits from the federal government without going to court. AIRPORT SECURITY: Requires the government to hire about 30,000 airport screeners and to inspect all checked baggage. UNFINISHEDSTIMULUS: The two parties could not agree on a recession fighting package, with Republicans pushing tax cuts for businesses and middle- and upper-income people and Democrats insisting on extending unemployment insurance and providing health insurance for those laid off their jobs. INSURANCE: Legislation to provide billions in government loans to the insurance industry to cover potential losses from future terrorist attacks passed the House, but the Senate version did not come to the floor for a vote. ENERGY: The House approved a plan to encourage energy production that included allowing drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; the Senate did not act on a bill. FARM: The House passed a $170 billion 10-year farm bill that added billions to current crop subsidies, but Republicans effectively killed the Democratic version of the bill in the Senate, which gave more money to conservation and environmental programs. PATIENTS' RIGHTS: The House and Senate both passed versions of a patients' bill of rights, guaranteeing certain medical services, but did not compromise on a final measure. CAMPAIGN FINANCE: The Senate approved a bill to overhaul the nation's campaign finance law, including a ban on the large unrestricted political contributions known as soft money, but the House did not act. RELIGIOUS CHARITIES: The House passed a bill that expanded federal social service funds to religious groups, but the Senate did not act.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: France: Economic Standstill Expected 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Economic growth in France is expected to slow nearly to a standstill as the new year begins, the government statistics institute said. 
In its latest economic report, the institute projected growth of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001 followed by an identical rise in the first quarter of 2002. The institute said the slowdown was because of the global downturn, with recessions under way in the United States and Japan. But it forecast the French economy will grow 0.5 percent in the second quarter of 2002.

HEADLINE: Here's a Big Surprise for Boss Tweed, Wherever He May Be 

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
The newly renovated former New York County Courthouse -- generally referred to as the Tweed Courthouse -- opened its doors yesterday for a celebratory ceremony, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani welcomed the building's new tenant, the Museum of the City of New York. 
 The museum is not scheduled to move from its home at 1220 Fifth Avenue to the new space, on Chambers Street just north of City Hall, until the spring of 2004. By then another $40 million will probably be spent to adapt the building to its new purposes, above the estimated $85 million that the current renovation has already cost. 
 Robert R. Macdonald, the museum's director, said there was a possibility that beginning next April there would be a special temporary exhibition in the courthouse dealing with the attack on the World Trade Center. 
From the outside, with its broad granite steps and Corinthian columns, the palatial structure brightens Chambers Street. Inside there is a soaring skylighted rotunda looking down on broad open spaces. Mr. Macdonald said that when he first visited the site, "it was a rabbit warren of city offices." Now, it is a series of vast, high-ceilinged rooms, a basilica silently awaiting exhibitions.
The courthouse is a monumental structure built between 1862 and 1878 for more than $13 million paid by the city of New York. In a fraudulent scheme, a great deal of the money was rechanneled back to Boss Tweed, the notorious politician, and his friends in the Democratic machine at Tammany Hall. Among the many charges, $133,187 was paid to Tweed's plasterer for two days' work and $400,000 for safes.
Throughout its history, the site has been plagued by ghosts of its various incarnations. In the early 1800's it was the location of the city almshouse, converted in 1816 to the city's first cultural center. Through the latter half of the 19th century the land was occupied by the Tweed Courthouse. After 1916 the building housed government offices. In recent years it had fallen into disrepair and has been considered a white elephant adjacent to City Hall. Several speakers at the ceremony yesterday referred to the renovation as "an exorcism," finding a certain irony in the fact that such "a cursed building" would now be a museum honoring the city of New York.
Attending the breakfast ceremony were city officials, museum trustees and guests including the writers Louis Auchincloss and Frank McCourt.
After depicting the courthouse's history as an icon of Tammany Hall, Mayor Giuliani said that the renovation would "purify the building and remove the stench of Boss Tweed and corruption." He said "nobody hated Tammany Hall more than Fiorello LaGuardia," and added that he was sure LaGuardia thought about tearing down the courthouse. He indicated that it had been partly exorcised by the fact that Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees had visited it for meetings on four occasions in recent years.
The Mayor remembered walking through the structure in 1993, soon after his inauguration. "The building was in terrible, terrible shape," he said. "We met two rats, my first acquaintance with anyone from city government." 
Calling the Museum of the City of New York "a truly historic museum," he said that among other things, in its new location it would house tapes and interviews dealing with the attack on the twin towers. He said that the museum would now "take on dramatic and vital significance: it has become part of how we memorialize the World Trade Center." 
He added that on Sept. 11, before the attack occurred, he was headed toward the courthouse for a meeting about the renovation.
The renovation began in 1999. When it was announced last year that the museum was going to be the new occupant, there was some criticism that the shift would have a debilitating economic effect on East Harlem and other neighborhoods near the Fifth Avenue location. It is at the northern end of the city's Museum Mile, on the corner of East 103rd Street. In defense of the move, officials of the museum said the courthouse location was more accessible to mass transit and would double the exhibition space. Both buildings are owned by the city.
Mayor Giuliani and Mr. Macdonald both emphasized the fact that the move would now help to revitalize Lower Manhattan. Mr. Macdonald said that in City Hall Park the museum would continue to carry out its role as "a center of learning and a quality cultural attraction" and would now have a new role at the core of the city's civic center.
Renovations included repairing the columns and cornices, replacing the roof, replicating chandeliers and sconces and restoring courtrooms to their original shape.
Leading a tour of the building, Mr. Macdonald said that the ground floor would have a restaurant, a visitors' center, an auditorium for the museum's various literary and musical programs and a retail shop. Moving up the cast-iron staircase, he said that the second floor would have the main exhibition rooms, with a chronological historical portrait of the city from Dutch days to what he referred to as "the city of tomorrow." 
On the third floor will be the historical research library and special exhibitions, like the one currently at the Fifth Avenue location: "Al Hirschfeld's New York," a major show of the artist's drawings of the city and its cultural life. Next month, there will also be an exhibition on Manhattan skylines from the late 19th century through Sept. 11.
The Museum of the City of New York was founded in 1923 and was first situated in Gracie Mansion. In 1932 it moved to Fifth Avenue. There are 1.5 million items in its collection spanning 400 years of New York City history: theatrical memorabilia, documents, photographs, prints and drawings. These and other treasures will presumably be more easily available to the public when the institution moves downtown.

HEADLINE: Black Leaders Are Pleased To Be Courted By Bloomberg 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Assemblyman Carl E. Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, tells the story about having called Michael R. Bloomberg within a week of the election that made the billionaire businessman the successor to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Heastie said he had called only to leave a message with a secretary congratulating Mr. Bloomberg on his victory. 
 But, Mr. Heastie said, he was stunned when the mayor-elect, overhearing his secretary taking the message, picked up the phone himself and began chatting with the first-term assemblyman. 
 "We had a very nice, cordial conversation," Mr. Heastie said. "He told me that he would like to get together sometime and talk about the issues that are of the most importance to the people in my district."
He said he was flabbergasted by the mayor-elect's overture, especially in light of the fact, Mr. Heastie said, that he had not had a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Giuliani since being elected to the Assembly a year ago. "I was surprised and pleased. I never got the impression that Giuliani paid that much attention to my community."
It is a refrain spoken frequently these days by many black elected officials -- all of them Democrats -- who, like Mr. Heastie, are finding themselves consulted and courted by the Republican mayor-elect. While Mr. Giuliani was highly popular in some sectors of New York City, he has not had a particularly warm relationship with the city's black elected officials. 
And black elected officials say that Mr. Bloomberg's demeanor is a refreshing change of pace from their experiences with Mr. Giuliani, who, they contend, seldom if ever met with black elected officials.
"The mayor-elect and I have had a lengthy one-on-one meeting since the election," said Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens who is also the chairman of the Council of Black Elected Democrats in New York. "And we've had several conversations on the phone already."
Mr. Meeks said that he and Mr. Bloomberg have spoken at great length about the need for further economic development in Queens and problems in education in his Congressional district.
When asked how many times he had met with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Meeks said, "Well let me think for a minute. Try zero." Then he added, "if you want to know how many I've talked to Giuliani on the phone, let's see. Try zero."
Conversations with several black elected officials reveal similar stories of how Mr. Bloomberg either called them or intercepted their calls to him. In each case, the mayor-elect has asked for meetings with the various officials. 
And many say it is an almost shocking contrast with the tenure of Mr. Giuliani, who made headlines two years ago by announcing that he would meet with the state's highest-ranking black elected official, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, after shunning the comptroller's requests for meetings for five years.
Several officials explain that Mr. Bloomberg is riding into office in the aftermath of a highly charged election in which many black and Latino elected officials felt alienated from the Democratic candidate, Mark Green, the public advocate. In that election, Mr. Bloomberg received about a quarter of the black vote, compared with the less than 10 percent of the black vote Mr. Giuliani received in 1993.
Moreover, Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, came to office after an election in 1993 that was very much divided along racial lines, in which he defeated the city's first black mayor, David N. Dinkins.
Furthermore, Mr. Bloomberg's aides contend that there is no down side to being more aggressive in meeting with black elected officials, pointing out that as a businessman without a great deal of political experience or baggage, Mr. Bloomberg has little to lose, and everything to gain, by reaching out more assertively than Mr. Giuliani. 
So far, it seems the strategy is yielding dividends. 
Mr. Meeks said that he and the Council of Black Elected Democrats are planning a reception within weeks of the inauguration at which Mr. Bloomberg would be the guest of honor. They hope to help him become better acquainted with various officials. 
That Mr. Bloomberg is already receiving high marks from black elected officials is clear not only from those with whom he has met in the last few weeks. He has also been praised for his selection of Dennis Walcott, longtime leader of the New York Urban League, who is widely described as being a respected figure among black New Yorkers.
Even the Rev. Al Sharpton, the one-time mayoral candidate and frequent Giuliani critic, said that he has been impressed with the mayor-elect's performance, a function in part of Mr. Bloomberg's having agreed to be photographed with Mr. Sharpton.
"The signal so far is that there is going to be access," Mr. Sharpton said. "Now, whether access leads to action remains to be seen."
"But clearly, in a transition period of one month, there has been more outreach to the black community than in eight years under Giuliani."

 BODY:
 The Transfer of Power

A FRESH START -- Some 100 days after the terror attacks on America turned the world's attention to Afghanistan and launched a bombing campaign to topple the Taliban, Afghans prepared to install an interim government they hope will prove historic by ending 22 years of war. A1

STATUS QUO -- Despite the fall of the Taliban, no woman in the southern Afghan city of Karzis is likely to leave her house without a head-to-toe burka and no girl is likely to go to school. Representative of the deeply conservative Pashtun culture, the city is also home of the Karzai family and of Hamid Karzai, who becomes the leader of the interim government today. B1

The Hunt for Al Qaeda

THE MARINES -- The United States marines in Afghanistan have not directly engaged the enemy force on force. Instead, they have been used for quick, stealthy reconnaissance and raids. Now, at a time when nimbleness may count as much as firepower, the marines are being asked to prepare to root out the last pockets of Al Qaeda fighters, said to number between 300 and 1,000, in the ravines and caves outside of Tora Bora. B1

MORE TROOPS -- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he was ordering more American troops to search the caves of Tora Bora, and described the effort as critically important for capturing die-hard Al Qaeda members, seizing their weapons and uncovering intelligence on terror attacks now being planned. B2

IN MOGADISHU -- The Somali police arrested four Iraqi Kurds and one Palestinian for questioning over possible links to Al Qaeda or other extremist groups. The police said the men appeared to have entered Somalia without permission. B3

Threats, Home and Abroad

THE WALKER CASE -- President Bush directly linked John Walker, the American who was captured in Afghanistan, with Al Qaeda, as administration officials said Mr. Walker would probably face at least one charge that carries the death penalty. That would give the government more leverage to negotiate with Mr. Walker's lawyers. A1

A WARNING -- An instructor at a Minnesota flight school warned the F.B.I. in August of his suspicion that a student might be planning to use a commercial plane loaded with fuel as a weapon, a member of Congress and other officials said. The officials, who were briefed by the flight school, said the instructor had warned the F.B.I. in urgent tones about the threat posed by the student, Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Morrocan descent who was indicted last week on charges of conspiring in the terror attacks. B1

CONGRESS -- In the final hours before adjourning for the year, Congress took action on measures to combat bioterrorism, to protect the food supply and to increase security at seaports and nuclear power plants and along the nation's borders. B4

THE INTERVIEWS -- As the Justice Department's deadline for interviewing thousands of young foreign men about the terror attacks passed, officials said about half of the 5,146 visitors wanted for questioning had provided information, and that the controversial canvass had turned up at least two leads in the investigation. It appears that hundreds of the people on the list have not been found, in some cases because they have returned home. B4

BAIL DENIED -- A Pakistani man who prosecutors say may have links to the hijackers was denied bond pending his sentencing for voter fraud. A federal magistrate in Winston-Salem, N.C., ordered that the man, Imtiaz Ahmed Siddiqui, be held until his sentencing in March. B4

The Anthrax Investigation

WASHINGTON AND BAGHDAD -- Shortly after the first anthrax victim died in October, the Bush administration began an intense effort to link Iraq to the attacks and continued to do so even after scientists determined that the lethal germ was an American strain. But scientists and government officials said the largely secret work had found no evidence to back up the initial suspicions, which is one reason administration officials have said recently that the source of the anthrax was most likely domestic. A1

HOAXES AND THREATS -- A postal worker accused of scrawling a note about anthrax on a package as a joke was one of 58 people arrested nationwide and charged with anthrax hoaxes or threats since the anthrax scare began. B5

IMMUNIZATIONS -- Many postal workers at the New Jersey center where at least four anthrax-tainted letters were processed are not interested in being vaccinated, despite a suggestion from federal health officials that those at a high risk of exposure to the bacteria consider being immunized. B5

Relations in Asia

INDIA AND PAKISTAN -- India recalled its ambassador to Pakistan and ended bus and train service between the two nations to protest what it called Pakistan's failure to shut down two Pakistan-based groups that India has accused of carrying out a suicide attack on Parliament last week. Pakistan said it would not recall its ambassador to New Delhi and again denied any role in sponsoring terrorism against India. A1

THE KOREAS -- The South Korean government said it had canceled the alert placed on its troops at the outset of the war in Afghanistan, removing a prime obstacle to dialogue with North Korea. A5

ISLAMABAD ACTS -- Pakistan intends to follow Washington's lead and freeze the assets of two Islamic charities that were added to the United States' list of foreign terrorist organizations on Thursday. B3

Aftermath of the Attack

A GIFT -- Four firefighters and two police officers from New York City -- including one who lost his brother in the trade center attack -- delivered 90,000 pounds of food and blankets to an orphanage in Kabul. The expedition was intended to show Afghans the humane side of America, but also to raise the morale of United States soldiers there. B3

THE MEMORIAL -- A city still in shock has managed to create a quiet, dignified approach to what is now historic ground, as construction begins on the first of four public viewing platforms proposed for the perimeter of ground zero. B8

VICTIMS COMPENSATION -- Faced with widespread protests that he has been stingy, Kenneth R. Feinberg, who is in charge of the federal fund for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, urged disappointed families to seek a hearing before the fund to argue for larger compensation awards. B8

HATE CRIMES -- Complaints to the New York Police Department of hate crimes against Arab-Americans and Muslims have dropped sharply since the trade center attack, falling to less than one incident a week in the last month compared with 39 in the week ending Sept. 22. B8

HOLIDAY TRAVEL -- Air traffic this Christmas season is expected to be down 15 percent to 20 percent from last year, partly because of safety concerns after the terror attacks, and partly because of the weak economy. But the check-in lines are significantly longer -- up to three hours in Los Angeles, for example -- because of new security regimens. A12

HEADLINE: APPEARANCES; 
Selling Indulgences

BYLINE:  By Mary Tannen 

 BODY:
Along with everyone else this fall, I was unable to shop. Seeing thousand-dollar hand-painted mink-trimmed jeans in a store window made me cross the street. Planning Christmas gifts, I couldn't get past sturdy sneakers with Velcro straps.
 Buyers were not buying; sellers were not selling. The press offices of the beauty industry, normally all bubble and hum, were silent, as if everyone had suddenly lost sight of the importance of styling mousse and lip gloss. 
 Into this vacuum slid a narrow volume bound in black watered silk embossed in gold letters: "Clive Christian, the World's Most Expensive Perfume." I stared at the marbled endpapers, the etchings of women in Grecian attire, the glossy close-up of a crystal bottle. Obviously this book had fallen through a space-time wormhole and was coming to me from a parallel universe. Or, if not another universe, just another country. There was a letter from a publicist in England: Clive Christian would be in New York for a few days; would I like to meet him?
The meeting, at Cipriani in the Sherry Netherland Hotel, was breakfast, at my request. The publicist back in London had been perfectly happy with the hour; Clive Christian, drinking black coffee in the dim reaches of the restaurant, was less so. He wasn't used to talking this early in the morning, let alone to the press. In fact, he wasn't convinced that he should be talking to the press at all. "This might be one of the very few times that I surface," he offered.
Athletic and slender, he was dressed in black and evenly tanned with a two-day beard, and he made me think more of a Riviera cat burglar than the name behind the World's Most Expensive Perfume. Allowing only that he was from a "design background," Christian said that his ambition was to make his name "a generic for fabulous British products." Like Hermes in France. His first product was ornate cabinetry, which he displays from a showroom on Madison Avenue, where model kitchens are so embellished with cornices and balustrades that you can hardly find the sink, but when you do, the drain is gold-plated. 
"Two or more years ago," Christian said, he bought two old English perfume houses that had been supplying "the royals for yonks." Although his bottles are topped with replicas of Queen Victoria's crown, the formulas are new -- the old scents were terrible," he said -- and contain only natural ingredients: "You don't get a great waft of chemical perfume." The fragrances are available in perfume only, no cologne -- the Rolls-Royce but not the town car."
It must be difficult, I said, to establish a luxury brand when even the giants are reporting sales dips. Christian waved away my concerns. "Recessions come and go, but if you're the best in your field, you walk past that. Our sales are remarkable."
Soon after, I had lunch at the Four Seasons Hotel with Lyn Leigh, a publicist for Creme de la Mer. She had sent me -- just to look at -- a 16.5-ounce jar of the cream, complete with a sterling-silver tray and spoon selling exclusively at Neiman Marcus, this Christmas, for $1,200. Creme de la Mer is a fluffy, white cream invented, literally, by a rocket scientist, Max Huber, who cooked it up out of seaweed to treat his own face, scarred by a chemical explosion. Estee Lauder bought the formula from his heirs in 1996 and put the cream into select distribution for what was a stunning price then: $150. (It is now $165 for a two-ounce jar.)
Leigh, who is English, has the preternaturally clear, unlined and deeply moisturized complexion that is the trademark of every Lauder employee. When I mentioned the $1,200 jar, she gave a delicate wince. It was in production last summer, and initially she didn't have the heart to promote it. The big jar sans tray is more widely available for $1,000 and does very well, she told me. "Women buy it for themselves."
Afterward, I stopped in at Bergdorf's cosmetics department. The place was jumping. At Creme de la Mer, sales were good; ditto at Cle de Peau Beaute, a luxury division of Shiseido. Its face cream, called La Creme, was selling briskly for $450 an ounce. There were no spritzers at Clive Christian's counter. A saleswoman came out with scent strips -- three for men, three for women -- that were indeed subtle, not like the heady, complex mixes I associate with fine perfume. 1872 and X are $595 for an ounce and a half; No. 1, with a real diamond set into the bottle's neck, is $1,820. There was no scent strip for the $12,000 special edition, which has even more diamonds. No matter. The perfumes had sold out.
Looking around at the scores of platinum credit cards flashing in the light, I concluded that Clive Christian's vision had extended further and deeper than mine. He had been able to see beyond the epiphenomenal shopper's malaise to the enduring human capacity for self-indulgence. I wonder if it's too late to place an order with Neiman Marcus. . . .

HEADLINE: The Cult 

BYLINE:  By Jim Nelson; Jim Nelson is a writer and editor for GQ.

 BODY:
In Northern California this September, wine lovers and merchants were speaking secretively and longingly about a new wine -- said to be sublime but impossible to find in stores -- called Merus Cabernet Sauvignon. Some described Merus as "the next cult wine." Cult wines, I knew, were serious things, highly sought after beverages of unquestionable quality and rarity. So, hoping to see a state-of-the-art wine production facility, I drove out to Napa to find this Merus vineyards.
 Well, there were no vineyards. There were only the suburbs. The directions led not to Napa Valley but to the town of Napa. Instead of rolling hills and idyllic trellises, there were middle-class houses and fenced yards, Volvos and Nissans parked neatly out front. 
 Then I spotted it: in front of one perfectly ordinary house sat an unhitched trailer bed that had gone blotchy and purple with grape stains. I parked, got out and snooped around. In the backyard, where other families might put a small basketball hoop, sat an industrial grape-destemming machine, looking like some alien forklift. Behind it, the garage was taken over by a clutter of barrels and tubes, with jugs of wine on the shelves -- remnants, it seemed, of some illicit Prohibitionist activity. 
I went around and knocked on the front door, and a woman answered and said, yes, I had found my way. She opened her arms, motioned me into the living room and said, "Welcome to the winery."
Erika Gottl and Mark Herold are trying to make the next cult wine. They are assisted in this endeavor by their dog, Calypso, a wolf hybrid that paces the house as if she were quietly looking for the moon. Otherwise, they are on their own. Just the two of them, married to themselves and their grapes.
They do not own a vineyard. They do not have any ranch hands here in suburbia. But somehow they are managing -- brilliantly. In its very first vintage, Merus has become a hit. The 1998 cabernet sauvignon, released this year, won rave reviews from wine critics, especially the critic who matters most, Robert Parker Jr. Merus is already on the wine lists of exclusive restaurants like the French Laundry in Napa Valley and Charlie Trotter's in Chicago. Like every cult wine, it can't be found in your corner liquor store. Gottl and Herold sell most of their wine through a mailing list. And though Merus goes for $85 a bottle, there is no more of the '98 cabernet to speak of. 
"It's gone," Gottl says. "Sold out really quickly."
Gottl and Herold run a streamlined operation. He's more the grape man -- a trained oenologist who still consults at the venerable Joseph Phelps winery. She's more the business side. She licensed and bonded the house as a winery and ships the wine herself. She is superfriendly with her U.P.S. man. "This is mom and pop, O.K.?" she says, pointing to her husband and herself. "However, nobody really knows that, and we try and compete with the big boys."
Gottl and Herold made only 230 cases or so of the first vintage of Merus. They get their grapes from local vineyard owners, mostly retirees who have an acre or two of prime grape-growing land. They are fixated on quality, and their work ethic seems to know no limits or time constraints. Both often wake up at 5:30 in the morning just to go out in the backyard and "punch down," or stir up, a giant vat of fermenting grapes.
"Everything," Gottl says, "has to be perfect all the time."
Cult wines are a curious window on the wine world. They are both fetish objects and works of genuine hard-bitten labor. They are wonderful to drink and impossible to have. They are a measure of the giant leaps in quality that American winemaking has made in recent years and a gauge of how overblown the wine market has become.
Though they have inspired imitators in other countries, cult wines are uniquely American -- or, more precisely, Californian. The trend centers on an obsessive group of winemakers who produce picayune quantities of very high quality wine, usually cabernet sauvignon. The cult club is small: people in the wine business say, variously, that there are only 7 or 9 or 10 or 11 established cult producers. But all admit that they have an influence beyond their size -- thanks in large part to Parker, who has lavished them with high ratings. (The names of the major culties that get floated about usually include Harlan Estate, Screaming Eagle, Bryant Family, Grace Family, Colgin Cellars, Dalla Valle, Araujo Estate, Abreu and, to a lesser degree, Marcassin, Williams Selyem and Behrens & Hitchcock.)
All fetch what used to be considered outrageous prices. Most of the wines are sold, like Merus, only through mailing lists, and though high, the prices are actually in the neighborhood of the finest French Bordeaux, even a little less expensive. It's the secondary market where the prices really get out of hand. Until the economy started to soften, bottles of Harlan and Screaming Eagle were routinely selling for $1,000 to $1,500 at Internet auction sites. Now these wines can be had for a more "reasonable" $400 to $600.
What has survived from the boom times is an ever growing appreciation of wine. Americans are, more than ever, into wine -- into the swirl and smell of it, into wine bars and "29 wines by the glass." The numbers reflect the infatuation: sales of wine in the United States have increased steadily for the last decade, rising to $19 billion in 2000 from $10.9 billion in 1991. Interestingly, Americans aren't drinking more -- unit sales have remained relatively stable -- but they are spending more on wine. The only sector of the market that is tanking is the cheap stuff, all those jugs of Gallo that sit, unloved, in supermarket aisles. Meanwhile the high end is flourishing. 
California's emergence as a world-class wine producer has a lot to do with it. The state got its first real international recognition way back in 1976 when a bottle of Stag's Leap cabernet won a blind tasting at a wine competition in Paris. But it is only in the last decade that California producers fully shook off their inferiority complex and started to remake the business in their own way, investing in new technology and making ever more premium wines. Cult wines are the leading edge of this phenomenon.
The most striking aspect of the big cult wines is how similar they are. Nearly all are made in a very specific style. They're big, assertive, highly fruit-extracted, the very sort that American wine critics and enthusiasts have come to look for over the years. This is now known variously as the California style or, in a nod to the critic, the Parker style, and it has actually spread back to France. Small-scale vintners there known as garagistes (a reference to the dusty, romantic garages they presumably work out of) have begun to make big, assertive American-style wines -- and to earn high ratings from critics, particularly Parker. Some of the garagistes don't work out of garages at all but out of the west wings of chateaus. It hardly matters. Like the culties, they make highly extracted red wines in small batches, and like the culties, their wines can cost you $200 or more.
For both the garagistes and the cult winemakers, limited production is the vital factor: something they can brag about, but not a mere gesture. Limiting the yields of vineyards allows vintners to concentrate their fruit, which brings more flavor to the table -- that California style.
There is no better place to see this in action, indeed to see the full realization of an American cult wine, than where the original one was created, Harlan Estate, all 240 acres (36 of them cultivated) staring benevolently down at Napa Valley like Corcovado in Rio. Everything about the place suggests a Big Plan, a group of ideas set in motion years ago and only now being harvested.
Bill Harlan, 61-year-old dreamer who used to spend his money on racing cars and yachts, bought these hills with the fortune he made in land speculation in the 1970's and 80's. Back in the 80's, hilly property in California was not widely used for grape growing. But Harlan and his team studied the traits of the great wines of the world -- he is that type, the kind of guy who bungee-jumps but studies the rope first -- and found that slopes make the best wine. It's just harder to get to the grapes.
Harlan and his winemaker, Bob Levy, knew they needed to make a splash with their first vintage. So they held back the first three they produced; that is, they made wines every year from 1987 to 1989 but never released them. "They just weren't of the caliber that we felt we could come out with and make a statement," Levy says.
The statement they wanted to make, he says, involved putting out wines with intensity, with concentration, as well as a supple finish. The trick -- and it is a trick that winemakers have learned all over the globe in recent years, in part inspired by Parker's love of "fruit bombs" -- is to first limit the yield. This is counterintuitive, since the traditional goal of agriculture is to eke ever more out of the land. But the new thinking is that if you have four grape clusters feeding off the same cane, or shoot, of a vine, getting rid of two clusters will produce more flavor in the others. This is the brutal quandary of modern winemaking: deciding which grapes get to live and which get sacrificed to the greater good. When I walked through the fields that had yet to be picked at Harlan, I noticed that in some places Levy and his team left only one cluster where other winemakers would have allowed three or four.
The other trick is one that may seem obvious but hasn't been clear to winemakers until recently: picking the grapes when they are fully ripe. Harvest day is the most significant day of the year for a winemaker. After that, he's stuck with what he has -- whatever qualities and flavors the fruit evinces. In the early days of California winemaking up through the 1980's, grapes were picked automatically if they reached a certain sugar level -- gauged with an instrument called a refractometer -- but that didn't necessarily guarantee ripeness. It could result in underripe, unimpressive wines that couldn't stand up by themselves. Of course, most people didn't really notice. The wines seemed to fit the taste of the time. "In the 80's," Levy says, "a lot of the wines were made with the concept that Mondavi" -- the winemaker Robert Mondavi -- proposed as 'food wines,' which were really picked early, underripe, too low in maturity."
It has been only recently that winemakers, prodded by Parker, have realized that sugar levels don't tell the whole story. Even after reaching a certain sweetness, grapes need "hang time," their moment in the sun. Much of their flavor is sealed in the last waning days of summer sunlight. Winemakers have realized that to make bigger, more expressive wines, they need to let the grapes hang in the ripening sun longer (but not so long that they become overripe or, if the rains get to them, soggy and vegetal). California, where the growing season is long and the sun plentiful, is perfect for this. In France, by contrast, the wine-growing regions are situated at more northern latitudes than in California, and some vintages never attain full ripeness.
Levy expends a great deal of energy on the ripeness question, going out into the fields and tasting grapes by rows. Levy touches them, smells them, searches for signs of veraision (color change) and pops them into his mouth.
Harlan grapes, like the grapes at almost all wineries, are hand-sorted and go through a destemming machine on their way to the fermenting tanks. But Levy adds his own unique step. He sets up a conveyor belt between the two operations and instructs his fieldworkers to sift through the grapes one more time. The grapes get flung out onto the moving belt, allowing the workers to nab any stems the machine didn't catch. Does it make a difference? Who knows. Levy says that catching those few errant stems might remove a whiff of bitterness in the final product. "Anything we can do to make the wine a little bit better," he says, "I'm committed to doing." 
And what of the final wines? Parker gave both the 1994 and 1997 Harlan Estate a whopping 100 points, two of the dozen or so in his career that he has awarded a perfect score. Once a wine is anointed like that by Parker, collectors and wine lovers scramble to purchase whatever they can get their hands on. They seek out the gray market, driving up prices at auction. The wine sells out before it even hits the shelves. (Harlan Estate, like a classic first-growth Bordeaux, now sells its wine as "futures," meaning people on the mailing list buy it a year before it is even available.)
When I asked Harlan what would happen if Parker suddenly gave him a mediocre score, like, say, 87, he blanched -- what kind of madness was I speaking? -- then said, "Well, I wouldn't like it." Would he change the way Harlan Estate makes its wine? He and Levy would go back and taste the wines, try to figure out why they didn't please Parker. But, no, he said, he would go on making wines the way he feels is right.
The truth of the matter is that the cult wineries have Parker figured out. They are absolutely making better wines than they used to -- it isn't a mere paint-by-numbers game -- but they wouldn't be able to sell these wines with the same ease, or the same price tag, if Parker didn't like them. 
Parker admits that his ratings have tremendous influence on the game and professes to be unhappy about it. He laments the phenomenon of collectors "chasing the trophy wines," but he doesn't see a solution. "What do you do about it?" he says with a sigh. "I mean, I'm just not going to refrain my enthusiasm for a wine because I know the impact is going to be significant."
With all the clamor for these cult products, you have to wonder about the potential for abuse -- whether winemakers might be tempted, say, to hold back some of the precious supply for themselves, then sell it on the gray market and take the profit. So far, no one has been caught doing that. But the owner of one prominent, semicult winery says he suspects that some wannabe cult producers lie about how much they make. "A lot of people will tell you they make a tiny amount," the vintner says. "You'll read in the Wine Spectator, 'Only 500 cases made,' but then it's in grocery stores a year later. Sooner or later that's going to backfire."
Rather than play such games, most cult winemakers do things the old-fashioned way: they raise prices. This year, Jean Phillips, proprietor of Screaming Eagle, sent a letter to everyone on her mailing list bemoaning the fact that gray marketeers kept reaping fortunes from her wines. She promptly raised the price of a bottle from $150 to $250. I asked someone on her mailing list, a Sacramento doctor named David Schneider, if that made him rethink his annual purchase. Schneider said the price hike hurt, but he didn't want to lose his chance to buy the wines. "If I don't buy this year," he figured, "I'll probably be taken off the list, and it'll be impossible for me to get on again in the future."
This year, too, Harlan Estate made the jump from $150 to $200 a bottle -- and didn't suffer any attrition.
I had to taste such a thing, so I asked Bill Harlan to oblige me. Standing in his tasting room (it's more like a tasting suite, with a grand piano, a fireplace and a table for 16), I was nervous that I might knock something over: I had the figure $780 burned into my head -- the price for a bottle of Harlan I saw on a wine list at a restaurant in New York. Harlan poured the winery's two great vintages, the '94 and '97. The wines were bold and beautiful, more instantly accessible than a Bordeaux and yet more balanced than the "fruit bomb" I expected. I won't bother to say whether I detected "hints of chocolate" or "vanilla notes," as the argot has it, but I will say that the wines were delicious and that, despite my pleasure, I couldn't help wondering how much each sip cost. Was that a $20 sip? How much would a quaff run me?
These days things can happen fast in California. If a new winemaker sets his mind to it, if he is blessed of good resources, acts accordingly and wins high ratings, he can be an overnight sensation. The crucial step, says Michael Unger, a German importer of Harlan and Merus, is playing to Parker. "I name Parker as an instrument because if you know how to use it, then it works perfectly," he says. "Because if you're doing it right, you can be a superstar in five years."
Harlan Estate, after all, got a perfect score with its '94, its fifth released vintage. But Harlan says it isn't that simple. "We've been doing this for 20 years," he says, speaking of the decades of back work it took him, including acquiring the land for Harlan Estate.
And there is a lot of uncertainty looming ahead. At this point, it is not clear whether many cult wines will last long enough in the cellar to remain superstars. Since it is a new phenomenon, no one knows whether these wines will continue to improve for 15 or 20 years in the bottle, as most collectible Bordeaux will.
For now, most prudent wine producers are taking it one vintage at a time. Over at Merus, Gottl and Herold can use all the help they can get. To my taste, their wines are every bit as good as Harlan's -- similarly balanced, with a bit more spice. Parker gave their 1998 a score of 93 points, an incredible coup for a first vintage. The word arrived just in time. "It was great news," Gottl says, "just a tremendous relief.
"We're still running on a shoestring," she says, since they have to carry the costs of vintages that have yet to be released. "We still have to go beg at the bank. It's very hard, because we don't have deep pockets."
Here's a novel and just idea: perhaps they can take a loan out on a few more Parker points.

Occupancy and Rates Sag at New York Hotels

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
New York's hotel industry, along with the national economy, showed signs of weakness even before the terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. But those attacks plunged New York and large parts of the tristate area into an economic tailspin almost overnight and had a drastic impact on tourism. 
 A record 37.4 million people visited New York in 2000, but 5.4 million fewer will have visited the city by the end of this year, according to projections this month by NYC & Company, New York City's official tourism organization. As a result, New York hotel occupancy this year is expected to plummet to 72.5 percent from last year's record 84.6 percent, according to John Fox, the hotel industry analyst for PKF Consulting. And with at least five major hotels preparing to open next year -- adding a total of more than 2,000 rooms -- Mr. Fox projected that occupancy would fall to 68.5 percent next year. 
 To add to the industry's woes, next year's room rates -- which averaged $237 in 2000 and are expected to average $206 this year -- are forecast by Mr. Fox to tumble to $181 in 2002. If so, it would be the first time since 1997 that average rates were below $200. 
Whether so many out-of-towners are staying away because of the recession, because they fear flying, or because they are reluctant to visit the city that suffered the most from the terrorist attacks, the effect has been devastating not only to hotels but also to such other pillars of New York's tourism industry (projected at $14.9 billion this year) as restaurants, theaters, museums and scores of retail shops, big and small.
The latest statistics available for New York hotels are nothing to cheer about, but they are better than most travel industry officials were expecting just after Sept. 11. Still, while occupancy averaged 70.7 percent in October and is estimated to be about 73 percent for November, that is well below the 86.5 and 86 percent occupancy levels of those months last year. 
Most of the visitors now are Americans because as tourism statistics almost everywhere attest, vacationers on both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific are wary of flying and therefore are hewing closer to home than at any time in recent memory. That is why much of New York's recent tourism marketing has been directed at people within driving distance of the city, although with the added hope of enticing them to stay overnight. They are the focus of the Paint the Town Red, White and Blue campaign that began last month.
Priced from $157 to $324 a person, the packages, on sale through March, include a night at a Manhattan hotel, hotel tax, dinner, and a Broadway show. As of last Monday, 9,675 packages were sold. The tourist office is also offering to visitors and residents alike a brochure with discounts for hotels, museums, other attractions, shops and restaurants. (For more information, call 800-692-4843 or see www.nycvisit.com.)
One hotel without vacancies is the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel at Seventh Avenue at 51st Street. In an unusual twist, all 650 rooms have been sold out since soon after the terrorist attacks. They are not filled with tourists but with employees of Lehman Brothers, the investment banking company, which set up offices in the hotel after its offices in the World Financial Center were damaged in the attacks on the nearby World Trade Center.
Similarly, the Marriott Marquis hotel, on Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets in Times Square, set aside 250 of its 1,946 rooms for Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, which also had offices in the World Financial Center. It was not clear early last week how long Deloitte & Touche would occupy those rooms; Lehman Brothers said it would start moving workers out of the Sheraton in February. 
Tourism officials generally regard hotel performance as a reliable indicator of the health of the industry. Those figures not only track visitors' spending, as well as the taxes that their spending generates, but they also help tourism officials market a destination to out-of-towners. 
But not even the most reliable figures can prepare New York for the unexpected -- for example, the arrival in early October of about 1,000 residents of Oregon, who came to show solidarity with New Yorkers. They reserved 600 rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria (owned by Hilton) for $110 a night, instead of the pre-Sept. 11 rate of about $300. 
Then on Nov. 30, more than 3,500 Canadians arrived in New York by plane and bus for a three-day visit to shop, dine, attend Broadway shows and hold a solidarity rally at Roseland Ballroom. Their visit accounted for a total of 1,400 room nights (at $199 a night) for Starwood's Sheraton, Westin and W hotels in Manhattan.
Besides contributing to the hotels' bottom lines, the Canadians and Oregonians made another valuable contribution. The arrival of the Oregonians, said Pamela Graber, the executive director of the Waldorf Towers, also lifted the morale of Waldorf employees, who "until then had been rattling around in a hotel that had seemed almost empty."

Roll's Roles

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
Todd Beamer was a passenger on the doomed Flight 93, taken over on Sept. 11 by terrorists who intended to use the aircraft as a missile to destroy the White House or the Capitol. He had a telephone line open to an operator in Chicago, who reported hearing him recite the Lord's Prayer before leading a group of heroic passengers to rush the suicidal hijackers. Then Beamer said: "Are you guys ready? Let's roll."
 President Bush recalled that moment in the eloquent peroration of a speech in Atlanta last month. "We will always remember the words of that brave man expressing the spirit of a great country," he said. "We will no doubt face new challenges, but we have our marching orders. My fellow Americans, let's roll." 
 A song with that title was promptly distributed to radio disc jockeys. In a Philadelphia football stadium, a fan called "the sign man" unfurled a banner with the words "Let's roll . . . out" to tumultuous applause. "The words are everywhere," reported Britain's Guardian. "They have become America's favorite, bittersweet and articulate bumper sticker."
The phrase in its currently popular sense means "let's get going; let's move." The original sense of get rolling had to do with the wheels of conveyances, horseless and otherwise, and dates back to the 16th century. The crapshooter's roll 'em was introduced early in the 20th century, and the moviemakers' command to cameramen, "roll 'em," (answered in an old joke by "anytime you're ready, C.B.!") was first recorded in 1939. Five years later, in his novel "The Man With the Lumpy Nose," Lawrence Lariar wrote: " 'Do me a favor and go home and write it!' McEmons stood over the reporter menacingly. 'Get rolling!' " (I have an editor like that.) But the specific phrase let's roll in its current meaning was first cited in the 1952 novel "The Tightrope," by Stanley Jules Kauffman: " 'Let's roll, dreamer,' said Perry."
In 1950 and 1951, the blues artist Cecil Gant (aka Private Gant, the G.I. sing-sation) came out with two songs that brought roll onto the music scene. "We're Gonna Rock" was a remake of a lesser-known 1947 song by Wild Bill Moore, which repeated the words "We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll" for most of the song. The second was "Rock Little Baby" (the title bottoms on "rockabye your baby"), which included the line "Rock little daddy, send me with a rock and a roll." By June 1951, the disc jockey Alan Freed promoted the revolution in popular music that became known as rock 'n' roll. The phrase "Let's rock and roll" was an excited call to dance to that music. Later -- and this is the etymological conjecture of a confirmed fox-trotter -- with the rock clipped out, the phrase became a more general exhortation to nonmusical movement or action.
In a related development, as transition-hungry writers like to put it, a new sense of to roll up wheeled into the lexicon. It was expressed this month by ABC's Sam Donaldson: "It looks like the Taliban is being rolled up." The verb phrase roll up, which might have begun in the showroom of a carpet salesman, later became the action of arriving in a carriage or automobile, and now has the meaning of "to defeat" or "to conclude" (expressed by film directors in a noun form as "that's a wrap"), akin to the military meaning of "to mop up" (though no soldiers say "that's a mop"). 
Roll out, remembered not so fondly by former military recruits as the command to get out of bed, has also gained a new meaning as a noun: "a type of release in which a film gradually plays in an expanding number of theaters." This method of distribution differs from the usual nationwide release. Ira Konigsberg, author of the 1997 Complete Film Dictionary, informs me of the metaphoric origin: "The growing appearance of the film is much like the expansion of a carpet when it is rolled out. A synonym is platforming."
The old verb roll -- from the Latin rota, "wheel" -- like Ol' Man River, is unstoppable, creating new meanings as it goes, recently elevating itself by association with a historic moment. With the poet Byron, we can wish it ever more power: "Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean -- Roll!"

PERILS OF PARLOUS
These are parlous times. Make that observation in a speech, and each member of your audience will frown and nod, joining in the general worriment. One or two misfits will be wondering, "Does the speaker mean parlous or perilous?"
In The International Herald Tribune, the historian Roger Buckley writes darkly about "the parlous prospects for the economy." Bloomberg News was told by a spokesman for Cathay Pacific Airways that the airline industry "is in a parlous state worldwide." The ABC anchor Peter Jennings was quoted by Mark Jurkowitz of The Boston Globe as saying, "We are in parlous economic times."
The word is not related to parley; it has nothing to do with the French parler, "to talk." Parlous has the same meaning as the word it sounds like: perilous. The Latin periculum, akin to peritus, "experiment," means "risk." But perilous is beyond "risky," scarier than the general "dangerous" or the unavoidable "hazardous"; it is "fraught" (meaning "full of, laden") "with peril."
If parlous means "perilous," who needs both? The two forms of the same word have been battling it out for seven centuries, and today we're going to declare a winner.
Parlous is a delicious example of linguistic syncopation. Every ragtime or jazz enthusiast knows that when you syncopate (from the Greek for "cut short"), you begin a note on a weak beat in the bar, sustaining it into the accented part, thereby shifting the accent. In grammar, you syncopate by snipping a word short or by skipping one or two syllables in the middle. Examples: fo'c'sle for forecastle, and Chumley for Cholmondelay. They don't order Worcestershire sauce in Wooster, Mass.
Usually the shorter and easier forms win, and extrality is likely to overtake extraterritoriality. However, parlous has an arch, archaic ring and carries a touch of the pompously bookish (like fraught), while perilous has a straightforward, sailor-take-warning feel. You won't be incorrect if you try to impress your friends with the syncopated form of perilous, but if you do, it's at your parl.

Buyers Beware of Pleather and 19-Cent Sweaters

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT

 BODY:
IF you haven't purchased all your holiday presents yet, too bad.
 There is nothing left. At least at Macy's, where I've taken up temporary residence since just before Thanksgiving. 
 It all started innocently enough when I dropped into my local Macy's at Essex Green to return a pair of pants I'd bought for my son. As it happened, the day I walked in was one of their legendary one-day sales. There were markdowns on markdowns. It was like an economics lesson in deflation. Sweaters that looked and felt like cashmere (but were made out of some petroleum derivative) were going for $10. I bought three. 
Employees were taking down signs that said 40 percent off and replacing them with signs that said 50 percent off. If you had a Macy's charge card, another discount. If you opened a Macy's charge account, another discount still.
Cash register magic: one sweater rung up at $4.50.
It was like finding an amazing fishing hole, or a tree that actually grew money. It didn't matter if I didn't really need all those new sweaters. Macy's was practically giving them away.
My mother-in-law, who hates shopping, got caught up in the same one-day-sale frenzy. Watching in disbelief as the prices dropped, she told the cashier wryly, "What, are you going to pay me to take this?"
Thus began a new tradition in the suburbs: trading Macy's stories. I was sure I had everyone beat with my $4.50 sweater, until I found out that a cousin of mine in Fairlawn had bought one for 19 cents.
I discovered that the world was divided into two kinds of people: those whose hearts race at the thought of a 19-cent sweater, and everybody else.
My friend Julia vowed she would never set foot in a department store from October through January because of the crowds. Others expressed pity.
"They're not making any money," Liza said sadly."
Barbara of the socialist bent asked, "Is all this stuff made by slaves?"
Then there were those who confessed that they preferred paying retail. Odd creatures.
"I grew up clipping coupons my whole life," said one, whose identity I will protect. "I'd rather pay full price."
At lunches and holiday parties, we analyzed the issue of the 19-cent sweater like Samuelson or Keynes. Still the coupons kept arriving with each day's mail.
But then one day, coupons and charge card ready, I found the fishing hole had dried up. The 50 percent off signs -- vanished. I paid $20 for a sweater. Ripoff.
Macy's was playing games with me, taking advantage of my greed and gullibility. "You sound like a gambler in Atlantic City," Liza said. "Your eyes are all shiny and you're talking about coupons."
She was right.
I talked to Elina Kazan, publicity director for Macy's East, who told me that New Jersey had more Macy's stores than any other state but California. She insisted that the markdowns weren't any steeper than usual -- though she had just bought a $435 leather jacket for $106. 
"I'm the consummate shopper," she said. "It has to do with timing, luck, your shopping skills. I know when to strike."
Strike?
The day after speaking to Ms. Kazan, I saw the TV commercial -- Macy's One-Day Sale. My instincts took over. Never mind that I'd already cleaned my closet out twice to make room for all my new sweaters. I hadn't even started on accessories. I had one hour. I wound up with two handbags, a hat, a scarf, another sweater, two watches, two pins and a bracelet: $140.
The next day I was out with friends, breathlessly recounting the sale. I got this, I said, holding up a brown Liz Claiborne handbag.
"Nice," my friends murmured. "Beautiful." 
"Is it leather?" one asked.
My shopping skills were on the line. "I think it's leather," I said.
The purse was passed around.
"It looks like leather," said one. The next nodded.
Then it got to Molly. She shook her head.
"Pleather," she announced.
Pleather? 
Later I looked at the label inside: 100 percent polyvinyl chloride.

HEADLINE: Leaping From One Void Into Others 

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
WE are looking for substance or, failing that, for traction against the natural desire to seize on the meaning of things too soon. New York is far from absorbing the piece of world history that crashed into it in September. But the pressures to make sense of Ground Zero are great. Some of the pressure arises from the desire to help survivors of the terrorist attacks deal with the burden of grief. Some of it also arises from the tendency of bureaucracies to take on momentum with a logic all their own. This pressure can easily result in the burial of meaning rather than the discovery of it.
 A bureaucracy is now in place for the rebuilding of New York's financial district. The Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Authority, as the organization is called, is a division of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency led by Charles A. Gargano, an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki. With one exception, the authority's board of directors is a line-up of captains of industry, including top executives from financial services and communications companies and from public agencies for construction and economic development. Madelyn Wills, the authority's sole female director, represents Community Board 1, the local planning unit for lower Manhattan. 
 John C. Whitehead, a former Goldman, Sachs president who heads the new Redevelopment Authority, has said that the group's top priority is the design and construction of a memorial to the terrorists' victims. Ideas for this project have been taking shape since September. Pressure to proceed swiftly toward a design have been escalating, with the rationale that the design process is also a healing process. This thinking is sound.
There is a serious danger, however, that the scope of the design process will be too narrowly defined. The wounds in need of healing go deeper than Ground Zero and spread wider than the suffering of victims and survivors. The attack was an assault on a great city and its relationship to the rest of the world. It was an assault on history and on the American withdrawal from history in the post-cold war era. We should be skeptical of the desire for closure, one of our nation's pet chimeras, until we have faced its opposite: opening the civic imagination to the accelerating globalization of the urban realm. This opening, too, should be part of the design development.
The formation of the redevelopment authority signified the end of a process as well as the beginning of one. Actions taken and not taken between mid-September and late November are now part of the permanent record of 21st-century New York architecture. Historians will be analyzing them for decades. Meanwhile, this phase of recovery clarified some useful information for planners now working toward short-term and medium-range goals.
There are immediate needs to repair the transportation system into and out of Lower Manhattan. These should be linked to long-range planning for regional transportation. Such plans are contingent on the effectiveness of our Congressional delegation in securing federal support.
There are plans to construct public viewing platforms around the perimeter of the World Trade Center site. Two towers of high-beam light, depicted on the cover of The New York Times Magazine on Sept. 23, should be piercing the night sky by the end of the month. Many of us who live downtown never knew or admitted how attached we had become to the retail infrastructure, including stores like Century 21, Borders, Staples, Lenscrafters, Brooks Brothers and the Gap.
THERE is, however, no current need for office space, and hence no rationale for granting developers emergency concessions, like the suspension of zoning and environmental regulations. Questions that initially seemed pressing -- taller towers versus lower ones; modernist plazas versus Ye Olde Towne Squares -- are moot. Even if Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder on the twin towers, feels compelled to produce designs to satisfy his insurers, no one else need think about new buildings yet.
In general, however, this phase was notable for the lack of substantial ideas it produced. Efforts to rally the city's architects resulted in rounds of meetings, organizational strategies, motivational pep talks and general scurrying. Eventually, those efforts could be pivotal in reframing architectural discourse in this country around issues of cultural weight. If so, it will be because of the monumental vacuum that this hyperactivity exposed.
What we face now, in fact, are twin voids, one local, the other global. The first arises from the abdication of the public sector in the area of city planning. The second comes from New York's isolation from the rest of the urbanizing globe. Both stem from the collapse of historical perspective under the pressures of privatization.
The aggressive response of corporate architecture firms and their developer clients to the terrorist attacks was not New York architecture's finest hour. Nonetheless, much of this behavior can be diagnosed as a symptom of the privatization of city planning over the last two decades. Never has this surrender of civic responsibility been more starkly illustrated than in recent weeks.
"We should think like capitalists, not like Communists," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in his budget address earlier this year. The implied equation of the commonweal with the Cominterm sums up a role reversal that began during the Koch administration and is now nearly complete. City officials scurry about like Mickey Mouse entrepreneurs, plotting their next career moves. Corporate architects, despite clear conflicts of interest, try to act like public servants, with evident sincerity in a few cases. Nobody, meanwhile, bothers to look to the City Planning Commission for leadership. That demoralized, dysfunctional agency represents the power void in which all were operating before the state's redevelopment agency was set up.
Will the public sector reclaim it? For an extended period or for emergency use only? These questions deserve protracted debate. There will be efforts to neutralize the discussion, however. Municipal politics and real estate development have become, in effect, two divisions of the same industry: the City Hall-Development Complex, we might call it.
Politicians depend on real estate developers to finance their campaigns. Developers need politicians to help keep things all in the family when private contracts are awarded or special permits are sought. Architects may or may not like this status quo, but few of them are suicidal enough or courageous enough to demand reform. Our mayor-elect, Michael R. Bloomberg, is less beholden to the Complex. He is better placed to encourage developers to aim higher. But he is also taking office at a time when budgets for public services must be drastically curtailed. Privatization is likely to accelerate.
If faith in the City Planning Commission can't be restored, why bother keeping this agency around? We already have the city's Economic Development Corporation to expedite private development. In my scheme of things, City Planning would be retained, but recast within a more cultural, less legalistic framework. The agency should operate as a cosmopolitan think tank. Its primary mission should be to coordinate local growth with broader developments in global urbanization. Mayor Bloomberg can run it from his private jet.
A planning agency for contemporary New York should be guided by an overarching set of ideas that looks beyond municipal boundaries: great cities always have more in common with one another than with the nations in which they are located. Technology has drawn into close proximity great cities from the past as well as today's urban centers. Urban policy is now inseparable from foreign policy, at least on the cultural plane. The city is global.
Such an agency could create something substantial out of Void 2. In the last 14 weeks, we have witnessed the shocking culmination of a crisis that has been building for more than a decade. The war on terrorism illuminates, among other things, the widening gap between our advanced technology and the world that technology has enabled us to dominate.
This "culture gap" began with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1989. For 28 years, that structure symbolized the polarization of history into a global binary structure reinforced by nuclear arms. A new phase of world history began with the wall's collapse. The United States has yet to work itself free from the wreckage. It hasn't calculated the degree to which its place in the postwar era depends on historical awareness.
In October I was persuaded to cancel a trip to Syria. I had thought of the trip as an act of personal healing. My perspective on the contemporary city was shattered by the attack on the twin towers, and I didn't feel I could regain it without making a pilgrimage to the part of the world where cities were first imagined.
Aleppo, my destination, has been a cosmopolitan center for more than 4,000 years. Over the millennia, Aleppo has been destroyed and rebuilt often. They have a saying there: every civilized person has two homes, his own and Syria. New York could benefit now from the knowledge that civilization includes the destruction as well as the creation and re-creation of great things. Aleppo was in the news again recently. Mohamed Atta, the Egyptian who studied engineering and city planning and is believed to have led the Sept. 11 attack, wrote his thesis on the destruction of Aleppo's historic fabric by modern design.
On its Web site, the Aleppo hotel I was booked into appears to be a plain modern slab, floating in the usual modern void. It has a trio of penthouse restaurants, serving Chinese, Italian and American cuisine. There are good mountain views from the upper floors, along with the attraction of not being able to see the hotel when you are inside it. But Aleppo has survived Hittites, Mongols, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Crusaders, Venetians and Ottomans. It may even survive modern technology, and tourists like me.
But could our technology survive without Aleppo? Possibly not. Our machines are too dependent on the fragile network of relationships within the Near and Middle East that protects our access to oil. Those machines include the planes that enable us to fly around the world for peaceful or military purposes. They have been underused for peaceful purposes, if by that we mean not only activities undertaken without arms, but also actions that explicitly promote peace by enlarging our cultural awareness of the world that our machines control.
George Bush Sr. described the Persian Gulf War of 1991 as a defense of the American way of life. His son has defined the current conflict as a defense of civilization itself. We would like to think that those two objectives are compatible. But the increasing divergence between them has been the overarching story of the post-cold war period.
This gap has expanded even further since Sept. 11. Hot war is not the ideal way to build bridges. The appearance on best-seller lists of books on Islam is one sign that the gap may eventually be narrowed. It may take more than a generation before this cultural perspective penetrates foreign policy. But the work we do now at Ground Zero could help move the process forward.
Television. Skyscrapers. Jet planes. Mr. Atta took three examples of modern technology and combined them into a single weapon of mass destruction and terror. The result was a cultural statement as well as an act of murderous aggression. One can't unpack the meaning of Ground Zero without understanding its historical dimensions. We might start by recognizing that one third of the world's population embraces Islam. We could also recall the number of nations convinced of their destiny to lead.
Anyone can create his or her own authority for the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan. Mine includes two thinkers who have expanded my framework for historical awareness: the neuroscientist Gerald Edelman and the historian Fernand Braudel. Braudel, author of the recent posthumously published "Memory and the Mediterranean" (Knopf), used "la longue duree" to describe the framework I am looking for. The term is imperfectly translated as "the long perspective."
Perspective involves more than placing ourselves in illuminating relationships with historical artifacts. It also requires the process of illumination itself: perspectival adjustments in our interior landscapes, our private worlds of memories, learning and concepts. Mr. Edelman has described this process as "building a bridge toward consciousness."
The first task of my redevelopment authority would be to build a bridge toward a more complex consciousness of the urbanizing world. If you enjoy traveling -- around the globe and within the mind -- you have much to contribute to this work. You're carrying around a superior technology, a bunch of neurons in your head ideally suited to mapping modernity and your place within it.
My postponed Syrian trip was motivated by impulse. I wanted to touch some old stones, and memorize the experience in relationship to other stones I have stroked on the road. For example, I was looking forward to visiting one building, completed in 1325, that originally housed the Venetian Embassy. The word embassy is euphemistic: in those days the Near Eastern region lay within the Venetian maritime empire. I've spent many hours looking at contemporary art in the Arsenale, the shipyard from which the Venetian fleet set forth, and not enough time walking around the navy's far-flung destinations.
Stones are dots. Minds connect them. It is hard to understand Venice if you approach it from the West. But when you look back at Europe from the Asian side of the Bosporus, the pieces start falling into place. By pieces I mean stones: the actual materials from which Venice is made. In 1023 a law was passed compelling Venetian merchants to return from their Eastern voyages with treasures suitable for adorning the basilica of St. Mark. More than 500 of these precious objects, including marble columns from Syria, now decorate the church's facade.
VENETIANS saw themselves as "the third Rome," after Constantinople. That is one reason that Venetian Gothic, with its heavy reliance on perforated screens, resembles an Oriental style. For Ruskin, the Doge's Palace was "the central building of the world" because its design fused Romanesque, Byzantine and northern Gothic motifs. Through Ruskin and the 19th-century Venetian Gothic Revival, the stone trail leads to Great Britain and the United States. Its most recent incarnation is the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.
Touch enough stones, and you are on your way to developing your own longue duree. Think of it as a cultural radar system. Its antennas must be periodically readjusted, not only in response to current events, but also to receive memories of past adjustments. When the system is down, the causes and effects of events cannot be detected. Those linkages go the way of old radio waves, out into the ether.
The system is down. There is little coherent relationshjp between foreign policy and historical awareness. Our foreign policy is for machines. We have not found ways to integrate into policy the global civilization that technology is creating. This task should be performed by cities, starting with New York.
One feature great cities have in common is the capacity to recreate themselves after an assault. Under traumatic circumstances, New York has joined an ancient and illustrious roster. The dialogue about cities is synonymous with history. This discussion is now global. Young as we are, history is calling on New York to lead it.

Best Bet
When he was 5 and a Cub Scout growing up in Sea Cliff, James Foote visited Sagamore Hill, Theodore Roosevelt's home in neighboring Oyster Bay. Impressed by what he saw, he became interested in the man and his times and started reading about both.
 But it was not until he entered the Navy in 1968, grew a mustache, put on weight and acquired eye glasses that the casual interest turned to something more. 
 "Guys started saying, 'Hey, you look like Teddy Roosevelt,' and I realized they were right and started to really read up on him," Mr. Foote recalled. 
By the time he left the Navy 20 years ago and returned to Long Island to work as a machinist, Mr. Foote, now 53 and still a resident of Sea Cliff, had his future mapped out. He decided to parlay his physical resemblance to and intellectual fascination with Roosevelt into a career.
Clad in appropriate attire, Mr. Foote has created a "living portrait" of the man, using quotes culled from Roosevelt's speeches and writings, facts found in biographies and histories of his era, and even a 1915 recording cylinder made during a Roosevelt speech at the Young Man's Progressive League to emulate his hero's voice better.
Starting small and part time with just a few appearances a year, eight years ago Mr. Foote left his full-time job to be Teddy Roosevelt whenever and wherever the 26th president was needed. Last year he logged more than 10,000 miles, bringing Teddy four or five times a month to classrooms, historic sites, fairs, conventions and conferences throughout the United States.
On Friday he will be at the Port Washington Library at 12:10 p.m. Information: (516) 883-4400.
On Jan. 4 at 9 p.m., he will appear in a PBS special, "America 360." Next fall he will lead his Rough Riders, a group of re-enactors, up San Juan Hill in a four-hour documentary for the History Channel to be filmed at the Muttontown Preserve.
"I'll never get the villa I wanted," Mr. Foote said, discussing the economics of being Theodore Roosevelt.
"But," and here Mr. Foote, as he frequently does in conversation, slipped into his Teddy mode, quoting him, voice and all, "life is a great adventure and I want to say to you, accept it in such a spirit."

Spiritual Carols
The Bethel A.M.E. Church Choir appears at 3 p.m. today at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages on Route 25A in Stony Brook. The ensemble, from the church in Setauket, one of the oldest African-American churches in continuous use on the Island, will add spirituals to the customary array of carols and holiday tunes. Information: (631) 751-0066.

For the Birds
With the weather so peculiar lately, birders are not sure of what they will find when they take to the Island's woods, beaches and meadows.
"Orioles and catbirds are still around when they shouldn't be," said Lucy Nash of Stony Brook of the Four Harbors Audubon Society. "Unless there's a northern push soon, who knows what we'll see on Thursday."
That is when Ms. Nash's group does the Smithtown Christmas Bird Count, going from Sunken Meadow State Park to Mount Sinai Harbor. Information: (631) 751-7333.
Two other local birding counts will take place this year. One is on Saturday in Orient Point, which covers the North Fork. Information: (631) 722-5542. The other is next Sunday in South Nassau. Information: (631) 666-7624.

Still Funny
The Cinema Arts Center in Huntington will be showing "Funny Girl," the 1968 musical about the legendary singer-comedian Fanny Brice that won Barbra Streisand an Oscar in her first movie role. Directed by William Wyler with music by Jule Styne, the film will be shown in a new 35mm print on Wednesday and Thursday at the center on Park Avenue. Information: (631) 423-7610.

Free Choices
TODAY -- The Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference is holding a hike, "Cookies and Carols," at 2:30 p.m., going from the Great River Long Island Rail Road station to Connetquot River State Park in Oakdale and back. Participants are asked to bring flashlights, a warm drink and baked goods to share. Information: (631) 567-9484. BARBARA DELATINER

New Year's Resolutions For Financial Health

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
For many Americans, 2001 has been a difficult year financially, with continued stock market volatility, rising unemployment and recession.
 No one knows what the new year will bring, but experts recommend a few moves -- call them financial resolutions -- that may improve the outlook. Though most are basic, they seem more important than ever these days. 
 * Organize financial records. This provides a snapshot of your financial health and net worth -- and a framework for future investing and budgeting decisions. Review and file loan, investment, bank and tax statements. Permanent records, like birth certificates, property deeds and insurance policies, should also be stored in a safe place.
* Build an emergency fund. A cash cushion can get you through a layoff or other financial emergencies; it will also help you avoid selling stocks in a down market. Experts recommend having enough to cover living expenses for three to six months. Consider using any extra income, like a year-end bonus, to get a jump-start.
* Minimize debt. That means paying off or refinancing high-interest debt. If you have money sitting in a bank or money market account earning only 2 percent interest, you can improve your overall return by using some of that money to pay off a credit card balance.
* Keep investing. Stock market declines are not a reason to stop investing, especially for long-term goals like retirement -- historically, markets eventually rebound. But stick with companies that are fundamentally sound and keep your portfolio diversified. Now may be a good time to rebalance your portfolio, by reallocating your mix of stocks, bonds and cash. Experts recommend avoiding risky investments if your financial goals are short term.
* Review your insurance. That includes life insurance, disability and long-term care policies, as well as your homeowner's and business coverage. To ensure proper coverage, assess your risk exposure and personal circumstances. At certain times in your life, you may require more or less insurance -- for example, once your home mortgage is paid and your children are on their own, you may need less.
* Update your estate planning. If you don't have a will, draw one up; if you do, update it to reflect any changes in your personal or financial situation. To limit their tax liabilities, people with substantial assets should seek the help of a professional estate planner. Vivian Marino

Finally, Rooms in the Inn, And They're on Campus

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY 

 BODY:
TWO months after opening with great fanfare as the only on-campus hotel in the state, the University of Connecticut's new 100-room Nathan Hale Inn and Conference Center, has logged 2,000 occupancies, been host to about 30 conferences and brought in $135,000 in revenue.
 Not only has the plum-and-sand-colored, five-story hotel filled up rapidly since its Oct. 15 debut, it has also finally begun to satisfy an aching, longstanding demand at UConn, which has a four percent ownership stake. 
 Other than the few rooms available at the Best Western in Mansfield Center, the old-fashioned Tolland Inn on the Tolland Green, and various bed-and-breakfasts, all miles away and scattered throughout the rural hills, UConn has never before had a suitable facility up close to house parents, alumni, and conference guests. And that has hurt. 
"The need was dire," said Philip E. Austin, president of UConn. "There was no immediately accessible hotel that had food and beverage service and that was an upscale facility."
All that has changed.
David Kornfeld, manager of the new hotel, has already booked 100 conferences for next year averaging two to three days each. The conferences to date have included three weeklong events.
"We are on pace to do our plan, which is a 63 percent occupancy for the first year," Mr. Kornfeld said. "Annually we expect to do $3.5 million in revenue. The profit should be 30 percent, and that's good for a full-service hotel, especially after the first year of operation."
Meanwhile, parents and alumni have flocked to the $10 million inn.
"On campus there's great excitement that at long last here's a place where prospective students and their families and families of current students can have high-quality, geographically contiguous accommodations," Mr. Austin said, "not to mention the advantages for our faculty, now we're able to host regional academic conferences and professional meetings."
For homecoming weekend at the end of October, the hotel was totally booked and will be again at commencement in mid-May, Mr. Kornfeld said.
The hotel rooms have high-speed Internet access, with king- or queen-size beds in 82 single rooms, 17 mini-suites, and a presidential suite. The rates range from $89 to $149 a night. 
There is also a complete business center, laundry, and University shuttle bus service.
For conferences, the Nathan Hale can accommodate up to 750 people, with an executive board room, four meeting rooms, and a ballroom to complement the large conference space in the adjacent South Campus residence complex. 
Abigail's, a lounge and bar, abuts the 20-table Blue Oak Cafe. Room service and catering are also available. A small fitness center, a hot tub and a 40-foot-long indoor swimming pool seem to be popular, especially the pool.
"Anybody who has kids, that s what they ask for," said Elaine Olsen, the front-desk clerk.
But parents and alumni represent only a small portion of the business the hotel expects to bring in, Mr. Kornfeld said.
"We re hoping for about 10 percent of the business to come from alumni," Mr. Kornfeld said. "About 70 percent is going to come from the university from various conferences, guest speakers and other functions, anything from a holiday party to a staff meeting, and 20 percent is where we want our corporate and social business."
The hotel makes a "huge difference," said Karen Grava, a UConn spokeswoman. "In the past we did not have a suitable place for guests, and many times we ended up putting people up in Hartford, which was not convenient."
An example was the visit by the president of Senegal. "When the president of a nation travels," Ms. Grava said, "he has a huge entourage. It required many hotel rooms in Hartford and trying to get the people back and forth was very difficult."
The hotel finally puts UConn on an equal footing with other schools, said Dawn Bradway, a graduate school psychology student from Batavia, N.Y., who was having lunch with her adviser at the Blue Oak Cafe on a recent Saturday, on their first visits to the hotel.
"All the other major universities have had hotels and banquet facilities on site for years and we haven't," Ms. Bradway said, "so I'm finally glad to see we've got something on site."
The hotel has solved a longtime problem for Ms. Bradway, who has been at UConn since 1994 and who has had to house her visiting parents at distant hotels once or twice a year over the past couple of years.
"They've wanted to visit and stay," Ms. Bradway said, "and a really nice hotel is a good 30- or 40-minute drive, and if you're out at a late dinner and you wrap things up, to go that far for a night's stay is pretty inconvenient."
Benson Ginsburg, a biobehavioral sciences professor and Ms. Bradway's graduate school adviser, said the hotel is long overdue. "Having witnessed the need over the years," he said, "I'm very happy to see it." Mr. Ginsburg said a major international conference in his field is schedule at the hotel in July.
The hotel was a timely convenience for Susan Entwistle, her husband Gary, a Canadian accounting professor on sabbatical at UConn, and their two children Joel, 11, and Megan, 9, who had to find a place to stay when their four-month lease on a home ran out Dec. 15.
"We just came from Disney World," Ms. Entwistle said, "and this is a nicer hotel than where we were staying."
MeriStar Hotels and Resorts, a Washington, D.C.-based firm, manages the facility. Students make up more than half the hotel's 70 employees. The developer was Campus Associates, owned by Robert B. Friedman, also owner of the Norwich Navigators minor league baseball team.
Mr. Friedman paid $10.1 million to build and furnish the hotel. He signed a 50-year lease with the university and will pay it $5,000 a year for the first five years and $25,000 in the sixth year. After that, the rent will increase by the same amount as the rise in the previous year's Consumer Price Index, the federal inflation measure.

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Putting His Nightclub Experience to Good Use

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
NED DOUGHERTY'S account of his fast-track life as a Hamptons nightclub owner, punctuated by his near-death experiences and subsequent apocalyptic visions, was published in March, initially to limited interest. "Fast Lane to Heaven: Celestial Encounters That Changed My Life" (Hampton Roads Publishing Company, $21.95) was merely another title in a crowded category of books about faith and spirituality.
 Sept. 11 changed all that. Mr. Dougherty, who was an owner of Club Marakesh in Westhampton Beach from 1976 to 1996, has recently lectured at Harvard University and the Baylor College of Medicine, as well as at bookstores, cafes and religious retreats across the country. This weekend he was booked twice on the East End, at a Hampton Bays church and at a community center in Bridgehampton. 
 The reason behind the sudden interest in Mr. Dougherty appears on page 252 of his book: "A major terrorist attack may befall New York City or Washington, D.C., severely impacting the way we live in the United States." 
That prediction has audiences interested in hearing what else he foresees. In his chapter called "The Future," Mr. Dougherty recounts 11 other visions foretelling war and natural disasters. There are warnings about the Middle East and China, predictions of economic collapse in the United States, tidal flooding and a terrorist attack in Rome. 
But the book is less about prophecies than about his spiritual odyssey. Having created Long Island's answer to Studio 54, Mr. Dougherty became the king of Long Island night life in the 1970's and remained so for an astonishing 20 years. He also built a real estate business, which he ran from an office next to the club. 
"When I came to the Hamptons, my motto was, 'He who dies with the most toys wins,' " Mr. Dougherty, now 55, said in an interview. "I certainly had my share of toys. Now I have a different motto: 'He who dies with the most toys is in for a terrible surprise.' "
In the process of amassing those toys, Mr. Dougherty made his share of enemies. The mayor of Westhampton Beach used to call Club Marakesh a jungle. "It was a jungle to some people," Mr. Dougherty said, "but to others, it was a paradise."
Lon Sabella, an owner of Lon Sabella et Daniel, a clothing and jewelry shop in Westhampton Beach, butted heads with Mr. Dougherty in the past. "He lured the wrong people to Main Street, from Brooklyn and Queens," Mr. Sabella said. "His club became passe, and he had to reach further to keep it filled. There were so many fights we had to put on extra police."
Mr. Dougherty said he paid little attention to how others felt during those years. Things began to change for him on the night of July 2, 1984, when he and a business partner he had been feuding with got into a fight in the upstairs V.I.P. lounge at the club.
Afterward, Mr. Dougherty stumbled down the stairs and out the door, collapsing on the sidewalk. Such was the reputation of Club Marakesh that the medics who came to his rescue presumed he was using drugs, he says in his book, and so did the emergency-room doctors who wanted to pump his stomach a few moments later. Mr. Dougherty said that he sometimes used cocaine but that he had not that night nor in the previous months.
During the ambulance ride, the medics reported that his heart stopped for about eight minutes. Mr. Dougherty writes that at that point, he experienced many of the sensations, sights and sounds he has since learned characterize a near-death experience. 
In his account, Mr. Dougherty describes looking down at his own form lying in the ambulance. He writes of a tunnel and of feeling a warm light, of hearing melodious chiming. He describes a parade of memories as he encountered friends and relatives long dead. A celestial motivational seminar is held in an ethereal stadium; the spirits all cheer. He encounters the Archangel Michael and a figure much like the Virgin Mary. Both communicate what Mr. Dougherty calls End Time visions to him, which he recounts in his book's last chapter, about the future.
When he got out of the hospital after a few days, Mr. Dougherty started delving into parapsychology, reading the work of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and others on death and dying. He began to rediscover the Roman Catholic faith of his childhood, and he became a spokesman for the International Association for Near-Death Studies in East Windsor Hill, Conn. After 20 years of drinking -- several bottles of Dom Perignon a night were the norm, he said -- he lost his taste for alcohol.
"I realized I had a new agenda to follow," Mr. Dougherty said, but his transformation took years. He wanted to get out of the nightclub business, he said, but remained involved because a former girlfriend had bought a share of the business and asked him to stay.
Then, on May 26, 1996, a young patron named Shane Daniels was badly beaten as he left Club Marakesh. Mr. Daniels is black, his assailants white, and the police described the attack as racially motivated. Television cameras, newspaper photographers and national publicity, all of it bad, followed; the Rev. Al Sharpton held a march through Westhampton Beach to protest the way the case was being handled.
"I had already found a buyer for the club," Mr. Dougherty said. "I was going to sell it. When Shane Daniels was attacked in the municipal parking lot, I was less than 24 hours away from signing over the club."
He added quietly, "When you're trying to sell your business, you don't want Al Sharpton protesting in front of it."
The deal to sell the club fell through when the State Liquor Authority blocked the transfer of the liquor license to the prospective buyers, and the club closed. Mr. Dougherty said he lost a couple of million dollars. He subsequently sold his real estate business to a local competitor and devoted himself full time to writing and building a nonprofit foundation called the Mission of Angels (www.missionofangels.org), which is currently raising money to provide vacations for children who lost a parent on Sept. 11. The group does not yet have a board of directors, but Mr. Dougherty said he was recruiting members and hoped to build a headquarters in Hazleton, Pa., where he was born.
"In building the Mission of Angels, I find myself relying on some of my earlier business skills," he said, "but I also realize I am relying more on other people than I did before. I am much more aware of the need for teamwork today."
In June 1998, Mr. Dougherty filed for personal bankruptcy. He currently earns a subsistence living, he said, selling copies of his book. He does not charge for his personal appearances, he said, but he sells the book at them.
Even with his personal financial problems, Mr. Dougherty said he had no regrets: "I believe we are primarily spiritual beings. I believe we are here to learn and grow, and I believe we all have a mission in life. The message, to put it simply, is that everyone's mission is to be of service to mankind and to love one's neighbor."
On Main Street, the local pharmacist who bought the Club Marakesh building is trying open a health club there. The space is still strewn with chairs, sectional furniture and old bar fixtures from the club's last days and nights.
Mr. Dougherty said he took one souvenir when he left, the velvet rope he used every weekend, and donated it to the Shrine of Our Lady of the Island in Eastport. There, it's used to preserve orderly lines among the hundreds of people waiting for a healing touch during a prayer service.

Top-Flight Preparations in Historic Spot

BYLINE:  By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
SOUTHERN Suffolk's newest culinary star is also one of its oldest. The Bayport House, then called the Fiat Inn Hotel, opened in 1869. During its 132-year history, the landmark building has been a stagecoach stop, waiting room for the train, speakeasy and restaurant. The food has roamed from American to German to Italian. Today, everything is new at this historic spot: owners, chef, staff, food and ambience.
 When I last visited the Bayport House, about a decade ago, ristorante was part of its name. It served very good Northern Italian food but was equally renowned for its Christmas decorations. Garlands, wreaths, trees, boughs, lights, snowflakes and balls started appearing the day after Halloween. In a starring role was a plethora of santas, from the jolly fellow in his sleigh on the lawn to a regiment of moving santas and Mrs. Clauses within. 
 The 2001 version of the Bayport House also makes a holiday statement, albeit a more restrained one. Decorations include wreaths and garlands entwined with pristine white lights, a display of miniature houses and an occasional santa or two. At other times of the year patrons will be taken with the overall ambience of the old building: the charming, multi-windowed dining porches and the snug tap room with its impressive, hand-carved bar.
Bill and Leda Sukow, the new owners, are a presence in the well-run dining room. Their staff of amiable, hardworking professionals could not be faulted. Those all-seeing servers notice any drop in the fullness of the bread basket and offer more focaccia. Resist. That warm, onion-topped bread is so terrific that many a diner has found himself too full for the meal.
That would be a shame because Joseph Felicetta is in the kitchen. Long Islanders may be acquainted with the food of this highly regarded chef form his stints at places like Metropolis in East Setauket and Octopus Garden in Port Washington.
At the Bayport House the food is contemporary American -- a salad bowl of influences. The menu includes dishes as diverse as Laotian prawns steamed in banana leaves, a French Quarter seafood bisque, chicken in a Mexican mole sauce, calamari with a Thai dipping sauce, ancho chili-rubbed rib-eye steak, a German-style tenderloin of pork with potato pancake and baked apple, and a New England fish chowder.
That creamy chowder, full of briny goodies, was the top appetizer one night. Another time, the pink-hued seafood bisque, with its lashings of cayenne and sherry, was its equal. If the mixed seafood salad is a special, go for it. This was not the familiar Italian starter but a mound of greens dressed with a miso vinaigrette and topped with bean sprouts, crab meat, a few large shrimp and big chunks of meat from half a lobster. Wasabi and seaweed salad ringed the plate. (That very tasty seaweed salad is also listed with the vegetable side dishes and at $5 would make an economical opener.)
Other appetizers that more than made the grade were the very tender fried calamari, the classic Caesar and the rough-hewn pate served with cornichons, pickled onions and grainy Dijon mustard.
I encountered no failures on this menu. Among the headliners were sauteed skate in a brown butter sauce, grilled swordfish topped with tiny, thumbnail-size tomatoes in a tomato-basil salsa; a succulent grilled chicken breast crusted with rosemary and garlic and paired with a creamy wild mushroom risotto, and a velvety filet mignon sporting a Gorgonzola crown with red wine sauce, basil mashed potato and grilled vegetable accompaniments.
The best pasta sampled was an angel-hair blessed with leeks and littleneck clams steamed with fermented black beans, garlic, ginger, chilis and white wine. It was a lip-smacking treat. For those looking for something more straightforward, a two-pound lobster has been a frequent special.
Desserts were as scrumptious as the rest of the meal. All were worth the calories; two were show-stoppers. The sampler of homemade ice creams and sorbets was an eye-popper. Four mini (homemade) cones held assorted flavors. The plate also included ice cream-filled bonbons and a frozen banana ice cream pop covered in decadently rich chocolate. The same adjectives also also describe the bittersweet chocolate terrine. It's a don't-miss finale for chocolate lovers. The Bayport House itself is a don't-miss treat for Long Island foodies.

HEADLINE: Before the Textbooks, The Address Book 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WITH local N.A.A.C.P. leaders leading the way, it was anything but an ordinary return to school for Alexander and Jacques Pittman last month when the brothers walked back into the West Shore Middle School in Milford after being barred for nearly two months.
 In the glare of flashing cameras, Alexander, 12 and Jacques, 11, were escorted back into school by their mother, Debbie Pittman, and leaders of the Greater New Haven N.A.A.C.P. with a throng of news media following closely behind. 
 "It's great to be back," said Jacques. "It was getting pretty boring being home every day, and I can't wait to see my friends." 
The brothers were returning to school after a two-month battle with the city's school system. They had been barred from the school they had both been attending since kindergarten when both the city's Board of Education and a state hearing officer determined they did not live in the Milford home of their grandmother, but rather in the Bridgeport home of their father. 
The boys' mother, Ms. Pittman, who said she and her children lived with her mother in Milford, refused to enroll them in Bridgeport and instead kept them out of school while she battled with Milford and the state. She said she and her sons, as well as an older daughter who graduated from the Milford school system last year, had been living in Milford since 1993 when the brothers started attending school there. The private investigator hired by Milford, however, said the boys lived in Bridgeport with their father, who is divorced from Ms. Pittman.
The brothers were allowed back in school after the local Probate Court determined that temporary custodial guardianship, which Ms. Smith transferred to her mother, Dorothy Smith of Milford, in October, was not based solely on a motivation for the boys to attend the city's schools.
"It is against state law to transfer guardianship just because you want your children to attend a particular school system and we had to be certain that was not happening here," said Mary Jo Kramer, Milford's superintendent of schools who this month was named superintendent of the Darien school system. She said she was most concerned that the children had missed so much school.
Pupil residency is a major problem in school systems across Connecticut. School officials said hundreds of students were accused each year of illegally attending suburban schools, especially in districts near the state's largest cities. With many suburban schools already overcrowded and the cost of educating children so high, towns said they can't look the other way when a nonresident is attending their schools, although officials said they understand the motivation.
"As educators, these situations really do put us in a very awkward position because we do hear some very moving stories from parents pleading with us to let their children stay," said Marjorie Anctil, assistant superintendent of schools in Trumbull. "It's never easy to turn children away, but when we determine they do not live here we have no choice."
The rise in divorces, more frequent moves and shared custody among parents and other relatives have all contributed to the difficulties school systems face in trying to determine where students actually reside. Some school districts, in fact, such as the Hartford suburbs like West Hartford, Bloomfield and Newington, consider the problem so severe they have hired former police and law enforcement officers to work full-time on residency cases.
"We investigate between 200 to 250 residency cases every year and about half the time we are able to establish that a student is not actually residing in West Hartford," said Richard Gable, the school system's director of registration and student residency.
Mr. Gable, a 34-year law enforcement veteran who worked in the West Hartford and Newington police departments and has been employed in his current post since 1994, said his job has actually become more challenging over the past decade.
"More and more people are trying to illegally place their children in our school system, but we're getting better at detecting when it happens," said Mr. Gable. "Of course we don't catch everybody and I'm sure there are students who manage to even graduate without being caught. But it's something we devote a lot of time and energy to because it saves considerable money."
That's why the Newington Board of Education recently decided to hire the town's police chief, Richard Klett, who is retiring, to be the school system's first director of safety and residency. Mr. Klett will assume his new post Jan. 1, said Ernest Perlini, the superintendent of schools.
Mr. Perlini said that because the town is between Hartford and New Britain, he is certain there are far more students attending the district illegally than the 10 to 15 cases that are investigated annually.
"We believe employing an expert in local law enforcement full-time is going to save us a considerable amount of money over the long run," said Mr. Perlini. "While we would like to accommodate everyone who wants to attend our schools, the reality is that it is impossible."
While there are no statewide statistics on the number of students investigated annually by local school districts for fraudulently attending suburban districts, school officials in numerous communities said the problem has worsened considerably in recent years.
"Pupil residency has always been a concern of school districts, but because education has become so much more expensive and with enrollment in some districts actually bursting at the seams, there is no question this has become a much more urgent issue," said Thomas Murphy, a spokesman for the State Department of Education.
Mr. Murphy said there were programs like Project Open Choice, which makes it possible for more than 1,700 students in the state's three largest cities, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven, to attend other school systems. But, he said, parents often try illegal measures because "there are clearly far more people who want their children to attend school systems outside their districts than what the current capacity allows."
With annual per pupil expenditures now more than $8,000 on average, some as high as $11,000, and with soaring enrollments as well, districts across the state said they were scrambling to find ways to insure that all students attending their schools actually reside in their towns and cities -- including hiring full-time investigators. 
"It's not a pleasant reality, but it is something we have to do, given the current economic system in which school systems have to pay themselves for the lion's share of our budgets," said Ms. Anctil, the assistant superintendent of schools in Trumbull, a town that borders Bridgeport.
"We feel terrible we can't allow everyone to attend who wants to," said Mr. Perlini of Newington, recalling a family last year who desperately wanted their children to continue attending the school system even though they were moving to another town.
"It was very, very difficult to turn them down because their children had been attending our schools for years and they were all good students," said Mr. Perlini. "It doesn't matter whether they're already attending or not, once they aren't living here anymore we cannot allow them to attend."
Both local and state educators conceded that at times the issue of actual residency is not easy to determine because of shared custody or divorces in which children split time between different homes. According to state statute, "a child residing in a dwelling located in more than one town shall be considered a resident of each town in which the dwelling is located and may attend school in any one of such towns."
In the recent Milford case, however, school officials said they were convinced after a six-month investigation that the Pittman brothers were living in Bridgeport. Milford's conclusion, upheld by the state, prompted Bridgeport school officials to send truant officers to the home of the boys' father on four occasions, but never found the boys or their mother there.
"We never found any evidence they lived in Bridgeport," said Richard Huydic, spokesman for the Bridgeport school district, which over the past two years has had 40 students placed in the district after they were illegally attending suburban schools like Milford, Trumbull, Stratford and Fairfield. "We were prepared to have them attend our schools, but we also needed validation they lived here and the family continued to maintain they resided in Milford."
Because she and her children are African Americans, Ms. Pittman said she believed there were "racial overtones" to Milford's investigation and decision, which included hiring private investigators to follow her sons. She said they were allowed back in school only after she enlisted the help of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"I said all along we lived in Milford and my only concern was that my children receive the education they are entitled to," Ms. Pittman said. "What hurts the most is that my sons have missed two months of learning they will never get back. But I could not justify sending them to the Bridgeport schools when I knew that's not where they lived."
School officials denied that race played any role in their decision, insisting the use of private detectives is a routine part of their dozen residency investigations each year, most of which, they said, involved white families.
"This was always about residency, not race," said Ms. Kramer, Milford superintendent. "I can't say that emphatically enough."
Mr. Huydic, as well as spokespeople for the New Haven and Hartford school districts, said they cooperated with suburban towns when informed that students attending those schools actually live in the larger cities.
"When we are provided with an address by the towns we always send a truant officer to investigate as part of our efforts to determine residency," said Mr. Huydic. "Other than that, there's really not much more we can do."
Ed Linehan, New Haven's supervisor for magnet schools and district registration, said while there are only about a half dozen students each year enrolled after illegally attending suburban school districts such as Hamden, East Haven, West Haven and Milford, "one would assume it happens a lot more often that we will never know about."
Mr. Linehan said there are about 450 city students attending schools legally in surrounding school districts, but added that the numbers of students who attend illegally shows "there is clearly far more demand than there is available space."

HEADLINE: Weather Spells Relief From Fuel Costs 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
DARREL GROCE, an owner of Wayne Fuel Service in Lynbrook, hasn't quite resorted to leaning back with his feet on the desk. But neither has the phone been ringing off the hook.
 "We're just sitting here waiting for people to call," Mr. Groce said. "And waiting for the weather to get colder." 
 Unseasonably balmy weather in the Northeast, including the warmest November on Long Island in 132 years and sweater weather for much of December, has sent demand for home heating oil plummeting along with its price, now about 30 cents less a gallon than a year ago.
Prices for gasoline and natural gas are also down sharply for reasons that have less to do with the weather but are adding just as greatly to the savings for Long Island consumers.
For Mr. Groce, all the warm weather has meant time on his hands in a season when he is usually making deliveries nonstop. In November alone, he said, business was down 40 percent and a driver who usually worked full time was hardly working at all.
But for others it was good news in a shaky time: money not spent on oil and gas was remaining in people's pockets or getting spent instead on holiday shopping.
Economists said lower energy costs were bringing huge savings to Long Island. The region consumes 20 percent of petroleum products used in New York, which is the fourth largest per capita consumer of petroleum after Texas, California and Florida, according to federal estimates.
"There is a little extra bit of a twist because the reduction in the oil and gas prices is coupled with the reduction in heating fuel consumption because of the weather," said Thomas Conoscenti, a Long Island regional economist in Nesconset. "It has helped keep the economy a lot stronger than it would have been."
Dr. Conoscenti said savings on heating oil were probably exceeded by motorists' savings on gasoline, down an average of about 30 cents a gallon from a year ago.
Gary E. Huth, the principal Long Island economist for the state Department of Labor regional office in Hicksville, said there were also intangible benefits.
"If people are not spending as much, it gives a certain amount of the feeling of a buffer, a cushion, and that's important in these times when people are feeling stressed in other areas," he said.
Savings were most easily quantified for heating oil, still the dominant fuel for home heating on Long Island.
For the estimated 615,000 residential heating oil customers in Nassau and Suffolk, the convergence of warmer-than-normal temperatures, lower prices, lower demand and large inventories of heating oil is the exact opposite of market conditions a year ago.
Kevin Rooney, the chief executive officer of the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island, a heating oil trade group, said that from Sept. 1 through Dec. 17 of last year temperatures were 7 percent below normal and an average customer used 264 gallons with an average retail price of $1.74 a gallon for a cost of $459.36.
For the same period this year, Mr. Rooney said, temperatures were 25 percent above normal and an average customer used 185 gallons at an average retail price of $1.42 a gallon for a cost of $262.70, a saving of $196.66 per customer and more than $120 million for all Long Island customers.
Mr. Conoscenti said that when a 2.1 retail multiplier was taken into account, the total boost to the regional economy was $254 million.
Mr. Rooney said industrial and commercial users of oil and natural gas had also saved large amounts of money.
"It's wonderful news for consumers, but absolutely awful for the heating oil industry," he said.
Residents who use natural gas for cooking, heat or hot water were also paying and using less.
Bonnie Habyan, a KeySpan spokeswoman, said the company estimated that bills for its 442,000 residential customers in Nassau, Suffolk and the Rockaway Peninsula would be 15 percent below a year ago for November through March, the period the company regards as the heating season.
Natural gas costs plunged by 27 percent in December. For a full-service gas customer with an average bill of $1,200, savings would be $180 for the season, she estimated.
At gasoline stations, the average price for midgrade gasoline was $1.311 at midweek, down from $1.729 a year ago, according to the Automobile Club of New York. Regular and premium grades declined by similar amounts. 
"It's always better for the retailers when prices are lower," said Kathryn Pollane, executive director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association in Melville. "People go out more, and they will buy things in the stations' retail stores."
Some retailers outside the gasoline trade said warmer weather had brought out more shoppers.
"By this time last year we had already spent $100,000 removing ice and snow," said Janine Nebons, general manager of the Tanger Outlet Center in Riverhead. She said shopping at the center's 170 manufacturer's outlet stores was running 12 to 15 percent ahead of a year ago.
"We're having a fabulous year," Ms. Nebons said. "What analysts and the media said about the discount scene being very strong fits right in with what we are seeing this year.
"A lot of people who would have traveled to New Jersey are coming here," she added. "The East End is a straight shot with no bridges or tunnels." Suffolk also exempts county sales taxes on clothing and shoes priced at under $110.
While the lower cost of natural gas and oil has also cut the cost to generate and import electricity, the savings will not be reflected on bills of the Long Island Power Authority until next year. LIPA makes adjustments for fuel costs once annually for the preceding year and is currently adding a 5.8 percent surcharge to electric bills to cover high fuel costs in 2000.
Richard M. Kessel, the authority chairman, said last week that the 5.8 percent surcharge might be reduced or eliminated when the authority reviews costs for this year. "I do not anticipate it will be increased," Mr. Kessel said. 
Heating fuel savings from unseasonably warm weather may be drawing to a close.
Tim Morrin, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service forecast office in Upton, said Long Island temperatures for the fall season had been two degrees above normal. But Mr. Morrin said the weather service was predicting temperatures colder than normal to set in late this month and through January and February.
He added, however, that a study by forecasters in Upton found a correlation between the 10 warmest autumns and significantly less snowfall in the winters that followed.

Leasing Former General Foods Site Is Behind Target

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
SLUGGISH leasing activity and construction delays at the sprawling 39-acre former Kraft Foods headquarters in White Plains -- now called 333 Westchester Avenue -- have caused the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation of Manhattan, the current developers, to secure an extension on its deadline for finding tenants as spelled out in its financial agreement with the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency.
 In response to a request by the developer, the county agreed late last month to give the company an additional 20 months to meet the occupancy goal, which had been set for next spring. 
 Charles Steven Cohen, president and chief executive of Cohen Brothers, which is renovating and marketing the 600,000-square-foot complex -- which was vacated by Kraft in 1997 and is still mostly empty -- attributed the current problems to a number of "costly delays and unexpected conditions." 
"All this has taken more time than expected, which is not unusual with a project of this scope," Mr. Cohen said. The company, which serves as owner, developer and leasing agent, has been renovating 333 Westchester since it acquired the property in 1998 for $25 million. 
So far, it has poured $15 million into the four-building campus, which was originally constructed for the General Foods Corporation in the 1950's. Its first task was to redesign and remarket it as four distinct buildings, and it hired the architectural firm of Philip Johnson. Under the new design, each building is now entered through a towering sculpturelike entry with its own distinctive color. In all, the project, which also includes upgrading the buildings and surrounding campus, is expected to cost $90 million.
In large part, the current slow economy is the main cause of Cohen Brothers' problems, according to company spokesmen and economic development specialists. 
"The once favorable conditions existing in the leasing market are not the same as when C.B.R.C. undertook the project," Joseph P. Carlucci, a lawyer for Cohen Brothers, said in a letter to the Industrial Development Agency seeking an extension in dates on its agreement with the county. 
"The market has flattened, and there is considerably more sublease space on the market today, which makes lease-up of the site more difficult," Mr. Carlucci of Cuddy & Feder & Worby in White Plains, wrote. The request was granted late in November.
The vacancy rate for the eastern part of Westchester that includes all of Westchester Avenue in White Plains as well as Harrison, Purchase, Rye, Rye Brook and Port Chester was 18 percent at the end of the third quarter, up from about 11.6 percent a year earlier, according to figures from Insignia/ESG Inc., the commercial real estate services provider.
COHEN BROTHERS -- which owns 11 million square feet of Class A commercial real estate in New York City, Los Angeles and Houston -- requested that the lease achievement date be revised to reflect the time each of the remaining three vacant buildings would be ready for tenants.
When the agency provides benefits to a company, it often takes ownership of the project and leases it back to the firm. Cohen Brothers in effect acts as an agent of the development agency and gets the tax exemptions to which the I.D.A. is entitled. "We hold their feet to the fire by retaining an ability to recapture benefits," said Teri Waivada, executive director of the Industrial Development Agency.
The I.D.A. board extended the 1998 arrangement under which Cohen Brothers agreed to sell the campus to the agency and lease it back in return for receiving economic development incentives -- in particular, sales and usage tax breaks on the redevelopment work and on purchases by tenants -- from Westchester County. As a condition of receiving county assistance, Cohen Brothers must fill certain percentages of its space by certain target dates.
To date, Cohen Brothers has leased about 100,000 square feet of the 193,000-square-foot south building, but none of the other three buildings.
"Cohen Brothers said they needed more time, and we extended the lease-up date to December 2003 from April 2002," Ms. Waivada said. On Dec. 31, 2003, Cohen Brothers must have 67 percent of the space leased out.
Cohen Brothers said it needed the amendment of the timetable in its agreement with the county agency to satisfy its lenders -- the Union Labor Life Insurance Company and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce -- and give itself more time to renovate the property's north, east and west buildings. Once the buildings are ready, Cohen Brothers said, it can obtain temporary certificates of occupancy from White Plains, allowing for the space inside to be leased to business tenants.
The future of the entire complex as viable office space is critical to the county, Ms. Waivada explained, because the 430,205 square feet of space that remains to be leased out represents a sizable chunk -- 21.69 percent -- of the 1.98 million square feet of office space in the eastern market segment.
"Buildings that are full generate jobs, disposable income and sales tax revenues," she said.
But the weak economy is not the only reason that Cohen Brothers has fallen behind schedule. The complex has not been an easy one to market, according to Mr. Cohen, in large part because it was designed for a single tenant almost 50 years ago, when General Foods moved from 250 Park Avenue in Manhattan to White Plains.
TODAY, Mr. Cohen is marketing the complex -- his first suburban office venture -- to small- to medium-sized tenants requiring anywhere from 2,500 to 500,000 square feet. The current tenant list in the south building includes Allied Irish Bank; Macsteel Asoma, a steel trading company; America Online; and Nexus Computing Solutions, among others. 
Although asking rents range from $28 to $30 per square foot -- which places 333 Westchester at the high end of Westchester office market, where rents have averaged in the mid-$20's per square foot -- Mr. Cohen said actual rents charged will be competitive with the rest of the county.
The company is requiring, though, that tenants agree to a minimum lease period. "Our mantra is to do business with people who are staying in business," Mr. Cohen said. "We want them to drop anchor with us five or more years."
Salvatore J. Carrera, the county's director of economic development, said that requirement was "more than reasonable," especially since the cost of the work necessary to prepare the space for a particular tenant must be amortized over time.
In his letter to the county agency, Mr. Carlucci, the lawyer, attributed some of Cohen Brothers' current problems to delays caused by unexpected site conditions, not the least of which were boulders at the bottom of new elevator shafts that are being installed as part of the rehabilitation of the buildings.
"For obvious reasons, we couldn't blast in the building," Mr. Cohen said during a recent interview, explaining that workmen had no alternative but to chip away at the stones with pneumatic drills. As a result, the process took far longer than expected, he said.
The company expects to complete lobby and elevator work at the buildings and receive the temporary certificates of occupancy by next April.
It has already renovated the cafeteria and private dining rooms in the south building, which altogether seat 800. And it has rehabbed the 15,000-square-foot fitness area, also in the south building, which has a small basketball court. 
Economic and construction setbacks aside, Mr. Carrera speculated that the most likely reason for the slowness in leasing out the building may be that potential tenants have not been able to visualize the completed space and have chosen to move into quarters that are available immediately -- of which there are plenty available in the county.
"Timing is everything," the director of economic development said. "That and finding the right user for the space. It's like buying a home -- you have to have the right match."
"If a tenant is looking for easy access to Interstate 287," Mr. Carrera said, "this building has that. If they need plenty of parking, they have that too. It's a great office building, and there is no way that this project is a lost cause."

Celebration in Stamford
Kwanzaa, the seven-day observance of the African-American heritage of family and community spirit was founded in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, head of the Black Studies Department at California State University in Long Beach. It has become a nationwide celebration that starts Dec. 26. 
 Josephine Fulcher-Anderson, co-founder of the Stamford Kwanzaa Association, said, "Now more than ever it's important to gather in celebration of life, heritage and family -- for all races to come together in support of our community and nation." 
 The second annual Kwanzaa Celebration in Stamford will be held Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Rich Forum of the Stamford Center for the Arts on 307 Atlantic Street. The celebration is open to the public free of charge.
During the evening, the first of Kwanzaa's seven principles, Umoja (unity), will be celebrated. Also, the meaning of the remaining principles -- self-determination, collective work and responsibility, economic cooperation, purpose, creativity and faith -- will be explored.
Story-telling, poetry, music, African drumming, dance, and audience participation, usually reserved for the close of Kwanzaa, will instead be presented in Wednesday's program.
For free reservations: (203) 325-4466.

Latin Mass on Christmas
The Saint Gregory Society of New Haven has preserved a custom of offering the traditional Latin Mass, or Tridentine Missal, every Christmas Day for the last several decades. The group will do so once again on Tuesday at 8 a.m. at Sacred Heart Church on Columbus Avenue and Liberty Street.
The music will feature the Gregorian chants for the Third Mass of Christmas, "Puer natus est nobis," performed by the Schola Cantorum of the Society, a choral ensemble of 20 professional church musicians. The group has acquired an international reputation for its concerts, radio broadcasts and recordings of sacred choral masterworks.
Music lovers who find an 8 a.m. concert on Christmas morning a bit daunting can hear additional High Masses with Gregorian chant scheduled by the Schola Cantorum on New Year's Day at noon; Jan. 6 (The Feast of the Epiphany) at 2 p.m.; and Jan. 13 (The Feast of the Holy Family) also at 2 p.m.
For information: (203) 624-2751 or (203) 432-9996.

Singing Cowboys
If once-popular songs of the West such as "Cool Water" and "Riders in the Sky" come around again, two New England cowboys could be the catalysts: Gil Dube from Maine and Dave Downs from Connecticut.
Ten years ago they formed a May-September duo (Mr. Dube is 71; Mr. Downs is 40-ish) calling themselves Old Paint and focusing on songs of lonely cattle drives, tough hobo tunes, coal miner's laments and love ballads for all ages.
They have sung and played acoustic guitars and harmonicas in more than 35 sites in Connecticut alone, including the Common Ground Bar in Bristol, where they met; the Center Squeeze Cafe in West Hartford; the Portland Historical Society; the Mattatuck Museum, the Apple Valley Folk Festival, the University of Hartford Folk Festival, the Soup Kitchen Concert Series in Middletown, the Veteran's Home in Rocky Hill, and at several motorcycle rallies.
They will perform at It's Only Natural at 386 Main Street in Middletown on Thursday at 7 p.m. No cover charge.

Monastery Reopens as Housing Complex for Elderly

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: BORDENTOWN 

 BODY:
FROM some angles, the four-story red-brick monastery, part of its nine-acre grounds enclosed by a wall, looks much the same as it did when the building was constructed in 1885.
 But closer inspection reveals a modern two-story addition behind the Romanesque-style monastery, attached to it by a glass atrium, as well as a cluster of smaller structures just beyond the brick wall. Here, new and old have been fused in converting the monastery and its grounds -- previously home to the Sisters of Poor Clare, a Roman Catholic order of cloistered nuns -- into a 137-unit housing complex for the elderly called Clare Estate. 
 The $18 million project, which opened this month, provides three levels of residences, social services and personal care so residents can age in place, according to its developer, CIS & Associates of New Brunswick, a partnership of Christiana Foglio and Dov Gluck, two New Jersey developers.
The complex is in Bordentown's nationally designated historic district, which has more than 700 structures, nearly half built between 1851 and 1900, giving the one-square-mile city a 19th-century look. 
Clare Estate has 50 assisted-living units in the new building, where residents, as part of their monthly rent, receive such services as three meals a day, housekeeping and health care, including medication monitoring. Tenants in the 51 units carved from the old monastery get some services but no health care.
There are also 36 independent-living units in nine two-story buildings dotting the grounds. These units are reserved for people with annual incomes of $21,500 to $28,860, and they rent for $600 to $700 a month. Rents for the assisted units are $2,600 to $2,800 and for the residences in the monastery, $1,700. Five units scattered among the buildings are for lower-income residents and rent for $526 to $600 a month.
"The monastery site," said John W. Collom III, Bordentown's mayor, "had the potential to become an eyesore, but it didn't happen." There had been "a high degree of acceptance" among residents to the idea of recycling the building, he said, adding that its reuse as housing for the elderly was much more attractive than other options for a nine-acre site.
As a project aimed in part at the elderly with modest incomes, Clare Estate is an anomaly. In recent years, all types of housing for the elderly, especially assisted-living units, have sprouted like daisies in response to the state's growing elderly population. Most were built for affluent residents. 
But the high-end market has suffered in the last 18 months from overbuilding and a slackening economy, said Barbara Kleger, president of Senior Living Consultants in Philadelphia, a firm that advises developers but was not involved in Clare Estate. Meanwhile, she added, investors are putting money into projects that fill underserved niches, and the elderly "are shopping for value," not just upscale surroundings. 
Rents for the units at Clare Estate are kept below what they would otherwise be in part because of a $14 million below-market-rate loan from the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, one of three state agencies providing financial assistance to such projects. The rest of the financing includes developer equity and proceeds from the sale of federal historic preservation tax credits. The city also granted a 30-year real estate tax abatement.
Deborah DeSantis, executive director of the finance agency, said that in the five years her agency has offered such loans, it has provided $165 million in financing for 1,400 units in 11 projects, either built or under way. At least 20 percent of the units are for people earning below an area's median income.
"There is nowhere near an oversaturation of affordable units," Ms. DeSantis said. Also in favor of Clare Estate, she added, is that it offers a historic campuslike setting and a continuum of care.
Those factors, along with a convenient location, are what drew Pearl E. Howe, 78, to an independent-living unit at the project. Mrs. Howe, a widow, moved in September from a rental in Bordentown Township.
"I don't have to use my car every time to go shopping," she said. "It is also peaceful here, like the country, but with the city just outside." Knowing that other levels of services and care are available also makes her "a little bit more secure," she said. 
Like others in the community, Mrs. Howe said she is happy the project preserved the monastery. It is "something of an monument," she added. 
FOR as long as old-time residents can remember, the monastery has been a part of the neighborhood's character. It started life as a parochial boarding school, and in 1909 it became home to the Poor Clare Sisters. 
So it came as a blow when the sisters announced several years ago that they could no longer afford to maintain the aging building, which was too large for their shrinking population. Originally, 45 sisters lived at the monastery, and as a self-governing, self-supporting order, they used some of the grounds to grow vegetables. At one time they also baked communion wafers for use in Masses.
There were various proposals to save the building, including a plan by the Bordentown Board of Education to reuse it as a school. But none were realized, mainly because it was too costly to renovate the building.
That worried city officials, who feared the monastery would suffer the same fate as the Bordentown Military Academy. Because it had been difficult to find new uses for the school's main building, it crumbled into an eyesore and ultimately was ravaged by fire and razed. Condominiums now stand on the site. 
But in 1998 CIS & Associates bought the monastery for $1.4 million, with visions of turning it into housing for the elderly. The sisters have since moved to a smaller newly built monastery in nearby Chesterfield.
The developers bought the site because "the building really moved us, and we saw in it something others didn't see -- its potential as more than a cookie-cutter senior housing project," said Mr. Gluck. Among its attractive features are its open land as well as its location close to Routes 130 and 295 and to the New Jersey Turnpike. 
But there were challenges, including piecing together the financing, which took a year. Because the federal government changed its requirements during the application phase, the project was redesigned and the total number of units dropped to 137 from 150. 
Under the design by Parsons + Fernandez-Casteleiro Architects of Manhattan, the old monastery's facade, with its rows of windows with brick arches, like eyebrows, has been restored. Inside, the main building has been transformed to residences as well as public spaces that include a main dining area carved from two former chapels. Such details as stained glass windows, arches and woodwork have been preserved and other features have been given a new uses; a confessional has been turned into a phone booth.
Rather than mimic the monastery," the new building is modern, said Jeff Parsons, a principal, adding that the glass atrium connects the structures and provides views of the monastery's bell tower and the site's 100-year-old oak tree. A barn on the property, which is being retained, offered the inspiration for the simple design of the smaller buildings.
State Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone III of Bordentown said Clare Estate "is the largest and one of the first assisted-living projects in the northern part of Burlington County, where "there is a crying need" for such housing. "It gives seniors a place to stay that is close to family," he added. 
Ms. Foglio said the lack of other comparable developments in the county and the graying of the population would enable Clare Estate "to weather the tightening economy." 
Mayor Collom said the project "is uplifting for the city," which has waxed and waned over the decades and is now on an upswing, and it put a tax-exempt property onto the tax rolls. Mr. Malone added that it also "saves not only a landmark but memories."

Warmer and Fuzzier Scrooges and Grinches?

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS

 BODY:
IF the corporate world is dull, colored in premature grays, then why is Stanley Bing laughing? Could it be the holiday season? Certainly not this year, with its sad undertones and economic malaise. 
 Despite all that's happened, though, Mr. Bing and his co-workers are doing their best to spend the season in the usual way. "We are commuting with friends," he said, "having lunch with friends, going out for drinks with friends and seeing our friends get fired." Because budget-writing time coincides with Christmas, the corporate world, Mr. Bing added, "celebrates the season with layoffs as reliably as the English do with roast goose." 
 As this year of tragic loss, shaken confidence and waves of layoffs draws to an end, it seemed a good time to seek some perspective from a sage veteran of the corporate world, a Westchester resident who slogs to Manhattan on Metro-North each day as thousands of others do. 
Stanley Bing is the pen name of a best-selling author and Fortune magazine columnist named Gil D. Schwartz, a New Rochelle resident who writes with telltale insight and humor about the inner workings of corporations, while trying to keep his identity secret because he also works for an enormous multinational conglomerate. 
"In a craven and cowardly fashion," Mr. Schwartz said, "I hide behind a pen name, disguising the people I work with while I report on life on the inside. I'm a spy and I report on the inside of the world I move around in, at the same time staying true to my country -- my company." 
How well does the disguise work? 
"It is a horrendously kept secret," he said. 
Before entering corporate America more than two decades ago, Mr. Schwartz worked as an actor. "But always in a theater company," he said. "I have a love for organization and structure. The beehive." 
He left the theater and went to work for a large "gigantic multinational, industrial behemoth based in Pittsburgh." At first, he hated having to wear a suit and shave every day. "Now I'm not really comfortable unless I'm shaved and in a suit," he said. "I have Stockholm Syndrome." 
Mr. Schwartz loved that first job. He remembers wistfully going to corporate headquarters where he had be among "two dozen steer-fed executives, none of them under 240 pounds, all with white helmet hair, sitting around a steel gray table."
"I heard them talk about turbines and power plants in this big building that was filled with these industrial people and I was moved."
Mr. Schwartz is fascinated by the ways people organize themselves for work and the ways those organizations bring out the best -- and worst -- in people.
"The public doesn't understand that the corporate world is really like a dysfunctional family," said Mr. Schwartz. "Of course this," he said, motioning around his large corner office at CBS in Midtown Manhattan where he is executive vice president of communications, "is actually the only family from which you can get fired." 
Bosses, he said, are receptors of filial feelings, even when they're younger than employees. "You rage at them, you want to kill them, supplant them. I mean, how much more Greek drama can you get? "As a writer," Mr. Schwartz confirmed, "I have a lot to feast on." 
It was soon after entering corporate America that Mr. Schwartz let his pen loose, capitalizing on his two talents, as a good writer and good bureaucrat. He began to write a monthly column for Esquire magazine, centered upon business advice, like "how to give good phone," as Mr. Schwartz put it. It was proscriptive advice, but "so hostile," Mr. Schwartz admitted, "that if it wasn't funny, it would have been obnoxious." 
For the last seven years, Mr. Schwartz has been writing a biweekly column for Fortune magazine, about his own corporate life and those of others he knew. He has written books, including a novel and the best-selling "What Would Machiavelli Do? The Ends Justify the Meanness" (Harper Business, 2000), which preaches rank meanness as a career tool. 
The book's acknowledgments page begins with Mr. Schwartz (uh, Bing) thanking "Leonard, my first boss, who kept me waiting in his anteroom for three hours one Friday night in 1982 until I realized that he had left by a separate exit without having the courtesy to tell me he was doing so. He is now a multibillionaire who works about six hours a week." 
Mr. Schwartz, 50, who grew up in New Rochelle, has been married to Sue Mittenthal, for 24 years. They have two children.
A book coming out in the spring of 2002 describes how you can use Zen to manage your manager. 
Mr. Schwartz has not relied upon Zen to succeed. "There were times when I kept my position only because I never left my chair," he said. "I just sat in my chair. My bosses would go, 'What are we going to do with him?' But I always had a chair and looked busy and they'd say, 'We'll get him later.' And then those people would be gone and I'd just keep going." 
The corporate world has changed since Sept. 11. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacks on workplaces and people who worked together died together. Anthrax, too, was sent to offices. There was concern and paranoia about everything from planes flying into the office to envelopes to the unknown. 
"It didn't help that so many demented people were phoning in bomb scares," said Mr. Schwartz. "I would walk down Sixth Avenue and see so many workers standing out of their buildings. Nor did Mr. Ridge's maddeningly vague warnings help." 
But as a result of the experience, noted Mr. Schwartz, there has been "a lot more holding onto each other, a lot more sharing of feelings." For a time afterward, every interaction at work was even prefaced with a mention of its inconsequence. 
"People were saying to me 'I know this isn't important, but I want a raise.' " And while Mr. Schwartz noted that corporate Christmas parties this year are for the most part more sober and calmer than usual ("the corporate lampshade allotment is down,") he did draw the line at how far change would ultimately go: "We're not going to sing Cumba-Ya and hug and sway."
In fact, recently, since the question of economic collapse is off the table and the only thing left to answer is exactly when the recovery will come, there has been a sense of relief. With it, said Mr. Schwartz, "the more superficial and idiotic stuff" has seeped back into corporate life.
"We had perspective," he said, "but pretty soon we'll be screaming when the 10 o'clock mail comes at 10:05." And that's not an altogether bad thing. "Life asserts itself in the inconsequential, a drink after work and other irrelevancies," he said. . 
In the end, by returning to such corporate conventions, "We are putting a thumb to our nose" at our attackers.
"It's still pretty cold in here," Mr. Schwartz confirmed from his corner office, "and we like it that way. It's the real world and we're glad to be alive in it."

HEADLINE: On Brighton Beach, a Tide of Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
ON oceanfront land in Brooklyn once occupied by the Brighton Beach Baths, the Muss Organization of Queens is moving into the third year of construction on a condominium project that is reversing the symbolism of the site -- from one linked with the past to one reflecting the possibilities the city holds for its recent immigrants and their children.
 The project is called Oceana, a large-scale development that began in 1999 and will have 15 buildings with 850 apartments when it is finished in about four years. So far five buildings are completed and fully or partially occupied. A sixth is in construction. 
 The Brighton Beach Baths were a sentimental symbol of Brooklyn family life as older people remember it. Starting in 1907, families came on weekends and in the summertime to change clothes in cabanas and take up the favored activities of the era -- swimming, handball, group exercising, sunbathing and mah-jongg. But by the mid-80's it became clear that the Baths' days were numbered. The developer who had purchased the site in 1954 closed the Baths and proposed a large-scale residential development. After many hearings the city approved a plan for 1,600 apartments in the recession year of 1993. It never went forward. 
Years passed. Then Muss went into contract to buy the property and won city approval for a more modest development: 850 apartments along with a 16,000-square-foot clubhouse. Site preparation started in the fall of 1999. 
The large number of immigrant families that Oceana has attracted makes it possible to think of it as a symbol of the future in housing quality that successful immigrants or their children can aspire to in America. Between 50 and 60 percent of the heads of household among the 305 buyers so far were born abroad, the management says. Many of them immigrated only within the last 20 years, often from the former Soviet Union but from other countries as well. Many grew up in America after arrival at a young age and early education in American schools.
All have used savings accumulated in business or the professions to buy housing that has all the elements of luxury living -- spacious apartments with grand views; a gated entrance to a 15-acre site; underground parking and some reserved street-level spaces; attention to design and decor in public spaces; a community building with a health club and a pool. Eventually, if the city can be persuaded, residents will have direct private access to the beach.
Current sales are mainly in a price range of $350,000 to $800,000 and rise as high as $1.2 million for penthouses with direct ocean views. Prices exceed $500,000 for 40 percent of apartments currently on the market. 
The Oceana condominium is not the only new housing in Brooklyn in which recent immigrants evidence their financial achievement. Nor is its housing the most expensive to be found. In Manhattan Beach and Mill Basin and parts of Bergen Beach, immigrant families have been prominent among the recent buyers of new or totally renovated houses selling for upward of $700,000, and as high as $2 million or more. A broker in many of these sales, Jon Sobel, said that in about a dozen sales at more than $1 million over the last two years, five of the buyers were Russian-born. The rest were American-born.
"All these people were well-to-do, and they were self-made too," Mr. Sobel said.
But, as interviews with new buyers at Oceana showed, there is remarkable variety in the twisting paths that led them all to reach their current economic status and then choose to settle in the same Brighton Beach condominium. Few of them appear to have come from a background of poverty. On the contrary, most had successful careers in their homelands, but had the ability to take on and succeed at new careers in America -- or to enable their children to succeed.
The newer immigrants may speak English hesitatingly, but their young children already speak as fluently as natives. As sales proceed, the variety in the ethnic background of buyers is also increasing. And more and more of them are coming from outside Brooklyn.
Steve Maksin and his wife, Natalie, a couple in their 30's who bought at Oceana, are perhaps representative of this newer type of buyer -- younger, Americanized, fluently English-speaking and lacking even shallow roots in Brooklyn. Mr. Maksin arrived -- alone -- from Kiev, Ukraine, only 13 years ago as a high-school graduate. He lived at first with his grandmother, who had immigrated in 1979. Two years later his mother arrived. He met Natalie when they were both undergraduates at the Stern School of Business of New York University. 
"My wife told me that her parents were planning to buy in Brighton Beach and I should go to look at apartments in the same development," said Mr. Maksin, a 34-year-old tax lawyer and accountant working for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Manhattan. "I thought that that would be the last place people would be likely to buy. But when I went to see the place, I was sold." The Maksins paid $285,000 for a two-bedroom second-floor apartment, buying from plans in the fall of 1999. They closed and moved in last February. 
ACCORDING to an analysis of the city's 1999 housing and vacancy survey done by the sociology department at Queens College, an estimated 85,500 households headed by immigrants had incomes of $100,000 or more at that time. Of that total, 7,700 of the households came from the former Soviet Union. The total number of immigrant-headed households in 1999 is calculated by the department to have been 1.14 million. 
In Brighton Beach near the entrance to Oceana -- on Brighton Beach Avenue, half a block from Coney Island Avenue -- the mark of Russian immigration is heavy on local commercial life. A small high-end supermarket called Gourmet Plaza opened a year ago. The women operating the many specialty-food counters in most cases speak Russian only. A small cafe, clothing shops and furriers selling high-priced goods have opened nearby. Yet prices generally seem much lower than in Manhattan. One condominium owner estimated that prices for specialty foods are 30 to 40 percent lower than they are in Manhattan.
The personal tales of the routes that Oceana's buyers traveled to condominium ownership establish the development's claim to be a leading magnet for the successful immigrant in New York City.
Tina Orsini, for example, was born in the Abruzzo region of Italy, on the Adriatic Sea. Her father arrived in the United States in 1955, when she was 7. Her husband, Alfonso, is a third-generation American, with Irish, Italian and Hungarian roots. Mrs. Orsini is an English teacher, currently working on her doctorate at Teachers College of Columbia University. Her husband spends most of the year in the ski-resort town of Leysin, Switzerland, as headmaster of a private school.
The Orsinis both came from middle-class families, but neither had been living in Brooklyn when they bought at Oceana. "We sold our house in Summit, N.J., when Al got an appointment in Switzerland, and when I came back a year and a half later when everything was in storage, I thought we had to re-establish a nest somewhere. My brother was living in Brooklyn, and he said, 'You really have to come and see this place in Brighton Beach.' "
Mrs. Orsini bought a two-bedroom apartment on the second floor of an oceanfront building for $330,000. Her husband had not even seen it when she went into contract, she said. "The community is highly multicultural but with a large Russian population, which I think has brought flavor and beauty to the area," she said. "To me it feels like a place abroad. It's nice to live in a luxurious way in a very local but global community." 
Another Oceana resident is Dr. Pavel Yutsis, 54, who bought a four-bedroom second-floor apartment from plans for $675,000 in May 2000. Born in Odessa, Ukraine, and a graduate of medical school in Voronezh, Russia, Dr. Yutsis arrived in the United States in 1980 with his wife, Lilia, and his son, Max, now 26. Their daughter, Francine, 13, was born in the United States. 
At first the family stayed with in-laws in Newark. While working as a nursing assistant at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J., Dr. Yutsis prepared to take the medical board examinations, which he passed two years later. In 1986 he opened a pediatric practice in Brooklyn and later bought a house in Bensonhurst. Fluent now in English, he is the host of two weekly medical call-in shows: one in English called "From Allergies to Aging" on WWRL and the other in Russian called "The People's Wave" on WPAT.
"There are very few Russians who would not like to live near the beach, especially if they're from Odessa," Dr. Yutsis said. "I could have bought a mansion with 40 rooms, but what would I do with all those rooms?"
Another buyer, Ernesto Custodio, 30, came to the United States from the Dominican Republic at the age of 10. He graduated from the State University of New York at Buffalo and now works, mostly at home, as a computer-network consultant. He and his wife, Lisa, were renting on 105th Street near Central Park West when they started house hunting throughout the metropolitan area on the Internet. They found Oceana on a real-estate Web site.
"We drove around in Brooklyn, and we liked the look of Bay Ridge," Mr. Custodio said, "but they just had regular apartments there that didn't seem to justify the commute." The couple bought a 1,200-square-foot one-bedroom apartment at Oceana on the first floor, selling at the time for $310,000. 
"I had never been to this place before," Mr. Custodio said. "But we like the beach and we take advantage of the club, and it's not a bad commute." Using the Q line express train, called the Q-diamond, the commute to Midtown takes about 45 minutes.
THE Muss Organization's purchaser-profile data on the first 200 sales last February showed that 73 percent of those buyers had incomes over $100,000 a year. Almost half the buyers were former renters, and the rest had owned a home.
Sixty percent of the buyers formerly lived in Brooklyn, and most of the rest came from other boroughs of the city. The information on occupations showed that 84 were self-employed and 30 were in computer-related businesses. The next-largest category was doctors -- 17. Forty of the first 200 buyers were retirees, and about a third had not yet turned 30.
Most of the early buyers were local people, largely Russian or of Russian extraction, who had been waiting for years for the redevelopment of the Baths site to succeed. But more recently, as Oceana has become better known, the buying pool has widened geographically. One attraction has been its on-site parking capacity, for 1,200 cars, a ratio of 1.5 cars per apartment. About 90 percent of the parking is underground. The typical ratio of parking in those mid-density Brooklyn projects that have parking at all is 0.6, or 6 spaces for every 10 apartments. About three-quarters of Oceana buyers own at least one car.
The Muss Organization acquired the property in 1999 after spending two years winning city approval for its proposed revision of a higher-density plan that had been approved six years earlier for the previous owner, the Miami Beach firm of Alexander Muss & Sons. Its principal, Stephen Muss, is Joshua's cousin. His view-oriented plan called for four tall towers with a total of 1,600 apartments, with many studios and one-bedrooms.
Joshua Muss, steeped in more conventional New York City midrise development, was unenthusiastic about that plan aesthetically, but faced two practical impediments that led him to abandon it and start over. The first was that it was extremely costly to build. The second was that it would have been nearly impossible to finance. "We would have had to finance 400 apartments at a time," he said. "Can you imagine finding yourself in a terrible market when you're building 400 apartments?"
Instead, Muss Development turned to the San Francisco firm of Sandy & Babcock International, working with the Manhattan architectural firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman & Efron, to redesign the project. Stanley Krebushevsky was the zoning consultant. 
The site plan is intended to create a "parklike neighborhood feeling," Muss says, with a circular road and 15 midrise buildings of 7 to 12 stories surrounding the central clubhouse. The carousel that was a notable feature of the Brighton Beach Baths was disassembled and donated to the New York Aquarium in Coney Island, which plans to restore it as a grand entrance and visitors center.
The Carlyle Group of Washington is a financial partner in the Oceana project. Construction financing is obtained on a building-by-building basis from the Bank of New York.
One fundamental change brought by Muss Development has been in the apartment mix. Instead of many smaller apartments in what was to have been a rental development, Oceana's for-sale apartments are all two bedrooms or larger, and 90 percent are either three bedrooms or convertible into three bedrooms in space built as a den or dining area.
Generous apartment size was one of the attractions for Phyllis and Irwin Shanes, an American-born couple who bought a 1,900-square-foot four-bedroom apartment with three baths and an ocean view for $685,000 a year ago. The Shanes, both retired, had been living in the Seacoast middle-income co-op next door to the Baths property for the last 15 years. 
"Most of our friends have moved to retirement communities in New Jersey, or they went to Florida," said Mrs. Shanes, whose husband was the administrator of a union health and welfare fund. "But I was happy here. I like the underground parking, and the closets. We bought a surface parking spot at our door too, so we can give a place to anyone who comes to visit us." Outdoor parking sells for an average of $35,000 a space, with a monthly maintenance fee of $35. Indoor space rents for $200 a month plus tax. 
THE development is not without Asian representation. Winnie Cheng and her husband, Lee Fong, a lawyer, arrived with their families about 30 years ago as teenagers, she from mainland China and he from Hong Kong. They met through friends, married in the 70's and later bought a house in Oyster Bay, N.Y. Their two sons are in college. A month ago they closed on a $400,000 two-bedroom apartment at Oceana, but are keeping their Long Island house, mainly for weekend use.
"We needed a place closer to the city for commuting," Ms. Cheng said. It matters little to them that there are so few Asian-born Americans in Brighton Beach. "We are from New York City, and today we do business with people of all ethnic backgrounds," she said. 
But Luba Dubrova's family is perhaps more representative of the early buyers. Ms. Dubrova, a 21-year-old senior at Brooklyn College, spoke no English at all when she arrived with her family from Minsk in 1989. She lives with her parents, Elvira Dubrova and Lev Klaynberg, and her grandmother, Marya Dubrova, in a 1,770-square-foot penthouse purchased for $625,000. 
Her parents, reluctant about giving an interview in English, sent their daughter on that mission. Her father worked for a printing company in Minsk, but now he works as a manager at his brother Joseph's company in Manhattan, Wonder Works Construction. The family rented apartments in Bensonhurst and at Trump Village on Ocean Parkway before buying their Oceana apartment.
"I went to P.S. 247 after we arrived in Bensonhurst," Ms. Dubrova said in accentless English. "One day I didn't speak, and the next day I couldn't stop talking."

HEADLINE: Thriving on a World in Crisis; 
Life at the Woodrow Wilson School, a Training Ground for Policy Wonks, After Sept. 11

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
LIKE a ghost, a stark, white reminder of the fallen World Trade Center stands over a corner of Princeton University.
 Aptly, Robertson Hall -- home to the university's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and designed by the same architect responsible for the twin towers -- has a similar soaring lobby set behind arching columns. 
 These days, the resemblance is a reflection of the building's purpose, since the world finds itself turning to the Woodrow Wilson School and a handful of institutions like it that serve as training grounds for those whose job it will be to make sense of the world in the aftermath of Sept. 11.
Unfortunately, the Woodrow Wilson School finds itself in something of a bind. At a time when the United States is embroiled in a war against terrorism and needs experienced operatives on the ground, the Woodrow Wilson School -- by its own admission as well as those of academics at other schools -- is heavy on traditional scholarship and teaching. 
Richard Falk, who retired from Princeton last year after teaching international affairs for 40 years, said that the school had lost some of its strength in international relations over the years and had become "dominated by economists and by an economistic view."
"It has been a period in which, due to retirements and resignations, it has not sustained its strength in international relations," Mr. Falk said. "It used to be very strong, perhaps the strongest, in international relations."
And for his part, Joseph J. McCarthy, associate dean at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University -- which often competes with the Wilson school for the best students -- said he thought his institution was more real-world oriented. 
"If you were going to distinguish between the schools," said Mr. McCarthy, "our faculty, while it includes many people trained in the disciplines of economics and political science, also includes -- more so than the Woodrow Wilson School -- individuals from the world of policy, former senators, members of congress and the foreign service."
Indeed, before the economy began to cool the well-crammed heads of Woodrow Wilson students were being turned by lucrative salaries at consulting firms and investment banks.
Now, said Fred Hitz, the school's director of the Project on International Intelligence and a former inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency, students are approaching him for help in starting careers at the agency.
"For a long time the C.I.A. and the government was really persona non grata on campus," said Mr. Hitz. "Students have awakened to the possibility of being of service, and that's music to my ears."
Shirley Tilghman, who was installed as Princeton's president in May and baptized by fire during the week of Sept. 11 -- which also was the first week of classes in her new tenure -- put it this way:
"What all of us are very conscious of since Sept. 11 is the importance of the school of public policy. We have seen a rekindling of student interest in public service. Students are interested in everything from R.O.T.C. to the C.I.A., and I think that's a very good and healthy sign that students see public service as a lofty goal."
That was echoed by Robert L. Hutchings, the assistant dean, who said he expected that the events of Sept. 11 would renew interest in government service.
"There's been a shift away from government to the nonprofit sector," said Dr. Hutchings, a former member of the National Security Agency and an ambassador at large to Eastern Europe. "Many students were averse to the unappealing bureaucracy in the U.S. government or the World Bank or the U.N. One effect of Sept. 11 was to show that if you want to be where the action is, if you want to influence big policy, then it's better to be in government than at a small nonprofit."
Founded in 1930, the school has produced thousands of influential alumni and has a reputation for offering a strong academic footing for those interested in careers in Washington or around the world.
Little more than a decade ago, Nicholas Rasmussen was a student at the Woodrow Wilson School working on simulations of a war between the United States and Russia; today he is a director of the National Security Council's office of combating terrorism.
"As I have gone through my career, I am continually running into alumni I know -- and people I didn't know were alumni -- at all levels of the government," said Mr. Rasmussen.
Anthony Lake, former assistant to President Bill Clinton for national security affairs and currently a professor at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, had been a foreign service officer in Vietnam before enrolling at the Woodrow Wilson School.
Once there, he helped a professor write a book about the sociology of Vietnam that he said "helped me understand still more about the underlying reasons for what we were experiencing in Vietnam."
The school has 90 juniors and 90 seniors in the undergraduate program, while 65 students -- of the 600 who applied this semester alone -- are in each of its two-year master's of public administration classes. In addition, there are 30 students in a Ph.D. program and 20 in a new one-year mid-career program for public servants who have been in the field for at least seven years. That group includes a state legislator from Guadalajara, Mexico, a doctor from the Food and Drug Administration and a United Nations peacekeeping officer who had served in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
The school currently has 2,463 alumni working -- 8 percent work for foreign governments, 12 percent in the field of education, 18 percent work for the federal government and 19 percent work for nongovernmental organizations or multilateral agencies. The remainder -- about 43 percent -- were in such fields as law, urban planning, consulting, communications and finance. 
For now, James Trussell, the school's associate dean, said it was too soon to know if the terrorist attacks would generate more applications for next fall or a shift in student concentration from domestic to international affairs.
"There are trends in student interest over time," said Dr. Trussell, who has been at the school for 29 years. "As the country becomes more isolationist so do our students, and they shift away from international affairs. Sometimes there is a boom in students interested in domestic, and other times a boom in students interested in international. These are all cycles that wax and wane."
From 1902 to 1910, when Woodrow Wilson was president of the university, he envisioned the creation of a law school to specialize in training students for public service. But a special committee made up of lawyers felt a law school would defeat Wilson's idea of a broader education, according to a history of the school written by an alumnus, William K. Selden.
In 1930, the university decided to create a school as a memorial to Wilson, but did not name it for him until 1946, when its endowment was firmly established.
The school received a huge boost in 1961 when Charles Robertson -- a member of the Princeton class of 1926 who managed the investments of his wife, Marie, an heiress to the A&P grocery fortune -- donated $35 million. The endowment has since grown to $550 million.
"My parents wanted to make a significant gesture of philanthropy, and I think they wanted to address the current state of world affairs, which included the cold war and the threat from the Soviet Union," said their son, Bill Robertson. 
With the Robertsons' money, the school more than doubled the size of its graduate program to 40 students for each class, hired additional faculty members and built Robertson Hall, designed by Minoru Yamasaki. In 1979, Princeton's board allowed the endowment to be handled independent of the university's finances, and the younger Mr. Robertson, a 1972 Princeton graduate, manages the fund with a board trustees.
Of course, the endowment allows the school to lure top professors to Princeton, where many have joint appointments with the Wilson school.
To be sure, Stephen W. Bosworth, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Boston said the Woodrow Wilson School was set apart from the other major public policy schools in two distinct ways: it was smaller, and it was very rich.
"They are affluent, to put it mildly," said Mr. Bosworth.
The institution's endowment also allows it to offer full scholarships to attract the best applicants. This year, students in the first year of the master's program -- who are paying $26,530 in tuition -- will receive a stipend of up to $13,000 for living expenses. Indeed, median financial aid to first-year master's students this year is $38,530.
That can make a difference in the shape of a career. Without a large burden of education loans, students can resist the more lucrative jobs in the private sector and instead accept a job in public service that could later grow into an influential policy position.
Kavita Ramdas, director of the Global Fund for Women, grew up in India and came to the Woodrow Wilson School on full scholarship.
"That's something the Woodrow Wilson School is well-known for," said Ms. Ramdas. "It makes it one of the more diverse graduate schools in public affairs because people who wouldn't be able to afford Princeton get a full scholarship."
Yet Mr. Bosworth, a former United States Ambassador to South Korea, said that having a faculty independent of the rest of the school had its advantages.
"We are in a position to set our own academic agenda and professional agenda in a way we could not if we did not have our own faculty," he said.
Sometimes the school's faculty -- by definition trained to look at events through a more cosmic prism -- can find itself at odds with the world around it.
For instance, Michael Rothschild, the dean of the school, was recently among three faculty members singled out in a report entitled "Defending Civilization: How Our Universities Are Failing American and What Can Be Done About It," prepared by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni in Washington -- a conservative nonprofit group devoted to curbing liberal tendencies in academia.
Mr. Rothschild was quoted at a town meeting on campus on Sept. 11 as saying: "There is a terrible and understandable desire to find and punish whoever was responsible for this. But as we think about it, it's very important for Americans to think about our own history, what we did in World War II to Japanese citizens by interning them."
Although the words of Mr. Rothschild -- one of 117 professors accused of unpatriotic behavior after Sept. 11 -- were held up by conservatives as proof that academia was out of step with the rest of the country, he said he had no regrets.
"I am a liberal," he said. "I am a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.
Zia U. Mian, a Pakistani lecturer at the school and a leader of the Princeton Peace Network, which has been critical of the American war in Afghanistan, tried to sum up the peace movement not only on the Princeton campus but at many leading universities around the country.
While Mr. Mian said it was "hard to be critical in a time of war and when thousands of innocent Americans have died," he did not hesitate to offer that "well-meaning mistakes" on the part of Americans might have contributed to the Islamic rage.
"Nobody really wants to talk about the fact that this is tied to the politics of oil in Saudi Arabia," he said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Rothschild said the school reflected all views, then quickly named off three left-leaning economists and three on the right.
"Is there a tilt?" he said. "I can't find it."
Defending the school's position in the universe of public policy institutions, Mr. Rothschild said it had a strong reputation as a feeder to national security and such multilateral agencies as the United Nations and the World Bank. In addition, he noted that it had been adding new centers to expand its policy expertise in other areas. 
For example, he said, "You just can't be a serious public policy school without an ability to understand health care."
Consequently Lee Silver, who taught microbiology for 17 years at Princeton, is now teaching at the Woodrow Wilson School's program in science, technology and environmental policy.
"I'm having the time of my life," said Dr. Silver. "It's been a whole new perspective on the world."
He said the disconnect was most evident in the early days of the recent anthrax scare.
"The Bush administration made a huge mistake when they did not contact scientists right away," Dr. Silver said. "They had no idea what they were talking about. It's a classic example."
Then there is Christina Paxson, director of the Wilson School's two-year-old Center for Health and Wellbeing, an economist who is trying to nurture interdisciplinary projects that go beyond the traditional health-policy work.
"The focus is on human wellbeing instead of looking at causes of specific diseases," Dr. Paxson said. "We're trying to look more broadly at determinants of emotional, mental and physical well-being."
Still, Mr. Mian said he thought the Woodrow Wilson School was at a disadvantage at the moment because it did not have a department devoted solely to Southeast Asia. While he acknowledged it would be difficult for the school to have every region of the world covered to that extent, he said, "The lack of programmatic depth is showing here."
For his part, Mr. Bosworth of Tufts -- a former United States Ambassador to South Korea -- also said the Woodrow Wilson School was known for putting academics ahead of practitioners.
Ultimately, however, he said it was difficult to compare the top public affairs school because each had its own emphasis.
"Harvard is large and focused on domestic policy," he said. "Fletcher graduates many students who go into international business. Woodrow Wilson is well-known for its emphasis on academics and public-service.
Mr. Rothschild admitted that the school's program was skewed heavily toward academics taught by experienced Princeton professors, though he said that in recent years it had been integrating more real-world practitioners into the school.
Of the handful of top-flight schools with expertise in diplomacy and international affairs, Dr. Hutchings said that the Woodrow Wilson School and Harvard's John F. Kennedy School were often compared.
"The quality of the education is similar, but the size and general feel of the place is quite different," he said.
For instance, he said that the Kennedy school "had an edge in bringing practicing experts to campus, while Woodrow Wilson's strength was in the quality of its teaching."
"In the public-policy arena, you really need people with strong theoretical training that is also linked to real-world public policy problems," Dr. Hutchings said. "I find it's easy to do one or the other, but to do both is a trick."
He agreed that "at the academic end of the spectrum, the quality of the faculty at the Woodrow Wilson School is unparalleled."
"Where we have to work harder," he said, "is to relate our work to real-world public policy issues."
For years, Mrs. Tilghman said, public policy education had focused largely on economics and political science.
"But one of the great strengths of the Wilson school is the much greater breadth of academic disciplines that impact on public policy," she said. "I would argue that's one of the great strengths of the school."
She said the Woodrow Wilson School has tended to be more fundamental, but that the direction of the school would be determined in large part by a new dean, whom she hoped to select by July.
After a tenure of six years, Mr. Rothschild, an economic theorist, announced this year that he would return to full-time research and teaching.
"I can think of nothing better," he said.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
The Home Equity Highway: Busy and Hazardous

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
EARLIER this year, Patrick Conner realized that he might face a delicate financial moment.
 Mr. Conner, 63, and his second wife, Carol, were about to send their 18-year-old daughter, Kelly, off to college. But the couple had been unable to save enough money to pay for all four years of her education, at La Roche College in Pittsburgh. 
 Mr. Conner, an administrative manager in a Merrill Lynch sales office in Manhattan, knew that he would have to pay the $100,000 for her education out of his income because his wife did not work outside the home. Complicating matters, his income depends partly on a year-end bonus. And this has not been a stellar year for the market. 
Last month, he took out a home equity line of credit. His home in Stamford, Conn., is valued at more than $400,000, and he owed $190,000 on the mortgage that he took out more than 10 years ago. Mr. Conner paid $200 in fees for a 10-year, $100,000 credit line, called a Merrill Lynch Equity Access loan, with a floating rate pegged at three-quarters of a point above the prime rate; that means the loan rate is now 5.5 percent.
If Mr. Conner's income suffers, he will have money to pay the educational costs; if he doesn't need it, he won't use it. "My intention is to never draw it down," he said. "It's a kind of insurance based on the appraised value of the house."
Not everyone is as sophisticated as Mr. Conner. Amid the rush to take advantage of declining interest rates, some consumers seem tempted to regard home equity loans as "free" money.
In their marketing pushes, financial institutions make the loans sound alluring. A radio commercial from the Mortgage Warehouse, a finance company in Huntington, N.Y., promises to "put hundreds or thousands of extra dollars in your pocket." Signs at many Citibank branches proclaim: "There must be $25,000 hidden in your house. We can help you find it." An Internet search for "home equity loans" or "consumer debt consolidation" shows hundreds of companies offering loans or credit lines.
The appeal is undeniable, particularly for anyone in danger of losing a job. Real estate values, on the whole, have remained strong despite increasing unemployment, recession and war. But if possible, it's far better to get a home equity loan before a layoff is announced at work, because most financial institutions look askance at lending to someone who is unemployed -- and because the loan process may take three months.
Home equity loans have advantages over some other forms of credit. The loans are certainly less expensive than carrying debt on credit cards, many of which still have interest rates of 15 percent or more. (As of Thursday, the average rate on a fixed-rate home equity loan was 7.15 percent, according to bankrate.com, which tracks loan rates.) And interest on credit card debt is not tax deductible, while interest on the first $100,000 of a home equity loan is. Tapping home equity is usually easier than borrowing against a 401(k) retirement plan, the value of which may be depressed because of stock market losses. 
But there are smart ways and not-so-smart ways to play the home equity card. Over all, it should be done from a position of strength, not vulnerability. 
Cynthia Stewart, 45, a single mother of three from Uniondale, N.Y., was in financial difficulty in late 1999. One day, she received an unsolicited check in the mail from Beneficial for $1,000. All she had to do was go to a nearby branch and sign the check. "They baited me," she said.
Ms. Stewart ended up taking out a $22,000 home equity loan in November 1999. Because of her past credit problems her loan had a variable interest rate that started at 20.15 percent and was set to the prime rate plus 11.9 percent, far above the national average. The loan had an origination fee of $1,150 (more than 5 percent of the loan amount) and carried annual fees of $50 for the remainder of the loan. In addition, she took out credit insurance (common for borrowers with poor credit ratings). 
The terms of the loan, Ms. Stewart said, were partly responsible for her having to file for bankruptcy earlier this year. It turns out that she didn't understand all the fine print. "When you're in financial distress, you're not thinking clearly," said Ms. Stewart, who is an assistant train dispatcher for New York City Transit. 
Household International in Prospect Heights, Ill., which operates Beneficial, said that it had not "baited" Ms. Stewart and that it had helped her to pay off six other debts and to save $400 a month in payments. "We dealt with her in good faith," said Lisa Sodeika, a vice president at Household International.
For a home equity borrower, the biggest risk from a loan default is the possible loss of the home, not to mention a bad credit rating. Financial advisers and bankers thus urge caution during uncertain economic times. If a breadwinner in a household is worried about losing a job, the first step should not be to borrow more money. 
"If you're expecting some financial distress, focus more on trimming back your expenses or increasing savings as a shelter against future financial difficulty," said John Nichols, president of the home equity division at the Bank of New York. The number of home equity loans at his division has risen 70 percent this year over last. 
Many other lenders also report an increase in home equity lending, partly because of the lower interest rates. At the end of the third quarter, outstanding loans totaled $689.7 billion, up 12 percent from the same time last year, according to the American Bankers Association. 
Financial advisers say people who are having financial problems should use a home equity loan or line of credit only as a last resort. Other ways to cut expenses should be explored first, they say. 
Opening a line of credit and using it, though, are two different things -- a distinction of which Mr. Conner is aware. Advisers agree with him that the line should be used sparingly. And an old rule still applies: if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Experts also say that if a home equity loan is used to consolidate debts and to eliminate expensive credit card bills, a change in spending behavior is essential. Too often, they say, consumers tap into their home equity but then run up the same kinds of credit card bills that got them into trouble in the first place. 
"It's your house you're playing with," said Bert Halliday, a senior financial consultant at Merrill Lynch who advises Mr. Conner. Some home equity loan customers do not understand that this form of lending involves a lien on their homes, just as a first mortgage does.
Not all home equity loans are created equal. Some are "balloon" loans that offer cheaper interest rates for the first two or three years but then adjust rates to market conditions. That could be an unpleasant surprise if rates rise again. "These products come in a variety of flavors," said Mr. Nichols of the Bank of New York. 
The terms, of course, are different for fixed home equity loans and lines of credit. With a fixed, or term, loan, borrowers receive a lump sum that they pay off over a specific period at a set rate. A line of credit, usually carrying a variable interest rate, works more like a credit card -- borrowers withdraw up to a certain amount as they need it, paying only interest on that amount. The most common type of credit line is for 10 years, which means borrowers do not have to begin repaying the principal until 10 years after the loan's origination. Borrowers are advised to pay more than the interest during the 10-year period, to avoid bigger payments later.
ANOTHER consideration is the debt-to-equity ratio. Typically, banks let you borrow only up to 80 percent of the value of your home. Some institutions, however, offer to lend 100 percent to 125 percent. 
"If debt reaches 80 percent of the value of a home, consumers should ask themselves hard questions," said Brad Scriber, housing coordinator for the Consumers Federation of America in Washington. "Under no circumstances should consumers take out loans over 100 percent."
Experts also warn against assuming that interest rates will remain low, or that real estate values will remain high. They also recommend going to the holder of your first mortgage to see if you can get a better deal as an existing customer. Shopping, of course, is crucial -- rates and closing costs should be compared, as well as fees over the life of the loan; do not think only of monthly cash flow. If warranted, seek help from a financial adviser, accountant or lawyer. 
Mr. Conner has some simple advice for would-be borrowers. "If you do it for the right reason, it makes a lot of sense."

(George Ruhe for The New York Times) Chart: "Unlocking Your Home's Value"Considering a home equity loan? Here are a few suggestions from the Consumer Federation of America. DO*Compare the offers of several lenders.*Review your credit report so you know how good your credit is, and identify any errors.*Know the terms of your loan before you sign. Does it have a fixed or adjustable interest rate? Does it have a low teaser rate, with higher rates possible later? Is there a prepayment penalty?*Evaluate the total cost of the loan, including all points, fees and closing costs.*Know the total amount you will have to pay over the life of the loan.*Beware of high fees, credit insurance and negative amortization -- a payment schedule that does not lower the balance due on a loan. DON'T *Act impulsively or under pressure.*Respond to lenders or brokers who call you, without doing research.*Underestimate your credit rating and accept a more expensive loan than you qualify for.*Accept a prepayment penalty if you may want to pay off the loan early.*Take out a mortgage or combination of mortgages for more than 100 percent of the value of your home.*Use your home equity to pay off other debts.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for GAIL D. FOSLER; 
Even Without a Stimulus Plan, the Outlook Brightens

BYLINE:  By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
THE failure of Congress last week to reach agreement on a package to stimulate the economy raised some fears that the recession, the first in a decade, could linger well into next year. But not all forecasters view the deadlock in Washington as bad news. 
Gail D. Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group in New York, has become less pessimistic about the economy than she was a few months ago. She spoke on Thursday about the stimulus package in Congress and the economic outlook. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
 RICK GLADSTONE

Q. Will the inability of Congress to reach a deal this year on a stimulus package hurt the economy?

A. Actually, the economy was beginning to rebound before the attacks, and as we look at the economy over the last three months, we're setting a stage for a move back to growth in the first quarter. I think people will be surprised at how modest the decline is in the fourth quarter.
 Retail numbers have been going up and prices are going down. That is coming out of inventories. And durable-goods orders suggest that business spending and investment did not decline faster in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. When you add all this up, the consumer sector is going to look surprisingly strong in the fourth quarter. So, it's not a great market. You can't just put out the cheese -- you have to discount the cheese. But people are out and they're spending money.

Q. Is it too late for Congress to help the economy recover?

A. Had this all come much sooner, it could have helped to reduce the risk factor that everyone, including myself, had assigned to the economy. You had to, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, create some possible outcomes that were pretty dire. And so if the government had stepped in, say, in the middle of October, or even in the beginning of November, with a stimulus package, it would have given consumer confidence and business confidence a kind of a lift -- yes, help was on the way, and you could discount some of the worst outcomes. This may turn out to be, in terms of absolute duration, one of the shorter recessions, and it may turn out to be one of the mildest. I'm old enough to remember when things were really, really bad. Back in 1981-82, we had 10 percent unemployment. We haven't got to there.

Q. The stimulus package would have given billions of dollars in tax breaks to businesses. Which ones lost out the most?

A. The most capital-intensive businesses -- airlines, basic commodities, basic industry, the steel industry -- almost anybody outside the service sector that's investing in high tech. The losses are pretty much according to the level of capital investment as a share of total spending. But their cash flow turned positive in third quarter and more positive in fourth quarter. This would have added to improvement in cash flow. We will get to where we would have been, but more slowly.

Q. Do you expect another tax-cut bill, including corporate tax breaks, before 2004?

A. I don't think so. I think there was a pretty strong rationale, given the credit squeeze, of trying to put cash in businesses' pockets. Once you initiate a tax bill, it literally snowballs, so it's impossible to keep a tax bill from becoming a Christmas tree. Can you have that with other things riding along? It's hard to make that case, because we're moving back into a more profitable corporate environment. So some of the urgency one might have felt in the last six months, certainly the last six weeks, dissipates.

Q. Many investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates around the middle of next year. What is your view?

A. The Fed could take rates from 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent, I would think around the middle of 2002, the third quarter, but then I think the Fed could hold rates constant for quite a while. I view this recovery as rather sort of flattish -- we will move back to positive growth, but a 1 or 2 percent growth range for nine months or so. So while the Fed might redress its exceptionally low rates, the notion they will go into a tightening phase is just misguided.

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
Going Global? Forget Borders

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
IN the early 1990's, Motorola was king of the wireless telephone game. Few Americans had even heard of a Finnish company called Nokia, based in a suburb of Helsinki. Motorola was fat and content; Nokia was the ambitious challenger. It dispatched executives to California, Japan and London to see the latest ways in which people were using their cellphones. Nokia combined that knowledge with what was happening in the Finnish market, one of the most advanced in percentage of cellphone users.
 As a result of that effort, according to the authors of a new book, Nokia grabbed the lead over Motorola globally, embracing digital telephony and designing phones that were stylish and easy to use. Motorola, they say, didn't have eyes and ears in all the important places to sense where the market was going; it was blindsided. "Fishing for innovation in a restricted, local pool, Motorola missed the shift to digital mobile telephony," the authors say. 
 The book is "From Global to Metanational: How Companies Win in the Knowledge Economy" (Harvard Business School Press, $29.95). The writers were Yves Doz, Jose Santos and Peter Williamson, all professors at Insead, the French business school. 
Their subject is complex, and the prose isn't exactly heart-pounding. But this is must reading for anyone who seeks to do international business from the inside, or to observe the workings of multinationals from the outside. In fact, this is one of the freshest and most important books about managing multinational companies to emerge in recent years.
The book argues that companies must move from their current methods of organization to a new model that the authors call "metanational." They describe this model as one step more sophisticated than the "transnational" one depicted by Christopher A. Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal in another book, "Managing Across Borders," in 1989. (An updated paperback version of "Managing Across Borders" will be published next year, also by Harvard.)
American multinationals have such strong domestic bases that they started globalizing by merely projecting what they had learned at home to faraway places, the "Metanational" authors contend. In that sense, General Motors projects from its base in Detroit, just as Intel does from its base in Silicon Valley.
Over time, many American multinationals have fine-tuned that model by establishing country or regional managers on the ground, brand or technology managers with global responsibility, and a headquarters staff that keeps centralized control. Because someone selling Procter & Gamble detergent in Japan must report to both a Japan manager and a global detergent manager, this management system is called a "matrix." 
American multinationals that are organized along these lines have rarely been good at taking full advantage of new knowledge or new insights in the faraway lands where they operate, Mr. Doz, Mr. Santos and Mr. Williamson write. They cite the example of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, rightly regarded as a highly innovative company. Its researchers in Germany invented an exciting new adhesive that German auto makers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW were eager to use in their products. The Japanese subsidiary of 3M learned of the breakthrough and started selling the new adhesive in Japan. Eventually it filtered back into the United States and was called a major breakthrough, but the process of spreading it throughout the company happened largely by accident. "This sort of story is, indeed, a miracle when it happens inside a traditional matrix, because there is little or nothing inside that structure to encourage the melding of dispersed knowledge to create breakthrough innovation," the authors say.
SO what has to happen? American multinationals, the authors say, have to learn from some smaller European, Japanese and Taiwanese companies that have found ways to sense new pockets of knowledge and to mobilize them globally. Increasingly, successful companies will be the ones that find new ideas in distant lands and transform them into global products. That's what the authors mean by the ability to exploit the "knowledge economy."
Not surprisingly, smaller companies in Europe and Asia are leading the way, the authors write. These companies haven't had any choice but to move knowledge in new, innovative ways to compete against bigger, older corporate giants. Aside from Nokia, the authors are impressed with STMicroelectronics, a French-Italian semiconductor company; PixTech, a French start-up that makes a type of display used in electronic devices; PolyGram, the music company based in London; Acer, the Taiwan-based maker of computers and other electronics gear; and Shiseido, the Japanese cosmetics maker. All learned how to identify knowledge that is complex and "sticky" in the authors' terminology -- meaning it was deeply embedded in a distant and unfamiliar environment -- and to transform it into something of commercial value around the world.
Polygram, for example, sells music in many national markets, but it is always on the lookout for performers in those markets whose work can be transformed and marketed to create hits in other markets or even globally. To do that, Polygram set up an International Repertoire Center, a network of 75 professionals. Roughly one-third are scouts scattered across the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. They identify local talent but also understand the local promotional, marketing and sales plans that are so important in creating a hit. That's sticky knowledge. 
Members of this network are not compensated as part of their national divisions; they are rewarded based on how their network performs globally. That is essential in building a metanational structure, the authors contend.
To make the transition to this nimbler form of corporate organization, companies must create three planes of activity, the book says. The first is the "sensing" plane -- a group of people around the world who prospect for new knowledge, or "sense" it. This plane is expensive, because a company's best and most highly compensated talent must be turned loose for frequent travel and international meetings. These sensors find new knowledge among customers, partners, rivals, suppliers or distributors.
Once that plane has found valuable knowledge, including technologies that may disrupt the way the company has operated for many years, it relays the knowledge to a "magnet" plane. This group, also spread around the world, has the primary job of working inside the company to disseminate the knowledge.
Finally, the knowledge should be melded and infused into a third, or "operations," plane. It comprises people who actually make things, market them and have face-to-face contact with distributors or customers.
In effect, the authors of "Metanational" are proposing a new vocabulary and organizational model for how global companies should be organized and managed. One clear implication is that country managers aren't very important any more. The sites where the sensing plane operates can span several countries, and if those sites have common ground, they should manage their activities without taking direction from a country manager.
"The national subsidiaries' role as the basic building blocks of a transnational structure is fundamentally at odds with the way metanationals need to view the world," the authors write. That's one difference between their work and that of Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Ghoshal. If taken to heart, the advice offered in "Metanational" would require multinationals to rip up their organizational charts.
Becoming a metanational also implies behavioral changes at the top. The job of the chief executive is no longer to preside over a "center" that projects knowledge and technology to the world; instead, he or she must attract senior talent from all over the world to the headquarters, and must view the headquarters as a node in a network.
"The C.E.O. in a metanational is not the commander of mission control but more like a head of state who unifies three suborganizations (sensing, magnet and operations) with a common interest," the authors write. A chief executive shouldn't spend time managing operations, but should concentrate on the sensing and magnet planes.
PERHAPS the biggest question hanging over the book's line of argument is whether managements of multinational companies can get from here to there. Already, the internal decision-making of large multinationals is chokingly complex. Mr. Doz, Mr. Santos and Mr. Williamson contend that they need new mentalities, cultures, systems and processes and that these cannot be shoehorned into existing operating units. To make matters even trickier, some of the sensing and magnet organizations that a company sets up will prove temporary in nature; others will endure. Moving people in and out of these units, and figuring out how to compensate and motivate them, will require tremendous skill.
The authors dedicate a chapter to the here-to-there issue. They acknowledge that it isn't easy. The alternative, however, is being overtaken by competitors like Nokia who seemingly come out of nowhere to roll out innovative products and attack the profitability of incumbents. If the authors are right, there just might not be a choice but to take the leap into a metanational future.

To Understand, Go to the Source
The authors of "From Global to Metanational" describe how Shiseido, a cosmetics company in Japan, recognized that it needed to develop its perfume business, but also that the best knowledge about perfume was concentrated in France. Following are excerpts from the book, describing how Shiseido succeeded.
"Plugging into this type of complex knowledge requires living and experiencing it in order to learn. It cannot be accessed through market research reports or a search of the Internet. A company learns the perfume business by having some of its people experience what goes on in a successful perfume house, so that they can 'creep into the minds' of people who have spent years honing their subtle skills."
"To plug into the fragrance knowledge base in France, Shiseido had to be in that business in France. Shiseido created BPI (Beaute Prestige International) in Paris, a 100 percent subsidiary specializing in the development and sales of fragrances. BPI aimed at the top segment. Its success would be assessed by French, not Japanese, standards. Shiseido hired a French female C.E.O. (another bold step for a Japanese company.)"
"Despite many conflicts of a cultural nature, in areas such as research, planning, marketing, and sales, the Japanese decided to let the French people do things their own way. But the company learned by close observation and interaction, and Shiseido now applies some French managerial techniques in Japan for other products -- an added bonus from plugging in to France."

Charges of Racism and Bias In a Liquor License Battle

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Two Potato, a dingy gay bar at Christopher and Greenwich Streets, is in the middle of a dispute that pits accusations of gay-identity politics against claims of racism.
 The 15-year-old tavern, once at the center of New York gay life, now attracts a mostly gay black and Latino crowd. Neighbors say it is frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes who spill onto the sidewalk and cause trouble. 
 "It's the worst element," said David Poster, president of the Christopher Street Patrol, a volunteer group. "And they hang out there all night. You can't walk on your own sidewalk."
When the bar's liquor license came up for renewal in August, local residents organized. Petitions were circulated, community board positions were drafted and the police dusted off reports of a drug sale involving the doorman. All the pieces were falling into place until residents approached their local officials.
Unanimously, the officials remained quiet on the issue. For some residents, this was another instance of liberal politicians, which in this district includes three gay and lesbian office holders, protecting pet causes at the expense of their quality of life. 
"Christine Quinn turned her back on West Village residents," said Elaine Goldman, president of the Christopher Street Block and Merchants Association, referring to the city councilwoman. "The only thing I can think of is that it's black and gay."
Ms. Quinn responded angrily, "Anyone who makes that assertion has clearly not looked at my record."
To explain her position, Ms. Quinn said that her office had heard from many residents who supported the renewal of the liquor license, and that the bar owner had pledged to address the complaints. She also rattled off a list of gay bars that she had singled out for noise and other violations.
Her supporters, however, say that race is the unspoken issue. "The fact that it's mostly kids of color must have something to do with it," said Melissa Sklarz, chairwoman of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Committee of Community Board 2.
Meanwhile, Two Potato may become a memory. After renewing the liquor license, the State Liquor Authority issued a 30-day suspension Nov. 26 and fined the bar $5,000. Eugene Buford, whose wife owns the bar, said he hoped to reopen in Janaury under a new name, Chances Are. The reasons, he said, were economic. DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE; 
Council Ends by Approving Sloan-Kettering Tower and N.Y.U. Science Park

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
The Upper East Side is poised to become even more deeply Hippocratic. In its last, exuberant session on Wednesday, the City Council approved two medical and scientific projects that have divided residents for the better part of a year.
 The Council unanimously approved a request by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to build a 420-foot research tower on East 68th Street between First and York Avenues. The building permits still need to be obtained, but the vote was the last big hurdle, said Shelly Friedman, a lawyer for Sloan-Kettering. 
 Construction on the building, estimated to cost $500 million to $650 million, could begin in midyear 2002.
The Council also approved measures, by a vote of 46 to 2, to allow the New York University School of Medicine to develop its East River Science Park, a 6.8-acre complex for fledgling biotechnology companies on the Bellevue Hospital grounds.
Both projects overcame significant community opposition.
Sloan-Kettering got approval for a tower that was 20 feet shorter and at least 11,000 square feet smaller than it had originally proposed. The hospital also agreed to restrictions on the amount of development it could undertake without further public review. But the hospital is most troubled by the possibility that, because of reductions in the area to be rezoned, it may have to eliminate one floor of the planned 23-story structure.
Avice Meehan, a Sloan-Kettering spokeswoman, said the hospital's long-term growth needs were "substantially met" by the Council, but noted that the smaller building may not have room for all 40 new scientists it had hoped to recruit.
Still, many in the community felt shortchanged by the Council vote. "If you look at the outcome we may as well not have bothered," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Pete Grannis. Opponents, who vowed to continue the fight, said the project sets a bad precedent for putting tall towers on residential blocks.
The East River Science Park project is less settled. N.Y.U. needs to obtain approval from the Manhattan Borough Board and the mayor on the terms of its proposed lease with the city's Economic Development Corporation: $1 a year for 99 years.
There is also the problem of where the city will put the 850 homeless men currently in the Bellevue shelter to make room for the biotech development.
"Don't ink this 99-year sweetheart deal until we know where the homeless men go," said Mark Taylor, chairman of Community Board 6, who votes on the Borough Board.
The Department of Homeless Services has secured one new 400-bed shelter in Brooklyn and says it is in negotiations for another in the Bronx.
Advocates of the project, which will go before the borough board next month, said N.Y.U.'s $120 million investment in building the park will mean more than 2,000 jobs and added city revenue. ERIKA KINETZ

HEADLINE: Wired, Jobless and Free (for Now) 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER TUNG 

 BODY:
THERE wasn't an empty seat at 71 Irving Coffee & Tea Bar, a cozy below-street-level coffee shop near Gramercy Park. A stream of customers lined up for lattes and bagels. Men with rumpled hair flipped through magazines, and young women in yoga pants and sneakers caught up over coffee, some sitting at tables by the fireplace, others on the benches outside. Half a dozen laptop screens glowed in the dimly lighted room, and cellphones trilled over a Sunday morning soundtrack of twinkly jazz piano.
 But it wasn't Sunday morning. It was 2:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. And many in this leisurely crowd, refilling their mugs and picking at fruit buns in their pleated khakis and wire-rimmed glasses, looked a little too old to pass as students. So why the midweek tea party? Didn't these people have jobs? 
 In a word, no.
Kenneth Wall, a 33-year-old programmer typing code into a black Dell laptop, explained: "I was laid off from a multimedia software company five months ago. There's probably only one day a week that I don't come here." Mr. Wall, who has been living on unemployment benefits and savings, said he felt an almost primal urge to get out of his apartment every day. "Usually I sit here and work on my computer for a few hours, go out for some air and then come back." 
Four tables away, Jocelyn Bell, 26, perched in front of a tangerine-and- white Macintosh Powerbook that matched her orange-and-blond-streaked ponytail. A former account executive at a communications company, Ms. Bell was laid off in April and did temporary work until recently, when she moved in with her mother and decided to apply to graduate school for social work. 
"You can drink a cup of coffee for hours, and nobody bothers you," she said of 71 Irving. Glancing around at the packed room, she added, "The crowd here has exploded in the past few months."
Crowds are exploding at similar spots all over the city. With the economy in a recession, and 97,600 jobs lost in New York City in October and November alone, a peculiar kind of cafe society has emerged, at least in one thin substratum of the suddenly unemployed -- college-educated young people without dependents, and whose only previous association with hard times was a grandmother who reused tinfoil because that's what she did during World War II. 
These Gen X'ers don't have families or mortgages. Severance and unemployment benefits have left them with a passable, if not buoyant, financial cushion. Being jobless has made them anxious about the future, but has also given them a strange and exhilarating sense of freedom -- at least for a moment.
Knowing that job prospects only become scarcer during the holidays, many of the recently unemployed aren't even bothering to look for work. Instead, they're congregating in coffee shops, libraries and galleries. What these haunts have in common are comfort, affordability and the kind of laissez-faire atmosphere that encourages people to linger. Seven-grain muffins and high-speed Internet access are extras.
This is the latest generation of New Yorkers to gather in inexpensive places during tough times, said Kenneth Jackson, president of the New-York Historical Society and a history professor at Columbia University. In the Great Depression, he said, "the first place people spent time was the park system, which became noticeably better during that decade, with new pools and better maintenance." Another popular spot was Coney Island, where there was no admission charge. "You could walk among the crowds and at least vicariously share in the excitement," Mr. Jackson said, adding that in winter during the 1930's unemployed men gathered at volunteer firehouses, bars and the headquarters of the local ward bosses.
The bars and firehouses of yesteryear are the coffee shops and Barnes & Nobles of today. Michael Tobias, a manager at the Big Cup Coffee and Tea House in Chelsea, has noticed a considerable increase in weekday lingerers. "Usually, we get a rush around 10 a.m., and then it clears out," he said. "Yesterday, we had a packed house at 10 and it lasted all day. And it was a Monday."
On a recent Friday morning at Ozzie's Coffee & Tea on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, a stream of patrons fueled up on caffeine and plugged in computers. "I'm here two to four times a week, and I see all the same faces," said Jason Weinstein, 28, who became a dot-com casualty in October and has since finished a novel. "I also spend time at the Rose Reading Room at the Public Library on 42nd Street," he said.
The Rose Main Reading Room, with its 51-foot ceilings and 42 white oak tables, has long been an attractive option for people with time on their hands. The winter of 1929-30 was the most active period in the room's history, the library said, with New Yorkers fighting for standing-room-only space. The single busiest day was Dec. 30, 1929, said Rodney Phillips, director of the library's Humanities and Social Sciences Library, home of the reading room.
This recession is no exception. "I have noticed an awful lot of young people hunting for jobs or just coming in to read lately," Mr. Phillips said. "As long as they don't have to go to work, they might as well read in a pleasant room."
For every unemployed New Yorker gravitating to a favorite weekday spot, there's another rediscovering an outpost free of the weekend crowds. Melissa de la Cruz, author of the novel "Cat's Meow" (Simon & Schuster) and a former computer consultant at Morgan Stanley who was laid off in June, has been on the museum circuit for months. "I go to a different one practically every week," Ms. de la Cruz, 30, said. "I also go to a lot of 2 p.m. movies."
Rob Molchon, a 31-year-old Web developer whose company, Private Labs, shut down in October, works out at the New York Sports Club in SoHo three or four afternoons a week. "I can easily sit in front of my computer and while the day away," he said. "This gives me a good reason to get out."
And Rebecca Braverman, 25, a former shopping editor at Citysearch.com, has discovered the advantages of being out and about while others are at work. "Any place that can be horribly unpleasant after work or on the weekend becomes 40 times more pleasant when you go in the middle of the day during the week," said Ms. Braverman, who was laid off in July. 
"Recently I met a friend at ABC Carpet & Home, and no one was there," she said. "We were in the area with all the Herman Miller repros, and we sprawled across an Eames sofa and chatted. She wrote down the name of my hairdresser. People walked by asking if we needed anything."
Of course, lounging around in quiet stores is all well and good for now (provided the stores can stay in business). But when the bubble of "unemployment as extended vacation" bursts, today's Tuesday-afternoon gadabouts may find themselves relating more to the out-of-work single mothers and service workers barely scraping by all over the city. They might want to start saving their tinfoil.

HEADLINE: Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now? 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
AMEENA MEER, a writer who lives in Manhattan, will celebrate the holidays this year with a cast of (practically) thousands. 
 There is her immediate ex-husband, James. And her first ex-husband, Andrew. There is her 9-year-old daughter, Sasha, by her first husband, and her two children by her second husband, Zarina, 6, and Jahanara, who is almost 3. At a Christmas Eve dinner Ms. Meer is planning in Washington, Andrew will bring Stephanie, his girlfriend, and one of Ms. Meer's ex-boyfriends is also coming. Her brother, his wife and their new baby -- the sole concession to the traditional nuclear family -- will also be a part of the celebration. 
 "Sometimes I need a flow chart to keep everybody straight," she said. 
As families gather this holiday season, many will be reminded that American divorce culture has traveled far past "Kramer vs. Kramer." Sure, people were divorced 25 years ago. And sure, there were Brady Bunch stepfamilies. But these days, post-divorce families are better represented by the critically acclaimed ABC series "Once and Again," in which Sela Ward plays Lily, who is married to Rick and who used to be married to Jake. All three, along with the children from both marriages, not to mention Jake's pregnant girlfriend, Tiffany, spent Thanksgiving together on the show. And in an episode broadcast Dec. 14, it was Lily and Rick who assisted at the birth of Tiffany's child. 
Three decades after divorce rates first soared in the United States, removing the dire stigma of a broken marriage, and long after custody-law changes began forcing former spouses into close contact for years of joint child rearing, there seems to be a new tolerance emerging in many households for former partners. 
No longer are the names of exes unmentionable at the dinner table. No longer are the details of passing children between homes confined to emotionless e-mail messages. Family therapists, sociologists and researchers note that family members who 25 years ago would not have had anything to do with one another are finding it desirable to stay connected, and at no time more than the holidays. 
"There are certainly growing numbers of stepfamilies, and many more exes than in the past," said Dr. David Popenoe, the co-director of the National Marriage Project, a research institute at Rutgers University. "Now you routinely have third marriages and fourth marriages. And every year there are more and more cases of people spending Christmas together who in times past would not be talking to each other, let alone spending Christmas together." 
In 2000, the United States Census Bureau reported that fewer than 25 percent of households were made up of the traditional nuclear family, with both parents and their children. Divorce rates continue to hover around 50 percent, and a vast majority of former spouses remarry. These are the trends that have produced nearly as many stepfamilies as nuclear families. And within these new blended families, many are forging closer bonds with former spouses than in the past, said Dr. Harvey Ruben, a family therapist and professor of clinical psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. A new norm -- Mom and her new beau, Pop and his second wife, Junior, Sis and assorted step-siblings -- "is becoming a part of the culture," Dr. Ruben said. 
Of course, just as every unhappy family is different, every divorce is too: they range from the highly acrimonious, in which husband and wife cannot stand even to hear the sound of each other's voice and so communicate only through their children, to those marriages that conclude with a shrug of the shoulders. Those are the people who are finding it is no longer necessary, or even acceptable, to excommunicate their ex. 
Take the example of Jill Brooke, the editor of Avenue Magazine, who has such a friendly relationship with her husband's first wife, Alicia Lazaro, that she calls her "my wife-in-law." 
The relationship between Ms. Brooke's husband, Gary Goldstein, and Ms. Lazaro -- they have two daughters -- is also so amicable that even when they were divorced in 1990 they did not dissolve their business partnership. He is the chief executive of the Whitney Group, a Wall Street recruiting and search firm, and Ms. Lazaro is vice chairman. 
"We have been best friends for 20 years and business partners for 18," Mr. Goldstein said. "Our business relationship has never suffered."
Mr. Goldstein said that his wives past and present should be role models for divorced families. "Jill and Alicia both chose to be accommodating," Mr. Goldstein said. "Alicia knows when to give Jill her space. She knows that it's Jill's house now. And Jill is respectful of Alicia. Everybody is an adult." 
Ms. Brooke said her own family had been skeptical of her close friendship with Ms. Lazaro at first. "They looked askance at the whole thing," she said. "Then I explained to them: 'This is not 1950. People are a bit more relaxed today. And we can't just think of ourselves. We need to think of the children.' " 
At Thanksgiving, the crowd at the table included Ms. Lazaro, her two daughters with Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Goldstein, Ms. Brooke and Ms. Brooke's son with Mr. Goldstein. Jessica, a daughter of Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Lazaro, made a toast to her "three parents."
"It's really a big happy family," Ms. Brooke said. 
Several therapists and marriage scholars credited the laid-back attitudes typified by the Goldstein-Lazaro-Brooke clan to a culture that is increasingly diverse and has been forced to deal with the relentless rate of divorce. There are no statistical records on how many families spend significant time with former spouses. But experts who study marriage and advise couples note that stepfamilies in which ex-spouses are on good terms to the point that they celebrate holidays together are becoming more frequent. 
"The definition of family has changed," said Dr. Jonathan Lampert, a family therapist who has practiced in Manhattan for 25 years. "So have our notions of loyalty, and the importance of sex and sexual life as a binding force." He said that he recently had a holiday lunch with a family group that included a husband, his first two wives, his present wife, children from all three marriages, the third wife's child from her first marriage and several grandchildren. 
Not everyone at the table lived together, but Dr. Lampert said that the family has created a latticework of connections, sympathies and familiarities that are similar to the rhythms of a regular family. And he emphasized that successfully blending such a family takes time -- he recommends 10 years -- and a lot of work.
Plenty of therapists think that asking people to bond with their spouse's former partner is unrealistic. Diane Sollee, the director of the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education, an advocacy group, and a family therapist in Washington, said that Americans who are planning to form some sort of happy blended family in which former spouses are business partners, live next door and appear at the lunch table ought to understand the difficulty. 
Negotiating the potential crevasses in a plain old stepfamily is hard enough, she said. "It is the hardest family form in mankind," Ms. Sollee said. "No one can imagine how hard it is going to be until they experience it. The whole Brady Bunch idea, that you're going to love this man and his children and everyone is going to be so happy is so extremely rare and can only happen in truly exceptional cases." 
And so, she added, a situation where one's ex is present would be vastly more complicated. There can be terrible jealousies between former spouses. The holiday table, even for traditional families, is often a time of heightened tensions, rather than of peace and goodwill.
But Ms. Meer, with her two former husbands and three children, said that it was important to keep her exes in her life. "Once you are engaged in someone's life with that level of involvement, they don't just disappear," she said. "They are a part of you. You can't just close the door." Ms. Meer said that her former husband James recently spent time in the hospital, and that she went every day to bring him books and flowers and just hold his hand. 
"A few people were surprised, but most were not," she said. "It didn't work for us, but that doesn't mean I hate him." 
Dr. Henry Spitz, the director of couples therapy at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, said that the biggest mistake blended family members make is to have unrealistically high expectations for family bonding. "Modest to low expectations are the way to go," he said. "This is not Norman Rockwell here. That idea of the new fantasy family is where most people run into trouble." 
The family fantasy worked for Christine Rubin, a business consultant in Washington, for about five years. After a second divorce in 1998, she spent holidays with her first ex-husband, her daughter with him, and her second ex-husband, and there was little discomfort. Her daughter appreciated seeing her parents together and also got along well with the second husband -- who, by the way, had nothing to do with the first marriage's end, Ms. Rubin said. But then last year, after Ms. Rubin married a third time, it became time to limit the number of men at the table. And there was something else. 
"It was when No. 2 wanted to bring his male companion along to the Christmas table that I sort of lost interest," she said. 
Ms. Brooke of Avenue magazine said that she felt lucky because many factors that usually cause tension in a reconstructed family were absent in her situation. "If it was me, the stepmother, who had caused the initial split between the parents, that would be a very hard chasm to cross," she said. She added that it was also important that her husband's ex-wife, Ms. Lazaro, was economically independent. "It would have been horrible for the girls to see a situation in which their mother's life had been diminished because of the divorce," Ms. Brooke said. 
She added that getting along makes the children happy, and that making the children happy makes her husband happy. "Being nice to his ex-wife gives the kids permission to love me, because we don't live in a battle zone," Ms. Brooke said. "You only hear these "War of the Roses" battle stories with people who aren't smart enough to surrender their ego for the family good and aren't smart enough to carve out a little civility for the sake of the children." 
Of course, there are those who can't bear the idea of blending eggnog with a former spouse, let alone blending a family. E. Jean Carroll, a writer and advice columnist for Elle magazine, said that she has been married "the usual number of times" (two) and that she would never spend the holidays with her ex-husbands even though she is good friends with both, nor with her present companion's ex-wives. 
"I think it's warped," she said. "You have to be nice to your ex-boyfriend's wife, and you know stuff about her that she would never dream that he had told you. Horrible." 
And even Ms. Meer, the very picture of unflappable serenity and acceptance, said she did stop at some limits. 
"One Christmas, when I was pregnant with Jahanara, Andrew brought Stephanie," she said. (Remember: Jahanara is her daughter with James, and Andrew is her first ex-husband, and Stephanie is Andrew's girlfriend.) 
"And the girls had such a good time with her, they said, 'Mommy, we ought to name the new baby Stephanie!' " Ms. Meer said, then made a harumphing sound. "Naming my next child after my ex-husband's girlfriend was where I had to draw the line."

Armageddon Again: Fear in the 50's and Now

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH some nervous sorts may be whiling away the Yule hours in a bunker, most Americans are still exhibiting ambivalence over how much daily life should be subsumed by threat. Nonetheless, just as in the cold war, when Americans flirted with fallout shelters as a modern and patriotic alternative to nuclear obliteration, so the threat of terrorism has unleashed contradictory -- and in some cases wacky -- cultural reflexes.
 Add to those time-honored mirrors of American culture -- sports, television, Barbie -- the American response to a threat. 
 In the 1960's, the threat of annihilation was a family affair, as door-to-door salesmen hawked fallout shelters in the same way today's anxiety entrepreneurs have peddled gas masks and Cipro. "The fantasy about the perfect shelter was the fantasy of the perfect family," said Al Filreis, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, who pointed out that the term "nuclear family" was apt. "The world might be dead and the landscape wiped out, but at least you were together," he said. 
Imaginings of doom and suspicions that the neighbors could be Commies led to some seriously strange ideas. Among them was a 1962 handbook on nuclear survival issued by the Stanford Research Institute, which, among other ideas, suggested the "car body shelter" (bury a car in the backyard and put a plywood entry into one of the windows, a setup akin to a weeklong nonstop car trip with children). 
But long before President Kennedy began advocating the shelter concept in the 1960's, a grisly sub-genre of nuclear-apocalyptic fiction was flourishing. As Kenneth D. Rose writes in his new book "One Nation Underground: The Fallout Shelter in American Culture," the Federal Civil Defense Administration encouraged the new literature, which included phony newspaper front pages and whole magazines devoted to describing a fictional post-apocalyptic world -- in deeply purple prose. 
"The entire business district raged in a bonfire," reads a description of a war-ravished post-World War III Washington from Colliers magazine. "It cracked like a million cattle stampeding in a field of potato chips."
The nation's children were lured into cold-war culture by Bert the Turtle, the government-issue cartoon character who encouraged youngsters to "Duck and Cover." And the women of America were enjoined to keep the fallout shelter stocked with canned peas and other survival staples in the manner of grandma's pantry. Like casseroles and waxy build-up, nuclear war was a wifely issue, "no different than any other domestic problem" that the woman of the house was expected to handle, said Dr. Rose, a professor at California State University at Chico.
Today, anxiety knows no gender, as magazines like Men's Health and even Stuff offer how-to's on combating terror. In a manly echo of Cosmo, a recent issue of Men's Health offers the "25 Best Ways" for men to protect their families, including "leveling with them" and fending off a paunch because "a fit man evacuates his family faster from a burning house." Meanwhile, over at Ladies' Home Journal, daydreaming about revenge has replaced sex as the focus of reader polls post Sept. 11; 26 percent said they did it at least once a day.
Those seeking antiterrorism coping tools from the government can turn to Tom Ridge and the newly minted Office of Homeland Security, which plans to issue citizen guidelines that will help Americans prepare for possible terrorist attacks at home, work, school and church. And those who can't wait can look to the Web site of the state department's "Rewards For Justice" program (www.rewardsforjustice.org), where, among other nuggets of information about scoping out neighborhood terrorists, citizens are encouraged to remember that children of terrorists "often enroll in schools in the middle of the year and may leave prior to the end with little or no notice."
To be sure, there are some profound differences between then and now. Back then, nuclear anxiety penetrated the culture and civil defense was about anticipating war, not fighting it. Now, the unimaginable threat of devastation on American soil is real. 
Americans today are also much savvier about breathless messages of doom, whether from the media or government officials. 
"In the 1950's and 60's, folks felt what they were told about nuclear testing and other matters was true," said Dr. Filreis. "In the post-Watergate era, we don't have those expectations. We're suspicious of someone sitting behind a desk telling us something." 
OF course, that didn't keep gun sales from increasing after Sept. 11. But it's worth noting that, for the most part, Americans -- both then and now -- tend to reject hysteria. Back in the 1950's, despite government scare tactics and heavy propaganda, the fallout shelter was a miserable failure, with only one in 100,000 people building one. And today, after an initial flurry of worry and hype, there are indications that Americans are again refusing to allow threats to transform daily life. Sales of nouveau shelters are on the wane, and having now stashed away drinking water and duct tape, Americans appear to be overcoming their jitters and, lured by bargain fares, are beginning to fly again. 
As The Economist noted recently, "a country that specializes in junk television and risible lawsuits is proving that, when it comes to serious matters, it is quite capable of being grown up."
And no one has proposed the contemporary equivalent of "Bert the Turtle" -- yet.

Fuel Cell Companies Offer Choice and Risk

BYLINE:  By DAVID LUDLUM 

 BODY:
SHARES of fuel cell companies soared last year, posting triple-digit gains during the California energy crisis. This year, as energy supplies have rebounded, their prices have sunk as much as 95 percent from the highs.
 "The valuations had gotten way ahead of themselves," said Richard A. Giesen, manager of Munder Power Plus fund, which invests in energy companies. Now, he says, prices are low for some stocks, and he is buying selectively. Some analysts agree with that outlook, at least for investors willing to take some risks with companies that may not be profitable for several years. 
 According to ratings compiled by Thomson Financial Services, the analysts' current favorites are FuelCell Energy of Danbury, Conn; Hydrogenics of Mississauga, Ontario; and Proton Energy Systems of Rocky Hill, Conn.
Fuel cell companies are developing products to power homes, offices and factories as well as vehicles and electronic devices. Most fuel cells are still prototypes that can be expensive to buy and to operate. To realize the promise of fuel cells, the companies need to push down costs.
Like batteries, fuel cells use a chemical reaction that can be twice as efficient as burning a fuel. The fuel cells cut carbon dioxide emissions and produce essentially no noise or noxious fumes. They make electricity by combining oxygen from the air with hydrogen, which they can extract from a fuel like natural gas or propane. "You don't have to go to the Middle East or drill in Alaska to get it," said David Redstone, editor of The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor, a newsletter.
Analysts tend to see the most immediate market, and investment opportunity, in fuel cells for stationary applications: powering remote equipment, homes, offices and factories. The big fuel cells that a few companies are developing tend to be more efficient than smaller ones so they generate electricity at a lower cost, said Tom O'Neill, a power technology analyst at Lehman Brothers.
That helps explain FuelCell Energy's popularity among analysts. The company is developing particularly efficient fuel cells for large commercial and industrial users. "If you're looking for pure plays in the big fuel cells," said Christine Farkas, an energy technology analyst at Merrill Lynch, "FuelCell Energy is the one you play."
But "hold" is the consensus among analysts for Ballard Power Systems of Burnaby, British Columbia, which is associated primarily with the vehicle market, and for Plug Power of Latham, N.Y., which focuses on residential and light commercial uses. "Autos and residential are further out than commercial and industrial," Mr. Giesen said.
The shares of FuelCell Energy jumped 23 percent when the company announced a distribution and development deal last month with Caterpillar of Peoria, Ill., which makes generators. Using what she calls conservative assumptions, Ms. Farkas assigns the shares a target price of $25 to $30 in 12 to 18 months. They closed at $13.99 on Friday.
The stock of Hydrogenics has performed the best among the group this year, more than tripling since September. In October, the company announced an alliance with General Motors that includes plans to demonstrate the use of fuel cells to power cellphone towers. The alliance gives Hydrogenics access to G.M.'s research and marketing might, said David B. Smith, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. The stock is the only one he recommends among fuel cell companies; his target price is $12 in 12 months. It closed at $6.34 on Friday.
PROTON ENERGY SYSTEMS plans to sell fuel cells with devices that produce hydrogen from electricity and water. Marko Pencak, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, has a buy recommendation on the company, with a target price of $13 in 12 months; it closed at $7 on Friday. 
Mr. Pencak said any climb in the price might be limited, however, until Proton announced a significant partnership. "That could happen next week or a year from now," he said. "The more progress they make, the more confidence we have."
Some analysts and investors say that the stocks will trade less on industry trends than on company fundamentals -- and that the companies are risky investments because they are not yet profitable.
"They can be incredibly volatile," said David Schoenwald, co-manager of the New Alternatives fund. "It's very hard to value these things."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Gene W. Henssler; 
Henssler Equity Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHEN Gene W. Henssler was a finance professor at the University of Toledo in the 1970's, he managed his own investments and started choosing stocks and bonds for a handful of friends.
 In 1995, after stints at several other universities, he left academia to become a full-time money manager -- as chief executive of G. W. Henssler & Associates, in Marietta, Ga. The firm manages the $34 million Henssler Equity fund, as well as about $500 million for institutions and individuals. 
 He uses the academic principles of finance in his day-to-day investing, he says, but there are many more variables in real-life decisions. "You have money on the line, and you're measured every day," he said. 
The fund returned 5.2 percent a year, on average, in the three years through Thursday, compared with 0.3 percent for its peer group of large blend funds and a 0.1 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund lost 7.4 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 12.7 percent for its group and 12.6 percent for the S.& P.
To start choosing the 40 to 50 stocks in the fund, Dr. Henssler looks for "high-quality companies with good financial strength" among the 8,500 or so stocks traded on the major United States exchanges.
Using computer screens, he finds a total annual growth rate for a company: He adds two percentage figures -- the annual earnings growth and dividend rates -- and looks for a sum of at least 12, on average, over the last five years. But he excludes transportation and utility companies, which he believes do not offer long-term growth opportunities, as well as companies without enough liquidity -- those with average daily trading volume of less than 150,000 shares.
To assess future growth, Dr. Henssler reviews a company's reinvestment policies. 
"I want the cash flow put into assets that generate additional earnings," he said, adding that consistent increases in earnings per share drive stock prices.
He also seeks companies that have dominant products in their industries and catalysts for growth, like new products, climbing market share or rising reinvestment rates. "Companies can't continue to grow on cost savings alone," he said. "We like to see company earnings growing because sales are growing as well."
Ideally, he buys a stock when the company's earnings growth rate exceeds its price-to-earnings multiple. Over all, the portfolio companies now sell at an average of 26.7 times projected 2002 earnings; their earnings growth rate averages 15 percent. He considers selling a stock when a company's management changes, for example, or when its balance sheet deteriorates.
In March, Dr. Henssler bought shares of Ashland, the oil and gas refiner in Covington, Ky., at $38.30 in March; they now trade at $44.95. 
Ashland, which also operates chemical and construction-related businesses, has a total growth rate averaging 10.5 percent a year in the last five years, he said, but the shares sell for just nine times 2002 earnings. 
"The last independent oil refinery acquired got 12 times earnings, which makes Ashland's stock worth about $60," he said. 
Moreover, unlike some competitors, the company has enough cash to comply with new clean-air guidelines issued by the Environmental Protection Agency.
He bought shares of the Goldman Sachs Group, the investment banking and securities firm, at $96.04 in May; they closed on Friday at $92.31. Goldman's stock price may suffer in the short term, he said, because initial public offerings, which account for a big chunk of its business, have been slow. But Goldman is "a premier investment banking firm that will lead out as the economy turns around," he said. 
Dr. Henssler recently added shares of Applied Materials, the semiconductor equipment maker. "There's a big boom coming in that market, as manufacturers are moving to bigger chips," he said, adding that the company should also benefit from a trend toward more energy-efficient chips used in cellular phones and other portable devices.
His total growth figure for Applied Materials should average 21 percent a year over the next five years, he predicted. He originally bought shares in June 1998 at $14.11; his average cost has been $35.84. The shares closed on Friday at $39.97.

An Economic Speedometer Gets an Overhaul

BYLINE:  By JOLIE SOLOMON 

 BODY:
WHEN the Consumer Price Index is announced each month, it gets a lot of attention. People might assume that its creators know exactly what consumers are doing: how much they spend on an average trip to Costco, for example, or on a delivery from the local Thai takeout; how many DVD's they rent or buy; or how much they pay each month for their high-speed Internet service. 
 They would be wrong. The index, the main gauge of inflation and bedrock statistic of the federal government, is a surprisingly frail number. The calculations behind it are as much art as they are science. 
 But that has begun to change. Starting next month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which computes the index, will use some of the freshest data it has ever collected. It will readjust the weight, or importance, of goods and services in the index marketbasket, and the stores where they are sampled, far more often than it did in the past. 
And later in the year the bureau will start accounting for something that consumers do all the time: substitute one kind of product for another -- chicken instead of steak, cotton instead of cashmere, used instead of new -- to save money when prices rise.
Whether these changes will change the official inflation rate significantly is unclear. But it is hard to underestimate the potential impact. The Consumer Price Index is not just a measure of living costs. It is used to help determine the size of Social Security checks, veterans' benefits and other federal payments to about 80 million people. It affects how the Federal Reserve sets interest rates and how the Internal Revenue Service adjusts tax brackets. It can even change the size of alimony checks.
This is hardly the first time that the bureau has changed the index in response to new economic thinking. But the 2002 changes, with some others in the last few years, are the fruit of prolonged debate, inside and outside the bureau, as well as recommendations by two government commissions, one going back to the 1960's and, more recently, the Boskin Commission, which reported to the Senate in 1996.
The changes are meant to better reflect consumer behavior and, in turn, to give policy makers, businesses and consumers a better tool to gauge how social and technological changes affect inflation.
Two-income households, for example, mean more spending on takeout food and day care. New attitudes toward health may mean less spending on cigarettes and soft drinks. The shift toward work outside the office means more purchases of products like laptop computers and pagers. The rapid growth of grocery warehouses means that consumers are buying more food in bulk and at lower prices.
IN the past, such trends took years to affect the index because the bureau's marketbasket was based on consumer buying patterns surveyed 5, 10 or even more years earlier. The current index, for example, is based on consumer behavior in 1993-95.
When the bureau releases its January report on the index, it will use new "relative weights" for products and services based on consumer choices in 1999 and 2000. 
More weight will be assigned to college tuition and nursing home care, for example, and less to full-service restaurant meals and men's suits. Those weightings will then be adjusted every two years -- again in 2004, based on 2001-2002 surveys. Although there will still be a lag, it will be shorter.
"The B.L.S. is trying to get closer to a measure of inflation that people are experiencing," said Stephen G. Cecchetti, an economics professor at Ohio State University and a former Federal Reserve Bank officer.
In theory, the calculation of the index is simple. It is based on a marketbasket of 211 goods and services -- medicine, education, entertainment and so on -- bought by the average family. The prices are tracked over time.
But the task of calculation is daunting. As the bureau chooses among millions of products, it is constrained by budget limitations and saddled with old technology. Bureau agents roam stores, looking at price tags and writing prices on pieces of paper. They interview store executives, visit homeowners to determine housing prices and ask consumers to keep daily diaries of purchases.
All kinds of variables, including new products, mean that the bureau has a tough time keeping up.
Consider the bureau's prolonged statistical neglect of the cellphone. Cellphones were a staple in almost three million American households as early as 1992, according to Motorola, the big cellphone maker. But cellphones were not reflected in the index until 1998, when Americans bought almost 35.5 million of them. That was largely because the marketbasket was still locked into an outdated formula that had counted telephone service in the costs of housing -- and cellphones were used outside the home. 
The inflationary effect of new features on old products also bedevils the index. Consider a shopper who bought a Chevrolet Blazer in 1998 for $23,703 and now wants to replace it. The comparable 2002 vehicle, the Blazer LS, is priced at $26,310 -- an increase of $2,607, or almost 11 percent. But because it now comes standard with a Bose sound system and a theft-alarm system, among other upgrades, the bureau will slice hundreds of dollars off the price increase when calculating the price inflation. 
The bureau is now making such adjustments to more goods and services in its marketbasket. It is also trying to figure how to reflect quality decreases in air travel, for example. It had tracked product changes that affect the environment, like emissions systems, but stopped recently to re-evaluate that process.
Taken together, the changes should make the index more timely. Patrick C. Jackman, a bureau economist who is considered its top authority on the index, offered one example: Viagra, the male impotence drug introduced in 1998, was moved into the index in 2000. 
Starting next year, the bureau will measure a more subtle variable: what happens when consumers buy one product instead of another that has risen in price. The bureau began accounting for substitution in a rudimentary way in 1999, literally apples to apples or cheese to cheese. If the price of Golden Delicious apples goes up, for example, that would seem to bump up inflation. But if a shopper switches to cheaper Granny Smiths, the bureau records what the shopper actually spent -- which means less inflation. 
In 2002, the bureau will do this kind of calculation across categories -- measuring what happens when a shopper buys chicken, for example, because the price of lamb has increased. This, too, will result in a lower inflation rate, although the bureau is planning, for now, to report this number separately, not in the basic index.
Such changes in bureau procedures have been welcomed by critics like Michael J. Boskin, the Stanford economics professor who led the commission, established by the Senate in 1995. If the index does not record how technology is improving consumer life, or how consumers save money by buying cheaper goods, he contends, it overstates inflation. 
Economists continue to debate the issue. If consumers are forced to buy more expensive products, they end up spending more -- and to some experts, that should mean higher inflation. Michael Goldstein, a finance professor at Babson College who has worked at the New York Stock Exchange and with federal agencies, said the consumer index should "measure how much it costs to be a regular person in this society, and to keep up with everybody." 
Even small changes in the index can make an enormous difference in financial calculations. The Boskin Commission concluded that the index overstated inflation by an average of 1.1 percentage points a year.
Under current calculations, according to the Social Security Administration, a worker with an average wage rate who retired in 2002 at 65, then collected Social Security checks until she died at 82, would receive $318,000. If the index were cut by 1.1 percentage points, as the Boskin Commission recommended, that retiree would get $277,000, or $41,000 less. For the government, of course, such a reduction in the index would mean savings of billions of dollars.
But the index will always be flawed, said Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware and author of "Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers From the Media, Politicians, and Activists." The index, like many other statistics, is "meant to distill complexity into some relatively simple measure," he said. 
WHILE the bureau may be moving faster to change its data, its methods for gathering the data remain stuck in the nondigital past. When Dr. Boskin's commission was formed in 1995, he recalled, he traipsed after a bureau pricing agent as she went through a Nordstrom department store in Northern California looking at the tags on dresses and writing down the prices on paper. Now, six years later, even though legions of FedEx and U.P.S. deliverers have long been using handheld computers, bureau workers are still out in the field with paper and pencil.
The bureau is phasing in handheld computers; all pricing agents will have them by 2003. But it is unclear if or when the bureau will begin using another common technology -- the bar-code scanner -- that has revolutionized the way retailers and manufacturers follow price movements. 
This pace of change concerns Dr. Boskin. The bureau has "taken some steps," he said. But the inflation rate, he added, "is a moving target."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Money Talks, Sovereignty Walks

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, Argentina took a drastic step to stamp out the hyperinflation that was crippling its economy: it effectively gave up control of its national currency. Under a program developed by its economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, it shackled the peso's value to that of the dollar on a one-to-one basis, and pledged to do whatever necessary to maintain that link.
 It worked, more or less, for a while. Inflation subsided. Foreign investment flowed in. The economy expanded. 
 But there was a problem. The dollar got stronger and stronger during the late 1990's, a development that meant little to most Americans but had a devastating effect on Argentina by making its exports more expensive than those of its competitors in international markets. Jobs disappeared. Debts piled up. And Argentina's government kept asking for more short-term sacrifice in the hopes of achieving long-term stability and prosperity.
Last week, the strains became too much. With unemployment soaring, rioting broke out in the streets. Mr. Cavallo, back for another stint running the economy, resigned, followed quickly by his boss, President Fernando de la Rua, who stepped down in the middle of his four-year term.
Argentina's experience suggested that giving up national control of a currency is a treacherous business, economically and politically. Yet Argentina is far from alone in grappling with what sovereignty means in a global economy, and how to balance the demands of the market against the imperatives and traditions of the nation-state.
Even as Argentina melted down, the European Union was pressing toward the final stage of the most ambitious experiment to date in ceding national economic authority to a supranational institution: the adoption by 12 countries of a common currency. 
The euro countries have already frozen the values of their currencies against one another and set up a European Central Bank to conduct interest policy on behalf of all of them largely free of political control or interference. At the start of 2002, new euro notes and coins will begin replacing the francs, marks, guilders and crowns that for so long had been one of the most tangible everyday connections between citizens and their governments.
In Canada and Mexico there has been talk of scrapping national currencies in favor of the dollar. Hong Kong, despite its status as part of China, ties its currency to the dollar.
AS eye-glazingly arcane as exchange-rate policy can be, the link between a people and its currency is powerful, even emotional, a part of their heritage and identity. Consider the language used to describe currencies: They are strong, or weak, and need to be defended. "There's an element of national testosterone involved," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, the investment firm. "People frequently employ the lexicon of war."
Yet in a global economy, where trade, international capital flows and the confidence of investors are essential to pulling developing nations out of poverty and maintaining economic growth in industrialized countries, monetary and exchange-rate policy is far more complicated than choosing between a strong or a weak currency.
For Argentina, the outlook is murky. Economic policy there "had been so crazy that putting it in a straitjacket seemed like the right answer," said Michael Mussa, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now with the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington.
In the end it was not, at least not in the way Argentina handled the straitjacket. But whatever new government takes over in Argentina will find that severing the link to the dollar and devaluing the peso, if it chooses to take that course, will bring at least as many new problems as benefits.
Exporters would benefit. Borrowers, on the other hand, could suffer badly. Many debts are denominated in dollars, even though most people are paid in pesos, so devaluation would require them to fork over a lot more pesos to pay off their dollarized debts. And if the country formally defaults on its debts to international investors, as seems likely, it could have trouble attracting foreign investment on favorable terms for years to come.
In Europe, the move toward a united currency was as much political as economic. It was born first of a desire to link the countries of the continent so inextricably that another war between them would be unthinkable. It has worked, so far at least, because it also makes trade and travel more efficient among the common currency's members and makes the euro bloc a more formidable economic rival to the United States.
But Europe's commitment will no doubt be tested, as Argentina's was, should the euro countries face a crisis. It's not clear whether there is yet a European identity well-defined and strong enough to weather a sharp economic downturn or a diplomatic or military rift. And as economic forces blur national boundaries around the world, in nations rich and poor, politics is struggling to keep up.
"It's not an accident or irrelevant," Mr. Mussa said, "that we have tended to the notion of one country, one money."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Who Pays If Argentina Devalues Its Currency?

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
ARGENTINA'S long-running financial crisis has finally become unbearable. Stores are being sacked in eruptions of anger and frustration. People are hungry. Unemployment approaches 20 percent. Recession is turning into depression. And day after day, the endless debate over how to restart the economy comes to dead ends.
 Consider devaluation. It looms as a necessary measure, made more necessary by all the chaos last week. By law, the peso and the dollar have equaled each other, one to one, for 10 years. But Argentina's economy is far less efficient than America's, so costs, in dollars, have surged. A daily newspaper, for example, now sells for the equivalent of $1.50. Even products from Argentina's vast cattle herds -- once the source of so much wealth -- are losing ground. Leather shoes are being imported from Brazil, and some cuts of meat are, too. 
 Manufacturing is decimated. Argentine companies once made most of the toys sold in the country. Now most toys are less expensive imports. Import competition is similarly closing factories in other fields, and owners and workers are crying, in unison, for relief through devaluation. Even many who favor the chief alternative, "dollarization" -- exchanging pesos for American dollars -- would devalue as a first step. That would lower costs before less valuable pesos were exchanged for fewer dollars.
Devaluation, then, seems to an outsider like a necessary, straightforward step in reducing the hardship that brought so many Argentines into the streets last week, provoking the declaration of a state of siege, the resignation of the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, and then the president. In an earlier government, Mr. Cavallo wrote the law that tied the peso to the dollar -- making Argentina a magnet for foreign loans in the booming early years of the link, then a pariah as the government tried to siphon money from a shrinking economy to repay debt. "Now we know that our rigid system of linking the peso to the dollar works against us in a recession," said Julio Nudler, an economist and journalist.
Devaluation offers obvious relief. But visit Buenos Aires, as I did this month before the street protests erupted, get into conversations, and suddenly devaluation is not so straightforward after all. Up close, it comes in several flavors, each one producing different winners and losers. In the heated public debate over what to do next, only the imperative to devalue is obvious. But none of the alternatives seem to come out on top.
The unions, for example, favor devaluation, although they have opposed it in the past, arguing that devaluation dilutes wages. This time, generating jobs is more important. Still, many Argentines, including union members, have acquired debts denominated in dollars: car loans, mortgages, credit card debt. Repaying dollar debt in devalued pesos is not fun. So there is a big constituency for devaluing debt, too.
That bothers the creditors, of course. They offer a couple of alternatives. Bank deposits these days are denominated in dollars, although the government, to prevent bank runs, permitted very little withdrawal of bank savings in any currency. In one alternative, $100 in deposited savings would become 100 pesos worth, say, only $50. The devalued deposits would offset bank losses from devalued loans. 
In another alternative, the $100 deposit would become 200 pesos -- still worth $100. Debts would not be devalued, but each depositor would have to pay a special 30- or 40-centavo tax for each peso withdrawn. This tax would be used to subsidize debtors, a disguised devaluation of debt. Argentine companies with revenue in pesos and debts in dollars to foreign companies would especially benefit from the subsidies.
THEN there is the carrot approach. A $100 bank account becomes 100 pesos worth $50. But the depositor has options. He can accept the devaluation or acquire a bond with a face value of $100 payable with interest in the future, when times, he hopes, will be better. The difficult choices posed by these options help to explain why some middle-class Argentines sympathized with the protesters, or joined them.
Finally, the government owes tens of billions of dollars in public debt to foreigners. Many of the "foreigners," it turns out, are Argentines with dollar accounts in New York who bought their government's dollar bonds in the 1990's, collecting more than 8 percent annual interest. As the bonds come due, the holders are being told that the government wants to delay repayment of principal for three years and to lower rates for the additional years to 7 percent or less.
The bondholders can object and sue, in which case the government would be in formal default. Or they can accept the new terms, as many are, thus acquiescing to backdoor, de facto devaluation.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Optimists Aside, He Still Sees a 98-Pound Rebound

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WITH the broad stock market averages up almost 20 percent from their September lows, it is clear that investors not only believe the recession is ending almost as soon as it began, they also think the recovery will wow. 
 But is a return to outsized earnings growth a reasonable prospect or an irrational hope? With the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trading at about 30 times next year's earnings estimates, the question resonates. 
 James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, fears that investors' optimism is more about hope than reason. 
Though analysts have cut near-term earnings estimates, long-term expectations for United States companies remain high. The median estimate for earnings growth, Mr. Paulsen said, now stands at 13 percent. Adjusting for inflation, that's almost 11 percent. 
Although no one knows what kind of revenue growth companies will generate when recovery comes, in recent years sales growth has averaged around 5 percent. It may be lower, in Mr. Paulsen's opinion.
Thus, if sales are rising 5 percent or less, companies must show a surge in profits to hit that 11 percent target. Although they can be forgiven for wanting to reprise the good old productivity miracle days, Mr. Paulsen argued that this time, the past may not be prologue.
"A lot of investors are saying we went into a short-run recession but we haven't dented our long-term expectations," Mr. Paulsen said. "I think we'll come out of a recession and earnings will do better, but I don't think we're going to come back to growth." He bases his view on several things. Most important is the role of a declining inflation rate. Though low inflation would be a bonanza for consumers, it would spell trouble for companies hard-pressed to raise prices. 
"It seems like a good bet to me that the Consumer Price Index will be under 1 percent soon, on a year-over-year basis," Mr. Paulsen said. "That's going to make companies struggle for profits."
When the economy emerged from its last downturn, in 1991, inflation was around 3 percent and climbed to 3.5 percent. That provided some pricing power to corporations. At 1 percent inflation, that power dissipates.
Mr. Paulsen also said that the companies now showing strength in sales might not be able to translate those figures into profits. Auto sales have soared, but only as a result of no-cost financing. Retail sales have come mostly where price cuts have been deep. "Most everything is tied back to price discounts," Mr. Paulsen said. "We may find that we got a real boost to G.D.P. growth in the fourth quarter, but did any of those companies make money on it?"
As long as bond yields remain relatively high, he added, the stock market will have difficulty. When the economy exits a recession, bond yields typically fall, fueling higher stock prices. Such was the case from mid-September through mid-November, when the S.& P. rose almost 16 percent. But since bond yields started rising in mid-November, stocks have stalled. 
Contrary to investors' high hopes, Mr. Paulsen notes that recessions never turn into full recoveries overnight. In the last recession, a healthy growth rate did not return until 1994, three years after the recovery began. "Between 1991 and 1994," he said, "there were many periods when optimism rose that strong growth was imminent, only to prove mistaken a few months later." 
Everybody knows how well the market anticipates recoveries. What few investors seem willing to recognize is how costly its too-early enthusiasm can be.

HEADLINE: The Drug-Price Express Runs Into a Wall 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM and MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
WITH a clatter of stadium-style seats, several hundred drug stock analysts rushed from the crowded amphitheater in Merck's gleaming $250 million headquarters in Whitehouse Station, N.J., on Dec. 12. Racing into the nearby atrium, they began feverishly contacting their trading desks on their cellphones and Blackberries to report a bombshell for investors.
 Judy C. Lewent, the chief financial officer, had just told the analysts that Merck, a pillar of the pharmaceutical industry and one of its most consistently highly profitable companies, expected no growth in earnings in 2002. The analysts had been expecting 8 percent. 
 By the end of the trading day, Merck shares dropped 9.4 percent, or $6.29, to $60.70. 
Like most other pharmaceutical companies, Merck has hit a wall of resistance to the practice of continually promoting new drugs, typically with higher prices, that are sometimes no better than older ones.
That practice worked well throughout the prosperous 1990's, when employers paid most or all the costs, patients felt no financial pain, and doctors, who write the prescriptions, had little reason to challenge the sales pitches. It didn't hurt that a number of the drugs introduced in those years were breakthrough therapies for widespread problems like high blood pressure, excessive cholesterol and depression.
In those days, when health insurance companies and employers tried to slow the cost spiral, the manufacturers outfoxed them with a system of rebates tied to sales volume -- the more that a health care provider prescribed a particular drug, the greater the rebate -- and an avalanche of television and print advertising aimed at consumers. The industry is spending about $2.5 billion on consumer advertising this year.
But as the economy slumps, and as consumers bear more of the costs of their treatments, the state governments, managed-care companies and employers who foot the bills are trying to clamp down on drug expenditures, which have jumped 92 percent in five years, to $116.9 billion, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Some are banding together to buy in bulk and to demand greater volume discounts.
Others are refusing to buy new drugs that are more expensive but not much more effective than generic versions. And some are considering laws to limit what drug makers can charge.
"There's a lot of pushback," said Robert D. Reischauer, an economist who is president of the Urban Institute, a Washington research center. "Budget difficulties in the states, the rapid rise in health insurance premiums and now the economic downturn" seem to have changed the equation, said Dr. Reischauer, who is also a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Patricia Wilson, an independent pharmaceutical consultant who advises large companies on controlling drug costs, was more succinct. "Employers are like the man in the movie who yelled, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more,' " she said.
The announcement by Merck was the latest and most startling in a chain of disappointments for pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough and Pharmacia. Wall Street has reacted by pushing down drug share prices this year by 18 percent, on average, for the eight largest companies, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has declined 13 percent, according to Neil Sweig, a drug analyst at Ryan Beck & Company. Merck was down 36 percent this year, at Friday's close of $59.63.
The worldwide economic slowdown, reduced budgets for health care and pressures from states and insurers have contributed to "the most challenging period for the entire drug industry that I can recall during more than 25 years in it," said Fred Hassan, chief executive of Pharmacia.
Even the rosy picture painted last week by Henry A. McKinnell, the chief executive of Pfizer, which is still reporting double-digit earnings growth, included a mention of growing pressures on the industry from frustrated employers, insurance companies and consumers.
"Confronted with escalating health expenditures, both payers and providers are seeking to cap the growth of their costs," Dr. McKinell said.
The power shift in health care may be just starting, but it is already affecting drug industry revenue. The sales growth of 8 of the 10 most heavily advertised drugs, nearly all of which have annual sales of more than $1 billion, slowed in the third quarter, compared with the period in 2000, according to IMS Health, a drug research firm.
The eight were Prilosec, a heartburn drug; Celebrex and Vioxx, for arthritis; Paxil, an antidepressant; Claritin, Allegra and Flonase, for allergies; and Viagra, for erectile dysfunction. Only Zocor and Pravachol, two cholesterol treatments, gained momentum, and that was after Baycol, a similar drug with dangerous side effects, was withdrawn from the market.
Patricia Danzon, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in pharmaceuticals, said the drug companies' high rate of growth "is not sustainable in the long run."
The reason is simple. Drug makers' biggest customers have realized that they are big enough to affect sales unilaterally, and the rapid rise in spending on drugs makes it imperative for them to act. More than 40 states are trying to rein in drug costs, especially as their budgets have been battered by the economic slowdown.
"State Medicaid programs are being blown up," said Tom Scully, administrator of the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Florida received federal permission in September under the Medicaid law to use its power as a buyer to extract concessions from Pfizer, which agreed to pay for an education program in the state explaining the value of generics. Mr. Scully said Michigan, Maine and at least a dozen other states were also preparing to ask for similar permission. 
Last year, Maine passed a law that threatened drug makers with price controls. Florida and Michigan have let the drug companies know that if they do not reduce their prices, their products will be excluded from preferred lists of drugs available under Medicaid, which covers the health care costs of the poor.
Many states have begun to join together in buying groups, aiming to become much bigger, more powerful purchasers so that they can extract greater discounts from the drug companies.
Arkansas and Florida are sending emissaries to tell doctors that low-cost generic drugs can often be just as safe and effective as heavily advertised expensive products for the same ailments. "Much of the information that physicians get on drugs comes from salesmen who are on commission," said Ray Hanley, director of the Medicaid program in Arkansas. "Our research shows that most people do not need those drugs that are advertised excessively."
The drug companies are resisting. Last year, the industry asked a federal court to stop Maine's new law, and after losing a round in appeals court, the drug companies are now appealing to the United States Supreme Court.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade group in Washington, has also filed a federal suit against Florida and a state suit against Michigan.
Alan Holmer, the president of the trade group, said programs like Florida's and Michigan's, which try to limit the drugs doctors prescribe, can harm patients.
"When states impose prior authorization requirements, it puts patients who are most in need at the back of the health care line," Mr. Holmer said. "We think that is wrong."
Hoping to eliminate the growing patchwork of state laws, the drug companies have also been lobbying hard in Washington to have federal legislators add prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
But the states are only part of the problem for drug companies. Managed-care companies, facing skyrocketing costs themselves and more pressure from their customers to keep rate increases down, are tightening enforcement of the lists of drugs for which they will provide a high level of coverage. That way, they hope to force doctors and consumers to stick to less expensive treatments when several drugs are effective for a disease.
Many managed-care companies -- and many big companies that insure their own employees -- are requiring employees to shoulder more of the cost of drugs, particularly expensive ones.
In more than one in three drug plans, patients now pay about $7 a prescription, on average, for generic drugs; $14 for brand-name drugs on a preferred list; and $29 for all other prescription medications, according to Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. Some companies, including Chevron, now require employees to pay a percentage of the full price for all drugs, instead of a flat $7 or $29. Such changes give patients an economic incentive to choose the cheapest drug that can treat their conditions.
Other companies take different approaches in response to similar pressures. Verizon Communications, which does not use the percentage co-payment method, still expects employees to shoulder some of the drug burden, and is taking steps to encourage the use of generics.
"We are focused on making sure that value is always delivered," said Bruce Taylor, director of benefits planning at Verizon. His company is concerned about the growth in its bill for prescription drugs -- to $500 million this year, or 25 percent of the $2 billion it spends on health care for one million employees, retirees and their families. Such a percentage is typical of older industries with many retirees. 
"Value always means using the least costly drug that is appropriate to the individual, so you always start with an appropriate generic," Mr. Taylor said. "But in some cases you may even add an expensive drug that a patient should be getting." 
Last summer, Verizon leaned on its drug plan managers to ensure that people taking Prozac switched to the newly available generic version, fluoxetine.
Similarly, the company is checking on whether it can use the new generic version of Mevacor, an older cholesterol treatment.
"Clearly, people are getting more aware of the cost of drugs," said William W. McGuire, chief executive of UnitedHealth Group, which covers 17 million people. "There is probably greater awareness by consumers that there can be options among many drugs within a category," like the cholesterol-lowering drugs.
SOME Blue Cross plans, like Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York and WellPoint Health Networks, based in California, intend to offer a new pricing category next year that could be even more expensive than current reimbursement levels. It may cover "life style" products like Viagra and Rogaine, a treatment for hair loss.
In Empire's version, patients would pay a percentage, possibly 20 percent of the full cost, in its new category, said Dr. Michael Stocker, its chief executive. Empire is also planning to offer small-business customers a new drug discount card next year that will cover only generic drugs. Employees would have to pay the full price for brand-name drugs.
"Two years ago, the entire increase in drug costs was borne by health insurance," said Leonard Schaeffer, the chairman of WellPoint. "Now for the first time, with these three-tier drug plans, Americans are understanding how expensive these drugs have become."
At the same time, WellPoint and other managed-care companies are pressing the drug companies not to use delaying tactics against the introduction of generic versions of their best-selling drugs once the patents on them expire. Generics already account for more than 40 percent of the prescriptions in many managed-care drug plans. The generics' importance should surge in the next five years as American patents expire on drugs with $35 billion in sales, about 28 percent percent of all United States drug sales. That will pose a major threat to drug industry profits.
A generic version of Prozac, the best-selling antidepressant, was introduced last August; next year, rival generic versions of that drug will come on the market, putting additional pressure on prices. General Motors alone expects to save $7 million on Prozac over the next three years by buying the generic version.
WellPoint has campaigned to have the federal Food and Drug Administration change the classification of Claritin and Allegra, two best-selling allergy drugs, so they can be bought without a prescription. That would put them in direct competition with cheaper, comparable over-the-counter antihistamines. The change was supported in a 19-to-4 vote by an F.D.A. advisory committee and is awaiting a decision by a new food and drug commissioner. President Bush has not yet filled that position.
Some economists and others contend that the drug industry's recent focus on trying to extend patent protection for its best-selling drugs may have hurt more than it helped because it distracted them from developing new drugs.
"They are not bringing out as many new truly innovative products, which signals that this industry is going to hit some rougher financial times in the next two to five years," said Stephen Schondelmeyer, an economist at the University of Minnesota.
Larry Feinberg, a partner in Oracle Partners, a health care hedge fund, said that in many respects, the "glory days are over" for the drug industry. For example, he said, the companies can no longer demand higher prices for new "me-too drugs" that are not superior to older products.
MANY companies are now putting their main research efforts into seeking "clinical breakthrough products as opposed to me-too products," said David D. Halbert, chief executive of AdvancePCS, one of the biggest pharmaceutical benefit management companies.
The drug companies say they are just trying to get the best medications to the people who need them. 
"Setting up bureaucratic hurdles is not, in our view, the right way to manage prescription costs," Mr. Hassan of Pharmacia said. "There is a real and present health risk to patients if they are steered toward a cheaper, but less appropriate, product. It would be unfortunate to have physicians' judgments second-guessed by what inevitably will be a bureaucratic and potentially arbitrary prior-approval process."
Merck, the only manufacturer that now has its own managed drug plan unit, Merck-Medco, takes a different tack.
Acknowledging that generic drugs are forcing drug makers to compete on price, Raymond V. Gilmartin, Merck's chief executive, said earlier this year that it was up to the pharmaceutical companies to "demonstrate improvements in patient care, health outcomes, quality of life and cost effectiveness" to win a place on insurers' lists of preferred drugs.
As it happens, Merck's problems are closely tied to the pressures from buyers for generics. Since last summer, patents have expired on three Merck products -- Vasotec, a heart drug; Pepcid, for heartburn; and Mevacor. Next spring, it expects to face generic competition for Prilosec, the best-selling ulcer treatment, which it sells with AstraZeneca.
Health insurers like WellPoint Health Networks and employers like Verizon and General Motors are already planning to push their health plan members to stay with a generic version of Prilosec.
In the past, the managers have often promoted more expensive brand-name alternatives. 
"When Prilosec, the best ulcer drug in the world, goes off patent, why substitute another?" said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, who says growth in drug company profits is slowing.
Even more important for Merck, many health plans have balked at paying for Vioxx and Celebrex, a similar arthritis drug made by Pharmacia, except for a relatively small number of patients who cannot tolerate over-the-counter ibuprofen painkillers like Advil and Motrin, which cost one-tenth as much.
It did not help Vioxx when a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in August said that drugs like it might increase the risk of heart attacks in some patients. Merck said that conclusion was unfounded.
BUT David W. Anstice, president of Merck's human drug sales unit, said the company had been successful for years despite the pressures from insurers and employers. The reason for Merck's current earnings problems "really is the patent expirations," he said.
The payers, of course, see the issue through the other end of the telescope. Health plans like WellPoint are refusing to add expensive new drugs to their preferred lists unless the manufacturers come up with data to show they are worth the money.
"The issue for us is to make health care affordable," said Rob Seidman, WellPoint's chief pharmacy officer. "The enemy is the obscene prices for new pharmaceuticals where the cost-to-value equation has not yet been proved."

HEADLINE: The Next Campaign 

 BODY:
As the holiday season commences, it may seem premature to start thinking about the 2002 elections -- unless you are a member of Congress running for re-election next November. As Congress adjourned last week, it was clear that the jockeying for 2002 had already begun. Lawmakers left Washington dazed and exhausted, preparing to wage the campaign next year on many of the same issues they contested in recent weeks, including taxes, health care, the budget and the economy. 
 A year ago, even as the recession was starting, the federal government projected surpluses far into the future. Today there are deficits to contend with once again. The administration attributes them to the slump. But neutral calculations by the Congressional Budget Office demonstrate clearly that the lavish Bush tax cut is responsible for most of the disappearance of the surplus. 
 When lawmakers return in January, they will likely be preoccupied with some important numbers relating to the makeup of the Senate and House rather than the budget. The House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, has nudged Democratic margins up in each of the last few elections and will try his best to wrest the House for the Democrats in November. In the Senate, most of the seats up for election are held by Republicans, and Democrats will be trying to frame the issues starkly for maximum advantage. 
The biggest issues will all be related to the budget. The administration plans to request more money for the military and domestic defenses while trying to hold the line on overall domestic spending. That stance is certain to put pressure on Congress to cut elsewhere -- in housing, school aid, nutrition and welfare programs.
With so little money, Congress is not preparing to provide a prescription drug benefit for the elderly in Medicare next year. All the talk of money to save or privatize Social Security has also vanished. Democrats are certain to revive these issues in the coming campaign. The recent battle over health benefits for the unemployed offered a preview of a potentially nasty fight. The opening shot is likely to be a drive to provide health and unemployment benefits for the victims of the recession, the biggest unmet need left by the recent session.
Where the money will come from to pay for vital programs is unclear. The challenge is a legacy of Congress's biggest failure this year -- its inability to deal in a realistic way with the economy and the federal budget. Although Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, seems unwilling to try to repeal the parts of the tax cut due to take effect in the next few years, Congress must recognize that it will not be able to get out of its fiscal problems without rescinding some of the cuts. Without adequate financial resources, the nation cannot wage a war, protect against terrorist attacks and meet the health care and education needs of its citizens.

Stocks Edge Up as Investors Read Signposts

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Investors took encouragement from small signs of economic strength last week, and stocks steadied even though a deal on a stimulus package fell apart.
 General Electric and Pfizer forecast robust earnings, supporting hopes for an economic recovery. 
Housing starts rose in November, and new claims for unemployment benefits abated, government reports said. Congress failed to approve a fiscal stimulus program, but investors barely reacted. 
 Merger activity bolstered the market. Amgen's decision to buy Immunex helped biotechnology shares, and a plan by USA Networks to sell its entertainment arm to Vivendi Universal of France helped media stocks. Shares of Comcast, AT&T and Microsoft were volatile after Comcast won the bidding for AT&T's cable unit.
 The Dow Jones industrial average managed to cross above 10,000 again, but the Nasdaq composite index stayed below 2,000. The Dow ended the week at 10,035.34, while the Nasdaq closed at 1,945.83 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,144.89.
 Bond prices rose, pushing yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell to 5.08 percent from 5.16 percent. MICHAEL BRICK

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE VICTIMS; 
A Mr. Fix-It in Brooklyn, A Dedicated Traveler, A Model of Self-Discipline

BYLINE:  These sketches were written by Alison Leigh Cowan, David W. Chen, Sherri Day, Abby Goodnough, Jane Gross, Constance L. Hays, Jan Hoffman, Charlie LeDuff, Felicia R. Lee, Tamar Lewin, Frank Litsky, Melena Z. Ryzik, Ben Sisario, Dinitia Smith and Edward Wyatt.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

EUGENE WHELAN
Guilty of Serial Hugging
 "He was no saint!" said Eugene Whelan's mother, Joan, her laughter bubbling up. "Yeah, he could be a giant pain!" her husband, Alfred, added, chuckling about the ninth of their 10 children. 
 But examples eluded them.
While Firefighter Whelan, 31, undoubtedly jettisoned saint eligibility at some Rockaway pub or Grateful Dead concert -- a captain called him "the king of fun" -- he was still terrific. He kept extra winter jackets in his Jeep in case he spotted a shivering homeless person. He was a persistent serial hugger, spreading those burly embraces known as "Eugene hugs."
He was a Mr. Fix-it and human Velcro to kids. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the neighborhood served by Engine Company 230, children would arrive at the firehouse with broken bicycles for Firefighter Whelan to make whole.
During a school visit, he asked why one child was left in the bus. The child was paralyzed, a teacher replied. Mr. Whelan carried the child to the fire truck. "He understood what life was really about," said his father, "so we feel pretty good about him."

JOSEPH McDONALD
Brainy, Brawny, Balanced
 To mere mortals, people with natural gifts seem to stroll down easy street. Certainly Joseph McDonald appeared that way. He towered over his six siblings athletically and intellectually, said his brother Paul.
A perennial captain, he had the generosity of soul to pick the dorky kids for his team. During high school he was courted by scouts for Major League Baseball, but he chose college.
As he aged, Mr. McDonald was no longer the best athlete, but he was usually the smartest. He could always figure out a way to win. And winning was everything.
Most people knew him as a modest, funny, social fellow. Those closest saw an occasional moodiness that would come upon Mr. McDonald, 43, a bonds broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. He felt, said Paul McDonald, that he was not fulfilling his potential.
But about three years ago, Mr. McDonald suddenly got it. He stopped competing with himself. He cut back the socializing with clients and embraced the family: his wife, Denise; his daughters, Kathleen and Brigid; his parents, Joseph and Mary. Weekends he hiked with the family and coached girls' soccer and softball in Livingston, N.J.
"He accepted that there were other ways to define himself," Paul said: he seemed imbued with faith and fresh joy, and he strolled with the lightness of a man who had found his way to easy street.

PALMINA DELLI GATTI
Keeper of Helpful Secrets
 Palmina Delli Gatti knew things. The secret of homemade pie crusts, for instance, and of a good thick pasta sauce. She knew. She knew the powerful people in the World Trade Center by their first names. When she traveled, she often went alone. They knew her in Paris, London, Rome.
"If there was a famous person in the room, there she was up there rubbing elbows with him," said her sister, Maria Fortuna.
Ms. Delli Gatti, 33, knew numbers. She was an accountant with Marsh & McLennan and lived with her father in Long Island City, Queens. In the evenings, she attended classes in pursuit of a master's degree in business administration, her sister said.
She never married, but hoped for a life mate. It just seemed that the career took possession of Ms. Delli Gatti's youthful years, her sister said. She liked fine things: jewelry from Fifth Avenue; good seats at Yankees games. "She was not afraid to walk through the door of life," Mrs. Fortuna said. "She knew what she wanted, and almost always she got it."

JEFFREY GIORDANO
He Shared His Bounty
 His wife's beloved stepfather, clinging to life in the burn center at New York Hospital, made Jeffrey Giordano promise to become a firefighter. And so he spent 14 years at Ladder Company 3 in the East Village, where he was decorated for bravery last spring after rescuing a woman from a burning apartment.
Firefighter Giordano, 45, also became a devoted friend of the burn center, where adults and children go to heal and where his wife, Marie, worked. He took ice cream to the children there, and endlessly raised money for the New York Firefighters Burn Center Foundation, which buys equipment and contributed $700,000 this year.
On weekends, Firefighter Giordano loaded his van with T-shirts to sell at firefighting conferences, often taking his children -- Victoria, 12; Nick, 9; and Alexandra, 6 -- with him. That was for the foundation, too.
He and his wife met when he was 15 and she was 13. "I miss his arms around me," Mrs. Giordano said. "I thought we would grow old together."
On Jan. 22, the hospital will open a children's playroom in the burn center. It will be named for Firefighter Giordano, who sped to the World Trade Center in the battalion chief's car on Sept. 11, even though it was his day off.

THOMAS J. McCANN
An Unforgettable Cook
 Thomas J. McCann was a great firefighter, a low-handicap golfer, a devoted father to Courtney and Sean and a loving husband to Anne Marie. But he was perhaps best known for his cooking.
A few years back, he decided to whip up a little chicken dish for the guys at Engine Company 65, where he spent most of his career. He got everything ready, set it on top of the range, turned on the heat and then the alarm began to wail. Everybody, Firefighter McCann included, pulled on their coats and boots and jumped onto the truck, pulling out of the firehouse on West 43rd Street and leaving the meal-in-progress behind.
When they returned, several hours later, orange flames and black smoke were billowing from their firehouse and firefighters from another company were spraying water everywhere, trying to bring the situation under control. "I guess they didn't quite turn everything off before they left," said Firefighter McCann's brother, George.
Fire departments from all over started sending Firefighter McCann recipes for barbecued chicken. "Put the chicken on a tray, leave it on the stovetop, turn the stove on and leave your firehouse for two hours," they wrote. "When you come back, it will be well done."

EDWARD SAIYA
Minor Fame, Major Fun
 The Saiya brothers have a place among the countless lesser-known Brooklyn legends. Frank, Art, Mike and Eddie were known as the Fame Brothers of Dayhill Road, based on the first letters of their names.
The Saiyas were tough boys. They went to Catholic school and they liked their beer. They served in Vietnam. But they were not so tough that they could not say they loved each other. Mike Saiya died a few years ago of liver cancer. Eddie Saiya, 49, was a communications engineer who worked on the 110th floor of 2 World Trade Center.
"He called me that morning from the roof, calm as could be, and told me to turn on the TV," Frank Saiya said. "The first building had been hit. He thought it was an accident."
Edward Saiya had two children, Katherine, 16, and Shawn, 11. Their mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, sometime asks how Eddie is doing, Frank Saiya said. They tell her just fine.
Frank, 60, is the eldest Fame brother. He now lives in Topeka, Kan., and has 20 pounds of the trade center rubble in his home. "Maybe part of Eddie is in there," he said. He's got that and the memory of Eddie Saiya in 1969 chasing down two thieves who had stolen his car. "He wasn't wearing anything but his skivvies."

JAMES ANDREW O'GRADY
A Place for Everything. . .
 James Andrew O'Grady kept his shirts arranged by color. He lined up his cuff links just so. And he liked his towels in a certain place. His love of order and ritual might have seemed out of place in the tumultuous world of the bond market, where Mr. O'Grady, 32, was a managing director of fixed-income sales for Sandler O'Neill & Partners.
Yet even there, in his 104th-floor office in the World Trade Center's south tower, "there was rarely a scrap of paper out of place," said Rich Tuohey, a friend and colleague.
As a boy, Mr. O'Grady's intensity focused on swimming, and he won a swimming scholarship to U.C.L.A., where he earned four letters, traveled three times to the N.C.A.A. finals and, in his senior year, was selected as a co-captain of the team.
"He liked things the way he liked them," said Rachel Uchitel, Mr. O'Grady's girlfriend and, since Aug. 5, his fiancee. Early in the morning on Sept. 11, Andy, as he was known, called Ms. Uchitel at work to needle her with a running joke. She had left the towels, he said, in the right place.

PAUL R. HUGHES
The Ultimate Technophile
 Paul R. Hughes was a computer guy. "And our house looked like it," said his wife, Donna Hughes. "He put together most of the electronics in our house. He built all our computers from scratch and was in the middle of building another one. He would go to computer shows or visit online auctions to get parts. U.P.S. visited my house quite frequently."
Only a few things took Mr. Hughes, 38, away from computers. One was a hot tub, installed about a year and a half ago. If he could have found a way to safely tinker with electronics while immersed in the bubbling warm water next to his wife and 10-year-old daughter, he might have tried it.
Another passion was the Yankees. Because Mr. Hughes rose at 5 a.m. to catch an early train from his home in Stamford, Conn., to his job at Marsh Inc., on the 97th Floor of 1 World Trade Center, he frequently could not stay up to watch the end of a game. So he taped them, and woe to the person who even hinted that she knew the outcome.
Some technophiles have trouble communicating their passion to the uninitiated. But Mr. Hughes had the ability to give simple directions on tackling a technology problem, usually sight unseen, said John Humen, a colleague in the data systems department at Marsh. "He would say do this, do that, and your problem would be solved."

JOSEPH SISOLAK
Helping Others to Think
 When there was a problem in the e-mail system at Marsh & McClennan in the World Trade Center, someone would call Joseph Sisolak at home in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, no matter what the hour. Mr. Sisolak, a 35-year-old senior vice president in charge of the e-mail system, would listen but would not hand out an answer. He would tell the caller to think the problem through, a technique that colleagues said made them better at their jobs.
"He just wanted to do the best he could," said his wife, Suzanne. "I think that's why golf appealed to him so much. You had to keep score."
Husband and wife took up golf three years ago, and last summer they played every weekend. Last spring, he joined 20 other men on an annual golf outing to Myrtle Beach, S.C. He was the newcomer, and he brought his enthusiasm to the game. When he parred a hole, he would dance around. He was so excited that he asked to return. Now next spring's getaway has a name: the Joseph Sisolak Memorial Outing.

VINCENT SLAVIN
Outgoing and Outdoor Type
 Vincent Slavin's fiancee called him "very outgoing, high energy, someone who walked to his own beat and never slowed down." His best friend, Tom Robinson, called him "a real New Yorker, a guy you couldn't put anywhere else."
Mr. Slavin, 41, was an equity trader and partner at Cantor Fitzgerald. He and his fiancee, Anna Baez, lived in Belle Harbor, Queens, three houses from the ocean.
Last year, he bought a vacation home on Stratton Mountain in Vermont. He and Ms. Baez drove there with their Rottweiler and their golden retriever on winter weekends for skiing and on summer weekends for biking and canoeing. There were also trips to the Cayman Islands or Belize for scuba diving.
Mr. Robinson, a private investor, and his wife often traveled with Mr. Slavin and Ms. Baez. "He brought everyone into his world," Mr. Robinson said. "Once, a co-worker mentioned in conversation that she would love to see the Oscars in person. Just like that, he got her tickets. He used to introduce me as his brother from another mother. I was proud of that."

JAMES STRAINE
Pleasure From Fishing
 Last August, the Straine family moved to Oceanport, N.J., so that James Straine, 38, could be near the ocean and the Shrewsbury River. Everywhere you go in Oceanport you can see water, and it was just perfect for his great passion, fishing. He would arrive home from his job as a bond salesman at Cantor Fitzgerald in the World Trade Center, scoop up his son Finn, 3, and off they would go, to fish. "He and Finn were best friends," said Mr. Straine's wife, Trish. Last summer, Finn caught his first one, a little snapper, and naturally, Mr. Straine took a picture.
Mr. Straine was also dedicated to his job. When his second son, Charlie, was born on Sept. 5, he took one day off, then he worked half-days. Sept. 10 was his first full day back at work. "He should have been home," Mrs. Straine said.
On Sunday, Sept. 9, the Straines and Mrs. Straine's mother, Dolores Carr, went to the park. There were some children fishing, and Mr. Straine helped them bait and cast their lines. "He just loved that," Mrs. Straine said. "That's exactly why we moved down there. It was a perfect day."

JAYESH SHAH
Provider of Memories
 Jayesh Shah and his brother were always close, whether the family lived in India or Wisconsin or Tulsa or Houston.
They went to the same college. They took computer science classes together in graduate school. "I was a terrible note-taker, and Jayesh was a great note-taker," said Niloy Shah, his brother, younger by a year. And when Jay Shah got married, the newlyweds lived with the younger brother and his wife for months.
Even after Jayesh Shah moved to New York last year, to work at eSpeed International, a division of Cantor Fitzgerald, the brothers talked almost every day.
Mr. Shah, a strong believer in education, wanted to be sure the move would not disrupt his children's schooling, so Mrs. Shah and the children remained in Houston until school was out. Each child has a favorite memory of time with their father. Nikita, 10, loved horseback riding in Yosemite. Sonia, 8, loved the "Sling Shot" ride at Seaside Heights. Kevin, 6, loved wrestling with his dad.
They and their mother -- and Mr. Shah's mother, who is staying with them -- will return to Houston. But education remains a family value, and they will not leave for Texas until June.

CARLTON F. VALVO II
Traveler First Class
 At the memorial service for Carlton F. Valvo II, friends gave his daughter letters describing an adventure-packed life.
At Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., when other students were heading home for spring break, Mr. Valvo was jetting off to Sri Lanka, because he somehow had a friend whose father knew the ambassador. "When Carl traveled, he traveled first class," said a college friend, Mitchell Barnett.
On one of his weeks off, Mr. Valvo and his mother, Coletta, met in Manhattan to drop in on the art auctions. He enjoyed them enough that later, when he moved to New York, he often volunteered to check out paintings in Sotheby's catalog that his mother was considering. Working as an international bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald just gave Mr. Valvo more ways to see the world. He visited dozens of countries in his 38 years.
Mr. Valvo met his wife, Lori Rossiter, while attending an opera performance. Their daughter, Dante, 7, is already like her dad in her ability to take in the U.S. Open one weekend and a Jets game the next.
For the holidays, Lori and Dante have an invitation to visit the Valvos' ski home in Oregon. But then, they also have an offer to go abroad. You see, Mr. Valvo had a friend whose brother is married to a Pakistani maharani living in Morocco. . .

EDWARD W. SCHUNK
His Turn to Wait
 On her way to work each morning, Lisa Schunk would drop off her husband, Edward W. Schunk, at the Baldwin, N.Y., train station in time for the 6:20 to Manhattan. Her car would be there each night as well, waiting as the 6:05 pulled in. Though life was hectic at Cantor Fitzgerald, where her husband worked as a broker, he stepped off the train as if his day were just beginning.
"He would be walking this John Wayne walk," she said. "He was the best-looking man getting off that train, because he would just glow."
Mrs. Schunk spent many of the hours in between preparing meals as a corporate chef. Yet she was still delighted to serve up her husband's favorite Italian dinner by candlelight when they got home. Dessert was typically chocolate pudding or cookie-dough ice cream. "He'd always get three scoops, and I'd say, 'get one-and-a-half,' " she recalled -- not that he listened.
They had no children, but at 54, he was often the only adult using the slide at his country club's pool, and he played Santa for his eight nieces at Christmas. No pillow was necessary, thanks to all that ice cream.
His wife says that he must be in heaven. "I know he's waiting for me until we meet again," she said.

DEBORAH KOBUS
Open to Adventure
 Getting downsized is no fun at all, unless you have the Deborah Kobus perspective on things. Ever since her days at New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn, she was the sort who knew how to cheer herself up, lately by sailing to Tahiti or going skiing in Argentina.
So her response to getting abruptly fired during the economic downturn just over a year ago was to jump into her Ford Explorer and drive to Colorado, figuring the skiing would be great. Work would take care of itself. It always did. She walked into the St. Regis Hotel, arguably the best ski hotel in Aspen, and walked out with a switchboard job that left weekends free for skiing and who knows what else?
The what else was meeting the man who would become her fiance, Alexander Setzler, who also worked at the hotel.
When the skiing ended, Ms. Kobus, 36, returned to New York to help her brother, Robert, care for their mother, who has Alzheimer's disease.
She soon found a job on Wall Street, as assistant vice president at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, on the 83rd floor of 2 World Trade Center. On Labor Day, Mr. Setzler proposed, successfully. Ms. Kobus planned to tell her mother and brother the happy news the following week.

JON SCHLISSEL
A Believer in Fitness
 There were a lot of sides to Jon Schlissel, and he was passionate about every one of them. He was religious about maintaining his health, and he exercised nearly every day. At 51, Mr. Schlissel had washboard abs and a physique that was the envy of his friends. He was also a dedicated naturist.
To people who toured historic homes in Jersey City, Mr. Schlissel was the man who owned a 14-room Victorian-style brownstone, painstakingly restored and furnished with items from the Victorian era.
His co-workers at the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, where Mr. Schlissel worked for 29 years, knew him as a dedicated employee. He last worked as a mediator for the agency, but he also knew how to stir things up. He challenged politicians on a variety of issues, including civil rights for gays, and was the kind of advocate who refused to let term limits stop him from serving in his neighborhood civic association.
"Even when he couldn't be in it anymore, he'd be the one making sure that there was ketchup for everyone when they had a potluck dinner," said his brother, Laurence.
Jon Schlissel was faithful to his 80-year-old mother, Ruth, calling her every Saturday morning and visiting her in Florida twice a year. "My son Larry used to talk from 10 to 11, and then I'd talk to Jonny," his mother said. Now, she said, "At 11, I cry. My nieces and nephews call. They try. No one's going to take Jonny's place."

ROBERT L. HOROHOE JR.
In Love With His Work
 Robert L. Horohoe Jr. was literally reared to be a corporate bond broker. His father, a former senior executive at Cantor Fitzgerald, kept a Telerate machine in their house and introduced him early to terms like "bid" and "offer."
So when Mr. Horohoe graduated from college and went to work for Cantor Fitzgerald in 1992, it was a natural and seamless progression. "He loved it there," said his brother Michael, who once worked at Cantor as a bond broker. (One sister, Donna Erskine, is also a former Cantor employee.) "People would gripe all the time, but Bobby never complained about going to work so early and leaving late. He was team Cantor."
After 10 years in Battery Park City, where he could see his office from his apartment, Mr. Horohoe, 31, had decided to buy a home in his native Holmdel, N.J., where he spent nearly every weekend at his mother's house, relaxing with his fiancee, recounting tales of earlier days with his high school buddies, and playing tennis with fellow weekday city dwellers.
Now, his mother, Patricia, said, "On Friday when I come home, the house is a little empty. Maybe I'm just waiting for him to come through the door and say 'Ah, it was a hoax' or something."

ADAM RAND
Doing What Came Naturally
 Adam Rand always wanted to be a firefighter.
When he graduated from high school, he joined the volunteer fire department in his Bellmore, N.Y., neighborhood. Even after Mr. Rand, 30, became a member of the New York City Fire Department in 1995, he continued to volunteer in Bellmore. For Mr. Rand, fighting fires was a calling.
He reveled in the camaraderie and in learning new techniques that he could teach to younger firefighters.
Mr. Rand's specialty was rescue. On Sept. 11, he joined his fellow members of Squad 288 from Maspeth, Queens, at 2 World Trade Center. He was trying to evacuate people when the building collapsed.
"If he had to die, he died doing something he loved," his mother, Mary Ann Rand, said.
Mrs. Rand said that in addition to his devotion to firefighting, her son lived a life of full appreciation for other activities, like skiing, fishing, hunting and preparing for his forthcoming wedding.
At the firehouse in Bellmore, Mr. Rand will be remembered for his legendary Halloween costumes. He once arrived at the annual party wearing a red wood box. Mr. Rand had cut out a square hole on the back of the box so that his face could be seen. He was supposed to be the missing child on the back of a milk carton.

SANDRA FAJARDO SMITH
Happy in New York
 When Sandra Fajardo Smith heard that her dear cousin, Wanda Fajardo, was feeling lonely and wanted to return to their native Brazil to celebrate her 43rd birthday, she would have none of it. Stay in New York, she told Wanda. Let me organize a birthday party. Trust me, you'll have a good time.
Ms. Smith was right. She was good at cheering people up. She was effervescent, always smiling. She loved her job as an accountant at Marsh & McLennan, loved working out at the gym, loved all of the city's cultural offerings.
But she especially loved her cousin. The two had grown up together, in a small inland town, and had come to New York more than a decade ago. And even though Ms. Smith was seven years younger, Ms. Fajardo relied increasingly on Ms. Smith for advice. "Sandra was so strong, so mature, and there was no one that I trusted more," said Ms. Fajardo, whose birthday party took place on Sept. 9. "She was like my therapist. I told her everything. Now, I don't know who I'm going to talk to."

ELKIN YUEN
Creative Vacationer
 Wall Street brokers often complain about how much work they have to do in such little time that they can't even contemplate taking a vacation. But not Elkin Yuen, who worked for Carr Futures.
Every year, he and his wife, Cella, took two major vacations and plenty of smaller ones, to get away from the city they grew up in. It was important, he always told his wife, to have fun, to live in the moment. (And to play golf, go to the beach and gamble, if at all possible.) Even when his wife had the urge to save money more quickly to buy a house, "he'd rather spend a few thousand dollars going away for a week than save the money," his wife recalled. And with that perpetual smile and infectious joie de vivre, who could say no?
Hawaii, Cancun, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Lake Tahoe, St. Maartens, Walt Disney World: they all made their way into the overflowing photo albums in the Yuens' Flushing home. Oh, and Aruba, twice. "I'm so glad he pushed me," Mrs. Yuen said. "I would have lost all that time with him."
Perhaps the only thing Mr. Yuen loved more than going on vacation was doting on his daughter, Nicole, now 3. These days, Nicole is still not sure what happened, but she does miss her father. She sometimes tells her mother: "I want Daddy to come home. Daddy used to take me to Chucky Cheese."

DENNIS GERMAIN
Daffy Downhill Skiing
 Dennis Germain, 33, a firefighter with Ladder Company 2, spent his working hours in the canyons of Midtown Manhattan and his free time on the slopes. He was a ski instructor at Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, N.Y., where he trained high school racing teams. He skied the Rockies on department trips. And he was indispensable at the annual downhill race at Hunter Mountain, which pits firehouses against one another.
Teams of five people grab hold of a 50-foot fire hose and spread out across the trail. The goal is to ski together without letting go, falling, or otherwise messing up. No, they are not allowed to use ski poles. Yes, there are other skiers sharing the snow. Depending on the firefighters' finesse, the spectacle can be either mildly funny or completely hilarious. "The hoses in many cases would cross and guys would go head over heels down the mountain," Lt. Neil Skow said. But not Firefighter Germain: "Dennis was always one of the better skiers we had."
His other specialty at Ladder 2 was starting enormous debates in the fire house kitchen with politically incorrect statements he was sure would set people off. As the argument heated up, he would slip away. "He loved what he did," said his brother Brian, a firefighter in Harlem.

A. TODD RANCKE
A Community Fixture
 When A. Todd Rancke knocked you down, you did not want to get back up, because you were too busy laughing. Mr. Rancke, a managing director at Sandler O'Neill, had a teasing sense of humor that played on people's flaws but did not generate any ill will, said his sister, Cindy Bienemann. "He could crack on you in a way without making you feel bad," she said.
In fact, it seemed that he did just the opposite. Mr. Rancke, who would have been 43 today, was such a fixture in the Summit, N.J., community where he lived that people teased him about being mayor someday, said his wife, Deborah. He was so well loved by his clients that they would sometimes join him on family vacations with his wife and children, Christina, 11; Brittany, 9; and Todd Jr., 7.
For all his jocularity, Mr. Rancke was a gentleman at heart, a caring man whose primary concern was his family's happiness. Mrs. Rancke sees that same quality in her children, especially her son. Now little Todd puts his arms around her when she's sad, Mrs. Rancke said, "just like big Todd used to do."

KENNETH SWENSON
Man of Inner Peace
 Leslie Swenson's favorite memory of her husband, Kenneth Swenson, is the day of the balloons. It was late May or early June, and the couple and their two sons, 10-year-old Kyle and 13-year-old Eric, were at a local field in Chatham, N.J. kicking a ball around. Suddenly, balloons of all colors floated from the sky and landed on the field. "He brought them over to me and said, 'I ordered these for you,' " Mrs. Swenson said.
Mr. Swenson, 40, was a vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald. "He was a great father to our two sons," his wife said. "He enjoyed taking them on camping trips. That was their father-son activity."
There was not much spare time in Mr. Swenson's life, but on Saturday nights he was a volunteer medical technician with Chatham's emergency squad, just like his father before him. Richard Rosenblum, a friend, said that Mr. Swenson was one of the first to marry, because he wanted a family.
He also retained his baby face long after the rest of them fought hair loss and weight gain. "He was like a piece of buttered bread," he said of Mr. Swenson. "No friction, no hassle. He was a peaceful guy, but no one took advantage of him. He was a man about things."

CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN
True Partner at Home
 Christopher and Dolores Sullivan were high school sweethearts, and he gave her a happy ending with a modern twist. She got a prince who was never too tired to play with their sons, Sean, 6, and Brian, 4 or to prepare her lunch for work. Mr. Sullivan, 39, was a firefighter at Ladder 11 and Engine 214 in Brooklyn.
"The main thing about him was that he was an excellent father," Mrs. Sullivan said. "He'd come home after working 24 hours and they would want to play and he played. He took them hiking and camping. He also did everything at home, from cooking to cleaning. We were a real team."
"The kids didn't have their Dad long, but they got a lot from him," Mrs. Sullivan said.
Jim Sullivan, Christopher's father, said his son "had a heart of gold but no one pushed him around," which made him perfect for firefighting. "Chris loved his job so much. We really respected the men he worked with."
Firefighter Sullivan also loved nature. He planted a pumpkin for the first time this year, and it grew. The family used it to make pumpkin bread at Thanksgiving.

HENRY MILLER JR.
Gentle Procrastinator
 With one exception, Henry Miller Jr., 51, made his way through life slowly, meticulously. He took maddeningly long to finish anything -- woodworking, roofs, stories. His Massapequa, N.Y., garage was a testament to the potential of broken objects, the dream of a thousand somedays when he would get around to fixing them. (Enduring mystery: just how old was that slice of pie found under the scuba gear and fishing tackle?)
Yes, he took his time. Spent 28 years at the job. Countless hours giving pep talks to a woman who lived on the street; she would later credit him with her decision to get off welfare, find work, start a bank account. He was 45 before he married. And like all his projects, this one glowed: "I dunno, fellas," Mr. Miller would say to holdout bachelors, "marital bliss, it's the way to go!"$

HEADLINE: The "A" List of Companies 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Three User's Manuals for Modern Management" (Book Value, Nov. 25), in which William J. Holstein reviewed three recent books on business change: 
 The review questioned how Jim Collins, in his book "Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't," could rank companies like Circuit City and Walgreen on a list of top performers, but not a company like Intel. 
But this isn't a book about innovation or social welfare.
Mr. Collins, one of the few management experts who is truly serious about research, asks an original and highly relevant question: What companies were able to make changes that led to sustained, superior performance in their product markets? He speaks to business executives who want to build stronger companies. He doesn't claim that Walgreen is in a cosmic sense a more important company than Intel.

HEADLINE: As Democracies Spread, Islamic World Hesitates 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
While more than three-quarters of 145 non-Muslim nations around the world are now democracies, most countries with an Islamic majority continue to defy the trend, according to a survey published last week by Freedom House in New York. 
 In the Islamic world, the survey found 11 democratic countries, or only 23 percent of the 47 nations that are predominantly Muslim. 
 "Since the early 1970's, when the third major historical wave of democratization began, the Islamic world, and, in particular, its Arab core, have seen little evidence of improvements in political openness, respect for human rights and transparency," said the new survey, "Freedom in the World 2001-2002." 
"In countries where there is an Islamic majority, there is just one free country, Mali, while 18 are rated partly free and 28 are not free," said Freedom House, an independent monitor of political rights and civil liberties. 
Among the most democratic Muslim countries after Mali are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait, Turkey and Morocco, according to the survey. 
The Freedom House surveys measure areas like the right to form political parties representing a wide range of views and the right to seek elected office; the protection of religious, ethnic, linguistic, gender and economic rights; and the protection of freedoms of the press, belief and association. Assigned numerical rankings, countries are declared free, partly free or not free. 
The absolute rankings used by Freedom House, however, cannot reflect all political trends or developments in a given country, where the realities of daily life may be more complicated or even at some variance with the place that nation is assigned on the survey's list. 
At the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Sweden, Bengt Save-Soderbergh, the organization's secretary general, said that under the surface in many Muslim nations there were interesting developments, and they were not always recognized and supported by democratic countries. 
"In a few countries, extremist fundamentalism has dominated for some time, but in a much larger number of countries efforts at democratization are much more important," Mr. Save-Soderbergh said in an exchange of e-mail messages from the institute, which is supported by democratic governments, though not the United States. 
"People driving these democratic processes often face very tough conditions," he said. "They are challenged by a combination of corrupt governments, fundamentalists and international double standards. As an example, I think it was most unfortunate that the world at large did not respect the outcome of the elections in Algeria in 1992, when an Islamic party was denied an electoral victory and the army took over."
The Islamic party never had to face "the tough realities of participatory democracy," he said. Many Muslims, including in Iran, have learned that religion does not solve a country's social or economic problems and is not a substitute for democracy, he said. 
In general, the Freedom House survey found that 121 of the world's 192 governments -- or 63 percent -- are electoral democracies, the highest figure ever recorded. Around the world, 86 countries are considered genuinely free by the survey; 29, including the United States, received a perfect score. 
The 10 lowest-ranking countries according to the survey were Afghanistan (before the war), Cuba, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Turkmenistan. 
The emergence of mass terrorism may threaten the "tranquillity" of democracies, Freedom House said, but democratic governments and free-market systems were likely to prove resilient because citizens have "a sense of ownership."

HEADLINE: A $12 Million Plan to Save The Forests by Buying Them 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The Open Space Institute, one of the largest conservation groups in the Northeast, has set aside $12 million to help land trusts protect some of the largest and best-known forest areas in the Adirondacks, the Green Mountains of Vermont, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
 The money will be awarded to selected land trusts in the next three years, and can be used only for property in what is known collectively as the Northern Forest, a 26-million-acre stretch of wilderness that takes roughly the shape of a barbell stretching from New York to Maine. 
About 4 million acres of that is already included in state and federal parks, the single biggest chunk being New York State's 2.6-million-acre stake in the Adirondack Park.
This week, the institute announced that the first $1.4 million of that money would be used to help three groups buy a total of 62,854 acres of privately owned land in the Northern Forest. The grants include $400,000 to the Nature Conservancy for 26,500 acres in the central Adirondacks, and another $400,000 grant to the Trust for Public Land for 13,910 acres in northern New Hampshire that will link two sections of the White Mountain National Forest. 
The institute's focus on the Northern Forest comes when many financially struggling paper and pulp companies are closing aging mills in the Northeast, consolidating their holdings, and selling off vast tracts of forestland that they have owned for decades. In the past four years, these companies have sold nearly one-fifth of the land in the Northern Forest to financial investors and other timber companies, and to a much lesser extent, conservation groups, according to the institute's statistics.
But conservation groups have increasingly sought to acquire these lands, or the development rights to them, to prevent the new owners from chipping away at the Northern Forest. These groups say they want to protect wildlife habitats and public access to recreational areas, and just as important, to ensure that working forestland continues to be used for commercial timber harvests. Though the timber industry has steadily declined in the Northeast, it remains a vital part of the economy in many rural towns and villages.
"This is a one-time opportunity," said Joe Martens, president of the Open Space Institute. "The land is for sale now and a lot of these transactions are going to determine the fate of the Northern Forest for a long time to come."
David M. Smith, a professor emeritus at the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, said that conservation efforts were especially needed in areas near rivers and lakes in the Northern Forest. He said developers and second-home owners have been drawn to waterfront property, carving out private refuges that displace the wildlife. "There is a need to protect those lands," he said. "It's important to keep some of the tall pine trees as nesting sites for bald eagles and ospreys."
The Open Space Institute, a nonprofit group endowed with money from the Reader's Digest fortune, raised the $12 million from two New York City philanthropies, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Surdna Foundation, and plans to supplement that with money from private donors. It has formed an advisory board of forestry experts and conservationists to review and select proposals from land trusts.
The institute's director of the Northern Forest Protection Fund, Denise Schlener, said the goal was not to acquire all the private property in the Northern Forest but to protect pieces that would link together adjoining forest areas to preserve the larger landscape. She estimated that as many as 5 million acres could be protected with money from the institute's program.
The $400,000 grant to the Nature Conservancy's Adirondack chapter will be used to repay part of the loan used to buy three large tracts of land that it recently acquired from the International Paper Company for $10.5 million. The properties, which are near the town of Long Lake in the central Adirondacks, include a pristine 800-acre lake that has not been open to the public. 
The Adirondack chapter's director of land protection, Todd Dunham, said the group borrowed money to buy the land and plans to eventually resell it to New York State, or to private owners who will promise not to develop it. "The property was available, and we had to move on it as quickly as we could," he said. "These kinds of resources don't come up for sale very often."
The Northern Forest covers about 14 million acres in Maine, 8 million acres in New York and 2 million acres each in Vermont and New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE EXILED RULER; 
Backers Seek a Role for Ex-King

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Those around the 87-year-old former king of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who has spent nearly three decades in isolated exile here, want to see him take on more than a symbolic role in rebuilding their country. Some even speak of restoring the monarchy.
 "I think people are still attached to the monarchy," the king's cousin and former military commander, Gen. Abdul Wali, said in an interview. "I'm one of those people, and there are others like me, who want him to play an active role during a period of transition." He described that role "as the national leader or head of state." 
 The reclusive Zahir himself, however, rebuffs any suggestion of restoring the monarchy, and remains noncommittal about what role he might have in rebuilding the country he has not seen since he was overthrown in 1973. 
Mostly forgotten before Sept. 11, he has since been taken increasingly seriously as someone with the potential to unite his people. He was their last leader in a time of peace, and his greatest strength has been that he has seemed beyond personal ambition, both because of his temperament and his advanced age.
Soon, he is expected to return to Afghanistan to convene a loya jirga, or tribal council, which will elect a new government. There is also speculation that he may be chosen, not to rule, but to serve as the transitional head of state who would in turn name the head of government, subject to a vote of confidence by the council.
Yet even as he prepares to return to his country, he continues to seem so oddly detached and indifferent, not to his country's fate, but to his own, that it is somewhat difficult imagining him boarding the plane.
He has certainly waged no campaign to bat down persistent questions about his competence to take on anything beyond a symbolic role, though several Western diplomats and one journalist who met him for the first time recently described him as remarkably fit, lucid and even something of a flirt.
For many weeks, aides have been saying, over and over in an endless loop, that His Majesty is ready to return to Afghanistan at a moment's notice. Yes, now he is ready. Yes, now he is really ready.
Yet it is hard to say how the former king himself feels. He has given face-to-face interviews since Sept. 11 only to Newsweek, Vanity Fair and People magazine. He told Newsweek: "It is not a question of seeking a position. I see my role as a peacemaker."
To Vanity Fair, the Francophile former monarch, who was schooled in Paris and Nice, said: "Je n'ai jamais ete optimiste." (I have never been an optimist.)
He had turned down an invitation to return to his country to try to govern 11 years ago, he explained, because, "I have always believed that unless I was willing to personally go forward and lead this putsch, that I should not encourage others to do something where a lot of people would lose their lives."
Ten years ago, a man posing as a journalist pulled a knife on him. But the paralyzing mixture of caution and royal reserve in his reticence have deeper roots. General Wali, his cousin, said the former king did not speak to reporters more frequently because he was bored by saying the same thing over and over.
Certainly the former king has never sought either attention or power. Those who know him best describe him as quiet and kind, an intellectual but often indecisive man who has always been reluctant to lead.
He was a lonely but pampered child who grew into an athletic youth particularly fond of tennis, mountain climbing and horseback riding. 
At 16, he married his first cousin.
At 19, in 1933, he was training to become an officer in the Royal Afghan Army when his father, Nadir Shah, was assassinated in front of him while handing out diplomas at a graduation ceremony in the gardens of their palace in Kabul.
"Suddenly, a boy in the crowd pulled a handgun and began shooting," said General Wali, who was there. Zahir threw himself on his father's body, weeping and trying to shield him from further bullets, "but it was too late."
Within the hour, the young man was proclaimed king.
In the early years, his father's three brothers and various other male relatives held effective control, while he rode the country on horseback, visiting his people and seeking to improve the country's agricultural production by better matching crops to the climate.
His 40-year reign was a time of relative calm, and when he finally came into his own, in the early 1960's, he brought a new measure of democracy to Afghanistan.
During his reign, a new constitution established a Parliament, guaranteed girls an education and women the rights to vote and a place in political life. Women at that time served as representatives and cabinet members, though the new Parliamentary government was wobbly, and a series of governments fell.
Even then, though, there were complaints that the king was too indecisive. "During a period in which this system must look to him for leadership, he is unsure as to when and how to intervene," the American ambassador, Robert Neumann, said in a 1970 cable. "This indecision has been the foremost obstacle to economic modernization."
Never a workaholic, either, and was often distracted by his passion for horses and ski holidays. Sometimes, even intimates thought he was just not paying enough attention.
Zahir was on the island of Ischia, off the coast of Naples, consulting a specialist about an eye injury suffered during a volleyball match, when he learned that he had been overthrown.
The coup was engineered by a slighted cousin, with the help of some young communists who paved the way for the Soviet invasion of 1979, and the king took the familial betrayal especially hard.
He never went back to Afghanistan, but while he stayed on in Italy, he never really settled here either. His cousin sent him a $10,000 monthly stipend -- the income from his investments and properties. But when the cousin was killed in a coup before the Soviet invasion, the money stopped, and Zahir Shah was forced to live on a tight budget for a time.
"The King and the Queen don't even have a live-in maid," a 1979 report in The New York Times noted. "An Italian woman comes in every day to do household chores." Later, the Saudis began subsidizing him and his entourage, none of whom seems to have a paying job.
His life here has truly been a life of the mind, 28 years spent buried in French novels, painting miniatures, walking in his garden and dreaming of Afghanistan. He has never learned Italian, never socialized, and rarely ventures from his heavily guarded home north of Rome.
Someone who knew him in the late 70's said, "He was shuffling around in his felt slippers even then," like a much older man.
Now, rather than seeking power for himself, he is urging Afghans to unite behind Hamid Karzai, a distant relative and ally, who is the country's new interim leader.
One thing he has never wavered on is "his sentiment is that monarchy has not existed for 28 years and people have changed," General Wali said. "I do not think that way, but he has wanted to make clear he is not a pretender to the throne, or interested in restoring the monarchy. Or, God forbid, in becoming a politician."

HEADLINE: A Mittenless Autumn, for Better and Worse 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK and ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Across the Northeast, people opened their doors yesterday to discover something unfamiliar: a chill in the air.
 Weeks later than usual, temperatures have finally descended into something like their normal late-December range. The cold snap followed an autumn in which sidewalk cafes stayed open into December, golf courses were packed with plaid and the first World Series game ever played in November felt more like May. The unseasonal curveball that the weather threw at the calendar affected almost everyone, for better and for worse. 
 Varel Bailey, a cattle and pig farmer in Anita, Iowa, has been spending 5 percent to 10 percent less on grain because cattle eat less when it is not cold. 
In New Mexico, Ski Santa Fe, a snow-starved resort, had to postpone its planned Thanksgiving Day opening to Dec. 8, and even now has less than half its skiing areas open.
In the natural world, daffodils bloomed, and the grass at the New York Botanical Garden was a lush green the week before Christmas. In Pennsylvania, a baby killdeer hatched in December instead of April. And in Massachusetts, Bill Davis, a state wildlife biologist, came home from a deer station one recent day with a sunburn.
"It's global warming, dude," said Pito Robles, 28, an auto mechanic who on Thursday was dangling his fishing line into the Hudson River near West 66th Street in Manhattan. "I don't care if the whole planet burns up in a hundred years. If I can get me a fish today, it's cool by me."
In fact, the warm spell that settled over much of the nation this fall may not be caused by global warming, the gradual but potentially calamitous rise in worldwide temperatures that most scientists attribute, at least in part, to fuel-burning human activities like making electricity and driving. When burned, fuels release carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" that trap heat in the atmosphere.
The fall weather could have been a fluke, climatologists agree, because in the short run weather often does unanticipated things.
But the unusually balmy fall seems to fit at least two longer-term patterns. One is that the weather has become significantly more erratic and variable, and that is likely to continue, scientists say.
Another is that the warming trend is destined to continue. This year is expected to be the second warmest on earth since 1860, when temperatures were first measured systematically. Nine of the 10 warmest years have occurred since 1990. And one of the world's leading forecasting agencies, the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research in Britain, says there is a 75 percent chance that next year will be even warmer than this year.
So far, the results of global warming in North America seem to be a mix of good and bad. Since 1960, New England has seen the last hard freeze come a day earlier every three years, extending the growing season. But in the Middle Atlantic and the South, shores are receding as seas, slowly raised by melting glaciers, eat away at coasts. 
And Alaska, where warming has been most pronounced, is undergoing a host of changes. Glaciers are receding, permafrost melting, shrubs spreading across previously barren tundra. The start of the Iditarod dog race this year had to be moved north because the trail near the usual starting point was too mushy.
But the growing variability of the weather may be as troublesome as the warming. This weekend, after a mittenless fall, temperatures are plummeting quickly across the country. And the prospect of a sudden, sustained cold snap is making many people uneasy.
Will birds that delayed their ritual migration be trapped up north by frigid weather? Will buds that bloomed in December's warm chicanery burst their pipes and suffer winter damage? 
"The party is almost over for people who like warm weather," said Jon B. Davis, a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago. "Wednesday's 49 degrees in Chicago was probably the warmest we will see until late March. We are headed into a major-league cold pattern."

Labor and Industry
Even if this winter is about to earn its reputation, the fall's warm weather has made its mark -- economically, environmentally and in other ways.
It has been a boon to workers at the site of the World Trade Center disaster. Joe Bradley, the foreman of a crew of machine operators struggling to clear rubble at ground zero, said the mild weather allowed them to clean up the site quickly and to recover bodies they might not have otherwise found. 
"It gave us an opportunity to get the bulk of the work done," Mr. Bradley said. "It was a gift from God, a real miracle." 
Economically, the warm spell has cut both ways, benefiting some industries while hurting others. Warm weather, it turns out, may get people out of their houses, but not necessarily into stores. Foot traffic may have increased, retailers say, but people tend to window-shop. And they are not buying the winter supplies that stores have stocked. As a result, retailers have slashed prices on things like coats, scarves and gloves.
"Warm weather is not good for retailers," said Scott Bernhardt, senior vice president in charge of retail research at Planalytics, a consulting firm in Wayne, Pa., that provides long-range weather predictions and marketing advice to retailers. "A winter like this hurts because retailers don't plan on it." 
Snow shovel sales are down about two-thirds for the 7,200 hardware stores in the TruServ cooperative in Chicago, said Ray Winkel, its director of inventory management. But snow blowers are selling well. "Unlike snow shovels, they are not an impulse purchase, and people remembered what a tough winter last year was," Mr. Winkel said.
And other industries are clearly benefiting from the warmth. Scott Arves, president of Schneider National in Green Bay, Wis., the huge trucking company known for its orange fleet, said the mild weather had resulted in hundreds fewer accidents, lower maintenance costs and on-time delivery rates rare in late fall and winter, when a single storm can delay 1,000 Schneider trucks. 
Warm weather has depressed demand for natural gas, and, partly as a result, prices have fallen sharply -- to $2.60 per million B.T.U.'s of gas to be delivered next month, from $10 last winter. That has helped consumers in the upper Midwest, where gas provides 90 percent of the home heating energy.
In agriculture, the warmth has generally been welcome. Livestock farmers can buy less grain, not only because cows eat less in warm weather but also because breeding stock can stay out in the fields longer to forage. Grain farmers can expect to pay less for fertilizer, because natural gas is a major component.
In states like Florida, rising temperatures may change growing patterns. A 1989 freeze pushed the citrus belt south, said Jim Lushine, a National Weather Service meteorologist, but warmer weather may have the opposite effect. "We could see a return, a northward shift in some of the growing climates in Florida," he added, "and that might actually prove to be a boon for some people."

Flora and Fauna
Some plants and animals have reacted to the warm cycle as if it were a false spring.
Spring peepers are calling, woodpeckers and ruffed grouse have been drumming, said Mr. Davis, the wildlife biologist. More ticks seem to be active late into the year, he said. And in Montana, the Bitterroot Valley has been alive with butterflies that would normally be hibernating.
Most birds that migrate over long distances are not affected by the warmth because they would already have been in the tropics by September. But other species, like ducks and geese, which migrate shorter distances, have stayed north.
Two calliope hummingbirds were first spotted at Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan about a month ago, when they would ordinarily be in Mexico, and were still at the park last week. 
The birds that have stayed north could suffer if a sudden cold snap causes ponds and lakes to freeze, making food unavailable for several days, said Dr. Jeff Price, director of Climate Change Impact Studies for the American Bird Conservancy.
Deer may actually benefit from the warmth. The deer population got winter coats on time, but then was less active and consumed fewer calories because of the higher temperatures, Mr. Davis said, adding, "This sends them into winter in better condition to survive."
Many plants may not do as well. At the New York Botanical Garden, Dr. Kim Tripp, vice president for horticulture and living collections, said the prolonged warmth, coupled with a long drought, had left trees and other plants discombobulated and stressed. To survive the winter, Dr. Tripp said, plants have to go through a long process of shutting down: annuals die, perennials kill off their tops, deciduous plants shed their leaves, evergreens pump antifreeze into their needles.
"It's still October for the plants," she said. If it suddenly goes from October to January, water could freeze in the plants' cells and burst them. If the freeze hits anything that has actually flowered, it will not develop buds for next spring, she said.
Several years of these conditions could take a toll on trees, too. Mature canopy could be lost because such stress leaves trees more vulnerable to disease and insects.
"You fight off a cold better when you are healthy and vigorous," Dr. Tripp said. "When you are stressed your metabolism is slower and healing is slower."

The Outlook
Even if this past fall's warm weather was only a blip in the global thermostat, most scientists are beginning to believe that human alteration of the atmosphere is at least partly responsible for a warming trend that has been going on for decades.
"I think it's increasingly clear that humans are influencing the climate," said Dr. Peter H. Gleick, director of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security in Oakland, Calif. "I think the debate over whether the climate is going to change is over, and now the debate is what will the impacts be, how bad will they be and what should we do about it."
Dr. Edward S. Sarachik, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said it was especially significant that 2001 had proved so warm. Usually, the conditions in a single year are discounted by climate scientists because weather conditions vary naturally over short time spans, pushed this way or that by unpredictable shifts in sea temperatures and wind patterns. 
But in 2001 there was no such push -- in particular, no sign of El Nino, the ocean condition in which unusually warm waters spread across the Pacific. El Nino has exerted a powerful influence in many other recent unusually warm years, including 1998, the warmest year on record. But this year, the Pacific has just emerged from the opposite, cooler condition, La Nina.
A milder climate has short-term and long-term consequences for everything from water supplies to beaches.
Higher temperatures, for example, mean reduced snow melt from the Sierras, on which California's reservoirs depend.
"As the earth is warming, less of our precipitation will be snow and more will fall as rain, and that has a whole series of problems for us," Dr. Gleick said. "It means we're going to get more runoff in the winters when we're most worried about floods. And at the other end it means our spring and our summer runoff is going to be reduced -- and that's when we need it most."
In Alaska -- and much of Siberia -- the annual mean temperature has risen 3 to 5 degrees over the last 30 years, said Prof. Gunter Weller, director of the Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.
"There's no doubt over all that the Arctic has warmed pretty substantially, and that it's causing serious problems," Professor Weller said. Among the effects are increased coastal erosion from melting glaciers, which have raised the sea level in the region, and thawing in the permafrost that has wreaked havoc with roads and could eventually damage structures like the 800-mile-long trans-Alaska pipeline.
Elsewhere, continued warming could produce rising sea levels and more frequent and more severe storms. Seas will rise with temperatures because water expands as it warms, and because melting terrestrial ice will send water flowing into oceans. Hurricanes draw their energy from the heat in ocean waters, so warming could make them more frequent and more powerful.
The consequences would be most serious for the East and Gulf Coasts, which are lined with low-lying barrier islands. A rise of one to three feet in the sea level, which many scientists predict by the end of this century, could send sea water 100 feet or more inland on these stretches of coast, in communities where the federal government is spending tens of millions of dollars a year to pump sand onto shrinking beaches.
The new evidence of human-caused warming comes as the Bush administration is turning its attention back to climate change, which it had approached with skepticism and a determination to choose no remedies that might hinder the use of coal, oil and other fossil fuels.
Most notably, last March Mr. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement that would require industrialized countries to cut emissions of greenhouse gases or face penalties. The last details were approved by almost every other major country at a meeting in November, although the treaty still awaits ratification.
In the next month or two, the Commerce Department, answering a request by Mr. Bush last summer, is planning to issue a new research plan aimed at improving United States climate monitoring and modeling efforts.
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, is one of many from both parties in Congress seeking significant new efforts, especially climate research. 
"I have asked that consideration be given in the coming budget to increase activities," Mr. Stevens said, "to zero in on places where they know they can get some firm data and get some firm predictions."
Others in Congress are proposing bills to limit releases of carbon dioxide from power plants, but Mr. Bush rejected such a move last spring.
While officials debate how to deal with the phenomenon, temperatures continue to climb.
Along with whatever warming might be happening because of human activities, federal scientists say, the Pacific is emerging from its most recent cool spell and the warm waters of another El Nino are getting ready to spread.

HEADLINE: OUTDOORS; 
A Scientific Search for Cougars

BYLINE:  By Bob Butz 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. 

 BODY:
Wildlife officials have maintained that cougars have been extinct in Michigan for almost a century, but Dr. Patrick Rusz, without benefit of traps, a tranquilizer gun or a pack of yowling hounds, recently brought back evidence to the contrary.
 Schooled as a habitat biologist, Rusz serves as director of wildlife programs at the Michigan Wildlife Habitat Foundation. The foundation recently released his 64-page study, "The Cougar in Michigan: Sightings and Related Information," which outlined decades' worth of physical evidence, including sightings, plaster casts of tracks and even video footage. Still, it took Rusz, two college assistants and a handful of volunteers equipped with good hiking boots and a couple of boxes of resealable plastic bags to get the scientific proof. 
 The bags Rusz and his team brought home were filled with scat that DNA tests confirmed as coming from a cougar. Rusz located the evidence (along with numerous tracks and the remains of some deer that he suspects cougars killed) in two areas of the Upper Peninsula: along a 33-mile section of Lake Michigan shoreline near Seul Choix Point and in the deep woods north of Baraga, 100 miles away, closer to Lake Superior.
"I believe these cougars are what remains of a population that was never completely wiped out," Rusz said. "They are neither transients from the West or Canada nor released pets, but rather a small breeding population."
Florida is the only state east of the Mississippi known to harbor a breeding population of wild cougars. Elsewhere in the East, and specifically in heavily forested states like Pennsylvania and New York, efforts have yet to yield scientific evidence of cougars. Organizations have so far been relying on sightings and tracks that critics easily shrug off. Given the irrefutable results of fecal genetic analysis, a process refined only in the last decade, others might soon be taking Rusz's lead.
As for Rusz, he is prepared to begin a new search in Michigan's more densely populated Lower Peninsula.
"Until recently, all we had in the Lower Peninsula were tracks and sightings," he said in an interview.
Rusz presented still photos taken from a video given to him by a woman in Mesick, about 20 miles south of Traverse City and about halfway up the Lake Michigan coastline from the Indiana border. The photos are grainy, but the animal in the pictures, with its tawny hide and long tail, is clearly a cougar skulking through the maples in deep snow.
"Some Michigan Department of Natural Resources employees told her this was a house cat," Rusz said. He traveled to the site where the video was shot, and after comparing the photos and taking measurements of specific trees the cougar passed in the footage, determined the cat in the picture was close to 30 inches at the shoulder: clearly no barnyard kitty.
Dale Willey of Tower, roughly an hour's drive northeast of Traverse City, reported a young colt in his pasture killed by a cougar. He said he saw the cougar July 3 and later found signs of how the cat, after killing the 50-pound colt, had cleared a five-foot fence and dragged its prey into some nearby bushes to feed.
In cooperation with Rusz, Willey bulldozed a half-mile-long road along the edge of his property and checked it every other day for tracks. He found some on the 14th day, and Rusz later identified them as a cougar's.
"Reliable sightings have come in from the Fife Lake area in Wexford and Kalkaska County, the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and other spots around Traverse City," Rusz said. The next step is to expand his study to include these areas and find the cougar scat necessary to back up his beliefs.
The big question is when will somebody capture a cougar? For many who dismiss Rusz's work, a genuine cougar is the only thing that will sway them.
"But even those people won't be convinced," Rusz said. 
The latest naysayers contend that any cougars in the Michigan woods are probably released pets. A 1987 law, in accordance with the Endangered Species Act, prohibits private ownership of cougars. A Department of Natural Resources roster shows the names of roughly 20 people owning cougars grandfathered under the 1987 law, but most of these animals are dead and the rest in the waning years of old age. Further, preliminary DNA analysis of the scat samples Rusz found in the Upper Peninsula did not show any of the South American genotypes typically found in cougars kept as pets.
"It's really not hard to imagine cougars surviving up here," Rusz said. "You have to look at what the landscape was like 100 years ago, when killing a cougar was worth a sizable bounty. A century ago, hunters stayed away from areas that would have been hard to rout cougars from for simple economic reasons. In the dense swamps and outlying areas, the output of effort required to kill a cougar was just too much, and here is where cougars were able to hold on."
Rusz also believes that, like Florida's panthers, Michigan's cougars are probably suffering from decades of inbreeding. Although he thinks collaring a cougar is unnecessary, Rusz believes that somebody soon will. "Fecal analysis is cheap and can tell you almost as much as running a cat up a tree," he said. "Since cougars rarely stray from their established home range, unless the cat is a transient male, all collaring a cougar would show is it moving around its territory. With further fecal analysis we can determine the sex of a cougar, even whether or not there are troubles with inbreeding."
If cougars do exist in Michigan, they are protected by the Endangered Species Act and cannot be hunted, trapped or harassed. Capturing a cougar is not part of Rusz's immediate plan, but he is applying for an official scientific collector's permit. Since the results of his study were released, Rusz has secured scat samples in the more densely populated Lower Peninsula and is awaiting test results that could show that cougars are closer than anyone ever imagined.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
A Shy Ramirez Tries to Find His Comfort Zone

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The first priority of the new Boston Red Sox owners should be a campaign. Call it "Make Manny Mine."
 John Henry, the incoming managing partner, could initiate it. Larry Lucchino, who will be the team's president and chief executive officer, could carry it out. Besides giving Manny Ramirez his $15.5 million salary next season, the new boys on the block can listen to their silent star's agent and do whatever is necessary to make him comfortable. 
 "When Manny signed with the Red Sox, we knew there would be an adjustment period," Jeff Moorad, Ramirez's agent, said last week. "The truth is the adjustment is continuing." 
For $160 million over eight years, give or take a few deferred dollars, the Red Sox have reason to expect Ramirez to have completed his adjustment already. But it may not be possible for him to reach that stage of satisfaction until certain steps are taken.
Moorad initially revealed Ramirez's concerns during the winter meetings in Boston earlier this month. He said the outfielder, in his first season with the Red Sox, was forced to assume a role as team spokesman, which he never had to be in his seven seasons in Cleveland. He blamed it on the layout of the team's clubhouse at Fenway Park.
The clubhouse, smaller than the facilities at newer parks, apparently deprived the shy Ramirez of the privacy he craves and enjoyed in Cleveland. When he switched from the Indians to the Red Sox, he left his comfort zone behind.
"Manny performs best in a relaxed environment, and it was anything but that last year," Moorad said in Boston. "It's no secret that the Cleveland Indians allowed him to sneak out the clubhouse door, and often he was the first one out of the clubhouse."
Before consulting the incoming owners, Dan Duquette, the Red Sox general manager, at least for now, said he was looking at some changes in the clubhouse.
Moorad suggested the possibility of separate press areas.
"It was not an easy decision for Manny to leave the Indians last off-season," Moorad said in an interview the other day. "Yet there was a burning desire on his part to take on a new challenge. Needless to say, in that respect, he's been challenged and he'll continue to be challenged. But along the way he is adjusting to his new environment in Boston."
Ramirez could have avoided many of the problems he encountered by remaining with the Indians, whose contract offer sported a higher number -- $171 million -- but a lower present-day value because of the amount of deferred money in the deal. But money isn't everything, as Ramirez has learned. Money minus comfort equals less enjoyment.
Ramirez might have had reasons for leaving Cleveland; he was said, for example, to have been bothered by comments the Indians' owner made questioning his desire to play. But, Ramirez, a New York native, grew up with the Indians and had a comfort zone in the Indians' clubhouse despite the turmoil created by Albert Belle and others.
Some agents, perhaps not many, try for a combination of money and happiness for their clients. They would settle for a smaller contract if they feel the player would be better off in a particular place.
"Ron Shapiro put players where they're comfortable," one executive said, citing Kirby Puckett with Minnesota and Cal Ripken with Baltimore. "They could have got more money elsewhere."
If Ramirez is not comfortable in Boston, he might want to take it up with his agent, not the Red Sox.

A Controversial Agent
Jeff Moorad has become one of the most controversial agents in the business, or more aptly, one of the most disliked. He has been widely accused of stealing players from other agents.
Players often change agents, but Moorad's critics say he uses what associates referred to as gofers to lure players to him. The associates, a baseball official said, receive as much as 30 percent of Moorad's fees from contracts signed by players they deliver to him. One of Moorad's gofers, two other agents said, is Orlando Cepeda Jr., son of the Hall of Famer.
One agent told of another agent confronting Moorad in an elevator at the recent winter meetings in Boston, saying, "You're the guy who's going around trying to steal everyone's clients."
Moorad declined to discuss the accusations. "I don't have anything to say," he said.
Manny Ramirez, Juan Gonzalez and Raul Mondesi are among the players who have left other agents for Moorad. Moorad landed Mondesi, a baseball lawyer related, after his former agent, Tom Reich, negotiated a four-year, $36 million contract with Los Angeles in 1998 but before Mondesi signed it. Moorad, the lawyer said, claimed he was entitled to the fee.
The dispute went to the players association, which certifies and monitors agents, but did not get to a hearing because union officials convinced Moorad that he had no case and Reich was entitled to the fee.
Earlier this year, a club official said, Moorad tried to lure Jason Giambi from Arn Tellem through Giambi's brother, Jeremy. His selling point, the official said, was the contract he got Ramirez with Boston.

New Challenge for Lucchino
Seven men sat in a Boston hotel room as day turned into evening last Thursday, growing increasingly pessimistic with each passing hour. They were waiting to hear if they had succeeded or struck out in their bid to buy the Red Sox.
"When we heard that a statement was coming, we made a dollar bet on what would happen," Larry Lucchino said. "No one in the room bet on us. We hadn't had any communication during the day, and we expected that if something happened, they'd have gotten to us early and given us a warning."
But they all lost their bets because they, the John Henry group, were declared the winners. What's $7 to a group of men who bid $660 million?
The development puts Lucchino in position to become president and chief executive officer of a third major league club and presents him with probably his greatest challenge: beating the Yankees and overseeing the first World Series championship for the Red Sox since 1918. 
"Oh-three," Lucchino said. "There is something special about '03 coming up. They won in '03."
Indeed, the Red Sox, nee the Pilgrims, won the first World Series in 1903, and their second season under the Henry group will mark the 100th anniversary of that season. 
Another challenge will be the future of Fenway Park. Lucchino has become adept at developing new parks, Camden Yards in Baltimore, one in the early stages of construction in San Diego, and now he gets a chance to work on renovating and expanding 90-year-old Fenway.

Trading Options
Fortunately for them they did not have to travel to the cities whose teams acquired them.
The Colorado Rockies obtained infielder Pokey Reese from Cincinnati last Tuesday, then traded him to Boston for catcher Scott Hatteberg last Wednesday. The next day, the Rockies opted not to tender Hatteberg a contract, making him a free agent.
Philadelphia acquired pitcher John Wasdin from Baltimore Dec. 13 and a week later did not tender him a contract, making him a free agent.
Among the 34 players not tendered contracts, the most interesting is Rick Helling, a 20-game winner for Texas in 1998. The Rangers let him go only two weeks after he attended his first union executive board meeting as the American League player representative, succeeding David Cone.

Selig Edits Himself
When the blue-ribbon panel report on baseball economics was released 17 months ago, there were reports that Commissioner Bud Selig had sent back the panel's drafts several times before the four members turned in a draft acceptable to him. Selig denied the reports.
What to think, then, when during his testimony at a House Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this month the commissioner mentioned the report and added "which I put together."
Asked about the statement the other day, Selig corrected himself. "I put together the blue-ribbon committee," he said.

HEADLINE: Discord Delays Choice of Interim Leader for Argentina 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The Argentine Congress was deadlocked tonight as it attempted to ratify a new president who will serve until presidential elections are held. But the eventual leadership change is likely to be the easy part in dealing with the mounting economic crisis.
 Most economists predict that the new interim president will, in the next few weeks, preside over the largest debt default in history and a potentially chaotic devaluation, which could ignite large-scale inflation if not handled smartly. 
 Gov. Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, who was chosen by Justicialist Partyleaders on Friday, was supposed to be ratified easily tonight to serve until presidential elections can be held March 3. But back room negotiations between various parties broke down over the timing and rules for a new election. Distinguished guests arrived at the presidential palace for an inauguration early this evening, only to find out that there still was not a new president. 
Nevertheless Mr. Rodriguez Saa was still considered to be the strong favorite to emerge as the new leader in a vote by a joint session of Congress scheduled for Sunday. The governor, until recently not a major player on the national scene, called this week for "the suspension of payments of the public debt until all Argentines have a job," suggesting that he could rule as a populist, at least in oratory. "I will govern for the most humble and for those who suffer," he said.
But he also indicated that he would like to retain the decade-old policy of pegging the value of the peso to the dollar, even though most economists here and on Wall Street say Argentina will be forced to let the peso float to a level of about one-half its current value. For years, the peg was an effective weapon against inflation. However later it began to have ill consequences, making Argentine goods, reflecting the strong dollar, too costly on world markets.
Before any devaluation, aides to Mr. Rodriguez Saa say, he will print scrip money in the form of low-interest bonds to pay government salaries and inject money into the sagging economy.
Mr. Rodriguez Saa, 54, a lawyer and accomplished bridge player known among his friends for his passion for neatness and punctuality, has kept San Luis Province's finances in order during 18 years as governor, but he has no experience commensurate to running South America's second-largest economy.
He or another leader might be able to pull it off, but it will not be easy, economists say.
Whoever is chosen will almost certainly be a member of the Justicialist Party, which controls Congress, and therefore can expected to have ample legislative support. He will also stand to benefit from the good will of an anxious public because no one can blame him for the crisis.
The Bush administration may try to help the future president in an effort to protect Argentina's democratic institutions, and the International Monetary Fund could be enticed to come up with what would be its 14th emergency bailout package since civilian rulers replaced a military junta in 1983. France has already called on international financial institutions, which turned off the loan spigots to Argentina in recent weeks, to reopen talks with Buenos Aires. And Italy, another source of investment here, restored lines of credit to Argentina on Friday.
Because the future president may govern for as little as three months, he will probably be able to do many things without worrying about disenchanting the electorate.
Most Justicialist leaders, who were in the opposition until Fernando de la Rua resigned the presidency on Thursday, have said the country must halt payments on the $132 billion public sector debt and free itself from the currency bind. "We have to tell the people the truth," said Gov. Nestor Kirchner of Santa Cruz Province, an influential Justicialist. "The country is broke and cannot meet its debt obligations. Our mission now is to reinstall confidence by governing with popular support."
The deepening economic crisis that forced Mr. de la Rua to resign has much to do with a slowing world economy and declining agricultural export prices, which no Argentine government can control. Restive labor unions and groups of unemployed workers have staged numerous strikes and highway blockades, slowing the economy even more.
During the last three months, industrial production, consumer sales and tax receipts have declined by more than 15 percent from a year earlier. Economists project that the economy, which is expected to shrink by 3.5 percent this year, will decline by a further 7 percent or more in the first half of 2002.
Many economists predict that the future president, to keep the government afloat, will be forced to seize dollar-denominated bank accounts and to give less valuable pesos back to the depositors after a devaluation. Should the devaluation be as sharp as some Wall Street analysts have predicted, per capita income, which has fallen by 14 percent in the last four years, could plunge by another 20 percent or 30 percent. 
If releasing the Argentine peso from its dollar anchor were a magic bullet that could solve all of the country's woes, the previous government would have done it. But a devaluation has many risks. Eighty percent of the country's loans are in dollars, meaning that people and businesses whose peso earnings will decrease in value will find it harder to meet their dollar interest obligations.
Many Justicialist economists have proposed to devalue the loans as well, by turning the dollar debts into pesos by mandate. That would help many borrowers, but it would hurt the banks, which are already in trouble, making lending more difficult. 
There could be other economically important losers. Medium-size and large Argentine businesses that depend on bond sales abroad would not benefit from a loan devaluation, because foreign lenders would probably be unwilling to go along with such a scheme. But the goods they sold would still be priced in pesos -- much devalued pesos.
Business bankruptcies, which have risen sharply in recent months, would be likely to increase further, throwing more people out of work.
A devaluation might also set off another wave of hyperinflation, a familiar Argentine woe before the peso was pegged to the dollar in 1991.
The new government could decide to drop the peso altogether for the dollar, but such a shift, without a devaluation, would not help solve Argentina's lack of competitiveness on world markets. And a third possibility is a devaluation followed by "dollarization" as a brake on a currency free fall.
All the options promise to produce months of confusion and years of legal battles between lenders and borrowers. This week, the Wall Street analysts that Argentina must win over in order to regain flows of foreign capital were decidedly pessimistic about the future.
"I expect a disorderly default process," David Malpass, a senior analyst at Bear, Stearns, said on Friday.
"The resignation of President de la Rua and the imposition of a bank holiday," a Credit Suisse First Boston report said, "signal a period of intense political turmoil and escalating civil unrest, a deeper economic collapse, imminent default and indefinite debt moratorium and the likely total loss of control of the currency."

HEADLINE: Downtown Is Slower to Embrace Optimism; 
Uneasiness and Worries Persist for Many Residents and Workers

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
The subterranean fires have subsided and the breeze no longer carries a sickly odor, but in the shadowed canyons of Wall Street and the lazy side streets of TriBeCa, the veneer of normalcy is not what it seems.
 There is a stubborn malaise afflicting Chinatown's sidewalk vendors, worried about lackluster sales, and the black-jacketed barkers of Little Italy, frantically trying to fill empty restaurants. In Battery Park City, it is the unnerving sight of yet another moving van or the silence of once-teeming playgrounds. It is visible in the jittery knot of office workers smoking outside 40 Broad Street, flinching when a crate loudly crashes off the back of a truck. It can be felt in the desperate solicitations of a downtown day care center, forced to lay off half its teachers, begging the public for donations. 
 With holiday crowds mobbing Times Square and Rockefeller Center, it sometimes feels as if the rest of the city has moved on in its quest for closure. For many New Yorkers, the scar tissue has already begun to form. But here on streets that abruptly end at ground zero, a place still piled high with debris and human remains, the laughter is more subdued, the atmosphere almost funereal. 
To be sure, three months after it was blanketed with smoke and choking ash, Lower Manhattan has largely returned to its former harried self. Gone are the National Guardsmen who stood sentinel at the avenues below Canal Street, checking ID's. Most businesses in the area formerly known as the frozen zone have reopened. Some of SoHo's most stylish restaurants, once eerily empty, are happily turning away diners on Saturday nights. 
"The pessimism has lifted and there's a joyousness in the air," said Ashley Massie, 32, a Stuyvesant High School teacher and Battery Park City resident who almost moved away. "For the first time in months, we feel like we can live again."
But for every optimist, there are a dozen pessimists still fitful and sad, uncertain whether their beloved neighborhoods will fully recover. Take Ray Wong, for example, an inveterate downtowner who has been beseeching his neighbors to stay put.
Born and raised near the South Street Seaport, Mr. Wong, 29, has always lived in the shadow of the World Trade Center, a comforting beacon whose birth and maturation mirrored his own. One of Mr. Wong's earliest memories, he said, was the sight of a helicopter affixing the giant antenna atop the north tower to ensure high-quality television transmission. As a child, he and his friends played tag in the trade center's underground shopping concourse. His first kiss was savored in the windswept plaza that anchored the two towers.
"I loved, loved, loved downtown," he said last week, pausing on the Hudson River esplanade as he walked his two dachshunds, a pair of yellow-tinted sunglasses shielding his eyes. "I never wanted to live anywhere else."
Yet with shame and sorrow, Mr. Wong admits he might be joining the exodus from Battery Park City. His melancholy can be measured by the score of friends who have already left, and by the growing piles of takeout menus that litter the doorsteps of departed neighbors. At night, his heart sinks when he looks out on the darkened windows around him.
"I'm a little messed up still," he said, as a truck dumped its scorched payload into a waiting barge. "My favorite restaurants on Vesey Street are gone. My building is half empty. The energy is gone. The community I loved is gone."
For outsiders, such changes are nearly invisible, at least beyond the carnage of ground zero. Water trucks that spray down the soot-covered streets every hour or so are just a curiosity. To them, the onslaught of "50 percent off" banners are not a sign of economic distress, but an opportunity to shop. In the financial district, where a tourist from Kansas City might see packed sidewalks and giddy Christmas cheer, Naeem Sheikh, the owner of a nut and fragrance store on Nassau Street, sees something more ominous. It is 5 p.m. and the pavement surges with office workers, but Mr. Sheikh sits alone in his empty shop and wrings his hands.
"Look at them rushing to go home," he said. "People feel scared. They don't want to spend money here. I used to employ three people. Now I have nothing to do." 
The vulnerability felt by many Americans is not an abstraction downtown, where workers and residents still choke up when describing their wounded psyches. The unease intensifies closer to ground zero, especially for those who lived through the smoke and blackness and terror of that morning. To them, Midtown feels like a soothing refuge. 
Oz Rosario, 25, a sales representative for a telecommunications company, visits clients all over the city but feels his gut tighten when he returns to his office on Broad Street. "It's especially eerie in the morning, when you come to work and the streets are so quiet," he said, a few paces from the New York Stock Exchange, with its maze of metal barricades. "Uptown, people are more relaxed. Here, everyone has a much shorter fuse." 
For Robert Brown, who serves lattes to customers on Wall Street, the fear has become oppressive. "I don't want to work down here anymore," he said from behind the counter at Timothy's Coffee. "You never know what's going to happen." 
Everyone is yearning for a more humdrum past. Some are wistful for the cacophonous gridlock of Wall Street, now off limits to cars, while others wish tourists would stop photographing the scenes of destruction. The endless detours, the police on every other corner and the inability to have lunch delivered are all irksome reminders of life out of whack.
Sometimes gruff and unyielding traffic officers make Krista Bojanowski cry as she tries to navigate the street closings on her drive home. "I know it's for my own safety, but they change the blockades every day," said Ms. Bojanowski, 27, a nanny who lives on Exchange Place. "I just want my old life back."
Still, most people express optimism, even if their voices are edged with apprehension. "Life goes on," they say with a shrug. "Time heals all wounds."
For some, especially residents, anger and frustration have largely replaced the fear of future attacks. Many worry about the air they have been breathing, a concern raucously driven home last Tuesday in City Hall Park, where dozens rallied to demand answers from a government they view as uncaring.
Maria Marra, 37, a commercial real estate broker, said she looked at two dozen apartments before deciding to remain in her home on Chambers Street. Her love for the neighborhood -- and a 30 percent rent reduction from her landlord, she said -- helped change her mind. "I'm glad I stayed," she said. "But I worry about the air, and worry that I might regret that decision 10 years from now."
Still, the stalwarts insist that downtown will recover. They shield their eyes from the disturbing nighttime glow of ground zero or look away when the trucks, laden with twisted girders, rumble up West Street. Some even try to relish the newfound tranquillity on streets drained of traffic.
"Ironically, with fewer people and cars, the neighborhood feels like it used to and our quality of life is better than it has been in years," said Robert Lyons, 42, a theater director who lives on Wooster Street.
For Ms. Massie, the teacher, it means free on-street parking. "It's awesome because I save the $250 a month I used to spend on a garage," she said. 
While most downtown businesses are still ailing, the somber ground zero pilgrimage has produced a windfall, especially for those hawking 9/11 memorabilia. Cindy Taylor, whose bakery on Chambers Street used to be nearly empty on weekends, is thankful for the tourists and recovery workers who have offset the loss of displaced workers.
"I'm almost embarrassed to say, but my business has doubled," she said before racing back to the kitchen. 
Then there is the surge in kindness and camaraderie that persists. Former strangers are on a first-name basis, and "How are you?" is still offered with earnestness.
"You see people at the dry cleaner and you feel a sense of relief that they're still here," said Suzanne Tinley, a 14-year resident of Greenwich Street, as she walked home with her two children. "A lot of people who came here because it was trendy TriBeCa have left. More than ever, those of us who stayed feel like this is our home and that we're in it together." 
Those who work in Lower Manhattan's skyscrapers have little choice but to stay. At 2 World Financial Center, where almost everyone lost a friend or business associate, the brokers and analysts try not to glance out the windows facing east. When the Merrill Lynch workers come down for their cigarette breaks, they hover beneath the building's sheltered entrance, their backs to the expanse of rubble behind them.
Sharon Doucette, a senior project manager, does one better: she walks around the corner and stands alone on the western side of the building, braving an icy wind off the river.
"I'm trying to avoid looking at it," she said, using her head to gesture to the unseen. "I'm trying to move on, trying to adapt."
Just then a band of tourists, their faces blank, passed by and Ms. Doucette seemed to absorb their gravity, at least for a moment. "We'll all get through this," Ms. Doucette said, stamping her feet against the damp chill. "I know we will."

CONGRESSIONAL ROUNDUP

BYLINE:  By Adam Clymer

 Congress went home playing the blame game over who killed the economic stimulus package, but first it passed a rewrite of aid to education to put more money into schools in poor areas and test annually to see results. It also agreed to more base-closings, raised military pay by at least 5 percent, and added $8.3 billion to homeland defense and $8.2 billion for New York reconstruction aid -- more than President Bush sought. 
It agreed that Sept. 11 victims should not pay income taxes for 2001 or 2000. But partisan wrangling blocked action on a farm bill and help for insurers. House Republicans killed an effort to get health-plan coverage for mental illness on a par with physical ailments. Adam Clymer

KILLINGS RISING

BYLINE:  By Fox Butterfield

 BODY:
 In what may be a leading indicator that crime is starting to increase again, after a nearly decade-long decline, homicides in many big cities have increased sharply. 
The rise was led by Boston and Phoenix, which both have had a greater than 60 percent jump in homicides so far this year. Not all cities are up -- in New York, homicides have fallen 5.2 percent. But police chiefs worry that several factors may be pushing violent crime up: rising unemployment, a growing number of inmates being released from the nation's expanded prison system, and a new surge in domestic killings.

MORE HOMELESS

BYLINE:  By Pam Belluck

 A United States Conference of Mayors survey of 27 cities showed homelessness had increased an average of 13 percent from last year. The likeliest causes: recession, still-high housing prices and Sept. 11, which increased layoffs and diverted charitable donations that usually support shelters and other homeless organizations.

Headlines From the Cutting Room Floor

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

 BODY:
THE world did not stop on Sept. 11; it only seemed that way. Many people, riveted by the extraordinary, paid little attention to anything else. 
 Life went on, of course. Argentina is in trouble, the Yankees lost the World Series, the Democrats and Republicans are fighting about everything but terrorism, and V. S. Naipaul won the Nobel Prize. Muggles in droves went to the Harry Potter movie. 
 What follows is a selection, arbitrary and incomplete, of some of the events of the past 100 days that were overlooked or that might have played out differently had the world's gaze not been fixed on terrorism.

The Higher Cost of Drugs
From George W. Bush to Edward M. Kennedy, there was widespread agreement in the 2000 campaign that the nation's elderly badly needed some assistance to cope with the soaring costs of prescription drugs. Nobody thought it would be easy to enact that benefit, but 2001 was considered the most auspicious year.
That changed in September, when terrorism and a slowing economy transformed the agenda in Washington and created some grim new budgetary realities. Creating a substantial prescription drug benefit for a group that uses more drugs than any other is an expensive proposition. As the surplus slipped away, lawmakers quickly realized that prescription drug benefits -- like so much else on the domestic agenda -- were too.
Health advocates had also hoped to provide new assistance for the nation's uninsured, who numbered just under 40 million last year. That effort also failed, even as experts warned that the recession would leave many more Americans without insurance. 
Now, many experts are warning of a health care crisis, a "perfect storm," as one study put it, fueled by soaring increases in health care costs and a wave of layoffs. Governors, meanwhile, are warning that the basic safety net program for low-income people -- Medicaid -- is under immense pressure as well, and have pleaded for help from the federal government.

HEADLINE: Imagine; 
Raiding the Lockbox

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
Remember the Social Security lockbox? 
 It was not long ago that both parties in Washington swore on all that is holy not to touch the portion of the federal budget surplus generated by the retirement system. To do so would invite certain political death. 
 Now, with the nation mired in a full-scale recession, the first in a decade, and President Bush having gotten his $1.35 trillion tax cut, the surplus has turned into an almost-certain deficit for the next few years. The lockbox has been broken open. 
The goal of paying off the national debt now seems unrealistic. Both parties will have to shelve their more ambitious and expensive proposals, like overhauling Social Security. In addition, Democrats will have to decide whether to stick to their Clinton-era position that fiscal responsibility brings benefits in the form of lower long-term interest rates, and Republicans will have to decide whether they are willing to accept chronic budget deficits as the price of higher defense spending and continued tax cuts.

 THE HEALING WOUND
Experiences and Reflections
on Germany, 1938-2001.
By Gitta Sereny.
Illustrated. 386 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
 Gitta Sereny, a writer perhaps best known for her extraordinary 1995 biography of Albert Speer, has spent most of her 78 years attempting to understand human evil. As we learn from this collection of essays, some of them autobiographical, this preoccupation came to her naturally enough.
Of Hungarian-German parentage and raised as a Protestant, Sereny was a precocious 15-year-old in Vienna when Hitler annexed Austria in 1938. Her mother traveled in Jewish circles, and young Gitta, whose father had died when she was 2, saw the unfolding terror firsthand. Unlike so many Austrians, she tells us, she did not jeer at the Jews on their hands and knees forced to scrub the pavement with toothbrushes; on one such occasion, she even impetuously risked her life to intervene. Not long after that harrowing episode, with her mother under threat for her engagement to a Jew -- the economist Ludwig von Mises -- the two fled to Switzerland. 
Placed in a finishing school, Sereny soon ran away and made her way to Paris. She was all of 17 when, with the fall of France, she found herself living under Nazi occupation, working as a volunteer nurse with orphaned children and hiding an occasional British airman for the Resistance. Tipped off to her imminent arrest, she crossed the Pyrenees on foot, and then the Atlantic by boat to the United States. Only near the war's end did she return to Europe as a child-welfare officer for the United Nations, working with the shattered children freshly liberated from Nazi imprisonment at Dachau. 
Wrenching as this assignment was, the next was more so. The Nazis had spent the war years scouring occupied Eastern Europe for "racially valuable children" for their Lebensborn program, whose purpose was to augment the German genetic stock. These they simply kidnapped by the hundreds of thousands, appraising them according to 62 pseudoscientific criteria, murdering many of the "deficient" ones in extermination camps and placing those deemed Aryan in the hands of unwitting German families seeking to adopt. One of Sereny's duties was to track down these "adoptees" and return them, where possible, to their natural parents. 
The actual task of separation, Sereny writes in "The Healing Wound," was "never anything but traumatic. I only had to do it once, and I will never forget the inconsolable grief of the couple who loved the 5-year-old I had to take away, and the uncomprehending wild anger of the child himself, who had no memory of his birth parents or native language and for whom the German parents were his world."
Exposed to so much misery, stunned by the magnitude of Nazi iniquity, Sereny set out in 1947 to try to account for all the horror. Over the next decades, as a journalist based in England, she came to write essays and books that would bring her even deeper into the interior of Nazi evil. This book includes selections from these works: mostly biographical sketches, thoroughly researched and supplemented by interviews, of Nazis and their collaborators, ranging from Leni Riefenstahl, Hitler's favorite filmmaker, to John Demjanjuk, the concentration camp guard who settled in Cleveland. 
In her snapshot of Riefenstahl, one sees Sereny in a typical mode. She converses politely with the aging filmmaker, drawing her out about her childhood, her sexual escapades, her artistry, while never losing sight of her as a target. Then, at a natural moment in the conversation, Sereny quietly springs her trap, confronting Riefenstahl with documents that demonstrate something she has always denied: her own immersion in, and promotion of, murderous anti-Semitic hatred. The result is only more denial -- but the exchange is dramatic all the same. "When she is honest," Sereny concludes in this dialogue interspersed with her own commentary, Riefenstahl "is very likable" -- but about the things that count, Sereny also shows, she has never been honest. 
Another figure whom Sereny sought out, more directly culpable than Riefenstahl, was Franz Stangl, who in 1970 was sentenced to life in prison by a German court for his role as commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka, where he had personally overseen the murder of over a million Jews. To Sereny, he appeared to be the one perpetrator who possessed "a semblance of moral awareness," and who therefore might be able to reveal something about the "inner lives" of those who carried out the Nazi enormity.
Sereny's exchange with Stangl, excerpted from her 1974 book, "Into That Darkness," is transfixing. Step by step, she leads him to recount the web of circumstances that brought him to his gruesome assignment, and elicits from him comments about his work. Initially, he confides to her, it was arduous -- the smell of "the hundreds, no, the thousands of bodies everywhere, putrefying, decomposing," was "indescribable" -- but presently it settled into routine. Processing a morning's round, a transport of perhaps 5,000 Jews -- unloading them, stripping, searching and shaving them, herding them down what the SS mockingly called the "Road to Heaven" and into the gas chambers, then burning their corpses on massive iron racks -- was "normally dealt with in two or three hours. At 12," Stangl informed Sereny, "I had lunch and after that about half an hour's rest. Then another round and more work in the office." 
Unblinkingly conversing with mass murderers, Sereny writes about Nazism with urgency and grace and fidelity to historical fact, and she is clearly a woman of some courage. Yet despite these commendable qualities, her mind is not consistently a match for the moral immensity of her subject.
After decades spent probing for some "new truth" about the men who slaughtered millions, Sereny is strikingly unable to convey what she has learned. Offering some thinly considered platitudes about the ills of "racism," she speaks about the Nazi gas chambers in the same breath as "the disproportionate number of blacks on death row in America" and "the apparent unwillingness of the rich white West to supply poor black Africa" with medication for AIDS. This conjunction of incommensurables echoes the self-exculpatory refrain emitted by the various accused and convicted war criminals themselves, including Stangl. 
The former United Nations secretary general Kurt Waldheim also appears in "The Healing Wound." Pressed by Sereny in an interview about his role as a Wehrmacht intelligence officer in the Balkans and Greece, he explains helpfully that it was a "savage war," like "Vietnam, and now the West Bank," where the Israelis "are breaking people's bones." Ineffectively challenging such remarks, Sereny goes on to judge Waldheim a "fundamentally decent man." 
Worse, Sereny does not merely confine herself to hearing out witnesses but sometimes appears to have set herself the task of engaging in a personal mission of salvation. In her dealings with Stangl, she speaks, largely on the basis of his contorted facial expressions, of his "intense desire to seek and tell the truth," and she permits his "despair" and "hopeless grief" to evoke in her "an instant of sympathy." Passages in "Into That Darkness" that are not reprinted here tell of how she brought a "special soup" to his prison cell that made him feel "wonderful"; by confessing to her, she wrote, he was able, at least for "a fleeting moment," to become "the man he should have been." 
Such passages bring to mind something that Adolf Eichmann once said in a moment of boastfulness: "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million Jews on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction." Sereny seems constitutionally incapable of assimilating a sentiment like that, let alone of grasping, after a lifetime of studying it, the radical nature of Nazi evil. Her chapter on Stangl, entitled "Colloquy With a Conscience," records a vain attempt to help one of history's worst criminals to cease "blocking" his own "acknowledgment of personal guilt," and thereby realize himself as a more complete human being. At such times, she enters into complicity with Stangl's own well-developed powers of self-pity and evasiveness, becoming in effect an agent of redemption for the irredeemable. 
How came such a manifestly astute and well-intentioned woman to compromise herself in this way? She herself provides a hint. Visiting Rome after her talks with Stangl, still tormented by the encounter, she spoke with "a kind bishop" at the Vatican. "If one exposes oneself to the devil," the bishop warned her, "he can invade one. Be careful, my child," he said.

HEADLINE: A Surge in Controversy for Power Proposal 

BYLINE:  By GARY SANTANIELLO 

 BODY:
FAIRFIELD COUNTY may be the engine of Connecticut's economic growth, but a few cities and towns in this critical corridor are challenging Connecticut Light and Power Company's current proposal to provide it with more power.
 C. L. and P., a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, wants to upgrade transmission capacity in the state's most populous county by adding a 345,000-kilovolt (kV) line from Bethel south to Norwalk along the existing 20-mile right of way. 
 The upgrade, which runs through Redding, Weston and Wilton, would require much taller transmission poles and a wider right of way. That change, opponents say, would affect the appearance of the largely rural area and possibly have a negative affect on the adjacent natural environment, such as the waterways, vegetation and wildlife.
Its overall impact, said State Rep. Toni Boucher, a Republican of Wilton, is outside of expanding Route 7, "the most controversial local issue we've had in a while. This is not about not wanting additional capacity. It's about how to do it without damaging the environment. 
"This is a bad proposal for many reasons," she added. "There has to be another way."
Citing an October 2001 report from I.S.O.-New England, a not-for-profit corporation that manages the bulk generation and transmission of electricity in New England, C. L. and P. said that transmission bottlenecks cost New England consumers $125 million to $600 million annually, and congestion is most acute in southwestern Connecticut. It maintains that a new 345-kV line will provide Fairfield County reliable access to lower-priced energy from throughout the New England power grid well into the future.
Opponents contend the company is overstating power needs, minimizing the proposal's impact on the environment, property values, historic districts and health, and ignoring less intrusive options.
"A lot of the information in C. L. and P.'s application is incomplete," said Monte Frank, a lawyer hired by Redding, Wilton and Weston to represent those towns' interests before the Connecticut Siting Council, which has jurisdiction on such issues. The only point on which there is some agreement is a need for increased transmission capacity in Fairfield County, which accounts for 26 percent of the state's population and roughly one-third of its retail sales. Further, according to the company's application, "its residents consume relatively more power, on average and at peak times, than those elsewhere in the state."
"We know energy demand in Fairfield County is growing, whether it's 1.25 percent, 2 percent or 3 percent," said Joe Dolan, a Redding resident and president of Communities for Responsible Energy, an umbrella organization comprising representatives from four of the towns challenging C. L. and P.'s plan. "The question is, to what extent is new capacity needed, and what are the alternate solutions?"
C. L. and P.'s preferred option is combining an existing 115-kV line and the 345-kV line on new steel monopoles, thereby minimizing the need for a wider right of way. The monopoles would average 130 feet in height, however, depending upon topography, and require right of ways averaging 125 feet.
Current transmission structures average 70 feet in height and require a right of way of 80 feet.
As required by law, the company's application presented alternatives: replacing the current 115-kV overhead line with the 345-kV line and burying a 115-kV line under current roadways; and an underground 345-kV line along public streets, primarily heavily-traveled Route 7. The former would sacrifice a wider right of way for shorter poles, and C. L. and P. claims the technology is unproven for a 22-mile underground route.
"The population is growing, and the need for power is growing even faster than that," said Frank Poirot, a company spokesman. C. L. P. estimates annual demand for power will grow by 1.5 percent, "but we're also required to plan for increases in peak usage," he added. Over the past two years, peaks have increased 15 percent, Mr. Poirot said, and two daily usage records were set last summer.
Even the State Department of Environmental Protection agrees that in terms of electricity transmission, Fairfield County is considered "a highly congested area," thus highlighting the needing for greater access to power generated throughout New England. 
"We ran into this precise problem in August, when we had 400 megawatts of power in Maine and no way of getting it to that part of Connecticut," Mr. Poirot said. "As a result, we were incredibly close to rolling blackouts."
And Representative Boucher, perhaps more than anyone else, knows what that means. "If the power is out," she said, "I get calls."
Critics of the company's proposal denounce the 345-kV line as "overkill" and insist a second 115-kV line, either on existing transmission poles or underground along Route 7, is a more appropriate option for meeting current and future energy demand.
Citing a report commissioned from Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., "one additional 115-kV line is sufficient to meet needs through 2017," said Monte Frank, the lawyer representing three towns.
The first selectmen of Bethel, Redding, Wilton and Weston began discussing the ramifications of C. L. and P.'s proposal soon after it was announced in July, and resistance has gathered ever since. Studies were ordered, public meetings were held, groups were mobilized, lawyers were hired. Approximately 100 Wilton residents attended a meeting called by First Selectman Paul Hannah on Dec. 11 at Cider Mill School to alert residents to C. L. and P.'s plans and galvanize opposition before the siting council.
The siting council, an appointed board of nine members, is charged by the Legislature with reconciling statewide need for such services with their impact on the environment. When it formally accepted C. L. and P.'s application on Nov. 29, the council set dates early next year for public hearings in the five affected towns, as well as for field inspections for the overhead and underground routes. The council has a year to make a decision on the application, during which it will gather information from various state agencies as well as individuals and municipalities. It can require Connecticut Light and Power to make design changes it deems appropriate, after which the company would formalize its design plan and seek construction rights and permits. C. L. and P's goal is having the new line operational by the end of 2003.
Opponents also are concerned about C. L. and P.'s plans for related projects, which have yet to be formally presented. They include a 65-mile, 345-kV line from Middletown into south Wilton, creating a transmission loop in southwestern Connecticut and allowing greater access to energy, and running new and replacement transmission cables beneath Long Island Sound from Norwalk to Hempstead Harbor and Northport on Long Island.
"C. L. and P. tried to make it sound like the three phases are going to be great for Connecticut," said Tom Schrum of Wilton, another member of Communities for Responsible Energy. "They just want to sell energy to Long Island."
Mr. Schrum is also the president of the Arrowhead Community Association, which is a group of homeowners on a 10-house cul-de-sac in south Wilton. Their homes are in the immediate vicinity of the power lines.
"It's a very difficult situation for this area to swallow, because of the deep-seated suspicion toward C. L. and P.," said Representative Boucher. "Their proposal is just so large and impactful."
For now, though, the opposition's focus remains fixed on the 345-kV from Bethel to Norwalk.
"This is not over," Representative Boucher told those attending the meeting at Cider Mill School. "People need to show up and provide testimony to the siting council. That will be significant for them to see."
Mr. Dolan added: "The solution may be a 115-kV line underground. We'll see. If we can keep the pressure on, we can accomplish our objectives. We're looking for the least invasive solution to meet the need that is there."

HEADLINE: Pushing to Speed Up East Side Rail Link 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
THE Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center has prompted the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to speed up work on the East Side Access Project, which would provide Long Island Rail Road riders another route into Manhattan.
 The project was initially scheduled for completion in 2010, but an M.T.A. spokesman said the agency now hoped to finish it by 2008 or 2009. 
 "The incident of Sept. 11 shows the importance of East Side Access to a greater degree," said Kenneth J. Bauer, the railroad's president. "If something happened at the East River tunnel, you wouldn't be able to run trains to Penn Station. The Long Island Rail Road gets 75 percent of the Nassau residents who go to New York City; 25 percent use cars. Can you imagine what it would be like if 100 percent had to use the roads to go to New York?" 
The vulnerability of the transit system was highlighted by an M.T.A. report released just after the terrorist attacks. "It was clearly the flexibility and capacity of the subway system in Lower Manhattan that helped the M.T.A. through this ordeal," the report said. "That makes more critical than ever the two important system capacity expansion projects," East Side Access and the Second Avenue subway projects.
To advance the $4.3 billion East Side Access Project, the M.T.A. is to receive a portion of the $54 billion Governor Pataki requested from the federal government after Sept. 11, an M.T.A. spokesman said. He did not know how much money that might be.
Already $323 million in contracts have been awarded for the design of the project, program management and engineering work. And earlier this year, the Long Island Rail Road and the New York & Atlantic Railway exchanged storage yards in a move needed to make East Side Access a reality.
The L.I.R.R. received two yards in Long Island City. During off-peak hours, they will store trains used for East Side Access during peak hours. The yards are near what will be the entrance to the rail tunnel that will run under city streets to the existing 63rd Street tunnel from Queens to Manhattan. The upper level of that tunnel is already being used for subway trains, and under plans for East Side Access, the lower level will be used for L.I.R.R. trains heading to Central Central Terminal over new tracks. 
At Grand Central, plans call for a new L.I.R.R. terminal below the Metro-North terminal. The L.I.R.R. terminal is to include a new ticketing and waiting area, passenger concourse, four island platforms serving eight tracks, passageways connecting to Metro-North and the subways, and new entrances and exits. 
Dean Skelos, Republican of Rockville Centre, the deputy majority leader of the State Senate, stressed the importance of East Side Access not only for safety but economic reasons. "It is critically important for the economic stability and growth of the region for it to go forward," he said. "I believe there will continue to be an increase in ridership and that a quick ride into the city is important for companies staying in New York City and the region."
Mitchell Pally, a vice president of the Long Island Association, the region's chamber of commerce, said that his group would welcome an earlier completion of the East Side Access Project "because the more options Long Islanders have with regard to where they are going to live and work, the better." The same would be true for city residents who want to work on the Island.
Senator Skelos said he came away from a recent meeting with members of the state's Congressional delegation with the belief that "there is an opportunity for additional funding for our rail tunnels and for those in Maryland and Washington." 
Mr. Bauer, the L.I.R.R.'s president, said that the East Side Access Project would increase the Long Island Rail Road's operating capacity by 45 percent, which he called critical because Pennsylvania Station was now at capacity.
An M.T.A. study projects that by 2010 that there will be 120,000 commuters using the Long Island Rail Road to get to Manhattan during the morning rush and that 70,000 of them will opt to use Grand Central Terminal. The L.I.R.R. currently carries 90,000 daily commuters to Penn Station.
Through November, ridership for the year was up 1.1 percent over last year, which recorded the most riders since 1949.
State Senator Caesar Trunzo, Republican of Brentwood, said he viewed the East Side Access and Second Avenue subway projects as a priority, along with safety improvements needed in the East River rail tunnels, which are owned by Amtrak.
"If a train gets stuck in there, there could be another disaster," he said. Improvement that are needed are more emergency exits and a new ventilation system to pump in fresh air and remove smoke, he said. 
Although the East Side Access Project is only for passenger trains, a tunnel for freight trains is also proposed. Mr. Pally of the Long Island Association said that Congress recently appropriated $5 million for an environmental impact statement for what is being called the Cross Harbor Freight Rail Tunnel, which would link Long Island to Manhattan or New Jersey.
"It would be very beneficial for freight operations," he said. "We are supportive of increasing rail access to Long Island" because it would mean fewer trucks on the road.
Bruce A. Lieberman, the chairman of the New York & Atlantic Railway, said that in the four years since his company bought the L.I.R.R.'s freight operations, business had increased 25 to 30 percent. That translates to 12,000 to 13,000 cars of freight a year, up from 9,500 cars. 
"This is a business that had 25,000 carloads in the 80's and 75,000 carloads in the 70's," he said, explaining that as the aerospace industry declined on Long Island, so did the need for freight service. Final figures for 2001 are not yet available, but Mr. Lieberman said that the slowing economy and the Sept. 11 attacks had had a negative effect on freight shipments.

HEADLINE: Chills in the Balance-Sheet Shadows 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
PAY no attention to those liabilities behind the curtain.
 That is the message corporate America has sent to investors in recent years as executives have shunted billions of dollars in new and existing financial obligations off their books and into the nether world known as "off the balance sheet." 
 When the stock market roared, investors were only too happy to believe that what they didn't know about their company's true financial picture couldn't hurt them. But now, in a crestfallen market reverberating with shock waves from Enron's collapse, shareholders are realizing that just because an obligation is absent from a company's balance sheet does not mean that it can't come back to bite them. 
What occurred at the Enron Corporation, at considerable distance from the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet, may of course prove an anomaly. The company, now in bankruptcy but once the world's dominant energy trader, was an aggressive user of partnerships separated from the parent but for which the parent's shareholders remained on the hook. Perhaps worse, it also committed the ultimate sin of omission -- it failed to disclose the extent of its contingent liabilities related to those partnerships. Under federal securities laws, those details should probably have been listed in at least the footnotes to the company's financial statements. 
In itself, off-balance-sheet financing is no vice. Companies can use it in perfectly legitimate ways that carry little risk to shareholders. The trouble is, while more companies are relying on off-balance-sheet methods to finance their operations, investors are usually unaware that a company with a clean balance sheet may be loaded with debt -- until it is too late.
"One intent of these structures is to try to move debt off the radar screen so that companies appear less financially leveraged than they actually are," said Scott Sprinzen, co-chairman of the corporate bond rating criteria committee at Standard & Poor's. "We try to reflect these off-balance-sheet obligations in our assessments. But if someone was just to take the financial statements at face value and not delve very deeply into these arrangements, then the statements could be misunderstood."
During the last decade, thousands of companies in many industries have used off-balance-sheet financing to power their expansions. Their obligations range from the mundane -- payments on leased aircraft or on real estate that is owned by third parties or liabilities associated with operations in which a company has a minority interest -- to the more arcane, including complex derivatives transactions. 
The most aggressive users of off-balance-sheet financing are, not surprisingly, financial services businesses like banks and brokerage firms. But retailers, airline companies, automakers and even gambling concerns use these financing techniques.
Each publishes their liabilities -- or not -- pretty much as they see fit.
WITH the boom phase of the economic cycle over, it is especially crucial for shareholders to have a complete grasp of a company's leverage. Banks and other lenders are no longer in the mood to offer companies easy money; some have reduced their appetite for lending or have chosen not to roll over existing debt. Unseen obligations at companies can destroy shareholders' wealth faster than the weather changes in Maine. Descents like Enron's are not called "death spirals" for nothing: it took less than a week after a credit rating downgrade for the company to file for bankruptcy protection.
These days, then, the aggressive use of off-balance-sheet financing is especially dangerous, said Sean J. Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings, a Wynnewood, Pa., credit rating firm that, unlike Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the biggest agencies, is not compensated by the issuers whose debt it assesses.
"Companies are in much worse shape now than they were maybe three years ago -- their balance sheets, their income statements," he said. "There are some egregious examples of companies like Enron that are rapidly growing and attempting to shield their growth in leverage from the market. With the increased volatility in the market, they are getting into difficulty."
One straw in this increasingly turbulent wind can be found at the major ratings agencies: the number of downgrades they assign to corporate bonds, compared with upgrades. Based on data through Dec. 17, Moody's Investors Service has downgraded 616 bond issues this year, well above the 2000 count of 472. This year, for every upgrade, 2.88 bonds have been downgraded -- versus 2.26 last year. 
The current number is the highest since 1991, the last recession, when it reached 2.93 (though it is well below the 4.39 in 1990).
Because disclosure is so spotty, it is hard to determine exactly how much debt resides off the balance sheet at American companies -- and at which companies. But many bond market experts agree that the explosive growth in this method of financing has occurred over the last 20 years and is a result of Wall Street ingenuity as well as changes in the way Americans finance their buying.
Decades ago, for example, airlines typically owned their planes, but today most lease them through arrangements with leasing companies, often off the balance sheet. While these arrangements allow airline companies to borrow less, they also mean that airlines have fewer assets to sell if they need to raise money.
Consumers have also contributed to the growth in off-balance-sheet financing. Many more Americans use credit cards today than they did just two decades ago. But banks and other credit companies do not want to carry those borrowings on their books. Instead, they have found ways to bundle small loans and to "securitize" them, selling them to subsidiaries, unrelated companies or institutional investors.
Carol Levenson, the editor of Gimme Credit, an investment advisory newsletter in Chicago that focuses on high-grade bonds, said the nature of these financing techniques had changed recently.
"There has been off-balance-sheet project financing and even acquisition financing for years," she explained, but it usually left the parent company unexposed. "It seems to me what's changed in recent years is the contingent obligation of the parent."
Indeed, in the old days, certainly before the last recession, if an obligation was moved off a company's balance sheet it was usually because the company had no liability whatsoever for the debt. 
BUT in today's loosey-goosey world of financial statements, off-balance-sheet obligations include those that keep a company exposed to some liability. Today's definition of off-balance-sheet financing has been stretched in much the same way the definition of earnings has -- with individual companies deciding what expenses they will count, or not, in "pro forma" earnings.
"For debt to be considered truly off balance sheet, there would have to be full and complete risk transference," said Pamela Stumpp, chief credit officer at Moody's Investor Service. "If there is any hook to the parent or if the parent is liable for any aspect of the operation, then it might not be a true off-balance-sheet liability."
Yet, as the Enron case showed, liabilities can remain on companies' books.
Investors, meanwhile, have been kept in the dark, Ms. Stumpp said, because many companies have not disclosed the details of the liabilities. For example, management at Calpine, a seller and trader of energy, has not disclosed in filings the existence of a $300 million letter of credit facility arranged with Credit Suisse First Boston in late August. The letter of credit was revealed by a Moody's analyst who downgraded the company's debt to junk status on Dec. 14.
A Calpine spokesman said that because the $300 million was not drawn, it did not constitute indebtedness. The company's securities counsel has stated that it was not required to be reflected in Calpine's periodic reports.
But that is emblematic of what Ms. Stumpp criticizes. "Financial officers are increasingly making judgment calls as to what to include about these things in the financials," she said. "Certain off-balance-sheet obligations are not included in disclosure. There is a need for better disclosure to clarify these structures because clearly there is risk that needs to be assessed in connection with them." 
After a debacle like Enron's, regulators may begin to examine disclosure lapses. Analysts and investors, meanwhile, are scrambling to understand where the fault lines are; Enron, whose shares trade for 53 cents, demonstrated how risky off-balance-sheet deals can be for shareholders.
Understanding that risk is not easy. Off-balance-sheet financings, even when disclosed, are highly arcane and can vary considerably, even at the same company.
Assessing the risk of something even as plain vanilla as financing of auto loans is problematic for investors. Ford Motor, for example, carries only $12 billion in debt on its balance sheet, 14 percent of its assets. But in the third quarter, Ford Motor Credit held $40 billion in operating leases. They are backed by the cars that Ford has leased, but in a distressed situation, it is not clear that those assets would have enough value to pay off the loans.
Essentially, companies assess their risk themselves, and Walter P. Schuetze, former chief accountant to the Securities and Exchange Commission and chief accountant of its enforcement division, expressed fears that companies are not pricing their retained risks properly. "Consequently, we are getting overstated gains and understated losses when the paper is sold and periodically thereafter we are getting understated liabilities," said Mr. Schuetze, who is retired but remains a consultant to the commission. 
Why does the mispricing occur? The wrong people are in charge of assessing the risks, Mr. Schuetze said. "The reporting enterprise or company is setting those numbers, and auditors look at them and say, 'That's about right,' " he said. "The enterprise should not be making that determination, and the auditor doesn't have the expertise to make that determination. It should be made by someone outside the reporting enterprise who is a competent expert." Then, Mr. Schuetze said, the expert's opinion should be included in company filings with the S.E.C. 
As off-balance-sheet financing techniques have grown in popularity -- and imagination -- several areas appear especially perilous, according to corporate bond experts. The use of special-purpose vehicles, like those at Enron that housed the partnerships and benefited certain insiders -- but for which the shareholders were ultimately liable -- is particularly troublesome as a result of Enron's failure.
Glenn E. Reynolds, chief executive of Credit Sights, an independent credit analysis firm in New York, said special-purpose vehicles were common at brokerage firms. In most of them, Mr. Reynolds said, the assets are unidentified and the risks unfathomable. 
IN a typical setup, a brokerage firm creates an unregulated subsidiary specifically to hold a high-risk asset -- such as debt issued by an emerging-market country like Argentina. The firm then makes a loan backed by the asset to a special-purpose vehicle that is off the brokerage firm's balance sheet. Because the subsidiary is unregulated, it may not have to record changes in the asset's value, known as marking to market. But if the asset defaulted, it would have to be marked to market and could cause repayment on the loan made to the special-purpose vehicle. 
The problem with these transactions, Mr. Reynolds said, is "you just don't see transparently the risk portfolio."
"If it blows up," he said, "then it sees the light of day. Until then, the fact there's a bomb down there is not so obvious to the outside investor."
Other lending arrangements that are used to minimize debt can also become a problem for a company, especially if it loses the confidence of investors. At any company with a trading business -- Enron was one, but other merchant energy companies include the Williams Companies, Calpine and Dynegy -- the brokerage firms or banks financing their trades may ask for additional collateral if they start to lose confidence in the companies' abilities to raise money in the capital markets. Such a reeling in of credit would not be seen by outsiders, but it could cause a squeeze if the company had little cash on hand, or access to it. That is why Enron drew down all of its credit lines, $3.3 billion, as soon as trouble loomed.
"A big difference today from 1991 is how extremely powerful global financial institutions have generated huge credit lines with these companies," Mr. Reynolds said. These credit lines, which can be generous in good times, can be withdrawn in a matter of hours if a problem surfaces, he pointed out.
Other off-balance-sheet arrangements back complex transactions designed to insure institutional investors' holdings. Known as credit derivatives, they had a notional value of $360 billion in the third quarter of 2001 and are a fast-growing segment of the overall derivatives market, rising 60 percent annually since late 1997, according to David Hendler, financial company strategist at Credit Sights. "The top seven banks control 97 percent of all the derivative trades in the United States," he said. The exposure of J. P. Morgan Chase, he added, stands at more than three times the bank's tangible equity.
Yet the risks associated with derivatives trades have never been tested in a sour economy; their consequences are unknown.
ANY company, not just a bank, can have obscured risks. One involves corporate bonds held in the issuing company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Known as ESOP notes, they often carry features that require the company to pay back the bonds if its credit rating falls below investment grade. 
Armstrong World Industries, a subsidiary of Armstrong Holdings, a maker of floor coverings and cabinets, filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago. The company had $142 million outstanding in ESOP bonds at the time. When Armstrong's credit rating fell to below investment grade, the company had to repay the bonds.
But Mr. Reynolds said these stipulations seldom showed up anywhere in filings, even in the footnotes to the financial statements. "Armstrong's was not even included in its detail debt footnote on ESOP notes at year-end," he said. "These details typically do not get disclosed unless the crisis is upon you."
Almost everyone agrees that companies must disclose more details about their off-balance-sheet transactions and entities -- and soon. The absence of disclosure, according to Mr. Reynolds, "reflects the abuse of substance in accounting today."
"There is no reason for these things not to be disclosed," he said. "It's just withholding material information. That can lead to shocks, and where there are shocks in the market, it leads to decline in confidence."
Ms. Levenson, the bond analyst, agreed. "I truly believe if Enron had kept all this stuff on the balance sheet and worked it into its maturity schedule just like any other debt, even if it meant carrying a $3 billion higher debt load," she said, "it may not have been a strong triple-B credit but it might still be a going concern today."

HEADLINE: THE CITIES; 
A Governor In Search Of a Policy For Old Cities

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
IN his successful run for governor, James G. McGreevey piled up impressive majorities in most of the state's urban areas. He was such a regular fixture it seemed -- even when not campaigning at black churches in poor urban communities -- that aides joked he was his own advance man. They marveled how at times he even recalled birthdays and anniversaries.
 But as Jim McGreevey the campaigner morphed into Jim McGreevey the governor-elect this month, the looming budget deficit -- estimated at $1.9 billion -- seemed to have taken his memory away and in the process doused the hopes of many in Camden and Newark. 
 In the lame-duck legislative session there are two measures pending that -- for the price of some concessions to the Republicans and suburban interests -- may begin to pull Camden out of its long swoon and add momentum to Newark's effort at revitalization. 
But Mr. McGreevey, invoking the budget problems, called a $180 million rescue package to try to bring Camden back on its feet too costly. And in the case of Newark, he endorsed the notion of building a $355 million arena for the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils -- supporting the idea of using a portion of sales taxes from the district -- as well as private borrowing but not involving any direct state subsidies.
Yet he concluded that the price of closing the deal -- set by exiting Republican leaders in the form of millions in direct state aid for projects in South Jersey and Bergen -- was too high a cost, and he refused to bargain.
Like prom dates all dressed up with nowhere to go, State Senator Wayne Bryant of Camden, who sponsored that city's rescue bill, and Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, who had sought a compromise to allow the arena bill to pass the Assembly, were left with only the promise that a McGreevey administration would take a fresh look at these issues after inauguration on Jan. 15.
Then, in the new light of changed political balances in the Legislature, Mr. McGreevey said he would present his own urban assistance programs.
But this begged the question of just what a McGreevey urban policy would look like. In a recent interview, the governor-elect's approach sounded much like the established programs that relied heavily on tax abatements and incentives to private businesses and developers to encourage them to return to the cities. He evoked such staunchly Republican programs as those enacted by Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, the Keystone Opportunities Zones, and John Engler's Rennaissance Zones in Michigan, which rely heavily on private investment as the key to success.
"I am strongly and unequivocally committed to redevelopment of our urban centers," said Mr. McGreevey. "But, respectfully, with my $1.9 billion budget shortfall, I have stated to both Senator Bryant and Sharpe James that there is a need to stave off any discretionary spending due to that shortfall."
Mr. McGreevey said that on its own merits, the proposal for a new sports arena in Newark was perhaps the most sound. The idea was to create a state entity that would receive a portion of the sales tax revenue generated in a sports and entertainment district surrounding the proposed downtown arena. The proceeds would help pay off $190 million in borrowed money that the owner of the two teams, the YankeeNets, would get from the sale of bonds.
The team owners would contribute $115 million of their own money to the project, and city and county governments would provide the remaining $50 million in the form of infrastructure improvements to roads, public transportation facilities and other publicly used areas.
"But attached to this program were certain Christmas tree items," said Mr. McGreevey, referring to a range of programs including a sports facility at Rowan University, a rowing center in Camden, a Disney World-like family entertainment complex in the Meadowlands and a Nascar track in South Jersey. "My only concern is these unrelated expenditures."
Camden was more problematic, requiring a bit more in direct state spending to finance nearly $150 million in state borrowing that would go directly to a newly created Camden Economic Recovery Board. The money would be used for grants and loans for street improvements, neighborhood rehabilitation, demolition of abandoned structures, home purchases by low-income residents, improvements to the sewer and water system and bolstering publicly supported hospitals and colleges that could in turn support a resurging commercial sector.
Still, Mr. McGreevey praised the bill's provisions for improved management of the city's affairs and accountability through the recovery board's supervision of local elected officials. But while it was long on accountability, he said, it was short of attracting private capital.
"Long-range growth of the city depends on that, and even though we are heading into an economic downturn we can create incentives to businesses to locate in the region," he said. "And with the Keystone Opportunities program that Tom Ridge started in Pennsylvania and the Renaissance Opportunity Zones in Michigan, you have programs that produce sustained private investment."
That would come as a surprise to those evaluating the two-year-old program in Pennsylvania who say that they have not yet determined how effective -- much less how sustained -- the private investment has been.
Under the Pennsylvania program, 12 regions of the state can each designate up to 5,000 acres of land on which they will abate more than a dozen municipal, school, county and state taxes ranging from the property, sales and income taxes to a variety of corporate and franchise taxes. The extensive abatements are intended to attract businesses and jobs to sites in rural and blighted urban areas alike that that would otherwise be left vacant. They would last for 12 years, and then the owners would begin paying state and local taxes.
Matthew Goodburn, an analyst with the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, a nonprofit research organization hired by Pennsylvania to evaluate the three-year-old program, said: "The program is doing well, but we are still doing in-depth analysis. One thing we are seeing is different interpretations of how to use the program with some areas designating really hard-to-develop properties that require a lot of infrastructure investment and others choosing the more site-ready properties such as old industrial parks."
Mr. Goodburn said some thought that by waiving the tax incentives, businesses would come running. But "it has not been that easy," he said.
Bruce Katz, director of the Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, said that in the last two decades such programs of tax incentives for private investment had become "the conventional wisdom" of urban policy, though he said that while perhaps necessary, they were not sufficient in themselves to arrest urban distress in cities like Camden.
There are several government subsidies that need to be dammed and redirected, he said, including greater subsidies for mass transit, de-emphasizing state spending on suburban schools and putting more emphasis on their urban counterparts, and steering more spending toward the infrastructures of the older areas rather than the newer exurban ones.
"I support empowerment zones, but they don't address the larger flows of public subsidy," he said. "We treat tax credits like the holy grail, but people tend to move where there are functioning schools, a good real estate market and safety."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
A Finger in the Wind Suggests It's Already 2002

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WHAT if the stock market rally for 2002 has already happened? What if the bond selloff that normally comes with an economic recovery has come in the last seven weeks of 2001?
 That "what if?" is not hard to swallow. The Dow Jones industrial average has climbed 22 percent from its low on Sept. 21, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 19 percent. The Nasdaq composite has jumped an even more spectacular 37 percent. Those are impressive returns by any standard. 
 As for the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has shot up as high as 5.19 percent, above where it was at the end of 2000 and not all that far from the peak of 5.5 percent that some forecasters are predicting for 2002. The yield was 5.08 percent on Friday.
But why would next year's stock rally and bond selloff come early? Maybe investors have become so intent on being ahead of the curve that they have jumped on the bandwagon before it even starts moving. Many analysts contend that investors in both stocks and bonds are already assuming that a recovery is under way -- and that it will be strong.
If the best news for stocks and the worst for bonds has already been factored into the markets, there may be much less scope for what can happen next year. If a recovery comes later and is weaker than expected, then the disappointment could undermine stocks, while interest rates could hold steady or even decline somewhat until the recovery is further along.
Such an outcome is not inconsistent with some forecasts: Richard Bernstein, the new chief United States equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, says stocks will be flat next year. Nor is it inconsistent with optimistic-sounding economic data like the report last week that housing starts surged 8.2 percent in November. That surge, in fact, could help explain why a recovery may not be as swift as many investors have hoped.
Housing starts jumped to an annual rate of 1.645 million in November. Unusually good weather, however, caused some of that increase and could also give housing starts another lift in December. More important, the gains mean that housing starts have not suffered in this recession and have no trough to surge from -- so they cannot fuel an economic recovery as they have in the past.
In the 1990-91 recession, housing starts plunged 48.5 percent in 12 months, to an annual rate of 798,000 in January 1991, then climbed by 51.6 percent over the next two years. In this recession, which officially began in March, housing starts have actually risen, supported by unexpectedly strong consumer demand, low interest rates and subdued inflation, according to Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
Housing starts are 1.4 percent above where they were in March, 5.5 percent above their level a year ago and just 1.3 percent below their high for this year. At the November level, the annual rate of starts would have to climb only 11 percent to reach a 15-year high.
WITHOUT a sharp decline to rally from, and with mortgage rates rising with Treasury interest rates, "it doesn't make much sense to talk of a housing-led recovery," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company. The average weekly rate on 30-year mortgages nationally is now 7.17 percent, according to Freddie Mac, up from 6.45 percent in early November.
Bernie Schaeffer, chairman of Schaeffer's Investment Research, sees another problem for stocks. By one of his favorite technical measures of performance, the market is still in a bear phase, and he questions the persistence of any market rebound until stocks move through this bear barrier.
His measure is the 40-month moving average of the S.& P. 500, which is now 1,293.59. The index closed at 1,144.89 on Friday. That means it would take an 8 percent rally to surpass the moving average, and that may be difficult if the economic recovery disappoints.

HEADLINE: Russia's Last Line 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Because of Moscow's exploding middle class, you quickly notice two things driving around this increasingly European city -- sushi bars are opening all over (yes, from borscht to Big Macs to California-Kremlin rolls in one decade!) and so many people have cars now that traffic is permanently snarled (imagine Jakarta with snow and ice and you've got today's Moscow). So sitting in gridlock the other day in Pushkin Square, I had plenty of time to ask my Russian friend Viktor a cosmic question: Is your life easier or harder now than it was under Communism?
 "Both," he remarked. "It's easier because I don't have to hunt for food every day and wait in lines for everything. Stores are full now. No lines. But it all costs a lot of money. The saying here now is that there is only one line left in Russia -- the line for money." 
 So Karl Marx's theories have finally triumphed in today's Russia: it's all about money. That's the key to understanding President Vladimir Putin, too. He's not a tougher Mikhail Gorbachev, or a more sober Boris Yeltsin. He is Russia's first Deng Xiaoping -- Mao's pragmatic successor who first told the Chinese that "to get rich is glorious" and put in place the modernizing reforms to do it.
Abba Eban once said that men and nations will always do the right thing in the end -- after they exhaust every other possibility. That is Mr. Putin's basic message to Russians: "For a decade, we've tried every bad idea, from default to devaluation to shock therapy. Now there's only one idea left: passing real reform legislation so we can get real investment to build a real modern economy. Because in this world, without a real economic foundation, you're nothing. So we're going to focus now on the only line that matters -- the line for money." This is Putinism: From Das Kapital to DOScapital.
And it explained to me why Mr. Putin rolled over so meekly on President Bush's decision to walk away from the ABM treaty, limiting missile defenses. In 1972, when that treaty was forged, Russian foreign policy was about one thing -- geopolitics, the ideologically driven global competition for influence with the U.S., and everything, particularly economics, was subordinated to that. Hence all the food lines. Today, Russian foreign policy is about two things -- geopolitics and geoeconomics -- and there is a real competition between the two. So if Russia can save money and win Western help by walking away from the ABM treaty, then walk it will.
Don't be fooled, though. Russia's military and foreign policy elite considered Mr. Bush's ABM move "a slap in the face," said the Russian pollster Igor Bunin. If the U.S. doesn't come through now with what Mr. Putin believes he's been promised -- a new accord for deep cuts in nuclear weapons, a real Russia-NATO partnership, plus debt relief, W.T.O. membership and Western investment, Mr. Putin will be seen as another Gorbachev -- always giving and never receiving. "Then elites could start to form a front against him," added Mr. Bunin. But for now, Mr. Putin is ignoring the whispers because in his view Russia will never again be a player in geopolitics unless it first masters geoeconomics.
What's new in today's Moscow is that there are young capitalists coming of age, and they believe they can get rich the Chinese way, by making things, not the old Russian way, by taking things from the state or from the ground. And without anyone noticing, in 2001 Russia's Parliament quietly passed a lot of the judicial and tax reform legislation that America was beating on it to pass for a decade.
I had lunch the other day in a combination art gallery-restaurant, Ulitsa OGI, which is part of a successful new chain started by Dmitry Jekovich and his partner. "The difference between us and the oligarchs is that we're oriented on creating something new, not just privatizing something that existed before," he explained.
The confidence of Russia's new generation that it can actually do this "capitalist thing" has enormous geopolitical significance. One reason that Russia was so zealous about keeping so many nukes, and reflexively opposing the U.S., was because these were the only currency that defined it as a superpower. If Russians believe they can be powerful on the basis of geoeconomics, they aren't going to surrender all their nukes or quest for influence, but the chances of their being real partners with the West will be much, much greater.
So keep rootin' for Putin -- and hope that he makes it to the front of Russia's last line.

HEADLINE: FRONT LINES 

BYLINE:  By ANDREA KANNAPELL

 BODY:
MILITARY CAMPAIGN -- There was a price for the reliance on Afghan opposition forces on the ground, and the United States has begun paying it. Afghan commanders considered the war over when they captured the mountainous territory of Tora Bora, while American and allied forces prepared to send a large force to search its caves themselves for Al Qaeda leaders, especially Osama bin Laden. Many fighters have already escaped into Pakistan. Phase 2 in the war on terror, Page 3.
 There are continuing hints that Afghan commanders sometimes cut their own deals. Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's chief, may be being sheltered. The group's other top leaders appear to have survived the campaign: the highest ranking casualty was reportedly a deputy foreign minister. In Kunduz, an Al Qaeda supporter suspected of being an adviser to Central Asia's largest terrorist group, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, slipped from Northern Alliance custody. 

PEACE -- Who will pay for the peace is another question. The World Bank says the first five years of rebuilding schools, roads and communications networks, underwriting the new government and taking on the myriad other projects associated with reviving Afghanistan could be $10 billion or more. International expectations were that the United States would pay a third, with Europe paying another third and the rest of the world, led by Japan, picking up the rest. But the Bush administration says it may have already done its financial duty, having spent about $1 billion a month on the war.
Still, peace appears to be marching on. The United Nations approved a peacekeeping force to be led by Britain. The International Security Assistance Force's first troops, British marines, began arriving in time to install the interim power-sharing government headed by the Pashtun leader Hamid Karzai and three Northern Alliance figures.

MINES -- Peace has lured farming families back to northern Afghanistan, but their soil holds hidden danger: land mines laid during 22 years of war. Some 400 Afghan demolition specialists from Halo Trust, a British nonprofit that has been working in the country since 1988, have begun clearing the mines, as well as removing discarded munitions from retreating Taliban fighters.

MONEY TRAILS -- Investigators trying to tease apart Al Qaeda's finances have new material. A Saudi captured in Afghanistan was identified as an official with the Wafa Humanitarian Organization, a Saudi-based Islamic charitable organization suspected of funneling money to the terrorist network. And in Kosovo, NATO troops raided the offices of Global Relief Foundation, which, like a second American charity, Benevolence International Foundation, is suspected of aiding Al Qaeda. The Treasury Department and the F.B.I. raided both groups' domestic offices. The Bush administration also froze the assets of a Pakistani group blamed for the recent attack on India's parliament. The group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, seeks independence for the Muslim-dominated Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and has links to Al Qaeda.

MORE EMBASSY BOMBING SUSPECTS -- A British court allowed the extradition of three men to stand trial in the United States on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden to bomb American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The three, a London-based Saudi businessman, Khalid al-Fawwaz, 37, and two Egyptians, Ibrahim Eidarous, 39, and Adel Abdul Bary, 42, had fought the case for three years. Last May, after a four-month trial in Manhattan, four men were convicted in the case -- and sentenced just days after the Sept. 11 attacks.

IRAQ -- The United States has been hearing some support from Arab nations for a move against Iraq, which has for three years barred United Nations inspectors seeking to make sure Iraq is not making banned weapons. There is no new credibility to early suspicions that Iraq was involved in the attacks (Unclear links, Page 3); rather, the support grew out of the rapid success of the military action in Afghanistan. Europe remains opposed to a move on Iraq, but Middle Eastern diplomats say Turkey would allow the United States to use its bases -- a critical piece of regional support.
The Iraqi National Congress, the exile opposition group that has repeatedly sought American support for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, produced a defector, Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri, with an eye-opening report. He said that he was a civil engineer and that he had worked on renovating facilities for biological, chemical and nuclear weapons in wells, private villas and even under the Saddam Hussein Hospital in Baghdad. 

ISRAEL -- The region seemed to take a half step back in its otherwise inexorable march toward open war. After his televised appeal to Palestinians to halt further attacks on Israel, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, closed more offices of the radical militant group Hamas. Both Hamas and another radical group said they would suspend suicide attacks against Israel -- but with such promises, only time will tell. The Israeli security forces, despite their government's declaration that Mr. Arafat was irrelevant, met with Palestinian counterparts to discuss the West Bank and perhaps loosening their iron grip so that Palestinian forces could maneuver again.

BIODEFENSE -- President Bush decided that the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, which has a seat on the Homeland Security Council, should be able to classify information as secret. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave 200 public health workers classes on how to recognize and contain a terrorist attack involving smallpox. And federal health officials began offering the anthrax vaccine to workers on Capitol Hill and to some postal employees.

GOOD OLD AMERICAN COMPENSATION -- The federal victims' fund may pay as much as $1.6 million to the families of each of those killed Sept. 11, according to its overseer, Kenneth R. Feinberg. But some say the funds' rules are too restrictive to allow payments anywhere near that. ANDREA KANNAPELL

HEADLINE: Blair and Putin Agree to Begin Exchange of Intelligence Data 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair ended two days of talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promising new intelligence exchanges and saying relations between Moscow and the West were the closest they had been in decades.
 Mr. Blair praised Russia for its cooperation with the antiterror coalition since the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 and said that other nations backed Mr. Putin's efforts to extend trust to Moscow. 
 "What I have found extraordinary and encouraging is the way not just Russia but NATO partners have embraced the idea of this new relationship in a way which would have been unthinkable a few years ago," Mr. Blair said. 
Mr. Putin said that "Russia is ready for such a relationship." He said he planned to meet in May with NATO leaders to set up a timetable for establishing the mechanics of such cooperation. 
This weekend's meeting was the fifth this year between the Russian president and Mr. Blair, who was the first Western leader to go to Russia, in March, 2000, when Mr. Putin emerged as the country's likely new leader. Last month, Mr. Blair began the push to give Russia increased access to Western organizations, sending a letter to Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general, and all leaders of the 19-nation alliance suggesting a special auxiliary council on nonmilitary matters of mutual interest that would include Russia. 
"This is a relationship that I value hugely," Mr. Blair said Friday night with Mr. Putin standing by his side as the two men took a break from their talks at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence in Buckinghamshire. 
Mr. Blair said he endorsed Russia's interest in becoming a member of the World Trade Organization and wanted it to happen "as swiftly as possible." He said economic reforms in Russia appeared to be working. The Russians are planning a forum in London in April as a showcase for their emerging economy and, in particular, their energy business. 
On Friday, Mr. Putin met with oil company executives, Lord Browne of BP and Philip Watts of Royal Dutch/ Shell, to discuss investment opportunities. Some Western leaders have speculated that oil from Russia could be the answer for countries wanting to reduce dependence on the volatile nations of the Middle East. 
Mr. Blair drew a parallel between the bombings of buildings in Moscow that killed nearly 300 people two years ago and the terror attacks on the United States, saying that both were examples of the kind of terrorism the world was now united in fighting. The comment bolstered Mr. Putin's assertion, still disputed in some Western capitals, that his government's war in Chechnya is part of the same struggle as the campaign against Al Qaeda. 
Mr. Blair also praised Mr. Putin for his reasoned reaction to President Bush's announcement last week that the United States was withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a move resisted by Moscow. The Russian president said, "We are not going to overdramatize the situation and we hope that the dialogue with all our partners including the United States will continue." 
Asked about extending the anti-terror war to Iraq, a move that Russia is firmly against, Mr. Blair said there was a clear need to deal with weapons of mass destruction but also an imperative to move forward only "within the deliberation and consultation of key allies."

HEADLINE: U.S. Providing $8.2 Million To Rebuild TV Antennas 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The federal government is providing millions of dollars to help restore television service to hundreds of thousands of viewers in the New York City region who lost it as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center.
 Tucked into the $8.2 billion emergency aid package that Congress approved last week for New York was an $8.2 million appropriation specifically earmarked to help rebuild the main antennas that stood atop the trade center's north tower. 
 The money was sought by local television executives who have been predicting that their stations would suffer significant losses in advertising revenue unless they found a way to restore their ability to reach every possible viewer in the region. 
The money is not expected to cover the entire cost of building a new broadcast tower, estimated at $30 million to $40 million.
But today, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York noted that any money that Washington provided at this point was welcome, particularly since the broadcast industry was already bracing for advertising revenue losses before the terrorist attacks.
"Television and communications are key industries in New York," said Mr. Schumer, who lobbied to set aside money for broadcasters. "To leave them with a significant hole in their broadcast network is bad for the New York economy."
Because the main antennas atop the north tower came down, virtually all local New York stations lost a significant part of their audiences, from 10 percent to 35 percent. The biggest loss has been experienced by WNET, Channel 13, because it has the smallest percentage of viewers who subscribe to cable television.
The destruction of the antennas left hundreds of thousands of viewers -- those who do not subscribe to cable -- access to only two television stations, Channels 2 and 41, which have backup antennas on the Empire State Building. 
Roughly 20 percent of the 7.3 million homes in the New York metropolitan television market are not hooked up for cable or satellite service. Many homes have only some of their sets wired for cable and depend on the broadcast signal for other sets.
The situation had financial impact for broadcasters. According to an estimate by the BIA Financial Network, a firm that tracks advertising spending on local television stations, advertising revenue for the New York market will fall by about 16 percent for this year, twice the drop the firm was predicting before Sept. 11.
For now, local stations are using space on the Empire State Building tower or one in Alpine, N.J., that enables viewers in some areas to receive some stations. But the Alpine tower is far too small to broadcast clear pictures throughout the metropolitan region, and the Empire State Building has too little space and electrical power to accommodate the demands of all the stations.
The long-term situation may lie in the construction of an enormous stand-alone broadcast tower, perhaps as tall as 2,000 feet, preferably somewhere near the twin towers site. But that solution has its own complications, chief among them the $30 million to $40 million cost, which would be divided among the stations.
The location will be critical, since the new antennas could interfere with television signals in cities like Philadelphia and Boston, and cannot be within established flight patterns for local airports. The 10 local stations have formed a coalition to address the problems, and it was this group that lobbied for the money that Congress approved last week.

Rebuilding A's Lineup Is in Baseball's Interest

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
WHILE Yankees fans argue the merits of Derek Jeter leading off and Jason Giambi hitting cleanup or third in the best lineup cable revenue can buy, the poor rabid A's rooter waits for a measly run-producing bat to be deposited under the Christmas tree.
 David Justice, unwrapped and unappreciated, apparently does not count. 
 "We need another hitter," my friend Billy reported from his couch in front of his newly installed cable box in Napa, Calif. "One more hitter, and I'm not conceding anything to anyone." 
Fair enough, I said in our most recent conversation, our first since breakfast in Berkeley the morning of what would become the Derek Jeter Game. Billy was buoyant over his French toast and as we strolled the university campus, stopping to worship at the building in which he earned his master's in math. His Oakland A's led the division series, 2-0, and had a nasty southpaw, Barry Zito, lined up for the kill.
"If Jeremy Giambi had slid," Billy said, not completing the thought because it's already part of baseball lore, and as ancient a topic as Grover Cleveland Alexander. Little G didn't slide and Big G couldn't beat the Yankees and opted to join them, taking the strapped A's owners off the hook for the $91 million they offered while thinking, "Just say no." Now the question is what, if anything, this unique playoff-competitive and modestly budgeted team can do about it.
Billy is not to be confused with Billy Beane, the crafty A's general manager, who again has the assignment of trying to do more with less, or Billy Ball, for that matter, the stylistic appellation applied to the early 1980's A's of Billy Martin. This Billy, the best man at my wedding nearly 16 years ago, forsook his deep Yankee roots when he moved west and has followed the A's through a quarter-century of dramatic qualitative swings and what seems like a half-dozen Rickey Henderson eras.
But we digress from the challenge before General Manager Beane, to appropriate some of the money not spent on Giambi and Johnny Damon, and fortify one of the two or three American League teams that may even be allowed into the same conversation as the Yankees in 2002.
I know George Steinbrenner is proud to have finished first in the Giambi Stakes' field of one, and Yankee fans are thrilled to have Giambi's offensive assets. It would nonetheless be a crying shame if the A's fell backward after assembling such a talented young pitching staff that, with Jason Giambi, has twice taken the Yankees to their only decisive A.L. playoff games during their five World Series seasons under Joe Torre. This was a real rivalry brewing, more than the wishful romance of the New England summer.
There must be some Yankee fans not relishing the thought of watching them flex in the mirror through mid-October, all the way to another World Series.
"Obviously it's the Yankees and everyone else in terms of them just going out and getting the players they want," Billy said. "So maybe we should just pack up, disband and volunteer to go into a dispersal draft." 
California cynicism, with a dose of economic realism, but also flavored with that saucy A's optimism. 
As Beane told me last summer, the A's losing players for financial reasons goes all the way back to Philadelphia, through Kansas City. History's lineup of significant Yankees imported from the A's begins with Roger Maris and runs through Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Ken Holtzman, Henderson, Scott Brosius and now Giambi. The A's are nonetheless second in the A.L. to the Yankees in World Series appearances with 14. "In Oakland," Beane says, "the glass is always half full."
My Billy's sentiments exactly. "We have young players, Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, just reaching stardom," he said. "Terrence Long, Jermaine Dye, maybe Justice can hit 25 home runs. Billy Koch as the closer -- better, hopefully, than Isringhausen. Except for the Yankees, we'll have the best starting pitching, and Clemens is going to be another year older. Winning, you know, is a matter of subtle chemistry, and the Yankees are going to have a lot of new players."
As long as his team has pitching, it has hope, so Billy is one A's fan of presumably many asking for just one big bat for Christmas. Tino Martinez would have been perfect, but he went to St. Louis last week. There was a Bay Area buzz about Barry Bonds's switching teams, but that didn't happen. Juan Gonzalez and Mo Vaughn, both on the bottomless wish list of the New York baseball culture, would be better off helping other teams that might help make the summer more interesting, less inevitable. That's the view from somewhere west of the Hudson.
General Manager Beane is telling Bay Area reporters that he has a couple of moves to make. His fans are waiting. All baseball fans still wanting to believe in competition more than coronation should be rooting for these A's to not give in, to refortify their lineup. The long-term alternative for too many major league baseball teams is to pack up, disband and volunteer to go into a dispersal draft.
