Operating Profit Rises At American Express

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its earnings from continuing operations increased 19 percent in the second quarter, to $359 million, pushed up by strong results in its credit card and investment businesses, the two areas in which the slimmed-down company is now concentrating.
Still, its total net income declined 14 percent, to $357 million, from $416 million in the second quarter of last year. Last year's results included $109 million from its Shearson and Lehman Brothers investment banking subsidiaries. The company spun off Lehman to its shareholders on May 31 and sold Shearson to Travelers Inc. last July. 
 Over all, American Express earned 69 cents a share, exactly what analysts had expected.
"The news is there is not much news," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "The earnings volatility that the company used to have because of Lehman and Shearson is gone, and this certainly was the right quarter not to have Lehman Brothers."
Lehman, like most brokerage firms, has been hurt by the volatile markets.
Separately, the company said it would change the name of IDS Financial Services, its mutual fund and insurance sales unit, to American Express Financial Advisors as of Jan. 1. As American Express divests itself of its other brokerage units, it is moving to tie IDS closer to its credit card business.
American Express announced its earnings yesterday afternoon after the stock market closed. Earlier, its shares finished at $26.25, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company said its credit card and travel agency unit, known as Travel Related Services, reported a profit of $263 million for the second quarter, up 13 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. The company said the increase was mainly a result of growth in business travel and increased spending on American Express cards.
Customers charged $34.6 billion worth of goods and services with American Express cards in the quarter, up 12 percent. But since the company has been reducing the percentage fees it charges merchants that accept its cards, those fees only rose 9 percent, to $983 million. And the income the company receives from annual fees for cards declined slightly to $431 million.
The number of Green and Gold American Express accounts in the United States declined to 11.3 million in the quarter from 11.8 million a year ago, but corporate cards and cards in international markets increased.
The American Express Bank earned $19 million, down from $21 million a year ago, mainly as a result of lower income resulting from rising interest rates.
IDS, based in Minneapolis, earned $109 million in the quarter, up 21 percent from last year. While many brokerage firms have posted sharp declines in earnings this year, IDS's business is more stable.
"IDS is not a transaction-driven business." Mr. Moszkowski said. "It is an insurance company and a money management unit that earns fees from assets." IDS said that sales of mutual funds and investments increased from last year, while sales of insurance declined.
American Express has been planning to change the IDS name for several years and has tested its own name on IDS offices in several cities. The company said that the switch had increased sales.
IDS, which is 100 years old, was bought by American Express 10 years ago and was briefly known as IDS/American Express before reverting to the IDS Financial Services name in 1985.

Bond Prices Edge Up In Day of Slack Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds drifted higher in very thin trading yesterday as traders and investors braced for a fresh batch of intermediate Government notes.
The price of the the 30-year bond increased 12/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 7.52 percent, from 7.56 percent late Friday. Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to 1/32 higher, while intermediate maturities ranged from 3/32 to 8/32 higher, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
 Most market participants refrained from major moves ahead of the Treasury's auction of $17.25 billion in two-year notes today and $11 billion in five-year notes tomorrow.
 
Still on the Weekend?
 "It was one of those days in which you felt like one-third of the market participants were on a long weekend," said Russell Abbott, a government securities trader at CS First Boston.
Some of the gain in the prices of the 30-year bond was attributed to expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon move to raise short-term interest rates.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, warned Congress last week that the Fed might need to raise rates for the fifth time this year to curb hidden inflation pressures.
Mr. Greenspan's comments last Wednesday killed the bond market's biggest rally in three months.
But since his testimony, some investors have sold short-term securities and bought long-term maturities in the hope that another rate increase would stabilize the bond market.
 
Effects of Higher Rates
 Higher interest rates on new securities would probably push down the value of existing bonds. But since the Fed uses short-term rates to carry out its monetary policy, short-term securities tend to be hurt the most by such moves.
Long-term bonds, meanwhile, might possibly gain in value from Fed moves to combat inflation, which has the most corrosive effect on longer-term maturities.
In the day's only major economic news, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes dropped 3.6 percent in June, the second consecutive monthly decline caused by mortgage rates above 8 percent.
The report was expected and had a negligible impact on bond prices.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.58, to 1,214.86.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9121/32 , up 1/32 from Friday. The average yield to maturity was 6.37 percent, down from 6.38 percent.
The following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	98.880	97.558	Discounted Rate	4.43%	4.83%	Coupon Yield	4.54%	5.02%	High Price	98.885	97.563	Discounted Rate	4.41%	4.82%	Coupon Yield	4.52%	5.01%	Low Price	98.880	97.558	Discounted Rate	4.43%	4.83%	Coupon Yield	4.54%	5.02%	Accepted at low price	34%	25%	Total applied for	$53,342,437	$54,527,049	Accepted	$12,571,841	$12,561,283	Noncompetitive	$1,165,135	$1,158,584

HEADLINE: John J. Driscoll, 82, Is Dead; Led Connecticut Labor Council

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
John Joseph Driscoll, who served for 24 years as president of the Connecticut State Labor Council, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport. A Bridgeport resident, he was 82.
He suffered a brief illness, his family said. 
 Mr. Driscoll presided over his state's Labor Council -- representing the constituent unions of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations -- from 1961 until he retired in 1985. During that period he was considered one of Connecticut's most influential citizens.
But Mr. Driscoll resisted the title of Connecticut's "Mr. Labor" that was sometimes bestowed upon him and played down references to his power. "The only power I have is the power of persuasion," he said.
The son of Irish immigrants, he was born in Waterbury and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in philosophy from Wesleyan University, from which he also received a master's degree in English. Earlier, he had wanted to be an architect, but a year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology convinced him that this talents lay elsewhere. After Wesleyan, a year at Harvard Law School left him with the same impression about law.
He had his first taste of labor at 17 working in a factory in Waterbury for the summer. He said the "horrendous" noise caused muscle spasms that disappeared only when he left the mill gate.
 
Familiar Figure in the Capitol
 Mr. Driscoll went to work in 1937 for 40 cents an hour at the Bristol Company in Waterbury. He was so good at organizing fellow workers that the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers hired him full time. He moved on to the C.I.O., the United Auto Workers and, finally, to the newly merged A.F.L.-C.I.O.
He became executive secretary of the State Labor Council in 1957 and was elected president four years later. After that, his slight figure and white mustache became as familiar in the Capitol corridors of Hartford as they were in union halls.
Mr. Driscoll served on the Governor's Council of Economic Advisers and on the state's first Commission for Higher Education. He often voiced concern that the rising fees at public colleges were shutting out the children of blue-collar families.
He was outspoken in his support of civil rights and marched in Selma, Ala., in 1965. As chief spokesman for his state's unionized labor, he was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions.
His only serious challenge for re-election as head of the Labor Council came in 1983, but he won handily.
Mr. Driscoll is survived by his wife, Margaret Connors Driscoll, a retired Superior Court Judge; a son, David, of Bridgeport, and a grandson.

Dollar Closes With Losses After Day of Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar declined against leading currencies yesterday in quiet, largely technical dealings, as traders awaited the release of economic data and assessed last week's gains.
The dollar traded in a tight range throughout the day, with no significant new economic data or policy statements influencing dealers to buy or sell. Profit taking erased part of last week's advance against the German mark. On Friday, the dollar settled at its highest level against the mark in a month. 
 "Many people are on the sidelines for the time being," said David Durst, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company. "We've had crazy markets in the past few weeks. People are taking it all in, some licking their wounds and others taking profits."
The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 1.5892 marks, down from 1.5985 late Friday.
The dollar fell to 98.60 Japanese yen, from 98.95.
Market participants said few dealers were willing to take new positions ahead of the Government's release later this week of economic data that could influence Federal Reserve action on interest rates.
Signs of inflation could prompt the Fed to raise short-term interest rates, which are currently lower than rates in Europe. That would lift the dollar both by attracting short-term deposits to American banks and by calming the inflation-wary American bond and stock markets, stimulating demand for dollar-denominated assets.
This week's data will include the July consumer confidence index to be released today by the Conference Board, a private research group. The Commerce Department reports June orders for durable goods tomorrow and second-quarter gross domestic product on Friday.
Mr. Durst of Bear, Stearns said traders were concerned about the G.D.P. report. "They're trying to get a feel for whether growth is going to be inflationary," he said. "That's putting things on hold."
Matt Porio, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, said the dollar's surge against the mark last week after a monthlong slide "surprised a lot of people."
"The market wants to see whether this is real," he said.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.3475 Swiss francs, down from 1.3560 on Friday; 5.4290 French francs, down from 5.4640; 1,578 Italian lire, down from 1,586, and $1.3778 (Canadian), up from $1.3768.
The British pound rose to $1.5305 from $1.5270.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Demands New Spending Cuts From All Agencies

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Barely a month after New York City adopted a budget with sharp cuts in spending, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ordered city agencies yesterday to make $250 million in additional cuts immediately and to prepare for the possibility of cutting yet another $200 million.
The $250 million cut, to be made over the six months that began July 1, represents an across-the-board reduction of about 2.6 percent for every city agency, including the Police and Fire Departments and the Board of Education. The move follows a reduction of 15,000 municipal jobs and program cuts of $1.1 billion already approved as part of the $31.6 billion budget. 
 Abraham M. Lackman, Mr. Giuliani's budget director, said the call for new cuts was prompted by an unexpected drop in state and city personal income tax collections in June, and by the possibility that the State Legislature might not reconvene in a special session this summer. Without state legislation, the city would not be able to implement initiatives that were supposed to save $70 million this year.
Mr. Lackman said it was also uncertain whether $200 million in additional Federal aid, promised by city representatives in Washington, would materialize.
Mr. Giuliani described his decision last night to order more spending cuts "as a management tool" and said that if the fiscal situation improves, it is possible "we'll be able to spend that money in the latter part of the year."
The actions came as New York State's Financial Control Board prepared to release a formal critique of Mr. Giuliani's budget this week. The report is expected to identify a number of risky fiscal assumptions in the Mayor's plan. The steps announced yesterday were more far-reaching than Mr. Giuliani's earlier pledge to the Financial Control Board to reduce spending in order to raise the city's reserves by at least $100 million.
 
Giuliani 'in Denial'
 But even as he acted yesterday, Mr. Giuliani criticized the state fiscal agency, whose executive director, Allen J. Proctor, had said Mr. Giuliani appeared "in denial" over the severity of the city's fiscal problems.
"As you solve one set of risks in ways in which they predicted we couldn't solve, they then move on to another set," Mr. Giuliani said.
The Mayor added: "Some of it is a complete misunderstanding of the way in which we are managing this budget, because it's never happened to them before. The Financial Control Board has never dealt with a city government that has actually reduced spending."
Mr. Lackman said the initial $250 million in savings would be held in a city reserve fund. He said the agencies would be asked to report on August 22 on how they would change their programs to manage the spending reductions. "I expect there will be significant head-count reductions," Mr. Lackman said.
The Mayor's order sends agencies from the city's welfare system, to the Parks Department, to the agency for the homeless scrambling once again to find ways to reduce spending at a time when most have not yet adjusted to the sudden loss of more than 6,000 workers through a severance buy-out offer in late spring.
"We have been through a tough budget process and I recognize how difficult it is to have to develop another program this early," Mr. Giuliani wrote in a memorandum to agency heads. "Nevertheless, we must ensure fiscal stability if we are to attain the goals we set forth for this fiscal year."
Mr. Lackman said that once the agencies report to him and the Mayor in late August, the administration would present a modification of the budget to the City Council for approval in September. He said that while a 2.6 percent across-the-board reduction would actually result in $290 million in cuts, the administration was leaving the Mayor some leeway to make choices and only relying on a net cut of $250 million.
While the Council overwhelmingly approved the budget in June, many members expressed misgivings at the time about the program reductions. Richard A. Riley, a spokesman for Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, said last night, "While we agree that the sooner you solve the problem, the better, the Council will be very concerned about where the cuts fall."
Mr. Riley added, "We think it's a good sign, though, that the Mayor has asked all agencies -- including police and fire, which had been held harmless in previous budget negotiations -- to make a significant contribution."
Mr. Lackman said that agencies could choose how they wanted to reach their budget targets, whether through job cuts, service reductions or finding ways to increase fee collections, without levying any new taxes. He said that if some agencies chose layoffs, it was possible that severance packages could be offered once again. He said that the city still had not spent $60 million of $200 million that the Municipal Assistance Corporation had made available earlier this year to pay for cash packages to lure city employees off the payroll.
Mr. Lackman said it would be clearer in the fall, when the Federal fiscal year begins, whether the second round of contingency cuts would be needed. He said city officials were uncertain whether the June drop in tax revenues was a one-time anomaly or a sign that the economy was not recovering as well as had been expected.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: THE OVERVIEW;
JORDAN AND ISRAEL JOIN IN PACT AIMED AT BROAD MIDEAST PEACE

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel today reached across 46 years of war, uneasy coexistence and furtive attempts at peace to sign a Washington Declaration ending the state of war between their nations.
As President Clinton sat beaming between them on a stage on the South Lawn of the White House, the two leaders also agreed to reaffirm King Hussein's role as guardian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, a step intended by Israel to forestall Yasir Arafat's aspiration to claim that right for himself. 
 It is an open question whether today's declaration will lead to an early agreement between Israel and Syria, the last major holdout among the Middle East belligerents.
In practice, Jordan and Israel have functioned for years as civil neighbors. But on a day that marked the first time their leaders have ever met in public, the sweep and detail of their accord appeared to have surprised even the principal participants.
"Out of all the days of my life, I do not believe there is one such as this," King Hussein said in a voice quiet with emotion after Mr. Clinton escorted him into the Rose Garden to join Mr. Rabin at a welcoming ceremony.
The leaders perched themselves three abreast on a stage on the South Lawn at the same 19th-century desk at which Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat initialed the accord between Israel and the P.L.O. on the same lawn last fall. The occasion today was warmed with so many handclasps and grins of delight that what might have been a stiff encounter was transformed instead into a celebration of hope that the Middle East conflict might at last be entering its final days.
"It is dusk at our homes in the Middle East," Mr. Rabin declared just before he and King Hussein picked up their pens to sign the 11-page accord. "Soon darkness will prevail. But the citizens of Israel and Jordan will see a great light."
In fact, the accord is just one step on a long and tortuous road, as was evident by the telephone call that Mr. Clinton placed to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria soon after the signing. Administration officials expressed new hope today that the improvement in Israeli-Jordanian ties will nudge Mr. Assad along a more conciliatory path, but aides said Mr. Clinton had taken pains to reassure the Syrian leader that the United States was not trying to isolate him.
At the same time, while King Hussein has expressed hope that a final deal between Israel and Jordan could be reached by year's end, it remains unclear how willing he will be to complete a peace treaty if his powerful Syrian neighbor remains stubborn in opposition.
With his move toward accommodation with Israel today, King Hussein has also made himself a likely target for Muslim extremists. (The King, then a 16-year-old, was with his grandfather, King Abdullah, when he was assassinated by a Palestinian militant in 1951 in Jerusalem.)
But as King Hussein stood today at the side of Mr. Rabin, who commanded Israeli forces in the 1967 war that cost Jordan the West Bank, the King declared that he and the Prime Minister would now meet "as often as we are able and as required to shepherd this process."
Officials from all three countries taking part today said the extensive terms of the declaration reflected the substantial progress made by their representatives in hurried preparatory talks that began on the Israeli-Jordanian border last Monday.
"After generations of hostility, blood and tears and in the wake of pain and wars," the Washington Declaration began, "His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin are determined to end to bloodshed and sorrow."
 
A Message for Arafat
 The language that guarantees "high priority" to maintaining King Hussein's "special role" in administering the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem was proposed by Israel last week, officials here said, after Mr. Arafat declared that if the King wanted to visit Jerusalem, he should seek Mr. Arafat's approval in advance.
Israeli officials said they wanted the Palestinian leader to understand that when it comes to the status of Al Aksa Mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem, they will deal with the Jordanian leader, as they have since Israeli troops occupied all of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
While that is bound to anger Mr. Arafat, Secretary of State Warren Christopher described the statement today as simply "a recognition of the reality of Jordan's responsibility for the religious shrines."
"I don't think it should cause any trouble," Mr. Christopher said.
Beyond that sensitive issue and their formal agreement to end the state of war and move toward a full peace treaty, the two leaders agreed immediately to take a number of unexpected steps to cement their closer ties.
They pledged that their police forces would cooperate to combat crime, that both countries would seek to discourage economic boycotts, and that they would quickly establish direct telephone links, a shared electricity grid, new border crossings and easy passage for tourists.
 
Making Friends From Foes
 Several times in the document, the two leaders paid homage to the instrumental role played by Mr. Clinton, who looked on like a proud father all day and signed the document as a witness.
In turn, their host welcomed King Hussein and Mr. Rabin to the White House by quoting from both the Koran and the Talmud in tribute to the virtue of making friends from foes.
"Before us today stand friends," Mr. Clinton said, "and heroes."
The ceremonies in the Rose Garden and on the South Lawn were the first in an extraordinary series of joint public appearances here by Mr. Rabin and King Hussein, who have met before, but always in secret.
They strode with Mr. Clinton across Pennsylvania Avenue for a working lunch at Blair House, the official guest residence, then returned to the White House to join the President, Hillary Rodham Clinton and 130 guests at a black-tie dinner.
On Tuesday, they will become the first pair of foreign leaders ever to address a joint meeting of Congress, then will return to the White House for a news conference with Mr. Clinton.
As their host, Mr. Clinton, whose foreign-affairs troubles remain the greatest weight on his popularity ratings, was able today to bask in some of the glory of a foreign policy gone right.
He described the gathering this afternoon as one that had come "to bear witness to history," and recalled not only the Camp David accords of 1979, when President Jimmy Carter brokered an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and the renewed quest for peace that was begun by President George Bush, but also "that shining September day last year" when he watched as Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat signed their accord.
"As this century draws to a close," Mr. Clinton said, "a new era of peace opens before us in ancient lands as brave men choose reconciliation over conflict."
A slow-motion depiction of the famous handshake between Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat is already a centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's political fund-raising videotape, and aides said today that they did not doubt that the Israeli-Jordanian version would be given a similar place. But while Mr. Clinton again positioned himself at its center, today's first handclasp between Mr. Rabin and King Hussein needed none of last fall's encouragement.
Instead, an aura of warmth and confidence suffused each touch and glance between the long-declared adversaries, whose wives sat side by side with Mrs. Clinton during the ceremonies and who themselves wandered through the Rose Garden this morning to make introductions, as King Hussein did in presenting Mr. Rabin to two of his young sons.

HEADLINE: THE MIDEAST ACCORD: THE IMPACT;
2 Neighbors Agree: Now It Can Be Told

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
There is a saying in the Talmud that the Messiah will come when he is no longer needed. And so peace between Jordan and Israel is coming because it already exists.
King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel did not need much coaxing to come together publicly for the first time today and sign a declaration ending the state of war between their countries. 
 They based their diplomatic breakthrough on a recognition of their mutual self-interest and on the comfort that what they were doing was endorsed by their peoples.
The ceremony at the White House today was different from the high-anxiety encounter last September between Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. That was a forced marriage between two lifelong foes who had been wishing each other dead for years.
By contrast, today's event was more like a sedate engagement between longtime neighbors who knew they had a lot in common, had secretly cooperated for years and now, in this new era in the Middle East, could finally allow their relationship to flourish in the light of day.
The body language said it all. When Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat held their public reconciliation, Mr. Clinton used his long arms to nudge them into a handshake. With Mr. Rabin and King Hussein, Mr. Clinton was a proud witness who stood by with his arms at his sides as the Israeli Prime Minister and the Jordanian King repeatedly pumped hands in front of him.
Israel and Jordan have more or less coexisted in a cold peace since the 1967 war, when Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan. King Hussein concluded that the war had been a disaster for the Arab world, and in 1973, when Syria and Egypt moved against Israel, the King sent a symbolic division of troops out of Arab solidarity, but much too late to make a difference.
The euphoria today was palpable. There at the White House stood Mr. Rabin, who was chief of staff of the Israeli Army when it defeated the armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan in 1967, alongside King Hussein, a descendant of the prophet Mohammed who had lost the holy places of Jerusalem to Israel in that war.
At one point Mr. Clinton told his aides how he was struck "by the personal warmth between them and how they couldn't talk enough together."
It took the peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians both to free King Hussein and to force him to accelerate the pace of his peacemaking with Israel. Suddenly the Palestinians were making peace on their own. The King, whose country's population is some 80 percent Palestinian, was freed from the responsibility for the fate of the Palestinian people and their claim to Israeli-occupied land.
He was also confronted with the prospect that the Palestinians would reap the benefits of peace in the Israeli-occupied territories without him. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria was holding back, but other Arab leaders were moving forward to receive Israeli cabinet aides and beginning to negotiate joint economic projects.
 
It Is, After All, the Economy
 What finally impelled the King was his concern about economic security.
He saw the value of the Jordanian dinar, the main currency in the West Bank and Gaza, fall as Palestinian autonomy took hold, and he saw the uncertainty that the decline engendered about Jordan's economic future there. He saw the Agency for International Development break ground for a $12 million housing project for Palestinians living in Gaza.
When Mr. Clinton told the King during a meeting at the White House last month that he would press Congress to forgive Jordan's $700 million debt with the United States if Jordan took a bold step toward peace, it was just the nudge the King needed.
The declaration signed today does not complete agreement over some basic issues: how to share scarce water resources, the final border between Israel and Jordan, the Palestinian refugees in Jordan. Those details will have to wait, although both sides are confident a final settlement will come within the next few months.
 
Shaping a Peace
 But the accord illustrates how the two sides are shaping the peace by immediately setting into motion practical measures and by breaking down important barriers to Israel's lingering pariah status in the Middle East.
Callers in Jerusalem will be able to telephone Amman, for example; the electricity grids of the two countries will be linked; two new border crossings will be opened; Jordanian and Israeli police will cooperate to combat crime.
"This is a situation where the economics of it may be driving the politics of it," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in an interview on Sunday. His aides acknowledge that Mr. Christopher's whirlwind tour last week of the Nabatean ruins at Petra, where Steven Spielberg filmed the last scenes of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," was largely aimed at encouraging American tourism.
 
Returning to Diplomatic Fold
 Today's event also symbolizes King Hussein's redemption in the eyes of Washington. This was the man who tacitly supported Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi leader invaded Kuwait, calling him "an Arab patriot." The king opposed the deployment of United States troops in Saudi Arabia and enraged President George Bush, who told intimates he felt betrayed by a "friend" whose signed photos hung in the residential quarters of the White House.
The only crucial player still awaiting redemption is Mr. Assad.
Last week Mr. Christopher described the Syrian as "relaxed" about the Jordanian-Israeli meeting, and Mr. Christopher was said to be heartened that during one of their meetings, Mr. Assad spoke approvingly of Mr. Clinton's statement last January that if all parties did not take advantage of every opportunity for peace, their children and grandchildren will not forgive them.
Administration officials also note that the predictions that Mr. Assad would challenge Mr. Arafat's legitimacy did not come true. The officials are so intent on keeping Mr. Assad moving forward that Mr. Christopher plans to return to the Mideast in early August.
And Mr. Assad cannot be happy that King Hussein, like Mr. Arafat last September, was welcomed at the White House while Syria is subject to economic sanctions and remains on the State Department's list of nations supporting terrorism.
Thus, the "new landscape" in the Middle East that Mr. Christopher talks about so glowingly still has vast areas of rough terrain.

HEADLINE: Rule Pumps Dollars Into Decayed Housing

BYLINE: ADAM NOSSITER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 25

 BODY:
Roofless buildings yawning to the sky, gaping windows without glass, inside walls stripped to rough planks, outside walls pitted with holes: it isn't the emptiness of the Desire public housing development that is disconcerting, but the presence of any residents at all. About 3,000 people live in a project that was designed for more than twice that number.
In March, the Inspector General for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Susan Gaffney, told Congress that renovating the isolated 97-acre reservation for the poor would cost $14 million more than tearing it down and starting over. Yet work is under way on a renovation plan that is expected to cost $90 million to $100 million. The housing agency has already approved the first $12 million. 
 The project, which is on the street immortalized by Tennessee Williams in his play "A Streetcar Named Desire," is a case study of what critics say is an irrationality of the Federal housing policy, one that has also affected cities like Newark, Cleveland and Washington. The root of the problem, the critics say, is a Federal housing agency policy that funnels large sums of money into decrepit apartments but provides little for new construction, and a law requiring that for every demolished apartment, a new unit be built, to keep the supply from dwindling.
This "one-for-one" law seems particularly irrational in New Orleans, which has the highest housing vacancy rate in the country, 16.6 percent, the Census Bureau says.
On Friday, the House overwhelmingly approved a bill that would revise the policy and ease the law. It would allow the demolition of the most decrepit public housing while freeing money designated for renovation to build new apartments. A housing bill is also before the Senate but it does not discuss the "one-for-one" law.
A leader in the drive for the House legislation was Representative Collin C. Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota, who toured Desire this year, and cited the project as an example of waste produced by the current policy. Mr. Peterson is the chairman of a House subcommittee on housing.
In the grim universe of decaying housing projects, Desire is "probably one of the worst in the country," a district inspector general for the housing agency, D. Michael Beard, said in a recent interview. Mr. Beard was in charge of an agency audit of the New Orleans Housing Authority completed last month.
The sprawling complex of two-story barracks-like buildings, built from 1953 to 1956, sits atop a landfill that was once a swamp. The ground is sinking beneath it, so that in many places porches have fallen away.
 
Exodus Began a Decade Ago
 Since the early 1980's, when Desire was almost full, residents have been moving out steadily as the project deteriorated and violence grew. The project is about 58 percent vacant. Of the 810 households there, 745 are headed by single women.
The project, two miles east of the French Quarter, is cut off from the rest of the city by two sets of railroad tracks, the New Orleans Industrial Canal and acres of warehouses and factories.
The complex was deliberately built of wooden frames, susceptible to the area's high humidity, as opposed to concrete and masonry, because the Federal Public Housing Administration, as it was known then, said it wanted to save money. It was built "as a colored project," according to the housing agency report completed last month, and only blacks still live there.
 
Violence Amid Wreckage
 Today, some of the apartments look as if they have been pillaged by marauding armies. Remains of plaster walls lie heaped on rotting wood floors. Vandals have taken everything, down to the window frames and copper piping.
There were 86 murders in the complex from 1989 to 1993, more than in any of the city's other housing projects in the same period, even though some of the others are larger.
But even before the first tenants moved to Desire, a public housing tenants' association report called it a "waste of public money" and "unsafe for human habitation." Those words have echoed through the years and were heard yet again as the New Orleans Housing Authority considered the renovation.
In addition to the public housing laws, the pride of local housing officials and some of the tenants were behind the renovation. "The neighborhood should exist," said Shelia Danzey, manager of the New Orleans Housing Authority. "It's like preservationists saying these 1832 houses should exist."
Ms. Danzey also questioned the credentials of the independent consulting concern that advised against rebuilding Desire, even though it is the same one hired by her agency in 1990. The concern, EA Technical Services Inc. of Atlanta, said renovating the project was neither "viable or feasible."
The decision by the New Orleans housing authority to push the renovation plan was essential for getting it approved by Federal officials. Yet the Federal audit of the New Orleans agency called its operations "inefficient, ineffective and uneconomical."
Joseph Shuldiner, the Assistant Secretary for public and Indian housing, said of the renovation plan, "There are legitimate questions here, but in our judgment they didn't outweigh the official policy of going along with the local request."
 
$12 Million Commitment
 In the first phase of the renovation, about $12 million has been awarded to the Rex K. Johnson Company, a Lampasas, Tex., concern that specialized in public housing work, to rebuild about 180 apartments. They have been redesigned as town houses, with each apartment having its own access to the street.
The overall plan calls for spending $71,000 to $78,000 for each apartment, which exceeds the housing agency's own spending limit for a new apartment by as much as 37 percent. The amount being spent to renovate each apartment could buy comfortable three-bedroom dwellings in many parts of New Orleans.
Under the renovation plan, a third of Desire's 1,800 apartments would be demolished and the rest would be gutted and rebuilt. The tenants would remain during the renovation. To conform to the one-for-one rule, for each Desire apartment demolished the housing authority will subsidize the rents for the same number of apartments.
 
Law Behind the Rebuilding
 In 1987, the tide had long since turned against construction of big public housing projects when Congress mandated that every housing unit torn down had to be replaced with a new one. In practice, the rule forced local authorities to leave deteriorating housing projects standing.
In addition to limiting money for new constructions, the housing rules bar new developments in areas that already have large poor and minority populations. Neighborhood opposition to new public housing is often intense.
For the current fiscal year, Congress appropriated $559 million for new housing against $3.2 billion for renovation. It also appropriated $7 billion for rental vouchers to be used for private housing. But there are limits on the number of vouchers that can be used to replace housing that has been demolished.
 
Rules Leave Empty Projects
 The national landscape is littered with decaying, empty housing projects. Newark has long wanted to demolish 21 high-rise apartments. The one-for-one rule made this difficult, so the city's housing authority received $17 million in Federal housing operating subsidies for closed and sealed buildings from 1985 to 1992, enabling the authority to accumulate reserves of $31 million and "become financially sound," in Inspector General Gaffney's words.
The Cuyahoga Housing Authority in Cleveland has received $47.3 million in operating subsidies for vacant units since 1987, and the Washington authority $5.5 million in 1992.
These accounts of subsidies for empty apartments, recited in March before Mr. Peterson's subcommittee, led to the legislation passed on Friday. It would allow all local housing officials to use up to half their renovation money for new housing. It would also allow them to ask the Federal housing agency to waive the rule requiring one new housing unit for each one demolished if it interfered with the development of new public housing.
An amendment to the bill would also allow New Orleans housing officials to use money designated for the renovation of the Desire in other ways, including renovating some of the city's many vacant dwellings for housing the Desire tenants.
The new Mayor of New Orleans, Marc Morial, who inherited the Desire renovation plan, says he supports the amendment that would give the city more discretion with its Federal housing money. He suggested that some of the $100 million may be better spent repairing the city's many abandoned houses, some of them with distinctive Creole architectural features still intact. But he said he wanted the first phase of the Desire renovation to be completed.
At Desire, there is suspicion of politicians, anger about the conditions and, in some residents, no interest at all in moving somewhere else. Charlene Slack, for one is glad to see the construction crews. "I'm happy about it," she said. "But I wish they would hurry up."
Bonnie Rodgers, vice chairman of the tenant council, said: "Don't send us somewhere else. Let us change where we live."
But others don't see much hope in change. Penny Jones stood by the rotting wood of her kitchen floor, near the bathroom where the sink was coming off the wall, and by the stairwell that looked like an elongated piece of Swiss cheese.
"I think they should tear it all down," she said. The summer heat had aggravated the stink of the sewage beneath her building, she said. Indeed, the Atlanta consulting firm found that the "subsidence of the soil has caused continuous problems with the sewer and water systems."
There were a "million" mice in the apartment. "They need to just tear it all down and start from scratch," Ms. Jones said. "They can fix it up. I don't care. I'm going to move."

HEADLINE: Polish Posters, Briefly Derailed, Are Back on Track

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, July 25

 BODY:
In the Communist era, Poland's poster artists were among the world's most acclaimed as they turned out graphically distinctive and politically bold designs. From the uneven red lettering on a white background that became the famous signature for the Solidarity movement in the 1980's to vivid cultural motifs that often used sly visual metaphors, Polish posters were collected and admired in Europe and the United States for their inventiveness.
After a lean four years since the Communists fell, the Polish poster is back, along with works from other nations, at the 14th Warsaw Poster Biennale, where 425 entries are on display. A Japanese artist, Mitsuo Katsui, won first prize in the main category of the competition with a hotly disputed entry created with computers. Poster collectors complained that the gaily colored abstract pattern held no message and was executed as a single copy instead of in multiples, as usual. 
 A Polish graphic artist, Mieczyslaw Wasilewski, a former gold medalist in the Biennale, came in second with a stark black Star of David burning in white flames. Designed to commemorate last year's 50th anniversary of the uprising by Polish Jews against the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto, the poster pleased Polish poster aficionados because it reflected the strong heritage of Polish design.
And Henryk Tomaszewski, the grand eminence of Polish poster art, who is now in his 80's, won a bronze medal in the advertising section for his amusing yet simple piece, which was designed to advertise his own 1991 show of posters at an Amsterdam museum. The poster has the word "love" in quirky black type on a white background.
The Biennale, which was canceled two years ago when the post-Communist cultural administrators could not decide where it should be held, has traditionally attracted big crowds of European poster collectors. In the past the show was at the National Gallery in the center of Warsaw. This year, it is being held at the Poster Museum, on the grounds of a 17th-century Baroque royal palace on the city's outskirts. Though the Poster Museum has two halls, the entries are squeezed together with barely an inch between the frames.
The hiatus in the Biennale reflected a troubled period for Polish poster artists and revealed one of the many paradoxes of the changes after Communism. With the coming of a market economy and freedom of expression, poster artists, whose Polish income was from Government sponsored cultural assignments, found it harder than ever to make a living.
"This is because their kind of art doesn't produce money," said Mariusz Knorowski, the assistant curator of the Poster Museum. "Real artists don't want to produce for toothpaste companies."
And as the cities here became ablaze with bright, Western-style billboards hawking everything from sodas to underwear, the more discreetly sized poster with less brazen images seemed crowded out.
Waldemar Swierzy, a well-established poster artist who works in a studio in Warsaw's Old Town and is a professor of art at the University of Poznan, has been attracting overseas commissions for many years. But he liked to complement this international work, mostly devoted to poster portraits of jazz and rock musicians, with home-grown assignments.
"In the past there were 22 theaters in Poland, each had eight premiers," Mr. Swierzy said. "And there were 250 movies, Polish and foreign, that would be shown, and we'd make posters for them. Now the theaters do posters less frequently because the printing costs are expensive. Now most films are imported, and they bring the art with them."
As for new Western advertising agencies in Warsaw: "They are not commissioning us," he said, meaning the big names of Polish poster art. "They pay little and hire younger people."
Mr. Swierzy entered three posters in this year's Biennale, including a silhouette of Thelonious Monk that is a part of a series on jazz musicians. The first jazz posters were commissioned by the Polish Jazz Foundation, but now European jazz organizations ask him to create posters for special events. They sell particularly well in France, he said.
The Biennale is accompanied by the publication of a book called "The 100th Anniversary of Polish Poster Art" edited by Poland's foremost poster collector, Krzysztof Dydo, who runs a private poster gallery in Cracow. He owns about 25,000 posters, most of them Polish.
The book traces the Polish poster from the 1890's, when the influence of Toulouse-Lautrec was clear, to the 1930's, when Art Nouveau travel posters were popular, and through the Communist era. It ends with the beginnings of the post-Communist period. One of the most intriguing periods was the 1950's, when poster artists entered into what Mr. Knorowski calls an "unofficial contract" with the Communist Government. The artists made posters in the Social Realism style, extolling the system by showing smiling women carrying cement trowels and men with pickaxes slung over their shoulders. This pact enabled poster artists to work and to create posters for cultural events in which they could sometimes make allusions to the grim living conditions, Mr. Knorowski said.
In those days, Mr. Tomaszewski was able to show obliquely that May 1, the Communist Labor Day, was not the time of euphoria that the regime's propaganda described. In a now famous example of this lack of enthusiasm for the supposed worker's paradise, Mr. Tomaszewski drew a poster that displayed only half a tractor (the machine was drawn at the edge of the canvas so only the end showed) and a few cherry tree branches and a piece of the Polish flag.
"For those days it was close to parody," Mr. Knorowski said.
Mr. Tomaszewski remains one of the few graphic artists of the postwar period to have stayed in Poland. Others left in the 1960's and 70's, weary of the political situation. Several of them live in the United States.
For poster historians like Mr. Knorowski and Mr. Dydo, Mr. Tomaszewski remains the favorite, not only because he stayed behind but also because he is seen as a purist.
"He is always the most intellectual," Mr. Knorowski said, "he always leaves something to think about and usually he is hiding something."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Land of the Free but Also a Home of the Bigoted

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG 

 BODY:
Behind the Mask of Chivalry
The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan
By Nancy MacLean
Illustrated. 292 pages. Oxford University Press. $30.
 
Anti-Semitism in America
By Leonard Dinnerstein
369 pages. Oxford University Press. $25.
It's appropriate to link Nancy Mac Lean's "Behind the Mask of Chivalry," about the Ku Klux Klan, and Leonard Dinnerstein's "Anti-Semitism in America" because racial and religious bigotries are companions. Historically, they are rooted in ignorance and intolerance. Both books suggest that old-fashioned demagogy has surfaced in new forms in American politics and broadcasting. 
 The framers of the Constitution placed the First Amendment clause against establishing a national religion ahead of even the one that assures freedom of the press. But listening to spokesmen for the religious and radical right on the hustings and on the radio, you would not believe that the First Amendment's anti-establishment clause existed. Political hopefuls of the religious and radical right profess to speak for the one true American way, but their way clashes with what President George Washington told the elders of Touro Synagogue in Newport, R.I., about religious liberty in the new United States: "To bigotry, no sanction."
Professor MacLean, who teaches history at Northwestern University, confines her book to the second coming of the Klan, in the 1920's. Its members weren't quite like the original night riders, who flourished during Reconstruction, perpetuating white supremacy. The estimated three million dues-paying members who joined the Klan after World War I were neighborly men and women, Professor MacLean says. But, the author adds, they believed that "Catholics were stockpiling weapons to take over the country, that a cabal of Jewish bankers controlled world affairs, and that white people must ready themselves for an imminent race war with people of color."
The second Klan was out in the open. During its heyday, families marched in parades, patronized only Klan merchants and voted for Klan-endorsed political candidates. The members were less interested in the lynchings that were performed by their criminal element than in winning elections. The Klan was particularly strong in Indiana, Oklahoma, Oregon and the Deep South.
In its most original chapters, "Behind the Mask of Chivalry" concentrates on the activities of Klan No. 5 in Athens, Ga., the home of the University of Georgia. The author sifted through the chapter's records and found membership rosters, propaganda tracts and correspondence. The men of property and social power who made up the local economic elite were less likely to join the Klan than were clerical workers, small-business owners, independent professionals and farmers.
Professor MacLean briefly mentions the success a few years ago of David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Klan, in using elections to build a following, but she then drops the subject and has little to say about the Klan's modern ideological soul mates in mufti on the far right. "Behind the Mask of Chivalry" is too narrowly drawn to have significance for readers seeking parallels to the national political arena today.
Professor Dinnerstein, who teaches history at the University of Arizona, gives the subject of American anti-Semitism a grand overview, from its colonial origins to the present. Along the way, he doesn't pull any punches about the forces in and outside churches who keep the theme of Jewish villainy alive.
The author finds that the hostility toward Jews was brought to the New World by the first settlers, instilled by Christian teachings and reinforced by successive waves of Protestants and Roman Catholics. He writes that an ancestral European Christian obsession with Jews became "an irrevocable part of the American heritage." Yet he notes that in recent years, the Roman Catholic Church has been in the vanguard of trying to change attitudes toward the Jewish people: "Not only did Pope John XXIII inaugurate a new emphasis on interfaith dialogue, but the Second Vatican Council specifically 'exonerated' Jews for Christ's death."
At times, Professor Dinnerstein makes the situation sound worse than it may have been for many Jews across the country. "From the end of the Civil War until the beginning of the 20th century, the United States witnessed the emergence of a full-fledged anti-Semitic society," he writes in one sweeping statement. "Like the hysteria exhibited during the war, the institutionalized bigotry that developed afterward reflected the biases of practically every stratum in society. As immigration figures soared, and as a significant Jewish presence emerged in the United States, people in every walk of life, from respectable working, middle and upper classes to agrarian protesters, Protestant and Catholic spokesmen, and members of the lunatic fringe increasingly focused on the allegedly deleterious characteristics of Jews that they believed impinged on American lives."
Such a judgment makes the reader wonder why, if a "full-fledged anti-Semitic society" existed here, so many millions of Jews chose to immigrate to the United States in the first quarter of the 20th century. After all, as full-fledged American citizens, Jews were allowed to enter colleges (albeit with quotas), make their way in most (though not all) businesses and professions, own property (almost anywhere), vote by secret ballot and practice their religion freely, just like Christian immigrants.
Professor Dinnerstein brings his account up to the moment with a discussion of anti-Semitic comments by Louis Farrakhan and Leonard Jeffries. Aware that Jews have been in the vanguard of the civil-rights movement, and that some died for the cause of black freedom in the Deep South, the author points out that enlightened black leaders have said they want to stop black anti-Semitism, but that it could take several generations before centuries-old beliefs are eradicated.
"Anti-Semitism in America" ends on a half-hopeful note: "By comparing the strength of anti-Semitism in the United States today with what it had been in previous decades or centuries, the obvious conclusion is that it has declined in potency and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future." It's a challenging book that deserves attention.

HEADLINE: El Nino Said to Predict Rain and Crops in Africa

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
FLUCTUATING sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean can reliably predict both rainfall and corn harvests halfway around the world in Africa, scientists have found, in a discovery that may offer a powerful new tool for agricultural planners.
Climatologists say they are able to forecast with some confidence the two-to-seven-year oscillations in Pacific temperatures, associated with the phenomenon known as El Nino, that set off long-distance atmospheric chain reactions which influence climatic conditions in many parts of the globe. The new findings suggest that these predictions can be used to forecast crop conditions in Africa as much as a year in advance, enabling planners to anticipate and cope better with droughts and shortened rainy seasons. 
 Reporting in the current issue of the British journal Nature, scientists in the United States and Zimbabwe say they have established a statistical correlation of "astonishing" strength between the temperature cycle in the Pacific and rainfall and corn yields in Zimbabwe. Similar links have previously been discerned in Australia and Peru. But both those countries are close to the gigantic pool of Pacific water where El Nino fluctuations take place, while the new link spans much of the world.
The researchers found that between 1973 and 1990, Zimbabwean rainfall and corn yields fluctuated in lock step with the oscillating surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, dropping in years when the temperatures were above normal (El Nino event) and rising in years when the temperatures dropped below normal (La Nina event).
Since El Nino's influence is global, the scientists wrote in Nature, "it may be rewarding to search for similarly predictable food crops in other vulnerable areas of the world."
 
Early Warning of Droughts
 The scientists are Dr. Mark A. Cane and Dr. Gidon Eshel of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Roger W. Buckland of the 10-nation Southern African Development Community's Food Security Technical and Administrative Unit in Harare, Zimbabwe. Dr. Cane, an oceanographer, climatologist and pioneer in the making of El Nino predictions, and Dr. Eshel, an oceanographer, are authorities on climate. Mr. Buckland is an agricultural economist.
The researchers were surprised, Dr. Eshel said in an interview, to find that the correlation between the cycle of El Nino-La Nina and crop yields was even stronger than that for rainfall. This means, he said, that crop yields respond to other factors in addition to rainfall, and that those factors are also linked to El Nino oscillations. He speculated that these factors might include the distribution of rain during the rainy season or even the population of field mice, but acknowledged that "we don't have a very good handle" on the precise mechanisms.
Corn is Zimbabwe's most important food crop, and it was devastated in 1991 and 1992 by the worst drought in this century in southern Africa. The drought was not anticipated, leading to greater agony and higher relief costs than might have been the case had there been a warning.
Now, "an effective early warning system is in place," Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig wrote in a commentary in Nature. "Next time we will be better able to anticipate and react early to minimize the cost and the damage." The potential for warning farmers in advance of drought "brings science, literally, right down to ground level," wrote Dr. Rosenzweig, an agronomist at Columbia University and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and an expert on the relationship between climate and agriculture.
The study is important, she said in an interview, because it shows that scientists who use computer models to predict El Nino fluctuations "have come far enough along in the predictive work that they are really ready to go work with the agronomists and agricultural planners to really move into an operational mode."
 
Help for Farmers
 This year, for instance, the annual rains in southern Africa ended prematurely, leading to a poor corn crop, said Mr. Buckland. "With adequate warning," he said, "farmers could shift to short-maturing varieties or to sorghum and millet." But he said "a lot of development work" lies ahead "before we can use the data with any confidence."
Dr. Rosenzweig noted that the study involves only one variable, rainfall, and applies to only one part of the world. Bigger strides in agricultural forecasting will come when more variables are included and the reach of this kind of analysis becomes global, she said.
El Nino, recognized for some time as a major global weather-maker, is emerging as the most important element in climate variability and its effect on human activities, Dr. Rosenzweig said. Climatologists have had somewhat better success in predicting El Nino's fluctuations a year or so in advance than might be expected for such a relatively long period.
But the predictions are not perfect. Forecasters failed, for instance, to forecast that El Nino that began in 1991 would last for nearly three years. Still, the forecasters say, they can gauge with fair accuracy the probability that a warm El Nino phase or cold La Nina phase will develop, and when.

HEADLINE: Filling In the Peace Map

 BODY:
Israel and Jordan moved the map of a peaceful Middle East a large step closer to completion yesterday when they agreed to end 46 years of formal belligerency and begin normalizing their relations. A peace treaty is still months away, but already the two countries are ready to resolve concrete issues like boundaries and water rights, open direct telephone communications across the Jordan and work together against what remains of the Arab economic boycott.
President Clinton rightly placed this Washington Declaration in the sequence that began with the Camp David agreements with Egypt and included last September's accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization. For the first time in Israel's history, most of its borders are peaceful. Only Syria and Lebanon remain without agreements, and progress on those fronts may not be far off. 
 Israel's accords with the P.L.O. made it both possible and urgent for King Hussein to move ahead. Possible because Jordan, with a large Palestinian population of its own, cannot now be accused of dealing behind the back of the P.L.O. Urgent to protect Jordan's economic position in the West Bank and religious rights in Jerusalem from rival Arab claims.
Jordan's Hashemite rulers have been more nuanced in their relations with Israel than Egypt under President Nasser or the P.L.O. before Yasir Arafat embraced diplomacy and peace. Yet Jordanian armies fought Israel in 1948 and 1967. Now King Hussein, who claims descent from the Prophet Mohammed, and Yitzhak Rabin, who made his name as a soldier in Israel's wars for survival, have openly taken the path to peace.
Yesterday's declaration is fresh evidence that the Middle East is adapting to the changed environment after the cold war. Religious and territorial rivalries may have been at the heart of the conflict, but superpower competition encouraged both sides to pursue military rather than diplomatic strategies. After the Gaza-Jericho agreement in May, Jordan felt it could no longer afford to stay aloof. Peace with Syria and Lebanon will be harder, but yesterday's declaration will increase the pressure on President Hafez al-Assad, who speaks for both countries, to make a deal.
King Hussein, who saw his grandfather murdered 43 years ago for deviating from the solid Arab front against Israel, would not have taken the risks he now accepts unless he believed that Syria and Saudi Arabia, for all their protests about a "separate peace," would not retaliate against Jordan. His country is financially and militarily vulnerable to outside pressure, all the more so after it alienated the U.S., Saudi Arabia and their allies by opposing the forcible expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait.
Any residual American coolness toward Jordan over that episode should be put to rest by yesterday's declaration. Prime Minister Rabin himself will now urge Congress to approve the $700 million debt forgiveness measure for Jordan that the Clinton Administration seeks. By heeding his plea, Congress can reinforce Jordan's initiative for peace and encourage Syria and Lebanon to complete the new map of Middle East peace.

HEADLINE: Kitchen-Sink Bonds: Paine Webber's $180 Million Misstep

BYLINE: By LESLIE EASTON AND PATRICK J. LYONS

 BODY:
Few investors would deliberately buy toxic waste. But a lot of them ended up owning the Wall Street equivalent, because they -- or their mutual funds -- bought what are called kitchen-sink bonds.
 Last Friday, Paine Webber Group said it would spend $180 million to buy two of these issues from its troubled Short-Term U.S. Government Securities Fund, which has fallen by more than 7 percent this year, far more than similar funds. The bonds made up about a quarter of the fund's assets. 
 If the brokerage manages to sell these bonds within the next two years, any profits will go into the mututal fund, said Thomas F. Eggers, managing director of marketing and sales for Paine Webber fund group.
 But making a profit may not be easy. Paine Webber told regulators it had not been able to get any other investors to bid on the bonds, whose names are a mouthful: Fund America Investors Corporation II and Fannie Mae Guaranteed Remic Pass-Through Certificate-Remic Trust 1994-74.
 Why? "It turns out kitchen-sink bonds are so complicated and backed by so many pieces of collateral that they are nearly not subject to analysis," said James I. Midanek, chief investment officer of Solon Asset Management in Walnut Creek, Calif. "We just aren't going to be able to figure this out if we look at it for the rest of our lives."
 Each kitchen-sink bond is different. "You can't compare one to another," said Paul D. Kaplan, senior vice president of the Wellington Management Company. But they all follow the basic recipe shown here. And they all share an Achille's heel: When interest rates move sharply, the assumptions they are built on go out the window, and so do the bonds' values. LESLIE EASTON AND PATRICK J. LYONS

GRAPHIC: Chart: WHERE THEY COME FROM
 
1 -- Instead of keeping mortgages on the books until maturity as most banks used to do, today banks and other mortgage lenders gather the notes they hold from borrowers and sell them to an investment banking house or an agency like Ginnie Mae or Freddie Mac in exchange for cash that can be used to write more new mortgages.
 
2 -- The buyer of the mortgages bundles them into a large pool, which is known as a "pass-through" because principal and interest payments from borrowers are passed through to investors. A simple pass-through is a popular investment. But Wall Street engineers also use the pools to back complex securities known as collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.'s
 
3 -- The C.M.O's are pools of mortgages that have been cut into separate pieces called tranches, which are tailored to suite different investors' tastes for risk and return. A given tranche may include only principal or only interest; it may mature in 3 years or in 30; its value may move with prevailing interest rates or against them.
 
4 -- Leftover odds and ends that are very risky and offer unpredictable returns are lumped together into catchall securities called cash-flow notes or kitchen-sink bonds. The various quirks of the components are supposed to offset each other, in theory adding up to a worthwhile investment. But the offsetting effect comes apart when interest rates jump, as Paine Webber discovered.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE OVERVIEW;
Democrats Issue Draft of Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
House Democratic staff members have drafted a summary of health insurance legislation for their leaders to discuss with other Democrats, but the preliminary document does not resolve many delicate issues, like timing.
As expected, the seven-page summary, widely circulated on Capitol Hill today, closely follows the lines of the bill adopted last month by the House Committee on Ways and Means, which aims to provide health insurance to all Americans, financed in large part by mandatory payments by employers. 
 Additions include allowing small businesses to enroll their workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the same plan that covers members of Congress. Two Senate committees had also provided for opening that program to non-Federal employees. Some other provisions appear to be taken literally from the Ways and Means bill, although they concern issues on which the leaders remain open to compromise.
 
A 'Work in Progress'
 For example, the document speaks of requiring employers to pay 80 percent of workers' insurance premiums, while the Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, made it clear today that he would be open to reducing this to a 50-50 split between employers and employees.
Nevertheless, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, is using at least some parts of this document as talking points with other Democrats.
Laura Nichols, Mr. Gephardt's press secretary, said tonight that the document was a "work in progress." She said it was prepared so leaders "can begin to not only educate members but talk them through what we could do in improving what the committee had done."
Ms. Nichols said the most sensitive issues, like how to structure the required employer payments toward workers' premiums, had not been resolved. The document, for example, does not discuss the possibility of exempting very small businesses, saying only, "In general, all employers would be required to contribute toward the cost of private health insurance for all employees."
She said, "The big policy decisions have yet to be made."
But as their leaders worked to turn legislation passed by committees into proposals for consideration on the House and Senate floors, Democrats were also busy using the health care issue to attack the Republicans.
Mr. Foley said the recent Republican National Committee meeting showed that Republicans wanted to defeat any health bill. He said their desire to "see any bill defeated is a remarkable confession of their putting politics above the interests of the people."
 
Issue of Medicare
 And Vice President Al Gore, addressing the National Council of Senior Citizens, said legislation proposed by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, would "raid Medicare," provide "virtually no help with costly medications" and allow insurance companies to go on charging "older people four times as much as younger people" for health insurance. He said Democratic bills, unlike the Dole version, banned discriminatory rates and provided for prescription drugs and long-term care for the elderly.
Mr. Dole replied in a statement: "One day they attack me. The next day they attack employers. The next day it's insurance companies. It's politics as usual at the White House. They are looking for enemies instead of solutions."
And Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, said Mr. Foley was wrong in accusing the Republicans of opposing all health legislation. "We are working very hard to write a bill that can be passed," he said. "In a city where Rabin and Hussein spoke from the same microphone, we might even have the Democratic and Republican leadership work together."
Mr. Gingrich said he had repeatedly offered to work with the House majority leader and had been rebuffed. He contended that Republicans wanted to pass a moderate bill. "It's not just an effort to upstage and defeat the President," he said.
House Republicans have insisted that they would not consider any bill that would require employers to pay part of the cost of their workers' insurance. Democratic leaders regard that as an essential ingredient.
The attack on Mr. Dole in particular has been a determined Democratic strategy for the last few days. Rather than argue against compromise measures that have some bipartisan support, the Democrats have taken Mr. Dole's bill, which relies on insurance law changes and subsidies for the very poor but would leave many people uncovered, as the enemy. They have attacked it sharply, seeking to define the nation's choice as between their universal coverage measure, whatever it turns out to be, and his minimal measure.
In a day of heavy lobbying by the disabled and the elderly, New York City also weighed in, when hospital executives, labor leaders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo traveled to Washington to demand that any bill provide universal coverage and not leave New York worse off than it is today.
Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, and Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the hospital workers union, were among a group who called on Mr. Gephardt. They warned him that proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid payments for graduate medical education and for hospitals providing a disproportionate share of care to poor people would badly hurt New York's teaching and public hospitals, especially if legislation did not include coverage for everyone.
 
Lobbying by Cuomo
 In midafternoon, Mr. Cuomo made many of the same points at a meeting with the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, before going off to see Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and the dean of the state's House delegation, Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan. Mr. Cuomo said he had told Mr. Panetta that he thought that not enough Americans understood that universal coverage was not merely an altruistic goal but the linchpin on which successful change depended, even if it took several years to achieve.
"I think many of the people in the country misperceive the rationale for universal coverage," Mr. Cuomo said. 'They think it is purely a matter of compassion and concern for 36 or 37 million uncovered people. And that leads some of them to believe that you are asking the covered people to give up wealth for the benefit of the uncovered people, when the better rationale is in order to protect the covered people -- at least eventually -- you have to get the uncovered people into coverage, because they're receiving health care, but it's too expensive and the burden of that expense falls on the shoulders of the premium-payers, which is the rest of us."
Ross Perot said today that he was disappointed that the television networks had refused to sell broadcast time to the Republican Party for half-hour advertisements on health care. He said he had been willing to spend more than $1 million for the Republican commercials. Echoing what some leading Republicans are beginning to say, Mr. Perot added: "Right now there's this feeling that if you don't pass it during the election, all life on the planet will stop. We should take our time and do it right."
Mr. Perot said he would not have appeared in the Republican commercials and simply wanted them to be an even-handed analysis of health care options. But he made clear his belief that employer mandates would be a grave mistake.

Chart: "DIARY: Health Care Developments"
 
YESTERDAY
 As a proposal drafted by Democratic staff members of pivotal House committees began circulating on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats criticized the ideas and tactics of their rivals.
 
CONGRESS
Democrats and Republicans traded barbs over rival proposals. Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Republicans were "putting politics above the interests of the people," while Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said Democrats "are looking for enemies instead of solutions." The Congressional Budget Office said it would be unable to deliver an assessment of a legislation approved by the Senate Finance Committee on July 2 until staff members finished writing its precise language. The plan relies on changes in insurance regulations and Government subsidies to low-income families to provide insurance coverage to about 95 percent of Americans; its backers hope that the budget office report will strengthen their argument that the plan would be effective and affordable.
 
WHITE HOUSE
Vice President Al Gore criticized Republican health care proposals as shortchanging the elderly, and his wife, Tipper, pressed for universal health coverage, including virtually unlimited coverage for mental illness. She spoke at the National Press Club.
 
LOBBYING
New York politicians, hospital executives and labor leaders from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo down descended on the Capitol to emphasize the need for universal coverage and to insist that any health care bill take account of New York's historically rich system of health care benefits and its large population of poor sick people and not leave it worse off.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: CAMPAIGNING;
Swept Into Office on Health Care Issue, Senator Struggles in Re-election Bid

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: READING, Pa.

 BODY:
As the man who put health care on the national agenda, Senator Harris Wofford, who is up for re-election this year, is determined to prove he has something to show for his troubles.
On a recent campaign swing through the Fairgrounds farmers' market here, he seemed oblivious to the summer swelter while he implored voters not to lose faith in his efforts to improve the health system. 
 Standing over Dorothy Waid's shopping cart, Mr. Wofford plodded through the ins and outs of mandates, deductibles and health alliances for 10 minutes as Mrs. Waid's plastic jugs of lemonade blistered in the sun and her bag of corn fell limp.
 
Message in Election
 Few politicians are identified as closely with health care as is Mr. Wofford, a Democrat. While his 1991 campaign for the Senate was not primarily about the health system, his upset victory demonstrated the appeal of even the vaguest advocacy for change. He beat former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a special election to fill out the term of John Heinz, who was killed in an air crash.
Now, as this 68-year-old former college president and discursive intellectual seeks a full six-year term, he is struggling to portray himself as a man of action, "at the center" of the health care vortex as it spirals toward a conclusion.
Congress is trying to forge a health care bill before its August recess. Leaders worry that if they have no bill by then, they will have nothing to show voters in November. For Mr. Wofford, the worry is whether, having let the health care genie out of the bottle, it will haunt him or help him.
Beyond that, Mr. Wofford's campaign is being closely watched both for its potential as one of several that could shift control of the Senate to the Republicans and as a barometer of President Clinton's personal fortunes.
 
Links to Clinton
 Although Mr. Wofford leads his Republican opponent, Representative Rick Santorum, in opinion polls and has four times as much cash on hand, his support is viewed as soft for a Senator seeking re-election. The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan Washington publication, calls the race a toss-up, and some Democratic leaders in Pennsylvania say Mr. Wofford could be in trouble if Mr. Santorum raises more money. Their hope is that, whatever Mr. Wofford's vulnerabilities, Mr. Santorum's ties to the religious right will prove too far out of the mainstream for most voters.
Part of Mr. Wofford's problem is his close alliance with Mr. Clinton. The Senator's 1991 campaign, based on strong domestic priorities, served as a harbinger for Mr. Clinton, who hired Mr. Wofford's political consultants for his race for President in 1992.
Mr. Wofford's election was perceived in part as a "wake-up call" to President George Bush to pay more attention to domestic matters. The danger for Mr. Wofford now is that voters will use him as a vehicle again -- this time to send a message to Mr. Clinton. The President's popularity here is flagging, particularly in the important Republican suburbs of Philadelphia, where Mr. Wofford and Mr. Clinton both received unexpectedly strong support.
"Wofford caught a wave coming in," said Charles G. Kopp, a Philadelphia lawyer and prominent Republican fund-raiser. "He's liable to catch a wave going out."
For his part, Mr. Wofford seems to be dancing an uneasy minuet. He portrays himself as intellectually independent of the President, while continuing to link himself with the White House in other ways. In an interview, he said, "Bill Clinton was looking to me on health care when he was a candidate." In the next breath he added that the bills now under consideration were "fundamentally different" from what Mr. Clinton proposed and that "I'm one of those who helped shape the difference."
Mr. Wofford's staff has prepared a four-page, single-spaced list of "significant Wofford/Clinton policy differences." It includes the Senator's opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his support for the balanced budget amendment. It notes that Mr. Wofford "votes less often with Clinton than over half of the Democrats in the Senate." But Congressional Quarterly says he voted with the President 90 percent of the time in 1993.
When Hillary Rodham Clinton held a news conference last month in the Capitol, Mr. Wofford, who arrived late, dashed up behind her and nudged aside the diminutive Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota so that Mr. Wofford's own visage would appear with Mrs. Clinton's on the news.
He had also planned to attend a recent health care rally with Mr. Clinton in Greensburg, Pa. But since Mr. Wofford and Mr. Santorum have been dueling over who has been present for more votes in Congress, Mr. Wofford did not dare leave and miss a vote. (Congressional Quarterly reports that in 1993, Mr. Santorum was present for 93 percent of the 553 votes in the House; Mr. Wofford was present for 97 percent of the 395 votes in the Senate.) Mr. Wofford, who addressed the rally by speaker phone, did attend a $10,000-a-person fund-raising reception with the President that evening in Philadelphia.
 
Image Among Voters
 Indeed, David Wilhelm, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, calls Mr. Wofford's campaign a "great opportunity" to make the case for what he cited as the Clinton Administration's successes in job creation, deficit reduction, the beginning of national service and progress on health care.
But voters here have a rather vaporous impression of Mr. Wofford. None of those interviewed could pinpoint any activity beyond his admittedly sizable feat of putting health care on the map. At the farmers' market, Michael Aulenbach, a 30-year-old factory worker, said that the Senator "seems like someone who's trying to help people out," but that it was "hard to tell" what he had done.
Rose Anne Engle, who works in an industrial plating plant, said she would not support Mr. Wofford because "I can't believe that he won't go along with whatever Bill-the-President wants."
Most of those interviewed said their main concern about health care was that they were already losing benefits and were afraid they would lose more.
 
'He's Become Furniture'
 Whatever happens on health care, the perception that Mr. Wofford has not been his own man or made a discernable mark in Washington is shaping up as the central campaign issue.
"The real issue is Harris Wofford's failure to give himself an identity," said David Buffington, editor of a nonpartisan political newsletter in Harrisburg.
The Republicans are already pounding this theme. "He came to Washington in '91 with a tremendous amount of momentum and the potential to build on that, but he's frittered it away," said Gary Koops, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which expects to give Mr. Santorum the maximum $1.1 million that it is allowed. "He's become furniture in the U.S. Senate."
Paul Begala, the political consultant who, with his partner, James Carville, engineered Mr. Wofford's 1991 victory and who is working for Mr. Wofford again this year, acknowledges that the Senator has not made his case to voters. "He doesn't play the game of posturing particularly well," Mr. Begala said. "But that's what a campaign is for."
 
'Not a Big Lion'
 Seated in the back of his campaign van, Mr. Wofford, a former Bryn Mawr College president and co-founder of the Peace Corps, seemed surprised that anyone might be unaware of his activities in Washington. "I'm not a big lion in the seniority system," he said. "But am I Mr. Universal Health Care?"
In listing what he viewed as his accomplishments, Mr. Wofford said repeatedly that he was the first to dissuade the Administration from its support for requiring people to join health cooperatives to pay for their insurance. He said he was also instrumental in writing bills that would provide support for long-term care and home health care and would protect retirees.
It takes Mr. Begala to trumpet Mr. Wofford's achievements outside of health care. He said the Senator was the driving force behind the national service law, which will allow students to repay college loans with some form of community service. In addition, Mr. Begala said, Mr. Wofford was the author of a provision to allow a family to exempt their home from their worth when calculating student loans and sponsored a measure to make it easier for high school students not going to college to get vocational training.
Although pollsters say the economy, jobs and crime are more important to voters here than health care, the latter remains a defining issue for Mr. Wofford.
"Whatever Congress does will be very, very important in his election," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University. "If there is an employer mandate or loss of benefits, he might not do so well. But if they pass one of these more market-oriented plans that doesn't take decision-making away from people, he could be O.K. The fascinating thing is that no one quite knows how it will play."

HEADLINE: Police in Lagos Break Up Protest

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, July 26

 BODY:
The police fired tear gas and bullets into the air today to disperse protesters in Lagos after four weeks of a strike and protests over the arrest of an opposition leader.
Nigerian oil workers are on strike over the detention of Moshood K. O. Abiola, who is thought to have won a presidential election in June 1993 that was annulled. On the anniversary of the election, he declared himself President, and he was later arrested. 
 "We remain on strike," said a spokesman for Pengassan, the union that represents the white-collar oil workers. Other workers, including university lecturers, have threatened to join the strike within a week if the military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, does not yield to Mr. Abiola.
Many people were arrested in Lagos today, as clashes between policemen and demonstrators continued. Policemen and soldiers patrolled Tinubu Square, near the Central Bank, intermittently firing shots in the air.

 WASHINGTON, July 26 (AP) -- As he departed for Nigeria with a White House mission, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said today that the potential for bloodshed there is greater than in Rwanda. Mr. Jackson and his colleagues hope to meet with officials and influential Nigerians, including Moshood Abiola.
In an interview, Mr. Jackson said Mr. Abiola's detention, coupled with labor unrest and a plummeting economy, has brought on a crisis "that could be much bigger than the one in Rwanda."
The White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said Mr. Jackson would "convey the President's concern over the recent detention of prominent Nigerians."

ESCAPE FROM ABUSE, BUT NOT NEGLECT
When 5-year-old Adam was fatally beaten by his father, the boy's short life and brutal death became a national symbol of New York City's failure to protect children from abuse in their own homes. Adam's parents went to prison and his brothers were scattered to foster homes -- where, more than four years later, they remain. Advocates for children say the brothers' long stay in foster care is symptomatic of another problem: the child welfare system's failure to find stable, permanent homes for children once the abuse stops.

Bids Soar At Auction By F.C.C.

BYLINE: By TERESA RIORDAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
By the time the Federal Communications Commission's first auction of the public airwaves adjourned for the day today, bids had more than doubled from Monday's surprisingly steep opening round and were still climbing.
"It's a slugfest," said David H. Brock of Metrocall, a paging company in Alexandria, Va., that was not participating in the bidding. The sale covered 10 nationwide licenses, which are expected to be used for advanced two-way paging services. "From what I've seen so far, several companies must have budgeted $150 million, $200 million for this auction," Mr. Brock said. 
 Of the 29 bidders who registered, about half appeared to have dropped out by midday, and action in the Blue Room in the Omni Shoreham Hotel, which was teeming with bidders and observers, had dwindled to the major players and some hard-core stragglers. By day's end, a clearly exhausted array of bidders had pushed the combined total of high bids for the 10 licenses to $343 million.
 
Group of Big Bidders
 Most of the action seemed to focus on fewer than five big players, who were identified only by bidding identification numbers displayed on television monitors around the room. Two companies alone bid $50 million each for four of the 10 licenses being auctioned.
Late this year, a set of potentially more valuable licenses, for personal communications services, will go on the block. The yield for the Treasury had been estimated at $10 billion, but given the intense competition this time around, the figure could go much higher.
Industry executives said this round's heavyweight bidders probably included Paging Network, BellSouth, Mobilemedia Communications Inc., Airtouch Paging and McCaw Cellular. The auction will end only when each of the registered bidders has either dropped out or won one or more licenses, up to a limit of three.
Gamesmanship and psychological warfare have been in full evidence. BellSouth, McCaw and other big bidders planned their strategies from carefully guarded hotel rooms, each one filled with computers.
One of the biggest bidders -- suspected to be BellSouth -- had hung back and placed almost no bids until the final round of bidding had closed on Monday. Then it abruptly bid $30 million for each of three different licenses, and bumped two of those bids to $50 million today.
 
Crucial for Some
 Capturing at least one nationwide license that will allow for two-way paging is thought to be crucial for companies like Paging Network, the country's largest paging company. The company announced in April that it had teamed up with Motorola to establish a two-way paging service. Today's paging services offer one-way communications and are most often transmitted through regional broadcast spectrums.
Some minority businesses continued to complain publicly that the stiff bidding had shut them out. On three of the licenses for sale, companies owned by women and members of minority groups, and small businesses -- identified as "designated entities" by the communications commission -- have an advantage, in theory at least. On those licenses they have to pay only 75 percent of their bids.
"The show of muscle in the opening bid was designed to knock the designated entities out of the competition from the beginning," said Clarence O. Smith, president of Essence Communications Inc.
The National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters had warned the commission before the auction that a 25 percent bid credit was not sufficient, Mr. Smith said. "Apparently those comments were not taken seriously," he added.
Competing bidders not in the designated entities category had little sympathy for Mr. Smith's position.
"Twenty-five percent isn't enough of a break?" said Wayne Perry of McCaw Cellular, who has been a flamboyant presence in the bidding room. "Give me a break. McCaw started with nothing. We were a small company. We had to claw and scratch our way up."
Charlie E. Jackson, president of Airtouch Paging, said that "if 25 percent isn't enough for them, I'd be glad to take their credit."
But others involved in the auction suggested that Essence's public complaints might simply be part of the company's bidding strategy given that its shareholders, which include Bill Cosby and Johnson Publications, the publisher of Jet and Ebony magazines, are believed to have deep pockets of their own. Essence acknowledged it was still an active bidder after the 11th round on Tuesday.
"We're not paupers, but there's a difference between big money and superbig money," said Thomas A. Hart Jr., a telecommunications lawyer with the Washington firm of McManimon & Scotland who is representing Essence.
The idea of auctioning the public airwaves to the highest bidder was first proposed in the late 1950's by Ronald H. Coase, the economist and Nobel laureate. The Reagan Administration pushed the idea during the 1980's, but Democrats in Congress resisted. After the Clinton Administration embraced auctions as a way to fatten Federal coffers, Congress converted, voting last year to require auctions for most nonbroadcast licenses.

HEADLINE: Queens Residents Criticize Plan for an Airport Rail Link

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
A proposed $2.5 billion rail link between Manhattan and the two New York City airports -- the largest public transit project in 50 years -- drew sharp criticism yesterday from residents of several Queens neighborhoods that the automated line would traverse. Many said the system would damage their areas while benefiting only Manhattan residents.
"They're building this monster for business executives," said Patricia Dolan, president of a homeowners' association in Kew Gardens Hills, who spoke yesterday at the first public hearing on the project's environmental impact statement. "But the noise and shadows and the filth will be devastating to neighborhoods like mine." 
 Proponents of the system, which is scheduled to be in operation by the year 2003, said it was intended to solve a decades-old problem: the lack of adequate transportation to the city's busy airports. They said the principal benefit to the borough would be a large reduction in the number of cars on congested highways and side streets leading to La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports.
Edward J. O'Sullivan, the project director for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the rail line would eliminate 30,000 cars from the road each day, reducing traffic by 7.2 percent to Kennedy and 10.4 percent to La Guardia.
The system would cut air pollution in Queens, he said, and provide an economic boost to the area by making the airports more accessible.
As outlined in the 2,000-page impact statement, the rail line would begin on the East Side of Manhattan, probably at 59th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues. It would cross the East River on the outer roadway of the Queensboro Bridge, follow the Sunnyside Rail Yard and the Amtrak and Conrail tracks through Long Island City, and then go along the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway to La Guardia. It would then turn south along either the Grand Central or the Van Wyck Expressway to Jamaica Station, and continue south along the Van Wyck to Kennedy.
Using computerized, driverless trains similar to those at Disney World, the system would take 12 to 15 minutes to travel from Manhattan to La Guardia, according to the Port Authority, and 35 to 40 minutes to get to Kennedy. Each train would hold about 35 or 40 people, and the trains would be spaced 5 to 10 minutes apart at peak periods.
The prospect of reduced traffic congestion, however, did little to assuage many of the 75 people who showed up at yesterday's hearing in Queens Borough Hall before officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that prepared the impact statement. Residents who live alongside the proposed line said the noise and the sight of the train -- which would be elevated over roadways along some stretches -- would damage their neighborhoods while giving them no transit benefits.
Joan Vera DaCorta, president of the Astoria Heights Homeowners and Tenants Association, which represents people living just west of La Guardia, said her group voted unanimously to oppose the plan. The missing cars on the highways, she predicted, would immediately be replaced by other drivers, not bound for the airports, who would then find the routes more attractive.
Francis McDonald, an aide to the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who represents the Astoria area, said that if the line were built, it would have to be heavily landscaped and prevented from having any visual or aural effects on surrounding neighborhoods.
"Queens County can benefit from a reduction of auto traffic, but we in the county must suffer the pain of construction and even give up an access lane on the free bridge to Manhattan," she said.
Several transit advocates who spoke at the hearing said the Port Authority was taking the wrong approach by building an "exotic" rail system instead of simply extending the existing subway and commuter rail system to the airports. Stephen Dubrow, president of the Committee for Better Transit, said the authority was spending a huge amount of public money for the single purpose of getting people to the airport. Better, he said, to integrate airport rail into the existing transit system so that all riders can benefit.
Mr. O'Sullivan responded that the system is being financed by a $3 fee paid by departing passengers at the three regional airports and collected by the F.A.A. By law, he said, that money can be used only for airport passengers, visitors and employees, and not for a general expansion of the local rail system. He added that the airports contribute an estimated $25 billion to the local economy, and deserve a dedicated system that allows easy access.
The draft environmental impact statement, completed last month, says the environmental consequences of the system "are relatively minor or may be mitigated to levels that are not significant." Though the rail line would have a visual impact on areas like Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the statement says, it would not affect the use of the park.

HEADLINE: Quoting Bible and Koran, Two Old Foes Pledge Peace

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
With words filled with emotion and history, King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel brought their message of reconciliation to Capitol Hill this morning, reaffirming before Congress their commitment to make peace in the Middle East.
"Mr. Speaker, the state of war between Israel and Jordan is over," King Hussein announced to a minute-long standing ovation in the Capitol. 
 Mr. Rabin echoed the King's remarks, telling Congress, "If my people did not desire peace so strongly, I would not be standing here today."
Their appearance -- the first time that two world leaders have addressed a joint meeting of Congress -- so moved lawmakers of both parties that Representative Bob Michel, the Republican leader, removed his eyeglasses several times to wipe away the tears, and Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat, couldn't put her white handkerchief away.
 
Smiles and Grins
 Facing the Congress, the Cabinet and the diplomatic corps, King Hussein smiled throughout the nearly hourlong meeting; the normally dour Mr. Rabin flashed broad grins in the direction of the King.
When their speeches were over, the two men met for a hearfelt handshake, but not quite an embrace, to cheers and cries of "Bravo!" from the audience.
"I daresay that the two speeches we heard today were the most moving, dramatic and historic speeches that any of us have ever heard," Representative Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, said. The Senate minority leader, Robert Dole, was also overcome by the history of the moment, saying, "I've been around here for a while and I can't remember a day like today."
At a luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, King Hussein said the past two days "have had a dreamlike quality" for him. He called the declaration signed with Mr. Rabin at the White House on Monday to end the nearly half-century state of war between Israel and Jordan "the crowning achievement of all my years."
 
Condemns Terrorist Attacks
 But at a news conference at the White House later, the King and the Prime Minister reminded their audience of the minefields standing in the path of peace in their region and strongly condemned recent terrorist acts against Jewish targets in Buenos Aires and London. When Mr. Rabin said that Iran and Syria could stop terrorist acts against Israel if they wanted to, neither President Clinton nor the King contradicted him.
For the King, today was in a sense a final forgiveness for his tacit support of Iraq's 1990 invasion and occupation of Kuwait and his opposition to the American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf war.
The appearance by the King and Mr. Rabin before Congress brought the two men before the body most able to help implement their peace with economic aid.
King Hussein in particular appealed for the help of Congress. "I have come before you today to demonstrate that we are ready to open a new era in our relations with Israel," the King said. "With the help and cooperation of this august body the peace we all want can be achieved."
 
$700 Million Response
 The warm response from American lawmakers to King Hussein also set the stage for Congress to respond positively to Mr. Clinton's pledge to forgive Jordan's $700 million debt with the United States and to help the country modernize its military.
Congress cut off aid to Jordan in March 1991 because of the King's support for Iraq during the gulf war and later blocked President Bush from releasing some military aid because of Jordan's blatant violations of the United Nations-ordered economic embargo against Iraq. Mr. Clinton later released all of the remaining aid, citing Jordan's cooperation in Middle East peace talks and American national security interests.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, White House chief of staff Leon Panetta and other senior officials have begun to work with Congress on a plan to pay off Jordan's debt over three years, senior Administration and Jordanian officials said today.
Despite the fact that this year's budget is nearly completed, the Administration told Congress today that it will seek to forgive $193 million in Jordan's debt in a pending appropriations bill, the officials added. The Administration will also seek Congressional approval for providing Jordan with still-unspecified American military equipment.
 
Different Agendas
 The warmth between the two leaders in the appearance on Capitol Hill did not disguise their different perceptions of history and the divergence of their political goals.
"For our part, we will never forget Palestine," said King Hussein, whose Hashemite Kingdom controlled the West Bank and East Jerusalem until the Israeli victory in the 1967 Middle East war, and whose "special role" in administering the Muslim holy places in Jerusalem was reaffirmed in the Washington declaration. The King said that only God could exercise sovereignty over the Muslim, Christian and Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem. He was not applauded when he made those remarks.
For his part, Mr. Rabin stressed the suffering and bloodshed of the past, reminding his audience that Jerusalem is "the heart of the Jewish people."
Mr. Rabin, who led a brigade in the defense of Jerusalem in 1948 and was chief of staff of the Israeli Army in the 1967 war that brought the West Bank and East Jerusalem under Israeli control, was given a standing ovation when he said: "I, who sent regiments into the fire and soldiers to their deaths, I say to you, Your Majesty, the King of Jordan, and I say to you, American friends, today we are embarking on a battle which has no blood and no anguish. This is the only battle which is a pleasure to wage: the battle for peace."
 
Blessings and Exhortations
 Mr. Rabin donned a yarmulke, the Jewish prayer cap, and intoned the ancient Hebrew blessing to "our Lord who has preserved us and sustained us and enabled us to reach this time."
King Hussein reached into the Koran for inspiration, quoting the verse, "Then if they should be inclined to make peace, do thou incline toward it also, and put thy trust in Allah. Surely, it is He who is all-hearing, all-knowing."
Throughout their appearance, Mr. Rabin was both exhilarated and uncomfortable with the prolonged burst of applause and the standing ovations, at times gesturing to King Hussein that they should sit down. But King Hussein reveled in the adulation. And when the two men left the dais, they mingled among American lawmakers, who reached out to shake their hands.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Co. Profit Up 53% As Ad Volume Increases

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it earned $34.3 million in the second quarter, up 53.2 percent from profits of $22.4 million a year earlier. Most of the increased profit resulted from increases in advertising and circulation revenue at The New York Times and the company's regional newspaper group, as well as improvements in its magazine and broadcasting groups, the company said.
Total revenues for the company rose 31.4 percent, to $635.5 million, from $483.6 million, mainly because of the inclusion of The Boston Globe, which was acquired last October. 
 Because of additional shares issued to acquire The Globe, earnings per share increased only 14.3 percent, to 32 cents, from 28 cents.
 
 
Slight Circulation Declines
 Advertising volume in the most recent quarter was higher than the levels a year earlier at The Times, The Boston Globe and the company's 28 regional newspapers. Circulation declined slightly at The Times and the regional papers, but was offset by higher prices. The Globe reported a slight increase in daily circulation and a small decline for Sundays.
Eric S. Philo, a media analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the 4.5 percent increase in advertising volume at The New York Times was a sign of "the grudging recovery of the New York economy."
The earnings announcement had little impact on Times Company stock, which closed yesterday at $23.50 on the American Stock Exchange, down 25 cents, and well below its 1994 high of $28.50. The company said that since June 1993, it had spent nearly $305 million to buy 12.2 million of its shares in the open market.
The company does not disclose profit levels for individual newspapers, but analysts noted that The Globe's contribution to net income had been overshadowed by a $6.5 million write-off of good will every quarter since the Times Company bought The Globe.
But excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, the presence of The Globe was a primary reason for the 44 percent rise in the company's operating profits, to $112.2 million, from $78 million a year earlier. For the last six months, operating profits totaled $194.2 million, up 41 percent from $137.3 million for the period in 1993.
Among the divisions of The New York Times Company, the magazine group earned an operating profit of $10 million in the second quarter, more than double the $4.9 million of a year earlier, as revenues increased 4.4 percent, to $108.9 million. The increase in profits was a result primarily of higher advertising revenues at Family Circle and timing of certain costs for the women's magazines.
The second-quarter figures did not include the profit from the recently announced sale of the women's magazine division to Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing for $275 million, plus the assumption by the German company of $50 million of Times Company debts. The after-tax profit of that sale, which was completed yesterday, was estimated by the company at $1.10 to $1.20 a share and will be included in third-quarter earnings.
Higher advertising revenues in the broadcast division led to a 35.1 percent increase in operating profits to $7.7 million for the second quarter for the broadcasting/information services group.
Mr. Philo noted that the acquisition of The Globe had not been followed by much cost cutting, but added, "That was not the primary reason for the acquisition." In a research report issued last month, he said the Times Company was financially healthy enough, despite the expense of a new printing plant, to be "in a position to make a significant acquisition."

HEADLINE: One Top College's Price Tag: Why So Low, and So High?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SWARTHMORE, Pa.

 BODY:
The faculty, with one professor for every eight students, offers unparalleled access to eager young scholars. The research facilities include everything from a 24-inch refracting telescope to a library with three-quarters of a million volumes. And when collegians need a break, there is always the option of a game of squash or a stroll around the 325 lushly planted acres.
Swarthmore is one of a handful of colleges that offer a superb liberal arts curriculum to a bright and diverse student body. "It's the Lexus of higher education," William Spock, Swarthmore's vice president for finance, says with pride. 
 But excellence comes at a stiff price: roughly $40,000 annually per student, as Swarthmore calculates costs. In the month families must write checks for their share of that awesome sum -- $25,900 for full tuition, room and board -- educators and economists are again wondering whether such elite colleges are pricing themselves into extinction. Even Swarthmore, with its enormous endowment and generous alumni, may some day be vulnerable.
A detailed analysis of Swarthmore's expenditures and income suggests that this college, like other elite colleges and universities, is treading a dangerously fine line between spending enough to keep itself competitive and spending so much that it may price itself out of the market for highly qualified students.
"I am not sanguine that enough Americans will have the cash and the dedication to pay" for this sort of education, said Morton Owen Schapiro, the dean of the University of Southern California's College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
As they write their steep tuition checks, many families may wonder what they are paying for. Where does the money go? And where does the $40,000-plus per student come from to cover a Swarthmore education, since that figure far exceeds tuition? Swarthmore offered The New York Times an inside look at what makes the college tick financially.
Swarthmore's tuition, room and board is about $10,000 more than the typical private, four-year college and just below the perennial leaders including Yale, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But that is the "list price," not the average charged to students.
 
'Need-Blind' Admissions
 Swarthmore is one of the last colleges to remain "need-blind" -- admitting students without reference to need -- offering scholarships (economists would call them discounts) averaging about half the $25,900 fee to about half of its 1,300 students. So families will pay, on average, $18,000 from their own pockets -- or from the proceeds of Government loans and grants made directly to students.
Most of the rest of the $40,000-plus, more than half the total cost of a Swarthmore education, comes from affluent alumni. The college's biggest single source of cash, after student fees, is income from its endowment, accumulated from gifts over the decades. After subtracting debts, Swarthmore's financial wealth is roughly $400 million, which puts it eighth nationally when calculated per student.
While the endowment funds have earned 11 percent annually over the last 20 years, the college draws considerably less, so that it can sustain the purchasing power of its nest egg. Thus roughly $13,000 per student will be available from the endowment.
If this year is like the previous two, gifts from alumni and parents to cover current expenses will probably total $10,000 per student -- a figure that puts Swarthmore well above Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth. Direct government aid to the college (as opposed to tax breaks linked to the college's nonprofit status) will round out the total, yielding just under $2,000 per student.
All told, then, the college will have a bit more than $42,000 to spend per student, a comfortable margin over its current costs but more than the average American family's income. On what can Swarthmore be spending that much -- and considerably more, when the cost of the capital sunk into buildings and land is included?
In 1992-93, the most recent year for which figures are available, some $10,000 per student went to cover faculty salaries and benefits. Swarthmore pays well -- $70,000 on average for a full professor, $40,000 for an assistant professor -- putting it in the top 5 percent of colleges surveyed by the American Association of University Professors. But the figure was barely satisfactory by Swarthmore's own benchmark, an index of salaries at elite small colleges ranging from Amherst to Wesleyan.
 
The Cash Outlay
 "Academic support" and "general institutional support" -- everything from computers to secretaries' salaries -- ate up $9,000 per student. Maintenance and additions to the physical plant came to $7,000 per student, while "student services" -- food, recreation -- consumed almost $4,000. When a few other categories are added, the cash spent came to $37,633 per student.
That is a lot of money, but still a serious underestimate of the true cost of a Swarthmore education. It omits the value of services from the college's investment in its physical plant, a sin the Securities and Exchange Commission would not forgive if General Motors omitted from the costs of a car today the cost of assembly lines built in the past.
A conservative reckoning puts the cost of rebuilding Swarthmore from scratch at more than $300 million, not including the purchase of the choice suburban acreage where it now stands. Thus if the college could rent out the property at a return equal to what it expects to earn from its portfolio of securities, it would have an additional $10,000 per student.
This implied total cost of a Swarthmore education, more than $47,000 in 1992-93 and surely over $50,000 in the coming year, is astronomical compared to most colleges but consonant with the ones that aspire to academic heights. Indeed, extrapolating from calculations made by Gordon Winston, an economist at Williams College in Massachusetts, the figure is comparable for his own institution.
Is it necessary to spend $40,000 a year in cash and consume $10,000 worth of capital resources to provide a Swarthmore-quality education?
Many economists are skeptical that any business-like entity can operate efficiently in a market where "output" is hard to measure and "consumers" rely on the generosity of strangers to cover half the product's cost. In a 1991 interview Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate, allowed that he had "no doubt whatsoever that it would be possible to make money on half the tuition charged by the Ivy League schools."
 
Two Options for Savings
 Economists are also inclined to be wary of the incentives of leaders in a "business" that eschews the label. Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School, suggests that since administrators at colleges like Swarthmore personally have little to gain and much to lose from cutting costs or radically redesigning the product, they are "deeply reluctant to test the system."
But the view from the trenches -- though very comfortable trenches -- is quite different. Robinson Hollister, an economist and member of Swarthmore's executive planning committee, says there are only two ways for the college to save large sums without sacrificing faculty quality.
One would be to raise the number of students per teacher by eliminating less popular departments and by halting the accretion of new courses.
Swarthmore already allows students to take courses at nearby Haverford and Bryn Mawr -- Japanese, for example -- that it does not offer, and now need not offer, on its own campus. But the college consciously swims against the tide by supporting out-of-fashion disciplines, like religion. And it is unwilling to increase minimum class sizes or ignore relatively new fields like Asian studies. "Knowledge expands," explained Mark Kuperberg, a member of the economics department.
The other cost-saver, Mr. Hollister suggests, would be to cut back on need-based aid. With 10 applicants for every opening in the freshman class, Swarthmore could probably reduce the average discount offered on tuition with only modest reductions in students' qualifications. But that is one price the college is loath to pay, said Jennie Keith, the provost. "Need-blind admission," she said, "is vital to the college's sense of itself."
But this is not the whole story. From 1980 to 1990 Swarthmore cash outlays per student nearly doubled, even after accounting for inflation. Some of the increase can be attributed to what economists call "Baumol's disease," the observation by William Baumol of New York University that productivity gains in service industries like education tend to lag behind those in manufacturing. Some is related to investments in making the academic product better -- lab facilities, new courses and the like.
But part of the increase covered the cost of fund raising and marketing. Still more was linked to improved amenities like sports facilities, an intercultural center, staffing for the new $14 million theater complex and comfortable student lounges. Last year each student received a separate telephone line, with voice mail.
 
Pressures of the Market
 Mr. Spock argues, however, that these outlays were driven by market forces that cannot safely be ignored. Swarthmore, he said, must show its best face to prospective students to maintain its share of top-flight undergraduates whose families can pay the bills. Michael S. McPherson, an economist at Williams, echoed that point. Colleges produce a unique product, he said, in that "a primary input is the quality of its customers."
Swarthmore's administrators know the risks in upscale marketing: As tuition rises, the numbers of first-rate students who can pay list price fall, potentially forcing the college to lower admissions standards. But they have cut the rate of growth of spending, and they are reasonably confident that they can hold future increases in student charges to the rate of growth of average family incomes without compromising educational standards. The expectation is that this will keep the college attractive enough to sustain demand.
The administrators may be right. Since most of Swarthmore's costs are for white-collar salaries, one would expect those costs to more or less track the incomes of the high-income white-collar families who currently pay full price when they enroll their children at Swarthmore. But economists still worry that rocky times lie ahead for many, if not all, high-priced liberal arts institutions. Dramatic curriculum cutbacks, announced just last month by Bennington College in Vermont, feed the conviction that no college is invulnerable.
One concern, said Mr. White of New York University, is that "excess capacity" among colleges with lesser reputations will cause a "ripple effect," reducing the number of gifted students willing and able to pay $25,000-plus tuition. In the last decade the market has segmented; demand for places at the highest ranked colleges increased even as second- and third-tier colleges were unable to fill classes with qualified students. But no law of economics, he argues, guarantees that these trends will hold.
David Breneman, an economist at Harvard's School of Education, fears that competition will force colleges to offer discounts to attract the most desirable students. Swarthmore already gives merit scholarships to bag the occasional music prodigy or star soccer player. But most aid is rigidly linked to need. And now that the Justice Department has frowned on the long-standing practice of collusion among elite colleges in determining need-based discounts, there is a good chance bidding wars will break out.
Yet another concern is that politicians will react to tight budgets and taxpayer resentment by questioning elite colleges' exemption from property and income taxes, as well as the tax deductibility of gifts. Private colleges think they already are slighted because they educate thousands of students who would otherwise be a burden to state universities. But Mr. White wonders whether government will continue to accept an "open-ended obligation to subsidize $50,000-a-year education."

GRAPHIC: Graphs: In 1992-93, Swarthmore College says it spent an average of $37,600 on each student. If student aid (discounted tuition) is added in, this figure would be well over $40,000. Here's where the money went.
 
$37,600 per student
 
Faculty salaries and benefits -- $10,000
Academic and general institutional support -- $9,000
Maintenance and additions to the physical plant -- $7,000
Food, recreation -- $4,000
Miscellaneous -- 7,600
 
"LEDGER: The Cost of a Swarthmore College Education"
 Swarthmore College estimates that in 1994 the cost of educating one sutdent for one year exceeded $40,000. The college also says it spends more money on each student than it recieves. Graphs, which run from 1970 to 1993, track where financial resources have come from and where they have gone. The figures shown are based on the college's estimates of the cost of educating a student each year, in 1993 dollars. (Source: Swarthmore College) (pg. A19)

HEADLINE: French Premier to Visit Africa To Show Continued Commitment

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 26

 BODY:
With France confident that Rwanda's refugee crisis justified its military intervention there last month, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur leaves for Africa Wednesday on a trip aimed at underlining to its former African colonies that France remains their best friend in the West.
French Government officials said Mr. Balladur's visit to Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Gabon was not prompted by the Rwandan tragedy. They said that the Governments of all three "understood" France's reasons for sending 2,500 soldiers to protect refugees fleeing Rwanda's civil war. 
 Until the refugee crisis, France was on the defensive, forced to deny that it intervened to help its former allies in the now-ousted Hutu-led Government. But when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans fled into Zaire, France was the only Western power with forces in place to aid them.
Now, having pledged to withdraw its forces from Rwanda by Aug. 21, the French Government is taking undisguised satisfaction from the fact that both the United Nations and the United States have appealed to Paris not to pull out its troops until they are replaced by United Nations soldiers.
France is no less eager to remind its former colonies that, more than any other major power, France is still ready to invest politically and economically in Africa's future.
There are nonetheless signs that Mr. Balladur's conservative Government is changing the focus of a policy that traditionally involved a combination of economic paternalism and support for local dictators whose main attributes were loyalty to France's top politicians.
In 1990, in a summit meeting with African leaders, President Francois Mitterrand signaled that, with the end of the cold war, one-party African countries were expected to start moving toward democracy. The results of that new policy have been mixed, with some African countries holding free elections, but others remaining under army-backed one-man rule.
Since Mr. Balladur took office in March 1993, France has also begun arguing that its former colonies can only achieve stability if they put their economies in order, by eliminating official corruption and stimulating exports and the creation of jobs.

HEADLINE: Investors Rush to Join Suits Over Derivatives

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA 

 BODY:
Investors will continue to join class-action lawsuits over the recently self-destructing financial instruments known as derivatives and "exotic" securities, lawyers are saying.
First there was a rash of suits against mutual funds, brokerage firms and others that were said to have made bad judgments in buying complex, financially engineered products without making investors aware of the risk. Now, lawyers say, because of continued publicity about problems with derivatives, their phones are still ringing, as investors seek to join the "classes" of investors who contend harm was done to them in risky securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations. 
 Paine Webber said last week that it would spend an additional $180 million to bail out a mutual fund that was devastated by holdings in exotic mortgage securities known as "kitchen sink" bonds. The news, in the wake of an earlier announcement by Paine Webber that it would reimburse customers for some losses in the same fund, is leading more investors to consider suing, lawyers say.
 
Companies Unsure of Liabilities
 With investors continuing to discover that they may have a case against a company or a financial institution, companies are left without a handle on their ultimate liabilities. A rise in interest rates earlier this year made a lot of the complicated investments go sour.
"I think you're going to see a lot more suits," said Steve Berman, a lawyer at the Seattle firm of Hagens & Berman.
In New York, Mel Weiss of Milberg, Weiss said: "Lots of people have been contacting my firm -- and I'm sure others -- claiming that the mutual funds they invested in were not supposed to be taking the kinds of risks we now know they were taking."
The rush to sue goes beyond mutual fund companies that marketed "safe" short-term funds without emphasizing that those funds owned volatile securities, although several such big cases exist. Paine Webber Group Inc., Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund, and Piper Jaffray have all been the targets of class-action suits related to poor performance earlier this year by mutual funds that held derivative and "exotic" securities.
 
Brokerage Managers Named
 In addition, investors have cited managements of brokerage firms that sold them risky mortgage securities typically reserved for sophisticated institutional investors, and publicly held companies that have lost money in derivatives. The General Electric Company's Kidder, Peabody unit was hit with a class-action suit in late May, as a result of the scandal in which a top trader was said to have executed billions in phony government bond trades.
And Salomon Brothers, the brokerage unit of Salomon Inc., has already received arbitration complaints from 10 investors who say they should not have been sold highly risky collateralized mortgage obligations in which they lost millions of dollars this spring -- and potentially millions more because Salomon told them they must ante up "margin calls" of three times the amount of their initial multimillion dollar investments.
David Guin, a lawyer at Ritchie & Rediken in Birmingham, Ala., said he had heard from several individual investors and small banks in recent weeks. They were sold collateralized mortgage obligations and now claim not to have understood the risks. The individuals who have called him "are not the kind of people who read the business pages every day," he said.
Lawyers say that the companies most vulnerable are those that were less than forthcoming in disclosing their risky securities in the documents they filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"To tell about derivatives on page 33 of a mutual fund prospectus is not enough," said Sam Schwartz of Bezar & Martin. "Generally investors don't read the prospectus in great detail. Page 1 is generally enough, and they're falling asleep; they hardly ever get to page 33."
Similarly, publicly held companies that have been less than forthcoming about their risky securities positions are also vulnerable to suits, Mr. Berman said. "A meritorious suit would be one in which the company hadn't said much about having made the derivative investments," he said.
And then, added Raymond Peffer, who is representing investors in one of the arbitrations against Salomon, there is the issue of whether the investors had been given the documents. "My clients didn't get the prospectus," he said. "But even if they did, it would have been difficult even for a sophisticated investor to evaluate the risk."

HEADLINE: Low Profits Push Dow Down 6.16

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders, having spent much of the year worrying about an inflation that has yet to appear, had a more immediate concern yesterday: souring corporate earnings.
It also did not help the market that bond prices fell and that the dollar declined against most leading currencies. 
 The damage was modest but noticeable because of the stocks involved. Stocks fell after Chevron and Eastman Kodak reported disappointing earnings and Boeing, among the leading American exporters for the last several years, reported poor profits and also warned of lower sales in the second half.
Chevron opened sharply lower, after a delay of nearly a half-hour. The company said second-quarter profits from continuing operations fell 54 percent. Eastman Kodak's earnings were hurt by failed currency-hedging strategies and weak demand for office equipment. Kodak's continuing profit fell 16 percent. Boeing's second-quarter net fell 43 percent as the recession in the aviation industry continued.
 
Components of the Dow
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.16 points, to 3,735.68, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.89 point, to 453.36. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 1.22 points, to 715.66.
Chevron, Kodak and Boeing are all component stocks of the Dow industrial average and the S.& P. 500 index, dragging down those indexes when their shares prices dropped. Kodak fell 1 5/8, to 47 7/8; Boeing fell 7/8, to 45 1/8, and Chevron dropped 3/4, to 43.
Many other stocks fell. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing stocks lagged behind the number of declining stocks, 935 to 1,165.
On average, however, many traders may still be on the sidelines. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal with 231.1 million shares changing hands, or 20 percent below this year's average of 289 million shares.
Blue chips like Texaco and United Technologies, conglomerates like General Electric and military contractors like Rockwell International, as well as over-the-counter stocks like Microsoft and MCI Communications all declined.
Long-term interest rates rose, perhaps because bond traders are awaiting more than $68 billion in new securities to be sold at auction over the next three weeks. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.54 percent from 7.52 percent. Bond yields rise and prices fall when traders perceive existing bonds as riskier than future bonds.
 
Dollar vs. Yen
 The dollar fell against the yen as currency traders bet that the United States and Japan would not succeed in trade talks scheduled to end next Monday. The dollar fell to 98.30 yen from 98.60 yen.
Commodity prices continued to fall, signaling a more stable inflation outlook. The closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities was largely unchanged, continuing a two-week trend. It fell 0.26 point, to 232.52, led by falling futures contract prices for such economically important raw materials as copper, lumber and crude oil.

Bonds Fall As Traders Absorb Notes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday as traders absorbed the Treasury's sale of $17.3 billion in two-year notes.
"The market's going to have to show me more of a concession before I step in and buy," said Fred Leiner, a market strategist at Continental Bank. 
 Earlier in the day, traders tried to drum up demand for the two-year notes by raising yields through the sale of seasoned securities. At the auction, demand for the new notes was stronger than expected. The average yield at the auction was 6.17 percent, the highest in almost three years and a basis point lower than anticipated. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.54 percent, from 7.52 percent on Monday. The long bond's yield was 6.30 percent before the Federal Reserve began pushing up short-term interest rates in February.
Demand for all Treasury securities dropped this week amid anticipation of as much as $68 billion in new securities in the next three weeks, investors said.
 
Main Issue in the Market
 "The main issue in the market now is supply," said Dennis Bushe, managing director at Prudential Investment Advisers, which has about $12 billion in fixed-income securities.
Besides yesterday' s sale of two-year notes, the Treasury will sell $11 billion in five-year notes today and is selling $40.25 billion in 3- , 10- and 30-year bonds in the second week of August in its biannual refunding.
"Until you get through the glut," of Treasury auctions, said Robert G. Smith 3d, "yields are probably going to hang out around this level." Mr. Smith manages $1.25 billion in bonds at the Smith Affiliated Capital Corporation of New York.
Some investors are also reluctant to buy Government securities until the Fed raises interest rates for the fifth time this year, as many analysts expect.
 
Efforts to Dampen Inflation
 The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said last week that it was an "open question" whether four previous rate increases were enough to dampen inflation.
The Fed is likely to raise rates by 50 basis points between now and the end of September, said Henry Kaufman, the head of Henry Kaufman & Company, which manages $750 million in fixed-income assets. Higher rates may "have a negative effect on the fixed-income markets" if the economy doesn't slow, he said.
Raising rates amid a big jump in the amount of new securities would hurt investors. "It would not be a pleasant thing for the Fed to turn around right after the auctions and raise interest rates," Mr. Bushe of Prudential said.
Buying notes at current yields could also be a dicey investment if Friday's report on economic growth last quarter shows a more robust expansion than expected, analysts said.
Economists surveyed said that the gross domestic product expanded at a 3.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter, up from the 3.4 percent rate of the first quarter.
Some investors, however, said the Fed would probably not raise rates soon. The economy is already slowing because "higher rates are having an impact," said Ken Windheim at Strategic Fixed Investment in Roslyn, Va., which has $2.3 billion in fixed-income assets. "If they raise rates at any point here, I think it would be pretty hard to justify," he said.
Nonetheless, the bond market's fall earlier this year points to a better future, said Robert DiClemente, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers. "The market has already built in insurance against inflation," Mr. DiClemente said. "It doesn't need to sell off twice" because of an inflation scare.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of two-year notes:

High Yield . . . 6.17%

HEADLINE: Expense Account Heyday Over, Companies Demand Cheap Fares

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Many American companies, eager to cut costs, are rebelling against the airlines' 16-year-old policy of making business travelers pay higher fares than leisure travelers. These companies are finding ways for their traveling employees to save money, even if that sometimes means inconveniencing them. They are also driving harder bargains with the airlines.
Apple Computer Inc., for instance, has set up a network that provides employees, working on computers, options for planning their trips, including information about the potential savings from discounts the company has negotiated with airlines. 
 The company's department heads then evaluate employees on how often they use those discounts compared with their fellow employees. In the first five months of this year, Apple spent 25 percent less on travel than in the corresponding period last year, even though its employees took 14 percent more trips.
The Boeing Company keeps for its own use the frequent-flier miles its employees earn on business trips. The Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies is more generous. Last year it began offering to pay its workers to use their frequent-flier mileage for business trips, giving them $300 for a trip that would have cost the company $600 or more.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up also encourages its traveling employees to stay over on a Saturday night, so they can take advantage of discount fares requiring a weekend stay. But to ease the strain of cutting into weekends, the company encourages its employees to take their spouses with them and picks up the tab.
Companies are also pushing the airlines for better deals. Corporate travel managers have increasingly entered negotiations with detailed information on employee travel patterns, showing just how much business their companies give the airlines. With such evidence, they have been able to wring sizable discounts from the airlines, which in turn have been more vigilant in insuring that companies deliver the number of passengers they promised.
In an attempt to increase their bargaining power, 17 companies, including General Motors and Merck, announced their support last month for a fledgling venture that plans to negotiate with the airlines for lower fares in exchange for sacrificing frequent-flier miles and eliminating commissions to travel agents.
The new aggressiveness by businesses could become a nightmare for the airlines, which have been plagued by losses and are hoping for increased revenue from business passengers as the economy recovers. Many analysts say business travelers may no longer be the customers they were in the days when they traveled with little regard for cost.
 
Pledges of Frugality
 Indeed, many corporate travel managers say that despite the moderately improving economy, they are more determined than ever to squeeze costs out of travel budgets.
The Georgia Pacific Corporation, for example, recently told its employees to avoid Delta Air Lines when possible because Georgia Pacific believed it was not getting a large enough volume discount for a company its size. Georgia Pacific, which has about 50,000 employees, has also chartered buses occasionally to drive groups of employees to meetings up to 300 miles away.
Conrail Inc. has cut its budget for air travel by 5 percent every year since 1990, and plans to cut 5 percent more this year and next. To help reach that target, the railroad, based in Philadelphia, has installed video-conference rooms in 12 locations, part of an industrywide network of video-conference sites set up by the Association of American Railroads to help member companies avoid having to fly employees to regular meetings.
"We don't ever expect to go back to the level of travel of a couple of years ago," said Michael W. Kabo, Conrail's director of administrative services.
The new frugality is not only affecting air travel. Many companies have told their employees to stay at less expensive accommodations like the budget hotels of Red Roof Inns or the "upper economy" lodging offered by La Quinta Inns. John Kaegi, senior vice president of marketing for La Quinta, which has 220 hotels, said the number of national contracts the company has with medium-sized and large companies had risen to more than 450, from about 80 two years ago.
To be sure, many companies have decided to send their employees on more trips as the business outlook brightens. "You can't fax a handshake" is a popular saying at Boeing.
And some industry analysts say that in keeping with history, more corporate purse strings will be loosened as profits improve. "There is definitely more of a cyclical element to this," Paul Karos, an airline analyst for CS First Boston, said.
But when employees travel, they are often traveling more inexpensively. American Express Travel Related Services, which has hundreds of large corporate clients, said that while the average number of trips its clients booked rose 10 percent from January 1993 to May of this year, the average fare paid by business travelers dropped more than 15 percent. Changing travel policies and more diligent use of negotiated discounts with airlines accounted for most of the decline; less than half the drop was attributable to lower fares.
Tenneco Inc., an industrial company in Houston, is a good example of the trend. It issued 11 percent more tickets to its employees in the latest 12 months than in the previous corresponding period. But after consolidating its six travel offices into a single office last year, giving Tenneco more leverage in negotiating air-fare discounts, the average price of each ticket dropped 14 percent.
The airline industry is worried.
"Clearly, it's a threat," said David A. Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group in Washington. "Business travel has always been the backbone of air travel, and if we suddenly find that there is a big change in that part of our market, the airlines will have a hard time in the short term coming to grips with that."
 
Making Changes
 Airlines are trying to lower their costs so they can profitably offer the low fares that business and leisure travelers demand. Continental Airlines has bet that by drastically lowering fares and simplifying its fare structure to charge everyone the same fare on many routes, it can fill its planes and more than offset the drop in fares with extra passengers.
The cost-cutting efforts by companies underscore the gamesmanship that characterizes the relationship between the airlines and their passengers. Before deregulation in 1978, fares were based on mileage, and most people aboard a flight had paid the same fare.
Then airlines started using computers to develop complex fare structures that charged what the market would bear, meaning business travelers paid much higher fares than leisure travelers.
Companies tolerated the high fares when the economy was strong. But the recent recession prodded many companies to scrutinize their travel budgets, typically the third-largest controllable expense after salaries and data processing.
 
Applying Technology
 Corporate travel management evolved into a science, and technologically sophisticated travel agencies found their services in demand, as did auditing firms that checked the work of those agencies.
Now, many companies want to eliminate such layers of complexity, believing they add unnecessary costs. That is the point of the new venture endorsed last month by more than a dozen large companies. Called the Business Travel Contractors Corporation, it plans to negotiate with individual airlines -- pending review by the Justice Department -- for a new fare system that would exclude the cost of travel agency commissions and frequent-flier programs.
The airlines, which have said they will not respond until they see a specific proposal for the venture, say that frequent-flier mileage represents only a small additional cost.
Earlier this year, the International Business Machines Corporation approached airlines with the suggestion of sacrificing frequent-flier mileage for its employees in exchange for lower fares. The airlines said no.
Even though requests for such drastic departures from the norm have a questionable future, many companies have made minor changes that chip away at the status quo.
 
Revising Commissions
 The Hewlett-Packard Company, for example, pays a flat fee to its travel agencies, but takes the commissions the airlines pay the agencies. The company says the policy eliminates the conflict of interest that arises from agencies earning more on higher-priced tickets, even though clients want the cheapest fares.
Hewlett-Packard, an electronics company, has also cut the percentage of tickets to Europe booked on business class rather than coach class to about 25 percent, from 85 percent four years ago. And the company has started encouraging employees to take advantage of discounts for Saturday-night layovers. Even though employees are not required to take the discounted trips, the use of the excursion fares has grown 50 percent at Hewlett-Packard in the last year.
"There has been a sea change, especially in travelers' minds," said Fred Swaffer, corporate travel manager for Hewlett-Packard. "They are looking for ways to cut costs, and that has a much broader impact than anything I can do. It has changed the way they behave, and it's not going to swing back."

HEADLINE: Consumers' Confidence Fell, Conference Board Reports

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Consumers' confidence in the economy slipped slightly in July but still remained near four-year highs, according to a survey released yesterday.
The Conference Board, a business research group in New York, said its July survey found consumers' assessment of economic conditions continued to improve, though their expectations for the next six months fell slightly. 
 The group said its monthly consumer confidence index, in which 1985 equals 100, was at 91.6 in July, down slightly from its four-year high of 92.5 in June.
"While consumers continue to grow more satisfied with ongoing conditions, their expectations for the immediate future have tapered off," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center.
"Still, the expectations component of the index, which has an impressive record as a leading economic indicator, suggests a continuation of steady, moderate economic growth in the second half of the year," he added.
The board said the survey, based on a representative sample of 5,000 households, found more respondents than in June reporting that economic conditions were "good," while about the same number as last month said the conditions were "bad."
Slightly less than 16 percent of the respondents said jobs were "plentiful," about the same level as last month, but slightly fewer said jobs were "hard to get."
Looking ahead to the next six months, slightly more than 17 percent of the respondents said they expected business conditions to improve, down moderately from last month, while nearly 10 percent said they feared conditions would worsen, up from 8 percent in June.
Regarding future job prospects, more respondents than last month said they feared there would be fewer jobs in the months ahead.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Haiti, U.S. and the Murk in Between

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
When a network presents an hourlong special on Haiti, you can be confident that the current military bosses of that sad country will get their lumps. More surprising in "House on Fire: America's Haitian Crisis" is the force and directness of Peter Jennings's attack on President Clinton's policy, or lack of one.
Mr. Jennings begins this pungent look at Haiti's tumultuous history and present distress with the promise that he will be asking "whether America should send its young men and women" to put out what the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the deposed President of Haiti, has called a house on fire. The question is indeed asked. Mr. Jennings puts it squarely to Father Aristide: "Of what value are you to the United States?" To which Father Aristide responds, "We are men." 
 Mr. Clinton is criticized not for taking a position one way or the other, but for taking contradictory positions, and Mr. Jennings is careful to take no position at all.
Tonight's timely report begins with a group of boat people, accompanied by Mark Atkinson, an ABC News producer, making the dangerous journey to what they hope will be a better life in the United States. But very few are welcomed, because American officials maintain a legal, possibly artificial distinction between those fleeing political persecution and those seeking economic opportunity.
There seems to be no doubt that paramilitary gangs have been murdering, raping and otherwise terrorizing pro-Aristide Haitians. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who now lords it over the island, assures Mr. Jennings that any soldier found guilty of violating a citizen's human rights is prosecuted. Then he adds a philosophical comfort: "You know, on this earth, there is no just society." On the evidence of United Nations observers recently expelled by his Government and interviewed for the program, that certainly applies to Haiti.
Back in the United States, the dispute over what to do has taken on racial overtones. Randall Robinson, the lobbyist who went on a hunger strike in protest against Washington's closed-door policy, tells Mr. Jennings that if the Haitian refugees were white, they would be better treated. He calls the current policy "profoundly racist." Representative Charles Rangel, the New York Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, agrees. Their opinion may be confirmed by an ABC poll for this program, which found many more Americans willing to use military power to stop Haitians from entering the United States than to oust the Haitian regime.
Television has carried mixed messages. The pictures of the boat people, including babies, being turned back by the Coast Guard must have stirred sympathy. The feelings stirred by the pictures of an American warship carrying American and Canadian military advisers retreating after a hostile welcome by armed thugs are less clear. Mr. Jennings calls it "the single most humiliating moment in the entire Haiti crisis," but Administration officials may have been worried about the impact of pictures of Americans being hurt or killed, as in Somalia.
Father Aristide's incitement of his supporters, the poorest of his poor nation, to violence against his opponents in Parliament is duly noted, as are charges that the Central Intelligence Agency spread reports of Father Aristide's purported psychological problems. But what really riles Mr. Jennings is the "series of stunning policy reversals by the Clinton Administration."
"I consider the Haitians to be political refugees, not economic refugees," the candidate Clinton is heard to say, as a reproach to the Bush Administration for sending the refugees back where they came from. But President-elect Clinton decided to continue that policy. And since then, beset by conflicting political pressures at home and adamant resistance by the Haitian military clique, the White House, Mr. Jennings notes sharply, has alternated between threats and retreats.
You can't be sure, but Mr. Jennings seems to prefer the threats. There is nothing ambiguous about his dire summation, however. He says President Clinton "appears to be drifting toward either another humiliating reversal, or taking the one step he most wants to avoid, invading Haiti."

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
THE Clinton Administration has finally named an Administrator for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the hot seat at the Agriculture Department. On Aug. 15, Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy at the Food and Drug Administration, will become responsible for meat and poultry inspection.
Many highly publicized incidents of illness and death from contaminated meat and poultry have occurred in the last few years, and in an interview this week, Mr. Taylor acknowledged that consumer interests, not politics, must be the overriding concern for his agency. 
 "There's a long way to go and a lot of contention, but the food industry has got to figure out a way to get food safety off tabloid TV," he said.
One problem Mr. Taylor will have to address first is why the Agriculture Department allows frozen chickens to be sold as fresh.
He must also wrestle with the tricky question of whether to exempt ground beef from the regulations that define "lean" for all other foods.
And he will have to decide if meat and poultry can be irradiated to reduce bacterial contamination.
"I am going over there to carry out consumer protection provisions," Mr. Taylor said. "The focus of my tenure will be to reduce food-borne illness."
Mr. Taylor is moving from an agency where decisions are generally based on public health concerns and consumer protection into an agency that has always worn two hats: food industry advocate and consumer protector.
The agency is constantly criticized by consumer advocates and health professionals who say that it bases decisions on politics rather than science or consumer protection.
Caroline Smith DeWaal, who is the director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington advocacy group, and has worked with Mr. Taylor on seafood safety, said if anyone can forge a consensus it is he.
"He's trusted not only by us but by the industry," she said.
Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, agreed. "Mike Taylor has a great background in food safety," she said, "but the job has got to be one of the toughest in Washington with all the different pressures from Congress, consumers, labor and the meat industry."
Mr. Taylor said he hopes to bring current scientific thinking to the antiquated system of meat and poultry inspection, adding microbial testing for bacteria to the current system, which now calls only for visual inspection.
It is not a moment too soon, critics say. The public has been bombarded for several years by newspaper and television reports about contaminated meat.
Carol Tucker Foreman, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for the Food Safety and Inspection Service during Jimmy Carter's Administration, said the meat and poultry inspection system is archaic.
"Public health problems have changed, but the Food Safety and Inspection Service hasn't changed," she said. "Mike Taylor has the ability to get the agency into at least the last half of the 20th century."
Mr. Taylor, who was a lawyer specializing in food and drug law before he went to the F.D.A., says he hopes to do better than that. He has been deeply involved in proposed regulations for seafood based on a system known as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, or Haccp (pronounced HASS-ip). This system calls for comprehensive analysis and control of hazards, with monitoring and record keeping.
"My immediate task is to initiate Haccp rule making for meat and poultry," he said. "I certainly hope this fall to have a very credible Haccp proposal out there. A good solid year after the proposal, I hope to have a final rule. I want to send a signal that microbial monitoring is out there, and we've got to come to grips with how best to use it in Haccp."
Many meat and poultry producers use some form of microbial testing in their plants. Yet, even though the National Academy of Sciences said in 1985 that the Agriculture Department should switch to a science-based inspection system -- and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy promised a Haccp program a year ago -- the department does not require microbial testing.
But improving the safety of meat and poultry will not include irradiation, Mr. Taylor said. A recent conference on the hazards of the E. coli bacteria that were responsible for the deaths of four children and the illness of 700 people from eating undercooked contaminated hamburgers recommended irradiation of raw meat as a solution. Mr. Taylor says such a solution will not work.
"Because of public fear irradiation is not going to be incorporated into the system in the near term," he said. "Not until the public is convinced everything else has been done. We need to be open to any technology that improves food safety, but that solution to today's problems is not credible."
And he said the Agriculture Department would stop blaming people for becoming ill from eating contaminated meat. After outbreaks of illness, the department and the meat industry always remind consumers that if they handle meat properly and cook it long enough, the bacteria will be destroyed.
"We can't put the onus on consumers to compensate for what the system is not doing right," Mr. Taylor said. "But people still need to cook and handle meat properly."
Not all the vexing problems facing Mr. Taylor are safety issues. Whether frozen poultry can be called fresh is a matter of economics. Experts generally agree that fresh is more desirable than frozen, and most people are willing to spend more money for fresh food than for frozen.
In the late 1930's the Agriculture Department decided that poultry was not frozen until it was at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. In the late 1980's an effort was made to define fresh poultry as that between 26 and 32 degrees, fresh-frozen between 0 and 26 degrees and frozen at or below 0 degrees.
The attempt failed because poultry producers who ship chicken frozen all over the country said that fresh-frozen was a perjorative term; the 1930's law remained in place.
Then California passed a law to prevent poultry frozen to below 26 degrees from being called fresh. It did so to protect local producers, who do not freeze their chickens, from national companies that want to sell their chickens in California as fresh when they have been frozen. Secretary Espy signed an order declaring the California law invalid because it overrode Federal law. Such a decision, critics say, was based not on good science but on politics.
"That issue obviously needs real serious re-examination," Mr. Taylor said. "The question is, How do we truthfully, in a non-misleading way, inform consumers? To my mind that is what this issue is all about."
Mr. Taylor will also have to make a decision about a proposal to continue to permit ground beef to be labeled with expressions like "70 percent lean, 30 percent fat," or "80 percent lean, 20 percent fat." Under regulations that go into effect Aug. 8, ground beef can be called lean only if certain criteria are met: a 3.5-ounce serving must contain less than 10 grams of fat, less than 4.5 grams of saturated fat and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol.
Ground beef seldom meets those criteria, and some members of the beef industry are looking for an exemption. And now the poultry industry wants to use the "percent lean" labeling if the beef industry is given permission.
"The question here, like on any labeling issue, is, How do we accurately and fairly inform consumers?" Mr. Taylor said. "The test in every case is, Does it make sense to consumers?
"We are not going to be adjusting labeling rules just to meet marketing needs of companies. The same is true on safety issues."
A lot of people who see eye to eye on very little are expecting assorted miracles from Mr. Taylor. He has a tall order to fill.

HEADLINE: Retreating on the Trade Pact

 BODY:
Sam Gibbons, who replaced Dan Rostenkowski as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, came to his new position with a reputation as a dedicated free-trader. But he tarnished that reputation last week by pushing a number of trade-closing amendments through his committee.
The committee was voting on the Administration's proposed legislation to institute the Uruguay Round trade pact, which the U.S. signed with over 100 other nations in April in Marrakech, Morocco. The Senate Finance Committee takes up the legislation today. The most controversial issue concerns "anti-dumping" statutes, which govern how the U.S. will retaliate against countries that export goods at unfairly low prices -- for example, prices below the exporter's manufacturing cost. 
 Anti-dumping statutes are a valid tool for enforcing fair-trade rules. But they have evolved into a favorite device of protectionists. The Administration, responding to lobbying by manufacturers of steel, textiles and cement, is seeking in effect to rewrite the Uruguay Round accord so that domestic manufacturers can use the anti-dumping statutes to shut out legitimate foreign competitors. Mr. Gibbons has now signed on to this malodorous effort.
One misguided provision would make the American market look far smaller than it really is, thereby magnifying the harmful effect of imports and justifying retaliation by the U.S. The House committee would shrink the American market by having the Government disregard the large amount of goods that American companies produce for their own use rather than for sale, as when U.S. steel companies produce steel that they use in other products they sell.
Mr. Gibbons would also allow the Government to find dumping even when no domestic producer is available to serve customer needs. And the committee may be preparing language to prevent foreign companies from temporarily cutting prices below cost to preserve market share during recessions -- a tactic routinely used by domestic businesses.
President Clinton points to the signing of the Uruguay Round pact as a hallmark of his economic and foreign policies. But when it came time to wrestle with Congress over putting it into effect he sided with special-interest manufacturers rather than the large number of U.S. companies that rely upon imports to help keep their output high and consumer prices down. Mr. Gibbons caved in. Today consumers will find out if the Senate Finance Committee will protect them from his retreat.

HEADLINE: In America;
Blacks' Problems, Seen Plain

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The speech was delivered in Indianapolis without a lot of flamboyant rhetoric. It spoke the truth, unadorned, without crude appeals to prejudice. It was courageous, intelligent and important.
Hugh P. Price, the new president of the National Urban League, said it was time for a new and more realistic approach to the problems plaguing African-Americans. He warned: "We must not let ourselves, and especially our children, fall into the paranoid trap of thinking that racism accounts for all that plagues us. The global realignment of work and wealth is, if anything, the bigger culprit." 
 In the overheated, oppressive, finger-pointing atmosphere in which much of our racial discourse is conducted, Mr. Price's speech was a welcome breeze. He was direct and unapologetic in his opposition to racism of any kind and to the fantasy of black separatism.
"Belief in racial inclusion goes to the marrow of my bones," he said. ". . . I fully understand the instinct to separate when we are incessantly under economic siege, when we're still discriminated against some 40 years after the Brown decision, and when, thanks to those recurring images on evening newscasts of black youngsters being hauled off to jail, even our honor students are trailed like common thieves when they enter stores.
"Even so, it's suicidal economically to become so bitter that we isolate ourselves from others."
Mr. Price's speech, the keynote address to the Urban League's national convention, was the latest acknowledgment that the role of traditional civil rights organizations has changed. Like the N.A.A.C.P., the primary focus of the Urban League is on finding remedies to the desperate situation facing poor blacks in America's inner cities. But the N.A.A.C.P. has alienated many of its traditional supporters by embracing Louis Farrakhan and others whose messages have been divisive at best, and at worst blatantly racist and anti-Semitic.
Mr. Price was clear on the direction the Urban League would take under his leadership. He said: "Many whites of good will have accompanied us on our long journey for racial, social and economic justice. None has matched the Jewish community as long-distance runners in the civil rights movement. Just as we denounce misleading media stereotypes of African-Americans, it is morally repugnant as well to impugn an entire people, especially longstanding allies, like Jews, because of the unconscionable behavior of some of them."
The essence of Mr. Price's speech was his recognition that the catastrophic circumstances enveloping so many African-Americans are in large part the result of changed economic conditions that are having a devastating effect on many whites as well. Blacks, with the least in the way of resources, are being hammered worst; but no ethnic group has been spared. Long gone are the days when the local manufacturing plant was the gateway to the middle class. The new world of employment is one that is steadily buffeted by technological innovation, radical corporate downsizing and the wholesale transfer of low-skilled jobs to low-wage workers overseas.
Said Mr. Price: "This ruthlessly competitive world waits for no nation, no ethnic group and no individual."
No substantial improvement in the condition of African-Americans in general and inner-city residents in particular can be achieved without a heroic effort to cope with these complex economic forces. That will require sophisticated leadership, unrelenting hard work, intellectual rigor and a firm commitment to reality. The belief that all evil is the result of the white man is worse than not helpful, it's monumentally destructive.
Hugh Price is one of many African-Americans throughout the country who have long since rolled up their sleeves and gone to work in a serious way on what has become a hideous array of social and economic problems. They have the talent and the will to succeed but not nearly enough support. Needless to say, they don't get the same attention as Jew-baiters and celebrities in handcuffs. But they are the true leaders. They are the ones who will make things better for future generations.

HEADLINE: How a Dollar Coin Hurts Ordinary Folks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Change for a Dollar" (editorial, July 15), recommending the dollar coin, would unleash a round of inflation that would hurt "little people" the most. Sodas may already be $1 in New York, but everywhere else they are mostly 70 to 80 cents. 
 As soon as a dollar coin is in wide circulation, all machine operators across the land will have the incentive to jump their prices to an even $1. They can't do it now because those dollar-bill slots are unreliable.
I did my part and kept using Susan B. Anthony dollars as long as my bank kept them in stock. But your Gotham-view idea will raise a child's or working person's cost 25 percent to 40 percent.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Now, Microsoft Wants To Gather Information

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation, fresh from a Federal antitrust settlement that did little to curb its dominance of the business software market, is now hoping to conquer an emerging field where the company's computer-nerd skills may, or may not, give it an edge: electronic publishing.
Like many traditional paper-and-ink publishers, and many other software companies, Microsoft is busy acquiring information to fill CD-ROM's, shiny disks that look like music CD's but can each contain the equivalent of 250,000 pages of text for playback on personal computers. When done right, the technology can combine true-to-life video images, sound and animation in a multimedia package that both entertains and educates. 
 Although the market for consumer CD-ROM titles was only about $325 million last year, it is growing rapidly and is expected to reach $1 billion a year by the end of 1996. And Microsoft ranks fourth in the field, on the strength of popular titles like "Cinemania," a $50 interactive guide with 19,000 movie reviews, and the $100 "Encarta," a leading CD-ROM encyclopedia.
 
Trying Something New
 But it is far from certain that Microsoft can ever dominate this new publishing market in the same way that it now leads in computer operating-system software and word processing programs. Unlike its earlier battles for emerging markets, this time the territory is less familiar to Microsoft.
"I don't think Microsoft will ever dominate the content business as thoroughly as they do the operating systems or word processing or spreadsheet businesses," said Charles H. Finnie, a multimedia analyst with Volpe, Welty & Company, an investment banker in San Francisco. "The content business is similar to the book or record business -- where people want to buy a lot of different things from a lot of sources."
And yet, as the publishing industry turns increasingly to the computing medium, Microsoft brings considerable technical skills, deep pockets and a well-developed distribution system for getting its shrink-wrapped software onto retail shelves.
"Our goal is to combine great software with great information," said Patty Stonesifer, head of Microsoft's consumer division.
At Microsoft -- the world's largest software company -- CD-ROM publishing is still a relatively small market: in the 1993 calendar year, it accounted for $30 million of Microsoft's revenue; for the fiscal year that ended June 30, Microsoft reported $4.65 billion in total revenue. But Microsoft officials say the company hopes to expand its CD-ROM business. Officials at the research house Dataquest Inc. said they expect Microsoft's CD-ROM revenue to grow more than six times, to $200 million annually in 1996.
The current market leaders are software companies far smaller than Microsoft. At the top, with an 18 percent market share, is Compton's New Media, acquired last year by the Tribune Company, whose holdings include The Chicago Tribune newspaper.
But virtually all the big publishing companies in New York have started new media businesses. The book publisher Simon & Schuster will soon enter the field with its first two CD-ROM titles: "The Macmillan Dictionary for Children" and "Firefighter," a children's book about firemen and women. Time Warner Inc., the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company and Grolier Inc. are already well established in CD-ROM's. And the magazine publishers the Hearst Corporation and Conde Nast Publications Inc. are both thought to have their sights set on the market.
It may be that when it comes to this unusual business, which resembles the music industry more than it does the software business, Microsoft may simply be one of the pack.
Microsoft's sprawling headquarters in a pine grove east of Seattle are far from the New York publishing scene and the Los Angeles entertainment capital. And the distances may be more than geographic.
 
Partnerships Promise Challenge
 In the emerging industry of electronic publishing, the key is building partnerships with the owners of "content" -- writers, photographers, film makers -- and Microsoft's critics are skeptical the company is capable of making such relationships work.
"Name a significant Microsoft partnership that has worked out for the partner," said Nick Arnett, president of the Multimedia Computing Corporation, a consulting company in Santa Clara, Calif.
Mr. Arnett is one of the many Microsoft critics who contend that Microsoft, with its techie staff and tough negotiating tactics, will be unable to work with what is collectively called "talent."
Such criticisms have evidently not been entirely lost on Microsoft, which two years ago hired Peter Mollman, a longtime executive in book publishing, to handle its licensing arrangements with information providers. Mr. Mollman had recently retired as president of the encyclopedia company World Book International in Chicago when he was lured to Microsoft as director of intellectual property development.
Under Mr. Mollman, Microsoft appears to be going after a wholesome, World Book-type of audience. Compared with the titles list of some other publishers, which include CD-ROM's of rock musicians and wildly offbeat games, such as the Voyager Company's "Freak Show," about the behind-the-scenes shenanigans at a fictional carnival, Microsoft's product list is decidedly uplifting. Five of its titles, for example, are about classical music.
 
A Veteran of Young Market
 Microsoft is hardly new to the consumer publishing field. Seven years ago, it became the first large software company to offer a mass-market CD-ROM title when it released a collection of reference works, "Microsoft Bookshelf." But like most of the CD-ROM's of that era, "Bookshelf" was strictly text, lacking the multimedia embellishments standard in today's products.
And even three years ago, Microsoft was having a tough time convincing the movie industry of the viability of a CD-ROM guide to the movies. "They really couldn't envision it," said Nils von Veh, program manager in Microsoft's consumer division, which publishes "Cinemania," an interactive compendium of movie reviews and other information that includes actual film clips. "Now they're just mad when you leave something out."
Though still small, Microsoft's consumer division is one of the fastest growing in the company. There, about 600 of the company's 15,000 total employees toil away on Microsoft's growing CD-ROM line, which now includes about 50 titles and is expected to double within one year.
The best-selling title is the "Encarta" encyclopedia, which illustrates the equivalent of thousands of pages of reference material with video clips, still images and sound. Increasingly, Microsoft plans to link reference works like Encarta to on-line network services, enabling users to retrieve the latest information about a particular entry. Already, with the brand-new "Microsoft Complete Baseball" CD-ROM, users can connect to Microsoft's Baseball Daily, an on-line service that provides updated statistics from the day's major league baseball games.
"I think it's pretty clear that in the future, information and tools will come together," Ms. Stonesifer said. Determining which information will be sold on the CD-ROM disk and which should be updated over the network will depend on what the company calls the data's "freshness factor."
 
Distribution Advantage
 One of Microsoft's major advantages in entering any new market is distribution, and in the competitive retail software market, where shelf space is limited, Microsoft already has a strong presence. Moreover, the American Booksellers Association conference in June, Microsoft announced it had signed a deal with the Ingram Book Company, the large book wholesaler, to start putting its CD-ROM titles into bookstores.
And while some "content" owners may prefer to deal with publishers perhaps more savvy in the ways of Hollywood and New York, others seem happy to sign on with a technology giant like Microsoft.
Scholastic Inc., itself a New York book publisher, is one. The company recently selected Microsoft to develop and publish an electronic version of its children's books, "The Magic School Bus" because, said Deborah Forte, executive vice president, it wanted the most advanced multimedia technology available.
"We were very capable just doing an electronic book, but that's not the experience we wanted," she said. "We're not there yet in terms of technical expertise. We wanted someone who could push the limits."

HEADLINE: THE WHITEWATER AFFAIR: THE PRESIDENT;
The Contrasts of Clinton, Only a TV Click Apart

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's Presidency has always spun from its reel so fast, with scenes of achievement and grace swiftly eclipsed by scenes of dishevelment and awkwardness. So it did not seem at all odd today to see both on the screen at once, separated only by the click of a tuner.
 There was Mr. Clinton in the White House between Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein, basking in his second Middle East diplomatic triumph, hearing Jordan's leader say he was "proud to have you as our partner." And there -- click -- was Mr. Clinton's counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler, parked before a microphone, telling a House committee investigating Whitewater that Administration officials had done nothing wrong, really, but that they shouldn't have done it. 
This happened occasionally to Mr. Clinton's predecessors -- George Bush threw up on television, after all, at the climax of a Tokyo trade conference -- but not since William Henry Harrison caught pneumonia at his inauguration and died 32 days later has Presidential triumph seemed so closely dogged by fate.
 Some of it is fate, and a past that refuses to stay in the past. But a large measure is rooted elsewhere, in Mr. Clinton's unmade-bed style of policy-making, in his and his staff's newness to governing and in the rise of tabloid-style news, both in print and on television. Together, they are eroding not only the President's political and moral standing, but the policies he is trying to promote.
 "A cloud does tend to be there that's always following him through the fields," one White House official said this week, attributing much of the problem to "naivete and hubris."
 
Victory-Loss Cycle
 In this case, the Whitewater cloud fogs not only the Middle East accord but also the last-minute drive for health legislation, perhaps the central issue of the Clinton Presidency. Mr. Clinton's European summit conference this month, essentially a bid to establish his foreign-policy credentials, was negated by his Administration's foundering Haiti policy.
 In January, the naming of a Whitewater special counsel drowned out the signing of a nuclear-arms accord in Ukraine. The President's first State of the Union Message, a booming call for fiscal restraint and wise investment, was wiped from memory weeks later when the White House's first budget bill -- a $20 billion package of "stimulus" spending -- was denounced as pork, and rejected.
 Some White House officials suggest there is little the President can do about a victory-loss cycle they say is dictated by the news media and his critics and that, in effect, Mr. Clinton is a victim of his own good intentions.
 Mr. Clinton was not legally required to name a Whitewater special counsel and thereby prolong public scrutiny of his Arkansas real-estate venture, they say. And no recent President has faced such vociferous critics, or a press so ravenous for bad news and bristling with technology to spread it.
 
Product of the Process
 "This President has an ambitious agenda," another senior official said today, "and whenever you have an ambitious agenda, you're going to draw energetic enemies and risk both criticism and defeat."
 Mr. Clinton sometimes loses, that official argued, because he fights for important matters. President Bush won the Gulf War and asked Congress for a highway bill in return.
 But if critics celebrate it and the press spreads it, much of the cloud that follows Mr. Clinton is a product of the process that got him to the White House to begin with. Political parties no longer vet candidates or even choose them; increasingly, the candidates rise from outside Washington on the skill of commercials and press relations as well as ability.
 Mr. Clinton is the latest modern master of the campaign, and his political aides once boasted of using the instant technology of modern news coverage during his race to bat down stories about Whitewater and his sex life. Such tactics did not bury those issues, it now turns out, but only postponed them until candidate Clinton became President Clinton and the center of global attention.
 "He procrastinates," said Stephen Hess, the veteran student of Presidents at the Brookings Institution, "and things catch up with him. He'll let something slide, and then he throws the energy, the intellect and the power of the Presidency into it. It's been a high-wire act for one and a half years."
 
Victories, but No Credit
 Indeed, White House officials say the foreign-policy dilemmas that have horned in on Mr. Clinton's Presidency in places like Haiti and North Korea are both inherited and unavoidable in the post-Soviet world. Others argue that Mr. Clinton has put off meeting those trouble spots head-on, only to discover that they just get bigger instead of going away.
 One result of Mr. Clinton's inability to string together any victories is confusion among the people who elected him President. For instance, consumer confidence in the economy is at the highest level in at least four years -- six, by some polls -- but according to the latest New York Times-CBS News survey, Mr. Clinton has reaped almost none of the credit in the last year. Indeed, more people disapprove of his handling of the economy than approve of it.
 Similarly, the President's foreign travels and peacemaking have failed to halt the drop in approval of his handling of foreign policy, now at the lowest level since his inauguration.
 It is true that the President's approval ratings have had their own peaks and valleys in the last 18 months, themselves a function of his performance in office. "When he's good," Mr. Hess said, "he's very, very good. But when he's bad, he's horrid."
 But judging by polls, people seem not to know whether the man in the White House on any given day is the Good Clinton or the horrid one. And so for now, they trust neither.


GRAPHIC: The House Banking Committee opened hearings today on what has become known as the "Washington phase" of the Whitewater investigation -- in particular, on the propriety of contacts between the White House and Treasury Department officials involved in investigations of a failed Arkansas savings and loan. That bank, Madison Guaranty, was owned by James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in their Whitewater real estate venture. Here is a chronology of such contacts that have been publicly revealed, drawn from documents submitted to the committee and from an account provided today by the White House counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler.
 
1993
 
March 24 -- A fax of a 1992 newspaper article about the Clintons and Whitewater is sent from the office of Roger C. Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary, then acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation (R.T.C.), to Bernard W. Nussbaum, then the White House counsel.
 
Sept. 29 -- Jean E. Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel, alerts Mr. Nussbaum that the R.T.C. plans to issue a criminal referral asking the Justice Department to investigate Madison Guaranty, a request that names the Clintons as possible beneficiaries of illegal actions.
 
Sept. 30 -- In a memorandum to Mr. Altman, Ms. Hanson says she has briefed both the Treasury Secretary and White House officials about the investigation.
 
October -- President Clinton is briefed about the request by Federal regulators for a criminal investigation into Madison.
 
October 4 or 5 -- Bruce Lindsey, a top White House aide, tells the President about press inquires on the referral.
 
Oct. 8 -- The R.T.C. formally asks the Justice Department to look into the matter.
 
Oct. 14 -- A meeting is held in Mr. Nussbaum's office to discuss how to handle the press inquiries. Those attending include Mr. Nussbaum; Mark D. Gearan, White House director of communications; Mr. Lindsey, Neil Eggleston and Clifford Sloan, White House lawyers; Ms. Hanson, Joshua L. Steiner, chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and Jack DeVore, then Mr. Bentsen's press secretary.. Dec. 30 -- During an annual New Year's retreat, Eugene A. Ludwig, comptroller of the currency, has a brief exchange with the President about Whitewater. After consulting with White House lawyers, Mr. Ludwig decides it would be unwise to have further discussions with Mr. Clinton on the matter.
 
1994
 
Jan. 4 or 11 -- Mr. Altman notes in his diary that Margaret Williams, Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief of staff, told him that Mrs. Clinton was "paralyzed" by Whitewater. He also records his impression that the White House was trying to negotiate limits on the scope of an independent counsel's jurisdiction, if one was appointed.
 
Feb. 2 -- Mr. Altman meets with Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Eggleston, Mr. Ickes and Ms. Williams to give the White House a "heads up" on how the regulators would proceed on potential civil claims arising out of Madison's failure. Mr. Altman raises the question of whether he should remove himself from supervising the Madison investigation. Mr. Nussbaum argues against such a move and the other participants question its necessity.
 
Feb. 3 -- Mr. Altman decides not to remove himself. Sometime later in the month, in separate conversations with the President and Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Ickes informs them of Mr. Altman's decision.
 
Feb. 12 and Feb. 27 -- Mr. Steiner comments in his diary that Mr. Altman is under "intense pressure" by the White House not to remove himself from the case and that the officials present at the Feb. 2 meeting told Mr. Altman that recusal was "unacceptable."
 
Feb. 24 -- Mr. Altman testifies before a Senate hearing and acknowledges that there have been discussions between Treasury and White House officials about the investigation. Later White House officials express concern to Mr. Altman about the completeness of his testimony.
 
Feb. 25 -- Mr. Altman announces his decision that he will remove himself from the Madison investigation and that he will step down as R.T.C's acting head. George Stephanopoulos, a senior Clinton advisor, complains to Mr. Steiner about the manner in which Mr. Altman's decision was announced and also complains about the decision of the R.T.C. to hire a former Republican prosecutor, Jay B. Stephens, to investigate the collapse of Madison. Mr. Stephanopoulos and Mr. Ickes, in a conference call with Mr. Altman, criticize Mr. Altman for failing to give the White House advance notice of his decision. In a diary entry, Mr. Steiner writes that they said that the President was "furious."

HEADLINE: Defector Says North Korea Has 5 A-Bombs and May Make More

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, July 28

 BODY:
The South Korean intelligence agency presented on Wednesday what it said was a high-level North Korean defector who said that, despite repeated denials, the Government in Pyongyang had five nuclear bombs and might soon develop five more.
If his remarkable story is true, Kang Myong Do, 35, may be the most damaging defector ever to escape from North Korea, one of the most closed societies on earth. His story could also spur a reassessment of efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. 
 Mr. Kang was introduced at a news conference in Seoul as the son-in-law of North Korea's Prime Minister, Kang Sung San. He said North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong Il, sees the development of nuclear weapons not as a bargaining chip, but as the only way to save his Government in the face of a collapsing economy. Ten bombs, Mr. Kang said, would give him the muscle he needs to stand up to the United States.
"There is a firm belief that the only way to sustain the Kim Jong Il system is to have nuclear capabilities," he said.
There was no way to confirm the veracity of Mr. Kang's claims, which would contradict even the gloomiest estimates by the Central Intelligence Agency. In a statement issued today, the North Korean Government denied that Mr. Kang is related to the Prime Minister, and said he was a fugitive. And some western intelligence officials and diplomats expressed deep skepticism after analyzing Mr. Kang's comments.
[Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the Pentagon was taking the defector's report seriously, though he still stood behind a United States intelligence estimate that the North probably had reprocessed enough plutonium to build one or two nuclear explosive devices, not five.]
True or not, there was concern about the South Korean intelligence service's motives in choosing this sensitive moment, two months after it said Mr. Kang had defected, to put him on display. The South Korean action could be interpreted as an attempt to poison the atmosphere at high-level talks between American and North Korean officials on the nuclear issue. Those talks are scheduled to resume in Geneva on Aug. 5. They were suspended three weeks ago after the death of the North's leader, Kim Il Sung.
There are some officials in Seoul who say the American and South Korean Governments may be induced to give up too much in the negotiations with Pyongyang, which they do not trust. So there was speculation that the officials might have been trying to pre-empt such a prospect by painting the North Korean nuclear program in the starkest possible terms.
The North Koreans have long denied that they are developing nuclear bombs, but they have refused to give international inspectors access to several nuclear sites where they may have produced or stored plutonium, the raw material for nuclear bombs.
Mr. Kang said he was vice president of a trading company under the control of the President's office. He said he decided to defect in May, during a business trip to China.
Neither he nor the intelligence officials offered any details on how he escaped, other than to say that he passed through a third country. No reason was given regarding why it took roughly two months for South Korea to release information on the defection or to present Mr. Kang.
Mr. Kang said he had learned details of the nuclear program, being carried out at a site 60 miles north Pyongyang at Yongbyon, from a senior official in the security service.
Mr. Kang said that Kim Jong Il is determined to build the bombs, and rockets capable of delivering them, in a desperate struggle for survival. Mr. Kang said North Korea already has five nuclear bombs. When it has ten, Mr. Kang said, Kim Jong Il will disclose their existence as a deterrent and potent tool in negotiations, while tryng to strengthen the North's battered economy.

HEADLINE: Durable Orders Up 1.3%, Showing Factory Health

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
In the latest sign of robust health in the nation's manufacturing industries, orders and shipments of cars, industrial machinery and other durable goods rose in June, the Commerce Department announced today.
Stock and bond prices fell sharply on the news, as traders and investors concluded that continued strong growth in the economy made it more likely that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates soon to prevent the economy from overheating. Investors also worried about declining earnings. 
 Orders for durable manufactured goods rose 1.3 percent in June, while shipments rose 1.1 percent, the Government announced. Private economists had expected orders to rise around five-tenths of a percentage point.
 
Orders Are Volatile
 Durable goods orders tend to be volatile and sometimes send contradictory signals about the economy's direction. But orders have now risen for four straight months and 10 of the last 11 months. Because new orders exceeded shipments in June, the backlog of unfilled orders at factories around the country also grew by two-tenths of a percentage point.
"It portends strong industrial activity in the next several months at least," said Eugene J. Sherman, the director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a brokerage firm.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown welcomed today's figures, particularly a rise in orders for big-ticket factory and office equipment, a category that includes everything from steam turbines to computers. "Not only is the economy growing at an appropriate rate, not only do interest rates remain at a relatively low rate but consumer confidence is up and more importantly, business confidence is up," he said in a telephone interview today.
Orders fell only for military goods and primary metals like steel and copper.
The big mystery in the American economy today lies in who will buy all the goods that American factories are producing. Economists estimate that consumer spending grew only 1 percent in the second quarter after growing at a 4 percent pace in the previous three quarters.
 
Inventories on Rise
 Because consumers account for two-thirds of all purchases in the economy, their new caution has resulted in a sharp rise in companies' inventories. Much of the nation's strong economic growth in the second quarter seems to have gone into inventories, said Kenneth P. Mayland, the chief financial economist and senior vice president at Keycorp, a Cleveland-based bank.
The Commerce Department is scheduled to announce on Friday morning its first estimate of economic growth in the second quarter, an announcement that traders have been eagerly awaiting as a clear signal of the economy's overall health and of the Federal Reserve's likely course on interest rates in the coming weeks. Today's durable goods figures showed strengthening activity in many different manufacturing industries, from cars to railroad equipment, suggesting that second-quarter economic growth was quite strong, Mr. Mayland said.
The durable goods announcement seems likely to fan concerns at the Federal Reserve about two possible sources of future inflation that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, described in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last week.
One concern is that the economy will grow so fast that production bottlenecks will appear and companies will be forced to bid up the prices for scarce materials and skilled workers, he said. The central bank has already noted spot shortages of truck drivers and construction workers as the economy moves closer to operating at full capacity, he added.
The other possible source of inflation could arise if bank loans rise sharply, Mr. Greenspan said, while adding that he had not yet seen any sign of this. A sharp rise in borrowing would feed more money into the economy and allow individuals and companies to bid up the prices of goods and services.

HEADLINE: Financing for Times Square Leads to Harsher Criticism

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Less than a week before a critical deadline in the long-delayed plan to redevelop Times Square, a new report from one of the project's most prominent critics suggests that the deal for four huge office towers has created a financial quagmire that could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
The report, issued this week by the Municipal Art Society, calculated that because of tax abatements the state has promised the developers of the proposed towers, the city and the state would receive from $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion less in taxes paid than they would get from a similar office complex built without subsidies. 
 "This is an unbelievably large subsidy going to four buildings that never made sense for the site, and are even worse now," said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society.
The abatements were promised to a development team led by the Prudential Insurance Company of America, to compensate it for the money it has agreed to put up so the state can condemn property for the towers as well as theaters and retail space. The developers have already paid more than $270 million for condemnation, an amount that state officials say may increase.
 
Facing a Deadline
 Next week the project is expected to take a significant step forward. The developers face a deadline on Monday for committing themselves to $20 million in improvements on the shabby and vacant buildings that now line the redevelopment area.
Renovation would mean that new businesses could move in, providing the basis for what state officials call their interim plan to reinvigorate the area until the developers decide that Manhattan's weak real-estate market has recovered enough to build their office towers.
State officials, and a spokeswoman for the developers, said they expected an agreement on the interim plan, and even the harshest critics of the redevelopment plan said they would welcome new street-level businesses.
But it is the long-term plan for four huge office towers that has provoked criticism from its inception and that some analysts now say has become a far worse deal over time.
Mr. Barwick's group recommended that the state pay back the developers' money that they have already used to condemn property. Then, if the developers want to build office towers, they would do so without public subsidies, the group said.
 
Long-Term Tax Relief
 State officials angrily rejected the analysis, saying that if anyone loses money on the Times Square plan, it will be the developers.
"To suggest, at this point, that the developers are getting a sweet deal is just absurd," said Rebecca Robertson, head of the 42d Street Development Project, a state agency. Though Prudential and its partner, George Klein, will receive long-term tax abatements, perhaps extending more than 50 years, she said the tax break may not fully reimburse the developers for the $270 million investment they have made in the project.
Still, the Municipal Art Society's analysis is not the first to criticize the project. "The subsidies go off the chart," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of urban planning and economics at New York University, who said the tax breaks would extend through the life of the 99-year lease the developers are to hold on the land under their buildings. Even so, he said, the developers may lose money.
No one denies that the project has been overtaken by a boom-and-bust cycle in the city's real-estate market.
Since th mid-1980's, more than a dozen large office towers have been built in the area, mainly at the north end of Times Square, creating a surplus of office space that has now persuaded Mr. Klein and Prudential to delay their project.
The developers took a critical step in 1990, when they turned over a letter of credit of $241 million to cover the condemnation costs.
The letter of credit came on top of $88 million that the developers had already paid for condemnation, a reflection of the rising value of real estate in the nine years since 1981, when Prudential and Mr. Klein won the right to develop the property.
So far, Ms. Robertson said, $192 million of the developers' letter of credit has been used. And since property owners have gone to court seeking more than the state has offered, the costs could grow beyond the limits of the developers' $241 million note, requiring them to commit more money or walk away from the huge investment they have already made.
The potential cost to taxpayers has also grown. That is because the developers' contract with the state gives them long-term tax abatements in return for their land costs.
When state officials first estimated that it would cost no more than $88 million to condemn the property, they thought it would take no more than 20 years worth of tax abatements for the developers to recoup their investment. Now, with the costs exceeding $270 million and growing, Mr. Tobier said, the developers may never get their money back.
Further complicating the deal is that the developers are to begin receiving interest on that money when construction starts on the office towers. The money would come through tax abatements. According to several scenarios calculated by the Municipal Art Society, the accumulated interest would eventually exceed $1 billion. But Ms. Robertson said taxpayers would not be obligated to pay those costs beyond the tax breaks Prudential would get.

HEADLINE: A Russian Pyramid Collapses, Burying Belief in Capitalism

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 27

 BODY:
Driven by equal doses of panic and greed, thousands of investors swarmed stock exchanges, offices and the headquarters of Russia's largest stock fund today, desperately trying to sell the company's shares, which have lost half their value in less than a day.
With at least five million shareholders, the company, MMM, had become the most visible, and aggressive symbol of the rowdy new capitalism here, churning profits seemingly out of air, and turning everyone from penny- pinching grandmothers to college kids into stock market addicts. 
 In the process, the company's outspoken chief, Sergei Mavrody, turned himself into a populist icon: a man who promises to deliver a piece of the good life to anyone willing to risk a little money to get a lot more back. He considers his investors a "political force," and says their growing power rivals the Kremlin.
That was before Tuesday, when the company abruptly refused to buy any of its own shares at dozens of offices throughout Moscow. This evening, every Moscow news show was filled with news of MMM and the possibility that its magic was made only with smoke and mirrors.
 
Investors Camp Out
 "How could I not invest in this company?" asked one forlorn woman, Galya S. Bondaryan, who like hundreds had slept on the company's grounds Tuesday night in an effort to be one of the few who could sell her shares back today. "They promised everything. And it seemed like they were going to be honest. I thought this was how the stock market worked."
Unfortunately her confused understanding of capitalism and her attraction to seemingly impossible returns on investment are still common in Russia. And beneath MMM's lucrative veneer and behind the ubiquitous television ads that promise apartments in Paris and vacations in San Francisco, the company is nothing but a classic, and monumentally huge, pyramid scheme. Aware that its collapse could do irreparable damage to the fragile image of a free market, Russian leaders, including President Boris N. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor K. Chernomyrdin, have begged people to find another place to put their funds.
They and most other political leaders here -- from right-wing nationalists like Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky to liberal reformers like Yegor T. Gaidar -- have denounced the potbellied, lascivious stars of MMM's advertising campaign. The two middle-aged men, who are always pictured on television lounging in foreign capitals swilling beer, have become heroes.
"People don't want to believe that this firm is built on air and is going to collapse," the newspaper Izvestia said in an editorial today. "All they want to hear is that the value of their shares will grow every day no matter what. They want to believe that MMM has never in any way tried to deceive them. Its always easier to blame these problems on the Government."
 
Warnings on Other Companies
 But the warnings of doom have been sounding with increasing frequency lately, not only about MMM but other, similar companies as well. Many well known economists and Government officials have predicted that further investment in these elaborate schemes could not only ruin the economy but destroy any hope of generating confidence in capitalism.
"Companies like MMM siphon enormous amounts of money from credulous people," Andrei Koshevarov, head of the Ministry of Finance's department that oversees stock markets, told the Itar-Tass news service today. "The campaign by MMM has assumed all the signs of financial drug addiction. Original investors are dividing the money invested by those after them."
That, of course, is what a pyramid scheme is all about. Each new round of investors supplies the money for the previous group. Such schemes offer higher and higher returns to lure new investors. Shares that cost 1,600 rubles in February (then worth about a dollar) had climbed to 105,000 (about $50) on Monday.
By today, however, shares were back to 13,000 rubles (a little more than $6) and rumors spread rapidly across Moscow that the company was on the verge of collapse.

HEADLINE: Supercomputer Pioneer Seeks Investor or Buyer

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 27

 BODY:
The Thinking Machines Corporation, the company that pioneered the technology for today's fastest supercomputers only to see larger companies invade its market, is in danger of going out of business unless it can find a big investor or buyer soon.
Several industry executives said today that Thinking Machines was negotiating with both Sun Microsystems and AT&T to invest in the company or buy it outright. If the talks fail, it is unlikely that Thinking Machines will survive, said the executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 Thinking Machines' president, Richard P. Fishman, declined to comment on which companies might be negotiating with the privately held supercomputer maker. But he did say the company had been looking for a partner for many months.
"We're trying to work things out under extremely difficult constraints," Mr. Fishman said. "We're pushing against the clock."
Although Thinking Machines is relatively small, with an estimated $90 million in revenues last year, it has the second-largest share of the $450 million market for a type of supercomputer known as massively parallel processing machines. But the world's largest chip maker, the Intel Corporation, is the leader in the field, and other giants like I.B.M. are also threatening to surpass Thinking Machines.
The company may be the victim of having invented a successful technology that bigger companies are better equipped to pursue. Thinking Machines is also feeling the effects of the end of the cold war, which has eroded Federal financing for supercomputer research and has curtailed the Federal Government's budget for buying such machines, which have typically sold for $10 million or more.
Founded in 1983 by a group of former Massachusetts Institute of Technology students and based in Cambridge, Mass., Thinking Machines originated the idea of massively parallel computing: chaining together tens of thousands of inexpensive microprocessor chips to reach supercomputer speeds. The tiny start-up company ultimately transformed the very top of the computing world with this approach, which breaks big problems into millions of discrete elements and solves them simultaneously.
The older approach to supercomputing, which is based on a small number of powerful, more expensive processors, still constitutes a larger market, estimated to surpass $1 billion this year. The leader in this field is Cray Research. But even Cray is now moving with the market toward massively parallel computers.
The technology takes advantage of the rapidly collapsing cost of off-the-shelf chips that are used in personal computers and work stations. It has changed the economics of the high-performance segment of the computer industry and is beginning to infiltrate corporate mainframe computing as well. American Express, for example, uses a Thinking Machines computer to plow through its wealth of credit-card information for detailed information about customers.
But machines for the corporate market tend to be priced much lower than the $15 million to $30 million machines that the Government was once willing to buy in computing-intensive military research programs like Star Wars.
 
 
A 'Replacement Market'
 "All the people in the world who want to buy $15 to $30 million supercomputers already have one," said Chris Willard, an analyst at the International Data Corporation, a market research company in Framingham, Mass. "It's now a mature replacement market."
With initial funds from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Defense Department, the Government virtually created the market for massively parallel computers in the 1980's. Indeed, the Pentagon agency gave Thinking Machines a $12 million grant in 1989 as seed money to develop a supercomputer capable of achieving a teraflop -- a trillion mathematical operations a second. But that was only a fraction of the cost that Thinking Machines and other companies said the project might cost, and no computer maker has yet achieved the goal.
Since then, the Government has seemed less interested in pursuing the teraflop goal. And Thinking Machines, which has been pursuing new avenues of support from the Government, has been told that several large orders for its supercomputers are unlikely to materialize until next year.
 
 
Energy Secretary Laments Fate
 Hazel R. O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, whose department helps subsidize supercomputing research, said today in a telephone interview that the demise of Thinking Machines would be unfortunate. "If we lose this jewel of a company, as a nation we are doing ourselves a disservice," she said.
Although she had no comment on financing for Thinking Machines, she did say it was in the Government's interest to support such companies. "You have to create a policy that insures that the pie is cut so there is an opportunity for both small and large companies."
But without the pressures of a cold war, industry executives said, and because supercomputing remains a field in which American industry holds a significant technical lead over the rest of the world, it is unlikely that Federal officials will be motivated to step in to save an ailing company.
Danny Hillis, Thinking Machines' co-founder and currently chief scientist, voiced frustration today that the Government had lost, since the end of the cold war, its urgency in pushing private industry to develop increasingly faster computers. "If the cold war had stopped in the middle of Apollo program," he said, "we never would have reached the moon."
But analysts say some of troubles of Thinking Machines are of its own making, citing a difficult product transition with its newest model, the CM-5, which was introduced two years ago.
 
Missed Opportunities
 "They missed a product cycle with the CM-5," said Terry Bennett, a computer industry analyst at Infocorp, a Santa Clara, Calif, market research company. After the CM-5 came on the market, it took more than nine months for the company to add a special math processing chip to provide its full performance.
Several years ago, moreover, Thinking Machines had an opportunity to merge with Cray Research, industry executives said. But the deal apparently collapsed after the two companies deadlocked over the value of Thinking Machines. Cray subsequently introduced its own massively parallel computer, called the T3D, which is challenging the CM-5.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Ford's Profit In 2d Quarter Set a Record

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 27

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company today reported all-time record quarterly earnings of $1.71 billion for the three months ending in June, as strong demand more than doubled the average profit the company made on each car and truck it sold.
Ford attributed the results, which amounted to $1.63 a share, to continued robust sales in the United States and a stronger than expected recovery in the European auto market. 
 But Ford was quick to say that its earnings, which exceeded the expectations of analysts, still lagged behind its own aspirations. "It isn't good enough," said David N. McCammon, the auto maker's vice president for finance and treasurer. "Our return on sales isn't to the level that we believe it needs to be."
 
Foreign Earnings Up Steeply
 Worldwide, Ford's revenue for the quarter was $33.8 billion, up 14.8 percent from $29.4 billion in the comparable quarter of 1993. The earnings were more than double last year's level of $775 million.
Still, Mr. McCammon said, Ford, the No. 2 auto maker, made only 69 percent as much as the Chrysler Corporation on each vehicle it sold in the quarter. To close the gap, he said, Ford must lower its vehicle-development and purchasing costs, and continue shifting production from cars to more profitable light trucks like sport utility vehicles.
Light trucks accounted for 53 percent of production in the second quarter, he said, up from 49 percent in the comparable period a year ago.
Given the strength of the recovery in the domestic auto market, Wall Street analysts said they were pleased yet appeared a bit blase about the earnings.
"They were obviously very strong results," said David Bradley, auto analyst for J. P. Morgan in New York. "The auto industry is doing fine, they're doing fine, and they should continue to do fine."
But in a down day on the market, shares of Ford fell $1, to $30.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Many investors have already discounted solid earnings from the Big Three auto makers.
Ford's previous earnings record for a quarter came in the second quarter of 1988, when the company made $1.66 billion. Partly because customers flock to dealerships in the spring, the second quarter tends to be the strongest of the year for the car companies. Chrysler reported all-time record earnings two weeks ago, and General Motors is expected to report strong earnings on Thursday.
Like Chrysler, Ford has been reducing rebates and other incentives to customers as demand has strengthened. The average incentive cost per vehicle during the second quarter was $550, down from $755 in the comparable period a year ago. In the first quarter this year, the average rebate was only $15 more, or $565.
Some analysts said they were worried that the costs were not dropping as fast as expected, which may help explain why Ford's profit margins were not fatter.
In addition, the company still sells a relatively high portion of its vehicles to commercial fleets, which negotiate lower prices by buying in bulk. In the second quarter, 25 percent of Ford's sales were to fleets, compared with 28 percent in the quarter a year ago.
 
More, Sooner
 While Ford's per-vehicle profit has jumped, it has not happened as fast as the company would like. Its after-tax return on automotive sales during the quarter was 4.2 percent, up 2.5 percentage points from the comparable quarter last year but below its goal of 6 percent for a strong second period. After taxes, the average profit per vehicle in the quarter was $945, more than twice last year's level of $462, but well below Chrysler's average of $1,360. G.M. makes less per vehicle than Ford.
With sales rising in an expanding market, Ford ended June with 25 percent of the United States car and truck sales, the same as a year ago.
Amid all this, the company has been hiring workers. At the end of the second quarter, Ford had 74,046 salaried workers in the United States, about 2,700 more than a year ago. It had 100,845 hourly workers, an increase of about 2,800.
The auto maker's earnings were bolstered by its performance in Europe, where its substantial reduction in employees and other cost-cutting moves in the last two years appear to be taking hold as economies begin strengthening. The company's European operations, excluding Jaguar, earned $244 million, compared with a loss of $66 million last year.
"The European economy is coming back quicker and stronger than we expected," Mr. McCammon said.
Jaguar continued to struggle during the quarter, losing $62 million, the same amount as last year. Mr. McCammon said Ford expected Jaguar to become profitable as soon as 1995. In December 1989, it paid $2.5 billion for the British luxury auto maker, and has since invested hundreds of millions more in it.
Also augmenting Ford's earnings was the strong performance of the financial-services subsidiaries. The wholly owned finance arm, Ford Credit, posted earnings for the quarter of $368 million, up 20.3 percent from $306 million in the comparable quarter last year.
The earnings were helped, as well, by a one-time gain of $31.4 million from the sale of Ford's minority interest in Manheim Auto Auctions, and another one-time gain of $13 million from the sale of receivables.

HEADLINE: State Says Giuliani's Budget Leaves a Gap of $600 Million

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Three days after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ordered up to $450 million in contingency cuts in the city's budget, the State Comptroller issued a stern critique of New York City's finances yesterday that concluded that the Mayor had still not done enough to avert a budget crunch in the coming months.
In a report that tempered enthusiasm for some of the Mayor's initiatives with criticisms of others, the Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, said the budget still included a gap of more than $600 million, caused by the failure to account for spending on things like overtime and pensions. 
 The Comptroller's report also identified another $150 million in risky assumptions or initiatives that have not yet come to pass, including increases in Federal aid and concessions from the city's municipal unions.
Mr. McCall said the city's budget problems had not been this severe this early in a fiscal year since the city regained full control of its budgets from the state's Financial Control Board in 1986, during the economically robust years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. And he warned that the city's fiscal position could worsen if the Mayor did not move quickly to plug the hole.
"If the Mayor doesn't close the gap with actions that produce recurring savings, the city will face larger gaps in future years," Mr. McCall said.
The report by Mr. McCall -- a Democrat who faces an election contest this fall -- is the first of three to be issued this week by the city's fiscal monitors. All are expected to point out serious risks in the Mayor's $31.6 billion budget, which was adopted by the City Council in June and took effect with the new fiscal year on July 1.
The state's Financial Control Board and the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, are to release similar reviews of the Mayor's budget today. Their reports are expected to identify as much as $1 billion in risky assumptions or initiatives and also to call for more steps to avert a shortfall.
The State Comptroller has no power to change the city's budget. But his critique, like those of the other fiscal monitors, is likely to influence Wall Street bond raters and investors, whose assessment of the city's fiscal health affects the interest rates New York must pay on money it borrows.
On Monday, Mr. Giuliani ordered the commissioners of each agency to come up with a 2.6 percent cut in spending across the board to build up the city's reserves by $250 million, to a total of $400 million by the fall. He also told them to prepare to cut another $200 million in case other parts of his budget unravel.
The Mayor's action, less than a month after his budget took effect, appeared to be timed at least in part to blunt the criticism from the monitors, although Mr. Giuliani said it was part of his long-planned strategy to control spending. He also had to address an unexpected $160 million hole in his budget caused by his failure to win legislative approval for money-saving initiatives in Albany and a shortfall of tax revenues in the last quarter.
 
Mayor's Brief Response
 Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani issued only a brief, muted response to the State Comptroller's report, focusing largely on Mr. McCall's praise of some initiatives, including the effort not to raise taxes.
"As I stated during my campaign and numerous times since then, this administration will continue to monitor city spending to insure that unnecessary expenditures are not made," the Mayor said.
The reports of the fiscal monitors underscore the difficulties that now confront Mr. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor who wants to show he has more control over the city's finances than his predecessors, particularly Mayor David N. Dinkins. Mr. McCall is an old friend and political ally of Mr. Dinkins.
Last July, Mr. Dinkins ordered new budget cuts totaling $130 million only two days after his $31.2 billion budget took effect. That budget, too, was roundly criticized by Wall Street bond raters and fiscal monitors, including Mr. McCall.
In his report, Mr. McCall said Mr. Giuliani had "moved aggressively" to close a budget gap of $2.3 billion without raising taxes. He also said the newest round of contingency cuts -- which he characterized as a spending freeze -- would help keep the budget balanced.
The Mayor's actions, though, risked violating government and legal mandates to provide certain levels of services, primarily for the poor or ill, the report said. And the contingency cuts "may strain the city's ability to provide essential services," it said.
The Comptroller's report concluded that the Mayor's budget would leave a shortfall of $600 million because it failed to address a number of problems.
The most serious of those were: $110 million in unbudgeted payroll and other costs at the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation; $150 million more in overtime costs than now estimated; $50 million in higher pension costs, and $45 million in savings from changes in laws regarding the city's liability in lawsuits, which have so far failed to win legislative approval in Albany.
The report also identified about $567 million in risky assumptions that had not yet panned out, including $200 million in new aid from the Federal Government, $200 million in savings in health benefits for city workers that must be approved by the unions and $65 million for the sale of the United Nations Plaza Hotel.
The risks still total $150 million -- on top of the $600 million in gaps -- even after accounting for the Mayor's contingency cuts and about $165 million in lower-than-anticipated bills left outstanding from previous years.
"I think the Mayor is stepping up to the problem," Mr. McCall said in an interview.
But noting that the city faces a budget gap of $2 billion next year and more in the years after, he said, "I think he's going about it incrementally."
Mr. McCall also said the Financial Control Board -- which includes himself, the Governor, the Mayor, the City Comptroller and members of the private sector -- should meet more frequently to create a forum for solving the city's long-term fiscal problems.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Fall on Surge In Durables

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday as the bond market gave a lukewarm reception to the Government's auction of $11 billion in five-year notes.
Behind much of the selling was an unexpected surge in orders for durable goods in June, which raised traders' worries about new inflationary pressures. Bond prices fell sharply and quickly in the morning after the Government released the report. 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond closed off 21/32 , or $6.56 for $1,000 of face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 7.61 percent, from 7.54 percent on Tuesday.
 
Back a Bit in Afternoon
 The bond market bounced back a bit in early afternoon trading after the Treasury's auction of five-year notes sale produced an average yield of 6.98 percent, the highest in three years. Still, some traders were disappointed by the five-year note sale, especially after the Treasury's surprisingly successful two-year note sale on Tuesday.
But other traders said the outcome was not so bad, considering that this week's new auction came on a day that the Commerce Department reported that orders for big-ticket items like automobiles and washing machines rose 1.3 percent in June -- triple the increase that many economists had expected.
Moreover, they said the bond market was concerned about a report scheduled for tomorrow on second-quarter gross domestic product, which could provide more hints of inflation.
"Some people may have expected a bit of an uptick once the auction was out of the way and they may have been disappointed because the market held in very well," said Matthew Alexy, government-trading strategist at CS First Boston.
"It was a fair auction, though, given that we have G.D.P. coming out this Friday," he said. "Ahead of that number, we're not going to see any major market move."
 
Economists Estimate G.D.P.
In a survey, economists estimated that the G.D.P. rose at an annualized rate of 4 percent in the second quarter, exceeding the 3.4 percent increase of the first quarter.
Traders fear the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates for a fifth time this year if the economy grew faster than expected.
"People are very interested in G.D.P. and after that the employment report," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. "But I'm surprised that many people are thinking the Fed could respond if G.D.P. growth is strong.
This is because the G.D.P. report is based on partial data, he said.
Nevertheless, the market has little else to focus on now that Congressional hearings on the Whitewater affair are "turning out to be a yawner," Mr. Moran said.
Dealers are also awaiting July's employment report due Aug. 5, and the Treasury's quarterly refunding during the second week of August to raise an estimated $40 billion for spending and maturing debt.
Meanwhile, the Fed added temporary reserves to the banking system via $2.5 billion customer repurchase agreements. Traders expects funds to open today around 4 1/4 percent, the Fed's target rate.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Confusion Abounds as Stocks Head Down

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Traders and investors differed yesterday over the outlook for the economy but stock and bond prices both still declined. Bond traders decided the economy was growing too fast and could spark inflation. They bid prices down for bonds. But stock traders concluded it was growing too slowly and could hurt earnings. They bid prices down for stocks.
The confusion continues the puzzlement that has gripped the markets all summer, as economic data continue to prove ambiguous, the course of the dollar defies Washington policy makers, and the Federal Reserve Board still appears ready to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year. 
 So far, the Dow Jones industrial average has given back about a quarter of the gains it made in the first two weeks of July.
The bond market, after rallying sharply in the second half of the month, has given up almost all those gains and is essentially back to where it was July 1. But long-term interest rates are still below the high yield for the year of 7.72 percent set for the 30-year bond on July 11.
 
Inventories Report Awaited
 Tomorrow both stock and bond market traders and investors will have to confront another key barometer of the economy -- the gross domestic product report for the second quarter. A rise in product inventories held by businesses could signal a slowing economy as consumers and businesses slow down spending.
Yesterday, the Dow dropped 15.21 points, to 3,720.47. Bond prices fell, prompting the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to rise as high as 7.612 percent before settling at 7.61 percent, up from 7.54 percent the previous day.
The immediate cause of the sour bond market was a Government report that showed unexpectedly strong orders for business durable goods, such costly purchases as computers, automobiles and railroad equipment. Durable goods orders in June were nearly triple the level expected by private economists -- 1.3 percent, instead of five-tenths of 1 percent.
Bond traders saw the orders as a sign of an unusually robust economy, which, so the thinking goes, is bound to lead to higher inflation or, at the very least, another increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Concern Held Unwarranted
 Bond traders therefore sold bonds, which decline in value if inflation is thought to be rising. But Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist for CS First Boston, said bond traders' concern was unwarranted.
"It does not deserve the attention that we're giving it," Mr. Alexy said, because the modest durable goods increase did not necessarily signal inflation. Bond prices improved quickly in the early afternoon after the Treasury Department sold $11 billion in five-year notes for a 6.98 percent yield, he noted, the highest in nearly three years but not exorbitantly expensive.
"The economy is growing steadily and solidly," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities. "The economy is never quite as strong as the people who are afraid that it is strong say it is and it is never quite as weak as the people who are afraid that it is weak."
The cause of the stock market drop was more subtle. As in the first quarter, earnings in the second quarter have been strong. Three stocks contained in the Dow industrial average -- Du Pont, Walt Disney and Allied Signal -- reported record earnings that were above analysts' expectations.
Yet the Dow over all declined because some traders apparently concluded that the strong earnings were too strong and that corporate earnings had peaked -- the sign of an economy slowed by four increases in short-term interest rates by the Fed. The Dow fell because prices dropped for economically sensitive stocks like Aluminum Company of America, International Paper,and Caterpillar.
Ford, which doubled its quarterly profit, contributed to the too-strong-for-its-own-good talk when David N. McCammon, Ford's treasurer, told reporters the second quarter would likely be the best quarter of the year. Ford's stock fell 1 1/4, to 30 1/4.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was again low at 251.8 million shares, or some 12 percent below this year's average of 288 million shares. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.79 point, to 452.57. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 3.53 points, to 712.13.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.40 point, to 249.84, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 897 to 1,272. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.48 point, to 434.02.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 14 fell, led by Aluminum Company of America, which fell 2 3/4, to 77 7/8, on no immediate news. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, some 235 fell.

HEADLINE: 21 Enterprise Zones Created, Including 4 in New York City

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
To encourage economic development in impoverished areas across the state, New York State officials yesterday named 21 special new enterprise zones, including four in New York City, to receive tax breaks and other incentives aimed at attracting business to distressed neighborhoods.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, seeking to spread around one of the few bounties he has to offer as he seeks a fourth term, announced the expansion of the state's existing economic development zone program from the current 19 areas to a total of 40 different locations. 
 Under the state program, which was first established in 1986, businesses that locate in designated areas of high unemployment and poverty are eligible for a mix of tax credits, low-interest loans, reduced property taxes and discount utility bills. The size of each zone is limited to two square miles.
 
'Aggressively Hospitable'
 "The zone program is an important part of our strategy of being aggressively hospitable to business and increasing jobs," Governor Cuomo said. "We want to make sure that the new prosperity we are bringing to New York reaches every part of our state and benefits all New Yorkers."
Asked whether the expansion, which was authorized in legislation approved last year, was timed to help his re-election bid, Mr. Cuomo replied, "The only way I can escape the question of such programs being politically motivated is to drop dead."
"When I do my job," he added, "you guys say that it's politically motivated."
New York State, based on a review of its seven-year-old enterprise-zone effort by a consulting firm, contends that its program has helped create 4,500 new jobs and stimulate nearly $750 million in business investments. Officials did not put a price tag on the how much the state was giving up in tax revenues because of the program. They argue that much of the investment would never have occurred -- and therefore the taxes would never have been collected -- if the zones did not exist.
But some critics assert that local enterprise zones, which have been put in place in 37 states and the District of Columbia, often do little more than shift jobs and business from one site to another.
 
Some Advantages
 Recent academic research suggests that enterprise zones, while of limited benefit, do offer some advantages. Margaret G. Wilder of Cornell University and Barry M. Rubin of Indiana University found that "enterprise zones appear to have some capacity to stimulate new employment and investment in certain areas," but warned that they "do not possess magical qualities which can overcome all physical, social and economic barriers to revitalization."
The expansion of the state program comes as the Clinton Administration is planning by the end of the year to designate six sizable "empowerment zones" within impoverished areas of major American cities to receive $100 million in grants and other Federal benefits. A part of New York City beginning as a broad swath of Harlem and extending into the South Bronx around Yankee Stadium is expected to be one of the six.
An additional 65 smaller urban neighborhoods around the country will also be named as "enterprise communities," receiving $3 million each.
The new state zones range from one end of New York to the another.
 
New Zone for Buffalo
 Buffalo, for instance, will receive a new zone divided into three sections, aimed at redeveloping the Ellicott District, an area in the northeast of the city around two General Motors factories, and a section that includes the former Republic Steel plant. In Ulster County, Kingston and Ulster are to benefit from a zone that includes several large buildings vacated by I.B.M.
Within New York City, four new areas were selected to go along with the existing zones, which are at Port Morris in the Bronx, East Harlem in Manhattan, South Jamaica in Queens and East New York in Brooklyn. The new zones in the city are the Hunts Point area of the Bronx, Sunset Park and Red Hook in Brooklyn, Far Rockaway, Queens, and the north shore of Staten Island from the Goethals Bridge to the home port naval station.
In the wider New York metropolitan area, the Bellport area of Brookhaven on Long Island was named as a new state economic development zone. It joins a zone in Islip and another in Yonkers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark On Surge in Durable Goods

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark again yesterday after an economic report raised concern about American inflation and sent bond prices lower.
But the dollar rebounded from early losses against the Japanese yen after an influential economist with close ties to the Clinton Administration said the United States and Japan were likely to reach an agreement on opening Japanese markets to American goods, making trade sanctions unnecessary. 
 Falling Treasury bond prices dragged the dollar lower after the Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 1.3 percent in June -- more than expected. The report suggested that the economy was growing fast enough to generate higher inflation. Currency traders watch bonds' performance for signs that international investors might be selling off dollar-denominated investments.
"The durable goods report put the fear of God into the bond market, and that sent the dollar lower as well," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5749 marks, down from 1.5839 marks on Tuesday. But it rose to 98.45 yen from 98.30 yen.
The robust rise in durable goods orders raised speculation that a report to be released tommorow on gross domestic product will show that the economy grew at a rapid clip in the second quarter, analysts said.
Strong growth could raise concerns that the Fed is not raising interest rates fast enough to control inflation, said Amy Smith, senior currency market strategist at IDEA. If that is the case, bonds and the dollar will be vulnerable, she said.
The dollar fared better against the yen today after C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, was quoted on the cable television channel CNBC as saying that the United States and Japan were likely to make progress in coming months in talks aimed at balancing trade between the nations. He also said the American trade deficit with Japan was beginning to narrow.
Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States means that its exporters have a constant supply of dollars they must sell for yen when they return revenue to Japan.
Every Japanese exporter "has dollars to sell," said Peter Gloyne, manager of institutional foreign-exchange trading at the First National Bank of Chicago. As long as that is the case, he said, "the dollar won't break back above 100 yen."
The dollar weakened against most other leading currencies yesterday, falling to 1.3345 Swiss francs from 1.3455 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5325 from $1.5245.

WHO wants to pay for universal health coverage? The answer, as the current debate is making all too clear, is no one. Indeed, for some interests who have campaigned for change -- notably big business -- the whole idea is to shed part of their financial burden.
But as a flock of studies have shown, the contretemps over who pays is a shell game: One way or another, households with above-average incomes, not businesses or government, would almost certainly pick up the tab for broader coverage. And President Clinton's understandable wish to obscure this reality may prove too clever by half. "He may end up without a good bill -- or the support to push a mediocre one through Congress," said Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. 
 Most Americans below age 65 have private medical insurance, and most of them receive it as a fringe benefit. So it was easy to see why the White House chose to build on the current system, requiring all employers to do what most now do to attract and keep valued workers. In fact, the political case for expanding the employer mandate seemed like a no-brainer when the President's task force was assembling the Health Security Act.
Those working without insurance would obviously be delighted by the prospect of something for nothing. More important, big businesses would be pleased, since they had much to gain: Their current premiums are inflated by doctors and hospitals, who look to private insurance to cover the costs of the uninsured and to supplement reimbursements offered by Medicare and Medicaid.
Organized labor, too, likes the idea of an employer mandate. Among other virtues it would take the pressure off unions, which have been asked to share employee medical costs by companies claiming to need the break to remain competitive.
But the politics of mandates has proved subtler than was widely reckoned.
To woo small businesses, which typically do not provide health insurance today, Mr. Clinton offered subsidies linked to the number of employees. The subsidy rate has proved inadequate to break small- business resistance, however -- indeed, the concession seems to have invigorated lobbyists who scent weakness like wolves on the hunt. And the subsidy has alienated big businesses, which assume they will somehow be stuck with the cost.
Most galling from the perspective of economists, the subsidy is sloppily targeted. While small businesses do employ a disproportionate share of low-wage workers, tens of thousands of beneficiaries of the subsidy would be middle- and upper-income employees. "It doesn't make any sense at all," Mr. Reinhardt said.
The broader economic problem is that the employer mandate is built on a misunderstanding. Virtually everyone thinks the money would come from employers' pockets. But there is a huge body of research by labor economists suggesting that employees as a group bear the costs. In one classic study published in 1991, Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. and Alan Kreuger of Princeton found that 85 percent of workers' compensation insurance costs were reflected in lower wages.
This finding implies that an "individual mandate" requiring families to buy health insurance, with subsidies for those who can't afford it, would generate roughly the same impact on incomes. And indeed, a new study by John Holahan, Sheila Zedlewski and Colin Winterbottom of the Urban Institute confirms it.
The research, commissioned by the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimates that the President's employer mandate would transfer roughly 6 percent of the income from families in the top fifth of the economic pecking order to pay for the care of the bottom fifth. So would an individual mandate, with insurance premiums linked to income. For that matter, so does the current system, in which a portion of private health insurance premiums along with tax revenues are siphoned from the rich to pay for both the uninsured and those insured by the Government.
But while the individual approach would certainly make it clear who was really paying, it is hardly an ideal way to finance medical costs. Subsidies that made insurance affordable to the near-poor, Ms. Zedlewski notes, would discourage work effort by sharply rising insurance bills as incomes approached middle-class levels.
Isn't there a better way? Mr. Reinhardt is a fan of the German system, which fudges the political issue of whether employers or employees pay by collecting a fixed percentage of payrolls to cover health costs.
If Americans really understood the bottom line, he believes they would opt to eliminate mandates entirely and cover medical costs from a broad-based tax, much the way they pay for Medicare and Medicaid today. For contrary to the conventional wisdom about "single payer" systems, the approach need not go hand in hand with socialized medicine.
"You could collect the money in one pot," Mr. Reinhardt said, "and still use it to finance Clinton-style managed competition."

HEADLINE: Japanese Offering Ford a Loan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 27

 BODY:
With the Japanese Government struggling to reduce anger over the nation's towering trade surpluses and financially pressed Japanese investors pulling their capital back home, the Export-Import Bank of Japan is negotiating a huge, politically sensitive loan to the Ford Motor Company.
The unusual loan being considered by the Government-controlled bank, which could run as much as $300 million, would be aimed at helping Ford manufacture right-hand-drive autos for export to Japan. That, in turn, could help reduce the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, which is expected to be as high as $60 billion for 1994. 
 The negotiations with Ford are one sign that the Government, which has resisted the Clinton Administration's demands that it guarantee increased purchases of American goods to whittle down the surplus, is anxiously looking for other ways of narrowing the deficit and, not least, earning some good will in the United States.
 
A Favored Rate
 Though the loan is not yet final, its motivation was evident in the terms under which it would be made.
Interest would be paid at a concessionary rate of slightly more than 4 percent. The Export-Import Bank says that is normal for its specialized lending. It is, however, well below the 7.25 percent prime lending rate offered by commercial banks in the United States, even below the more favorable rates often available to big corporate borrowers, like Ford. Thus, it could save Ford many millions of dollars in interest payments.
Officially, the Export-Import Bank denied a report of the loan this morning in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business newspaper.
"It is not true that anything like this has been done," said Seiichiro Shimamoto, a bank spokesman.
 
Breadth of Discussions
 However, other officials said that while no decision had been made, talks had been under way with Ford. "At this point, the report was premature," one official said, "but there have been discussions."
Indeed, all three United States auto makers said today that they had discussed the low-rate loans with the Japanese Export-Import Bank, but Ford appeared to be furthest along in the negotiations.
David N. McCammon, vice president for finance and treasurer of Ford, confirmed that the company was in preliminary negotiations with the Japanese lender. "We didn't ask them; they came to us," he said. "Anybody that comes forward and has low-rate financing, we're interested in." He said Ford had discussed a loan of $300 million, but emphasized that the terms remained uncertain.
Whether or not the loan goes through, it demonstrates the lengths to which Tokyo is willing to go to improve badly strained relations with the United States. This is particularly true now, with the two nations having only a few days to a deadline for completing negotiations on increasing Japanese Government procurement of foreign telecommunications and medical equipment.
The Clinton Administration insists that after more than a year of fruitless talks the Japanese institute procedures to insure a steady increase in purchases of the telecommunications and medical products. Tokyo, in turn, refuses to establish what it regards as quotas.
If no deal is reached by July 31, the United States may begin a procedure that could lead to sanctions against Japanese imports within 60 days, the first shot in a possible trade war.
 
Japanese Agency's Evolution
 Several years ago, this country's Export-Import Bank was transformed from a low-key institution that provided cut-rate loans to assist Japanese importers and exporters into a bank with a political as well as economic mission. Japan was trying to develop an argument that the huge trade surpluses piling up here were actually benefiting the global economy because they were being "recycled" in the form of productive investments in other countries.
Those efforts were redoubled as the flood of capital that Japanese investors sent abroad during the late 1980's dried up because of a recession at home. A greater burden fell on the Government to show that recycling was working.
The Export-Import Bank took on a new life, providing multibillion-dollar loans to developing countries that needed funds -- Mexico, for one. These loans were not, as had sometimes been true in the past, tied to the purchase of Japanese goods or services. More recently, the bank turned its focus from the third world to industrial nations.
 
West London to California
 For instance, the Export-Import Bank made a loan of 125 million -- slightly more than $190 million -- to help finance construction of a rail line from Paddington Station in London to Heathrow Airport. It invested $12 million in construction of a new Los Angeles harbor facility for the export of coal.
The bank has also starting making low-cost loans to private companies to assist them in exporting products to Japan. These have included a $46.6 million loan to Space Systems/Loral Inc., a maker of satellites, and a $117 million loan to help a subsidiary of LM Ericsson of Sweden export cellular-telephone equipment to Japan.
Export-Import Bank officials have said the bank is actively scouting for more opportunities to make targeted loans in the United States, particularly to state and local governments. The money could be used to develop local infrastructure projects and possibly earn good will from organizations in need of cash.
In fact, three years ago the bank seriously considered a plea for such loans from three Southern governors eager to get the low-interest loans and in the process increase their national stature, including the then-Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: BEHIND THE SCENES;
Hybrid Organization Serves as a Conductor for the Health Care Orchestra

SERIES: Special Pleaders: A periodic look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
These are heady days for Families USA, an unusual advocacy group that has become the de facto public relations manager of the Clinton Administration's campaign for comprehensive health care legislation.
Using a careful mix of statistics, hard-luck stories and staged political events, Families USA has played an important behind-the-scenes role in shaping public perceptions of the nation's health care problems. 
 For example, when the "Oprah Winfrey Show" and all four major networks reported on the man who went to jail last year for lending his insurance card to an injured friend rather than risk letting the friend, who had no insurance, be turned away from the emergency room, it was Families USA that brought the case to the networks' attention. The group organized a news conference the day before the man went to jail.
And last month, when NBC broadcast a two-hour special on the health care debate, with money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, several of the people who told their stories came from the Families USA "misery bank," a listing of people who have had problems with health insurance. In the four years since the list was compiled, it has been used by scores of reporters looking for examples to use in their reports on health policy.
 
Wealth of Statistics
 Then, each time lawmakers and health experts cite statistics like the 2 million Americans who lose their medical insurance each month or the 50 million Americans who lose or lack health insurance for at least part of every year, they are relying on Families USA, which circulates data inglossy monthly research reports.
These days, many of the staff workers from the Families USA headquarters are in the basement boiler room, where representatives from unions, health and other groups are organizing the Health Security Express, the bus caravan now driving across the country to rally support for universal health care.
So far the caravan has not been a ringing success, neither drawing large crowds nor the kind of favorable news reports that organizers hoped for. On a recent morning, the boiler room was going full tilt, with dozens of people from dozens of organizations cranking out press kits, recruiting riders, figuring out how much time the fish barbeque should get on the schedule and wooing local politicians to join the rallies.
At the center of it all was Arnold Bennett, Families USA's media director. For weeks now, he has started his mornings with an early visit to the White House, to discuss the selling of universal health care.
Mr. Bennett's most important contribution, though, may have been the strategy he devised three years ago for selling the middle class on the need for health care overhaul, a strategy that has been adopted wholesale by the Clinton Administration and many members of Congress. It comes down to a simple spin on the issue: emphasize people's fears of losing their insurance and play down the plight of the uninsured.
"Most Americans are not uninsured, but most Americans are afraid of losing their insurance," said Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA. "Generally, people act out of self-interest, not out of altruism. So if you want them to care about health reform, you don't talk about the uninsured, you talk about people who have lost their insurance. We shaped that message."
Unlike other interest groups that have tried to retain more independence, and more leverage over the White House, while promoting the same basic goals, Families USA has cast its lot squarely with the Clintons.
"We don't see it as Families USA doing Clinton's work," Mr. Pollack said. "We think Clinton has adopted what we've pushed since before he was a candidate."
 
Others Use Techniques
 In contrast to Families USA, the Health Care Reform Project, a broad coalition of labor, consumer and health groups headed by John Rother of the American Association of Retired Persons, describes itself as "a coalition of groups that support health reform but have not endorsed the Clinton bill."
That group, adopting some of the selling techniques used by Families USA, was responsible for the recent commercials accusing Pizza Hut of hypocrisy for insuring workers abroad but not at home.
Families USA is the creation of a rich Massachusetts businessman, Philippe Villers, who founded the $40 million Villers Foundation to help the elderly and then orchestrated its evolution into today's advocacy group, known first as Families United for Senior Action and more recently as it took on broader health care issues, as Families USA.
Families USA, which calls itself a national consumer group, operates both a tax-exempt educational foundation and a lobbying arm, contributions to which are taxable. Using direct mail appeals, it has put together a modest membership, including a network of 12,000 people who will write letters to Congress or make calls whenever Families USA sounds the alert.
 
Without a Constituency
 But while most advocacy groups exist to represent their constituencies (the American Association of Retired Persons, for example, serves the interests of its 33 million members), Families USA has no real constituency. Instead, its staff of 36 seeks to advance the goals of Mr. Villers and his hand-picked board of directors.
It was not always clear that health care would be the target of the fortune Mr. Villers amassed as founder of the Computervision Corporation.
Mr. Villers said he had known all along that he wanted to devote his money to bringing about some kind of social change. He said he settled on health care for the elderly as his group's mission after he had been convinced that his initial idea of trying to do something about unemployment caused by economic cycles was unworkable.
After deciding to focus on health care, starting with long-term-care for the elderly, his organization began giving grants, passing out some $16 million to strengthen or develop state and local groups interested in the subject. These days, Families USA receives far more grant money than it gives out: only about $1 million of the group's $4 million annual budget is Villers money, compared with $2 million from other foundations.
 
Models for Action
 "My role models, in thinking about what I wanted to accomplish, were the women's movement and the civil rights movement," said Mr. Villers, a small mild-mannered man who works out of a modest office above a bank in Concord, Mass.
And if health care legislation passes, he said, he will feel he has achieved something of comparable scope.
"It's been very gratifying," he said. "If we get health care reform passed, there will be many people who played a role, but it might not have have happened without us. How many people can say they had a chance to influence the most important social policy change in their lifetime? That's heady stuff."
While not everyone would agree that Families USA has played the central role in promoting health care change, it is beyond dispute that the group has been effective both in getting the issue to the top of the political agenda and in framing the debate.
 
Consistent Message
 Last week, amid the commotion over whether Mr. Clinton would stick with the goal of universal coverage or accept something less, like 95 percent coverage, Mr. Bennett was working overtime to keep the message consistent and to keep the spotlight on those who might lose insurance and away from the question of who will pay for the uninsured.
"Of course we're for universal coverage," he said. "No one is backing away from that. But the message is that this plan means no American will ever again have to worry about losing their insurance. When you talk about universal coverage, people start to worry about paying for someone else. When you talk about losing insurance, it sounds like something that will protect them."
The ties between Families USA and Bill Clinton were forged even before Mr. Clinton became President. Mr. Pollack and Mr. Bennett first met Mr. Clinton in September 1991, after Mr. Pollack and Phyllis Torda, the group's director of health policy, published an article arguing that while a Canadian-style single-payer health care system would work well for Americans, political realists would do better to push for less radical change.
At this point, the line between Families USA and the Clinton Administration has blurred somewhat. Mr. Bennett himself says it is not always clear to his audience whether he is talking for Families USA or for the White House.
But he and Mr. Pollack bristle at charges that the group has lost its independence. "It's untrue and it hurts our image," Mr. Bennett said. "Of course, it hurts our image. But who cares? What's important is winning the fight for health reform, not protecting our image."
Still, Mr. Pollack said, Families USA has paid a price for its closeness to the White House.
"We haven't gotten some grants we otherwise would have gotten," Mr. Pollack said.
Lately, there have been some tensions between the groups who are pushing to revamp the health care system.
 
Tension Between Groups
 Some groups have become loath to work with Families USA, feeling that Mr. Bennett and Mr. Pollack hog too much publicity. Others dismiss Families USA as a co-opted lobbying arm of the Clinton Administration, although a few concede that they envy its freedom to pay more attention to the White House agenda than to the more narrow interests dictated by their own members.
And for their part, both Mr. Pollack and Mr. Bennett express irritation that the other groups are not more willing to put aside their own agendas and work harder for health care legislation.
"There's been this chorus of 'I like the plan but,' and that does not help the bill get passed," Mr. Pollack said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Repression: Still an Issue

 BODY:
Last year President Clinton found a constructive way to heal the rift between Congress and the White House on China, linking Beijing's trade privileges to modest improvements in its human rights performance. But this year, after an aggressive business lobbying campaign, the President junked his own solution and extended trade privileges unconditionally. Now it is up to Congress to try to repair the damage. It can begin by passing legislation that would re-link tariff rates for certain Chinese goods to minimum human rights standards.
The annual struggles over China's tariffs stem from the outrage many Americans felt when Deng Xiaoping ordered army tanks to mow down students demonstrating for democracy in Beijing's Tiananmen Square five years ago. But the issue is no longer just Tiananmen. That one barbaric act unmasked the true nature of a regime that was known abroad mainly for its economic reforms. 
 Now people are more aware that China tortures prisoners, persecutes religious believers and is waging a sustained assault against the indigenous culture of Tibet. It also profits from selling Americans the products of prison labor and violates human rights pledges to Washington. China will continue to flout international norms as long as it believes it is immune from serious retaliation.
Today a House subcommittee holds hearings on a bill introduced by Nancy Pelosi, Richard Gephardt and David Bonior that would impose high tariffs on products made or exported by the Chinese Army or associated military companies or by certain state industries previously named by the U.S. Trade Representative as possible targets for retaliation in trade disputes. Exports from private businesses and joint ventures would be exempt. About a sixth of Chinese exports would be affected.
The bill also asks the Administration to encourage U.S. businesses in China to follow a voluntary code of conduct, a step Mr. Clinton said he favored at the time he abandoned his own human rights sanctions but seems to have lost interest in since.
The point is not to punish China, but to maximize the positive influence the U.S. could exercise as China's biggest customer. Beijing's sales to the U.S., from which it earns almost four times as much as it pays out for purchases here, are indispensable to China's development. China's leaders understand this very well, even if America's do not.
The Pelosi-Gephardt-Bonior bill enjoys wide support and could win a majority when it comes to the House floor, probably next week. A companion Senate bill has been introduced by George Mitchell.
Given the likelihood of a Presidential veto, it is doubtful that these bills will ever become law. Still, they may help teach both Chinese leaders and Mr. Clinton that the human rights issue will not go away until China starts treating its people decently.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Sharply Vs. the Yen

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The dollar rose to its highest level against the Japanese yen in a month yesterday, breaking back through the psychologically important 100 yen level and extending a bounce that began more than a week ago.
Analysts said the main reason for the dollar's rally yesterday was a rumor that the longstanding bilateral trade dispute between the United States and Japan would be resolved by July 31, the deadline Washington has set for deciding whether to take steps toward trade sanctions. 
 But in the next breath foreign exchange traders cautioned that there was more sum than substance to the dollar's performance. The day's gains, they pointed out, came during a session when trading was quite light, which means the dollar's surge may have been exaggerated.
 
Trade Deadline Looming
 "I don't think anyone made any portfolio changes," Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. "Big numbers were not being thrown around. There were trades in the $10 million and $20 million range, not in the hundreds of millions or billions."
Indeed, the dollar slipped slightly below 100 yen in morning trading in Tokyo today, then hovered at about 100 yen in the early afternoon.
With the trade deadline looming and an important economic report scheduled to be released in Washington this morning, Mr. Witten and other traders said traders and investors did not want to speculate against the dollar. The Commerce Department this morning releases the first report on second-quarter economic growth.
"It's a little confusing trying to differentiate between a shift in portfolios or a shift in positions in advance of two significant events," said one foreign exchange trader, who asked not to be identified.
"After this weekend, the signals will be a little clearer on what the investor world is thinking," he added.
 
Late New York Figure
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 100.10 yen, up 1.5 percent from Wednesday's closing quote of 98.45 yen. In yen terms, the dollar has not been this strong since June 28. The dollar hit its post-World War II low against the yen on July 12, at 96.60 yen.
"That was the drop-dead low," Mr. Witten said. "Ever since then things have been sort of positive. Today's move was a continuation of a trend that has been in place, and now we have this trade news."
The dollar also rose against the German mark in New York yesterday, to 1.5920 marks from 1.5749 marks on Wednesday.
Even though trading volume was light, rumors about people buying dollars were everywhere.
The Bank of Japan was said to be a buyer, first in Asia and later in New York through its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And some traders said they had heard that Saudi accounts were buying dollars to purchase United States Treasury securities and were selling bonds denominated in yen.
Analysts said that if the rumors about a trade settlement were borne out, the dollar could quickly move higher, perhaps by as much as 10 percent against the yen.
The long-simmering trade dispute has thrown foreign investors into a funk since February, the analysts said, making them unwilling or fearful of putting money into dollar-denominated assets and masking over positive fundamental factors -- an expanding economy in a low-inflation environment -- that would otherwise be helping the currency.
"Starting with the collapse of trade talks with Japan in February, most investors concluded that the Clinton Administration was at best indifferent to or at worst was actively trying to depreciate the dollar against the yen," John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said.
"The unfortunate side-effect of that conclusion was that foreign investors, including the Japanese, were reluctant to increase holdings of dollar-denominated assets," he added.
Even coordinated intervention by the United States and its allies to buy dollars to support the American currency has had little impact on investors' views.
Rumors that the trade impasse might be broken were somewhat surprising, because in recent weeks Clinton Administration and Congressional officials with trade responsibilities have been increasingly gloomy about the likelihood of a breakthrough in the talks.
 
Trade Talks to Resume
 American and Japanese negotiators are scheduled to sit down again today, and talk of the potential for a trade accord took hold in the currency market even as American officials played down the possibility.
Currency traders took heart from a comment by Charlene Barshefsky, a deputy United States trade representative, who said early in the day that the Administration did not plan to delay the July 31 deadline. Some dealers interpreted that to mean that the Americans expect to strike a deal and therefore will not need to extend the deadline.
"It's hard to tell if the rumors and leaks we are getting are real, or if they are a negotiating ploy by one side or another," the unnamed foreign exchange trader said.
"Most people are of the view that there will be an agreement, but that it will not be terribly significant."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Seeks Continued Federal Funds for Housing Police

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Pressing his plan to merge New York City's three police departments, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sought assurances today that the Federal Government would maintain its financial support for policing the city's housing projects in exchange for a city commitment to maintain or improve police services there.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development now pays about one-third the cost of supporting the 2,500-member housing force, or roughly $75 million a year. Any withdrawal of that support could jeopardize Mr. Giuliani's plan to transform the housing force, along with the transit police force, into a bureau of the main Police Department. 
 Mr. Giuliani, who came here to lobby Congressional leaders to protect the city's interests in fields from crime to health care, met with the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Henry G. Cisneros, to discuss the housing police.
The Mayor said he pledged to maintain police services at existing levels, or improve them, in exchange for the Federal money. Speaking to reporters later, he said that the city would draft proposed arrangements soon and that Mr. Cisneros had been encouraging.
 
Support Contingent on Results
 The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Joseph Shuldiner, said in a telephone interview that the department's concern was in maintaining public safety in the Housing Authority projects and that precisely how the city policed them was a local decision. He said the department had asked the Mayor for a detailed plan that would show how the proposed merger would affect safety conditions.
Mr. Giuliani said he suggested that if the city could improve safety conditions in public housing, it might deserve more Federal money. One of the Mayor's arguments for the merger was that while reported crime had fallen in the subways and the city as a whole, it had not decreased in public housing, and that a merger could improve management of police resources.
Mr. Shuldiner said the department might consider making its continued support contingent on "certain results or outcomes," like reduced reports of crime, or surveys showing that residents felt safer.
 
Bonus Payments Possible
 Mr. Shuldiner added that such an arrangement could result in bonus payments if the city improved conditions, or be simply a requirement of continued support. He acknowlegded that it might be hard to agree on what would constitute improvements.
As Mr. Giuliani sought support for the plan, City Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens announced that he would introduce a bill in the Council that would force the Mayor to get the Council's authorization before the merger could take place. Complaining that the administration had not "presented us with a single piece of paper," Mr. McCaffrey said the final determination on the merger "should be an executive and legislative decision."
He said he had major reservations about the merger, and he raised questions about whether transit or housing officers would be diverted from their duties to cover big events like the ticker-tape parade held last month for the New York Rangers. But he added that he had not seen enough information from the administration to decide whether he would support the merger.
Mr. McCaffrey said he felt he would have the support of a solid majority of Council members.
Meanwhile, the proposed merger met with near-unanimous opposition last night at a public hearing in Harlem held by Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright. Many people in the audience of about 300 said they feared that the Police Department would neglect housing projects and would be less sensitive to racial tensions than the housing police force, which has a higher proportion of minority officers.

HEADLINE: Minorities Get More Mortgages

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
A group of financial regulatory agencies announced today that the number of mortgages issued to black and Hispanic borrowers rose sharply last year, but that these applicants remained substantially more likely than whites to be denied home loans.
The group, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which is made up of five agencies, announced that the number of home loans issued to blacks rose 36.1 percent last year while the number issued to Hispanic borrowers climbed 23.6 percent. For whites, the increase was 17.1 percent. 
 Loan applications were denied less often last year than in 1992 for all ethnic groups, the council said. Blacks remained twice as likely as whites to be denied home loans, and Hispanics were one and a half times as likely. But the gap narrowed slightly in each case.
Even when income differences were taken into account, blacks and Hispanics remained substantially more likely than whites to be denied loans, the council said. Financial institutions attributed most of the denials to applicants' lack of adequate credit histories, the council said, but it added, "The extent to which racial discrimination may account for these differences is not known."
 
Two Trends Seen
 Deepak Bhargava, the legislative director of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a New Orleans-based group that advocates affordable housing, said the slight improvement announced today appeared to reflect two trends: Regulators are putting a little more pressure on banks to avoid racial discrimination, and low interest rates have helped make it possible for more people in low-income neighborhoods, including some blacks and Hispanics, to buy homes.
Loans rose the most last year for families earning less than 80 percent of the median family income in their metropolitan areas, the council said.
The volume of mortgages soared in 1993 as many people refinanced their homes, taking out new mortgages at low interest rates and using the money to pay off older mortgages at higher rates. The increases in volumes of loans are for financial institutions that reported figures in both 1992 and 1993.
Clinton Administration officials have repeatedly urged banks, savings and loan associations and mortgage companies to examine their lending procedures to avoid any unfairness toward people in low-income neighborhoods or minority groups.

HEADLINE: Fidelity's Bet on Macy Debt Paid Off

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Perhaps the most active behind-the-scenes player in the Macy-Federated drama was Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual fund com pany.
Fidelity is no stranger to the close-knit world of bankruptcy investing, where it has used its substantial financial muscle to influence the outcome of several big bankruptcy cases including Bally's Grand, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Mcorp. 
 But Fidelity's investment in Macy -- bank debt with a face value of $522 million and bonds with a face value of $81 million -- is the largest position Fidelity has ever taken in a company that is in bankruptcy.
Despite its hefty stake, the Macy case did not unfold as Daniel Harmetz, Fidelity's 31-year-old bankruptcy Wunderkind, and his colleague, Judy K. Mencher, 37, its associate general counsel, anticipated. They had bet that they could ally themselves with management and get Macy out of bankruptcy quickly, a strategy they had used to reap fat profits in several large bankruptcy cases.
 
 
A Complex and Bitter Case
 But the complexity of Macy's capital structure and the company's high profile guaranteed a level of contentiousness. And Macy's retailing problems were worse than anyone had known, which slowed its progress in bankruptcy.
Fidelity nonetheless reaped a handsome 30 percent rate of return on its Macy investment, which will enrich shareholder returns for its Capital and Income and Magellan mutual funds, among others.
Getting involved in the Macy bankruptcy was unusual for Fidelity. "I have always been very negative on retailers in bankruptcy," Mr. Harmetz said. He avoided them because retail companies are heavily reliant on the good will of their suppliers, which can hold up needed merchandise in bankruptcies. Customers may also be put off by the notion of bankruptcy. And retailers are always susceptible to fluctuations in the economy.
 
 
A Retailing Gem
 But David Glancy, now the manager of Fidelity's Spartan High Income fund but then a retailing industry analyst at Fidelity, convinced Mr. Harmetz that Macy's was a gem among retailers, with a national reach and some of the nation's best shopping mall real estate. "The bricks and mortar were not really replicable," Mr. Harmetz said. "They had true value."
Ms. Mencher's analysis of the legal technicalities and Mr. Glancy's estimates of the real estate values indicated that the $560 million of bank loans issued when Macy bought Bullock's, the West Coast department store chain, was the best buy. So shortly after Macy's filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 27, 1992, Fidelity began assembling a share of that debt.
Ultimately, Fidelity acquired enough of a stake in Macy's debt to block any reorganization proposal that was not to its liking.
But the size of its stake did not make the proceedings any easier for Fidelity. "I found it extremely difficult to deal with the slow progress," Mr. Harmetz said. "You would have two steps forward, one step back -- and the steps forward were baby steps."
The peculiarities of the Macy case forced Fidelity to abandon some of its tried-and-true methods for gaining the upper hand in a bankruptcy. Typically, Fidelity would ally itself with a debtor's management, but Macy's executives, while polite, were aloof.
 
 
Sharing With Creditors
 Unable to build a strong alliance with management, Mr. Harmetz and Ms. Mencher set out to unite their fellow senior creditors, each of which believed its claims against the company were better than the others. Fidelity's motives were questioned by other creditors who suspected the Fidelity team was looking to enrich itself at their expense. So Fidelity, as a show of good faith, handed negotiating power for one set of claims over to two fellow creditors, Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais.
"Ceding some control seems like a bad idea, but it took the pressure off of us," Mr. Harmetz said.
Hiring outside advisers was another first for Fidelity, which usually relies solely on Ms. Mencher's and Mr. Harmetz's skills at working the bankruptcy laws. But on the Macy case, Fidelity retained Wasserstein, Perella & Company for advice on merger issues and Stutman, Treister & Glatt, a prestigious Los Angeles law firm, for legal counsel.
Hiring such high-priced professionals raised Fidelity's costs, but Mr. Harmetz said their involvement helped increase Fidelity's returns by more than a few cents on the dollar. And by his reckoning, every extra penny allocated to cover Fidelity's claims increased its total return by $5.5 million. "We figured we could allocate a cent for outside advice," he said.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Looks At Ex-Fed Official's Role

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
A former governor of the Federal Reserve System has become the target of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the possible misuse of secret central bank information.
The S.E.C. is looking into whether the former governor, Wayne D. Angell, illegally received or passed on inside information this spring. At the time he was warning clients that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates significantly. Mr. Angell, who completed an eight-year term at the Fed in February and became chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company in April, said there was nothing to investigate.
 
Cleared in One Inquiry
 The inquiry comes on the heels of an internal Fed investigation that found no evidence of wrongdoing and after calls for further scrutiny of Mr. Angell from Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, the chairman of the House Banking Committee. People familiar with the case said that it was highly unusual and that they could not remember another like it in Fed history. 
 Mr. Angell's lawyer, Dennis J. Block of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said the S.E.C. was trying to determine whether Mr. Angell had violated Federal securities laws that prohibit fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, including a Government bond or a futures contract or option.
Specifically, according to Mr. Block, the S.E.C. is examining whether Mr. Angell violated Section 10B of the Federal securities code, which he said forbids "somebody passing nonpublic information with respect to a security and somebody who trades on that information."
But he added that in his view, "anything anyone in America does that the S.E.C. doesn't like comes under that small section."
The commission would not confirm or deny the existence of an inquiry. "I can't comment on whether anything is under investigation," said William R. McLucas, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement.
One focus of the inquiry, according to Mr. Block, is an April 19 meeting of hundreds of Bear, Stearns clients. At that meeting, which took place four weeks before the Fed raised its short-term interest rate target for the fourth time this year, Mr. Angell said he thought that 8 to 10 of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks had asked the Fed's board of governors to raise the discount rate, as well. Someone familiar with an account of Mr. Angell's remarks said he disclaimed any direct knowledge at the time.
 
A Clue to Other Rate
 Requests for changes in the discount rate are a closely guarded secret because a change can be an important clue to how the Fed's monetary-policy committee is likely to vote on the Fed funds rate, its more important short-term interest rate target, now 4.25 percent. In the late 1980's, a former director of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Robert A. Rough, was imprisoned for leaking discount-rate information to a broker.
Mr. Angell's estimate of sentiment within the Fed -- which he repeated before and after the April 19 meeting -- was sufficiently on the mark to prompt J. Virgil Mattingly Jr., the Fed's counsel, to ask Brent L. Bowen, its inspector general, to look into the question. Mr. Bowen sent his report to the House Banking Committee at the end of May and, about a month later, referred the matter to the S.E.C.
Mr. Block said the S.E.C. had requested, among other things, an interview with Mr. Angell as well as his telephone log, a transcript of an April 19 client meeting and Mr. Angell's trading records. He characterized the S.E.C. effort as a "staff inquiry," a preliminary investigation that is supposed to determine whether a full-blown investigation, approved by the entire commission, is warranted.
The Fed's own inquiry apparently found no evidence that Mr. Angell received or passed on inside information. It nonetheless prompted Mr. Gonzalez, a frequent critic of the central bank in matters ranging from monetary policy to employment practices, to demand a wider investigation. He has accused Mr. Angell of "selling inside knowledge to the highest bidder," and wants the central bank to adopt new rules to prevent its former officials from jumping directly to lucrative Wall Street jobs.
In interviews, Mr. Angell and his lawyer called the S.E.C. inquiry and the accusation by Mr. Gonzalez "baseless" and suggested that both had been politically motivated.
"There isn't anything to find," Mr. Angell said. "I have never had any secret information. And I wouldn't use it if I had it. "
Mr. Angell is a contrarian, someone who relishes a good fight and rarely doubts that he is right.
"Back in the Nixon days," he added in his defense, "there was a list and they even sicked the I.R.S. on people. We know that the Nixon group and the group that's in today aren't any different."

HEADLINE: Investing in the Inner City;
Small-Business Owner Sees Revitalized Future

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Jose Aguiar is the Kleener King.
The alliterative name is plastered in royal blue and yellow lettering on the 12 stores he owns in the Bronx and upper Manhattan. And if Mr. Aguiar has his way, it may soon become a household phrase in many more inner-city neighborhoods, emblazoned on a small fleet of trucks shuttling clothing back and forth between his dry-cleaning plant and dozens of Kleener Kings in northern New York City. 
 Mr. Aguiar is walking evidence of how a small-business owner can make it in some of the toughest neighborhoods of New York City. Not only is his business prospering, but he sees his future in expanding throughout the Bronx, upper Manhattan and lower Westchester County, where, in his view, the crowded neighborhoods provide an untapped market for a chain of dry cleaners providing low-cost, high-quality service.
It is businesses like his that many see as a lifeline of New York City's future economic success. As bigger corporations leave the city or shed employees, companies with fewer than 100 workers now account for almost half of the private work force in the city. Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, said these companies tended to be more resilient in surviving the recession of the early 1990's.
Mr. Aguiar's business is emblematic of the success of such companies. He hires locally, training neighborhood residents for stable jobs. And he hopes to expand his business greatly in the coming years with a large new cleaning plant in an industrial area of the Bronx.
"My market is the Bronx," said Mr. Aguiar, who is 32 and who owned only one store just seven years ago. "I think the Bronx is headed in the right direction, and I want to help rebuild it. I drive around and I feel proud sometimes that it's coming back, back to the heydays when my parents first came here."
Mr. Aguiar is one of the lucky ones. Despite small businesses' relative success in weathering the recession, economists say they are still risky ventures, with one in three failing in the first three years nationally.
 
'I Didn't Want to Sell His Dream Short'
 Mr. Aguiar got his start running a dry-cleaning shop when, as a student at Columbia University, he was forced to take over his father's company upon the elder Mr. Aguiar's death. Until then, the younger Mr. Aguiar had seen the business merely as a source of summertime employment. But with his father's death, he felt an obligation to take over the family store, on Creston Avenue near Fordham Road in the Fordham section.
"I really knew nothing about the business," Mr. Aguiar said. "He had a lot to teach me, but I just didn't want to hear. The reason I stayed is I didn't want to sell his dream short. If I would have sold his store, that would have been the end of what he fought for."
After spending three years learning every aspect of the business, Mr. Aguiar attended a national dry-cleaning convention in 1986. That trip, he said, changed his life.
He returned with the dream of setting up a string of stores that would serve the neighborhoods he had always known: the blue-collar and largely minority areas of the Bronx and upper Manhattan. Two years later, he opened a second store at Longwood Avenue and Southern Boulevard in Hunts Point, two blocks from the site of his father's original shop.
Lucille Gonzalez remembers when that store opened. "I used to bring my clothes with me to work, and leave them at a cleaners downtown," she said. "I just couldn't trust the places around here. Then this nice, clean store opened and I knew whoever owned that would take care of my clothes."
Mr. Aguiar has two basic tenets that he says have helped him create a successful, fast-growing business. The first is offering reliable, affordable quality. The second is creating an attractive, recognizable look for his stores.
Mr. Aguiar realized that the wealthier markets were not for him when he was forced to close a store he opened on West 90th Street because of intense competition. Unlike some higher-priced stores, he does not concentrate on difficult-to-clean fabrics or complicated trimmings, instead offering his customers basic cleaning they can afford. He also runs sales and pricing gimmicks, particularly in poorer neighborhoods.
 
A Goal of Consistent Quality
 "I'm not going to say that Kleener King is the best dry cleaner in the world," Mr. Aguiar said. "I may not even make the high-end market happy, but I know that my average customer's walking around happy because they have dependable, reliable quality. I can't do everything. I can only do certain things, and I look to polish what I do."
Mr. Aguiar patterned his chain on enormous enterprises like McDonald's and Blockbuster Video. He says those stores are successful because wherever customers go, they know they will receive the same quality.
For that reason, Mr. Aguiar chose a common name, Kleener King (which he hit on in a Burger King), and a common look for all his stores: every store has baby-blue floor tiles and royal-blue counters and the recognizable Kleener King logo out front. A team of carpenters visits each store twice yearly for cleaning and maintenance.
In poorer neighborhoods where many owners are unwilling, or unable, to spend the time and money to maintain their shops, his stores stand out. He points to the success of his stores in Hunts Point, on St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, as well as one he is about to open in a new shopping center just north of Crotona Park in the Bronx, as evidence of how his strategy has worked.
"You look in that general vicinity and there are no really attractive-looking stores," he said, referring to the East Tremont area. "Everything is run down. I feel that the minute somebody comes in and revitalizes an area and introduces something nice, people are going to notice and take a little pride."
 
Plans for a Central Plant
 Mr. Aguiar's flagship store, on Creston Avenue, is a gleaming white two-story plant that he built with a Small Business Administration loan on an empty lot across from the site he inherited from his father, which is now a restaurant.
The plant, where 20 employees clean clothing from five stores in the area, is a model for Mr. Aguiar's next big plan, a central plant in an industrial area, perhaps Bathgate Industrial Park in Tremont. Predicting that concerns over chemical emissions in the dry-cleaning process may eventually lead the government to outlaw cleaning plants in residential buildings, he wants to build a large plant that would service 40 to 50 drop-off stores throughout the Bronx. He also wants to franchise, by next year, about 40 of the stores, some with laundromats.
"I think there's a lot of people other than myself that believe in the Bronx and are willing to invest money here," Mr. Aguiar said.
With 12 stores open now, four more under construction and large plans for the future, Mr. Aguiar is often asked if he is moving too fast. "My gut tells me no," he said.
"To me this isn't work, it's my life," Mr. Aguiar said. "I guess that's why it comes so easily to me, because I really, truly enjoy it. I enjoy going into a devastated neighborhood and making a statement, going in and seeing a vision of what I can do there."

Bonds Rally on Rumors Of Purchase by Saudis

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The bond market rallied sharply yesterday, bolstered by a stronger dollar and speculation that Saudi Arabia had bought a large block of notes.
The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 20/32 of a point, or $6.25 per $1,000 bond. Its yield fell to 7.54 percent, from 7.61 percent on Wednesday. 
 Bond traders had begun the day betting on lower prices amid concerns that faster economic growth would lead to more inflation and higher interest rates. But traders were forced to reverse their bets once the dollar rallied, rising above 100 Japanese yen for the first in a month, since it indicated higher demand for dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities.
"We are pretty much coupled" to the rebound in the dollar, said Chris Madell, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets.
 
 
Bought Bonds Back
 Like other traders, Mr. Madell covered his positions by repurchasing bonds he had sold short on Wednesday. "For once I did the sensible thing and bought the bonds back," he said.
Traders typically sell borrowed securities short in a falling market in hopes of buying them back at a lower price.
Earlier, the 30-year bond fell as much as 8/32 of a point after the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for unemployment dropped last week by 59,000, to 331,000, more than three times the decline expected by many economists. The report raised concerns about economic growth.
Yesterday's rebound does not mean the bond market is less concerned about faster growth. Indeed, traders will be looking for signs of increased growth, and hints of inflation, in the Government's report today on the nation's gross domestic product in the second quarter.
 
 
Are Buyers in Line?
 Much of yesterday's buying reflected speculation that ready buyers like the Saudis were ready to snap up Treasury issues, traders said.
There were unconfirmed reports that the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, the nation's central bank, bought as much as $1 billion of 10-year notes. Calls to the authority in Riyadh were not answered.
"It's one of those things where you never know for sure, but in this case it wasn't just a vague rumor," said James Hale, senior fixed-income strategist at MMS International in San Francisco. "Usually when it's got numbers attached, it's got some legitimacy."
So many traders and speculators were betting that bonds would fall yesterday that they were caught off guard when prices rebounded, said Michael Marzano, head of bond futures trading at Yamaichi International (America).
Once bonds began rising, speculators were forced to reverse their bets that another decline would occur, which helped to accelerate the gain.
"We've got a nice little squeeze going," Mr. Marzano said.
A drop in the Conference Board's help-wanted advertising index for June also gave speculators a reason to reverse their bets, traders said.
 
 
G.D.P. Report Poses Threat
 The report due today from the Commerce Department on the gross domestic product last quarter could send bonds tumbling, traders and analysts said. Some economists are forecasting a growth rate as high as 5 percent, which would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year to pre-empt inflation.
"It's just a matter of time before the market goes down," said Michael McGlone, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company.
Also, traders said bond prices were being kept in check by the Treasury's quarterly refunding early next month, when the Government plans to auction an estimated $40 billion in 3- , 10- and 30-year securities, he said.
With such a large supply, "and all this uncertainty about the Fed, any rally in here will be short-lived," said Eric Cheung, who manages $2 billion of fixed-income investments at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Del.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
DOW CHEMICAL CO. (DOW,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that its second-quarter net income climbed 69 percent on a slight gain in revenue, pushed up by strong volume and price increases in its plastics division.
Net income rose to $251 million, or 91 cents a share. Wall Street had been expecting about 88 cents a share. Excluding one-time charges in last year's quarter, Dow's per-share results increased 21 percent. 
 "Dow's strength came from cost-cutting and volume growth," said Paul Raman of S. G. Warburg & Company. "They've done a very good job of controlling overhead."
Officials at Dow, based in Midland, Mich., attributed the overall improvement to gains in productivity and rising demand. Revenue rose 2 percent, to $4.93 billion. Operating income rose 55 percent, to $602 million.
Analysts said Dow's results underscored the cyclical recovery throughout the chemical industry. Improvement in the United States economy and a sluggish recovery in Europe are spurring demand that is catching up with the overcapacity that has hurt the industry for years.
Higher prices should bolster results for Dow and other chemical makers in coming quarters, said Stephen E. Roberts, an analyst with Roney & Company in Detroit. "Demand is soaking up excess supply," he said. "The U.S. economy is strong, Europe is picking up, and Japan is hanging in there, so things look good."

Year-ago quarter and 6 months' share earnings reflected the company's after-tax portion of a Marion Merrell Dow special charge that reduced earnings by 30 cents a share, while the sale of some Magma Power Co. stock held by Dow Chemical increased earnings by 9 cents a share.
The share earnings are after preferred dividends of $1 million in both the latest quarter and year-ago period. Share earnings for both the latest and year-ago 6 months are after preferred dividends of $3 million.
Dow Chemical said the year-ago 6 months' results included a pretax gain of $450 million from the company's sale of its 50 percent holding in the Dowell Schlumberger group of companies to Schlumberger Ltd.

HEADLINE: Stocks Move Up, With Dow Gaining 10.36

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In the latest swing in a seesaw week, the stock market rallied modestly yesterday in moderate trading.
The rise was due in part to a jump in the value of the dollar above 100 yen for the first time in a month, fresh evidence that the dollar's fall may have bottomed out and foreign investors were returning to American assets. 
 Surprisingly strong earnings reported by General Motors may also have provided a psychological lift to the market. But G.M. contributed only a slight lift to the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, of which G.M. is a main component stock.
The Dow rose 10.36 points, to 3,730.83, while the broader S.& P. 500 rose 1.67 points, to 454.24. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.30 point, to 712.43.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 246.6 million shares. The volume was far below the year's average, which is 287 million shares, but closer to the more cautious trading volume posted by traders since June 1, which is about 259 million shares.
 
Financial Markets Confusion
 The week so far has reflected the confusion in the financial markets after last week's testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who expressed concern about the economy without being explicit about what the Fed would do about it.
Stocks were up on Monday, and down on Tuesday and Wednesday in swings that were more drift than real changes in direction. Bonds mirrored the stock market.
But today will likely be the decisive session, at least for the week, as traders sift through data in the second-quarter gross domestic product for clues to the economy's direction and whether the Fed will raise interest rates a fifth time this year.
Inventory levels, an indication of whether consumers and businesses are buying more or less than in the strong first quarter, will be especially scrutinized.
 
U.S. and Japan Trade Talks
 The dollar's rise reflected short-term optimism that a breakthrough was possible in trade talks between the United States and Japan. Yesterday, for the first time since June 28, the dollar rose above 100 yen, closing at 100.10 yen, up from 98.45 yen. The dollar also rose to 1.5920 German marks, from 1.5749 marks, but was mixed against other European currencies.
The dollar rose against the yen from the start of the session in New York all the way to the close. A Japanese news service reported that the Japanese Government was considering concessions in the trade talks.
A main factor behind the weakness in the dollar is the United States-Japan trade deficit. The billions of dollars paid by American companies and consumers for Japanese goods are more often converted to yen rather than into dollar-denominated American stocks, bonds, goods or services. The resulting strong demand for yen and weaker demand for dollars have led to a post-World-War-II low in the value of the dollar.
The dollar's lift had an immediate effect on bonds, which essentially returned to Monday's price levels after a sharp drop on Wednesday. Also helping was speculation by traders that the Saudi Government had bought more than $1 billion in 10-year bonds, a fact not of enormous consequence by itself, but an indication that foreign investors were confident in the dollar and dollar-denominated assets.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7.54 percent, from 7.61 percent.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.76 point, to 250.60, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,079 to 999. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.14 point, to 433.88.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 16 rose, led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose 1 1/8, to 52 1/2, on no immediate news.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 236 stocks rose, led by General Electric, which rose 3/4, to 49 1/2, on no immediate news.
The most active stock, at four million shares, was Ford, which rose 5/8, to 31, also on no immediate news.
Stock prices sometimes move for reasons related to individual portfolio managers' priorities rather than external news events.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Fall

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Workers returning from summer furloughs in the automobile and textile industries helped push first-time claims for state unemployment benefits to their lowest level in four months, the Government reported today.
The Labor Department said initial claims dropped 59,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, to a seasonally adjusted 331,000 from the previous week's revised 390,000. The decrease was the biggest in five months and much larger than the modest 7,000 decline that most economists had predicted in advance of the report. 
 It was the first drop in three weeks and followed rises of 25,000 and 21,000 in the two previous weeks.
Many applicants in the weeks that ended on July 9 and July 16 worked in the auto and textile industries, which have summertime furloughs, and the latest number reflected the return of those workers.
The decrease was the biggest since Feb. 26, when a decline of 61,000 was reported. It was the lowest level since March 26, when 331,000 claims were filed.

HEADLINE: PHARMACISTS HELP DRUG PROMOTIONS

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
Without explicitly telling doctors or patients, major drug companies are enlisting pharmacists to promote their drugs rather than those of their competitors. And some doctors and medical ethicists don't like it.
Take the many neighborhood pharmacists who serve participants in Medco, a company that buys drugs from manufacturers and sells them through pharmacies and mail orders to 38 million Americans. 
 When customers appear with prescriptions for high blood pressure medicine, for example, the pharmacist often advises them that they could receive another, similar drug for less money, under their Medco plan. Would it be O.K., the pharmacist might ask, if they called the doctor and had the prescription switched to the other drug?
But what the patient and doctor may not know is that Medco is owned by Merck, the other drug is made by Merck, and Merck will pay the pharmacist a cash commission for arranging the switch.
Some say there is nothing wrong with this. Why not pay pharmacists for helping patients to get the best drug at the best price? John Doorley, a Merck spokesman, said pharmacists would suggest a switch only when it would help the patient.
"In no case will we ever permit a Merck product to be prescribed over another medicine if it is not better," he said.
But others complain that when pharmacists make money on particular choices of drugs, they are no longer disinterested parties. It is no different, some say, from the doctor who owns the diagnostic laboratory down the street from his office and so benefits financially each time he sends a patient there for lab tests. Or it may be no different from the doctor who is wined and dined by a drug company representative and then prescribes the company's drugs.
 
 
'Manipulative' and 'Dishonest'
 "It's outrageous, it's manipulative and it's dishonest," said James Love, who follows the drug industry as director of economic studies at the Center for the Study of Responsive Law, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.
"Traditional medical ethics is being replaced by traditional business ethics," said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
He and many other critics urge that at the very least any and all arrangements between pharmacists and drug companies should be explicitly disclosed to both doctors and customers. Others go further, saying that the arrangements should be barred on antitrust grounds. They argue that separating the drug companies and the drug distributors is the only way to insure that patients don't get medicine they don't need and that they pay the best prices for what is necessary.
Merck blazed a new trail when it bought Medco last year. In May, SmithKline Beecham bought Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, which handles prescription drugs for 11 million people. Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced it would buy PCS Health Systems, which has enrolled 50 million Americans.
Drug companies say the mergers will insure that their products make the list of favored drugs the supplier offers to its many patients, often at a very good price for the patient and the employer, who each pay part of the bill. Although the supplier will also sell drugs not on the list, they will cost the patient more, sometimes much more than the listed drugs.
The drug companies say the new arrangements are more than money-making ploys. By using huge data bases that include prescriptions that may be written by different doctors and filled at different pharmacies for individual patients, the pharmacists can, for example, alert patients and doctors to dangerous drug interactions.
But some doctors and medical ethicists are leery.
Dr. Alan L. Hillman, who directs the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said that drug suppliers used to select the drugs they would offer by looking for the best drug for the best price without regard to which company manufactured it. But the whole point of the new arrangement, he said, is to prefer one maker's drugs over another's.
"Now that these companies are aligned with pharmaceutical manufacturers, it is not fair to assume or to expect them to give all manufacturers equal treatment," Dr. Hillman said. "And, in fact, that's not why they were bought. They were bought so they can have pharmacists and telemarketing people call and try to get prescriptions changed.
"That is exactly the opposite of what they were at least theoretically doing when they were independent. It's not a good development."
Dr. Hillman acknowledged that doctors could refuse to go along with requests to change prescriptions. But he said most doctors would not question a pharmacist's motives in suggesting a switch. When they think of drug marketers, he said, they think of clearly identified salespeople who come calling or invite doctors to professional seminars to learn about a company's drugs.
 
Trustworthy Profession
 Mr. Love agreed. He added that pharmacists were always at the top of the list of national polls asking Americans which professionals were most trustworthy.
Dr. Hillman said he did not fault the drug industry for the new direction it was taking. "There is nothing illegal or unethical about it, " he said. "It's just American companies trying to get a leg up on the marketplace."
Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly needed that leg up. They are saddled with a legacy of the 1980's, when companies began making "me too" drugs -- competing and all but identical patented versions of popular medicines like anti-ulcer drugs or cholesterol-lowering drugs. These drugs now account for half to three-quarters of the revenues of large drug companies, said Robert N. Merold, a vice president of IMS America, a Totowa, N.J., company that analyzes drug company data.
But now, with many similar drugs on the market, companies realize that they must control not just the manufacturing but the distribution of their drugs. That way, they can place their products on the list of favored drugs offered by pharmacies participating in the prescription-drug plans of suppliers. Hence the acquisitions of suppliers.
Studies show that 80 percent of the time, doctors agree to requests that their patients be switched to a similar drug, Mr. Merold said. And, he added, there is an additinal benefit to the drug manufacturer. When a doctor is called repeatedly by one drug plan asking about a switch, the doctor eventually starts writing all prescriptions for that medicine.
 
The Turning Point
 Mr. Merold said the turning point seemed to be when about 15 percent of a doctor's patients were with one medical plan whose pharmacists kept calling. At that point, Mr. Merold said, "the doctor throws in the towel and says, 'Enough! Uncle! I give!' "
What about financial incentives for pharmacists to initiate such switches? Merck said it had several in place. The other companies, while providing no details, said they saw no reason not to compensate pharmacists.
Merck gives rebates of 6 to 10 percent of the wholesale price of each drug sold to pharmacists who dispense the company's line of generic drugs in preference to other companies'.
In a separate program, it also pays pharmacists $5 a prescription for increasing their sales of the total line of drugs, generic and patented, from the Medco formulary.
And it has started an education program that compensates pharmacists for helping patients learn about managing their chronic diseases. Pharmacists are paid $3 for reviewing a patient's prescription record, and for counseling; they are paid $9 more if the counseling results in a new prescription, and they are paid 50 cents each time the prescription is refilled, up to $3.
The rebate program that pays $5 a prescription was begun in October 1992 and the two others were begun last Jan. 1.
 
 
Began With Asthma Aid
 The education program began with asthma management, and Merck does not make asthma drugs. But next year, it will include conditions like ulcers and high cholesterol, where Merck's drugs face strong competition.
Some experts see nothing wrong with compensation programs. Dr. Devra Marcus, an internist in private practice in Washington, said that as long as she could approve, or disapprove, of a drug substitution, and as long as her patients saved money, "it's O.K. with me."
Dr. Jerry Wing, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said, "Everyone is compensated for what they are doing." If pharmacists "are spending time, why not be compensated?" he asked.
But Dr. Stephen Brenner, an internist in New Haven who has received some calls from pharmacists, disagreed.
"It's offensive," he said. "There's a very clear ethical issue here," he added, explaining that there is the same conflict of interest for the pharmacist who gets an incentive for calling doctors and patients as for the doctor who sends patients to a diagnostic lab where he or she has a stake in the profits.
"Legislation says I can't refer patients to my own lab or my own physical therapy center because I'm alleged to be getting something out of it, even though it may be 'in the patient's best interest,' " Dr. Brenner said. The same reasoning says that pharmacists should not be allowed to steer doctors or patients to drugs when they have a financial interest in the switch, he said.
Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and an economist at Stanford University and head of the formulary committee at the Veterans hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., also saw a conflict. Payments to pharmacists are "extremely troubling," he said.
Mr. Doorley of Merck said critics have to consider the drug industry's point of view. Something has to be done to restore profits. "The industry is getting murdered," he said. "Our company was worth $60 billion a year and a half ago and now you could buy it for less than $40 billion."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. to Help Ukraine to Rejuvenate Economy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, July 28

 BODY:
The head of the International Monetary Fund met with Ukraine's new President this week and said they would work together to develop an economic program that could open the door for the $4 billion aid package promised to Ukraine at the economic summit meeting this month in Naples.
The fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, announced "the beginning of something important and positive for Ukraine" after meeting on Wednesday with President Leonid D. Kuchma, who took office on July 18. If the program is successful, the first part of a $700 million loan could be issued by October, officials said. 
 The I.M.F.'s cooperation is important because it sends positive signals to private foreign investors. Ukraine, where economic reform has been more sluggish than elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, has received very little investment.
Vice President Al Gore has also accepted an invitation to visit Kiev next Tuesday after a visit to Poland to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw uprising. Washington has been concerned with Ukraine's unstable economy, and Mr. Gore's visit is seen as an effort to give a boost to the new President.
Mr. Camdessus said he was "impressed with the determination of the President and the Prime Minister," adding that Mr. Kuchma had drafted a "document which really touches upon the key issues."
Mr. Camdessus made his first visit to Kiev to keep a promise made to Mr. Kuchma last spring in Washington. Mr. Kuchma challenged Mr. Camdessus to come if he won the election and had concrete economic proposals ready.
"I said 'O.K.' " Mr. Camdessus recalled. "Then the President sent me an invitation the day after his inauguration, and here I am."
Asking for help is Mr. Kuchma's personal acknowledgement that the economy, despite an inflation rate below 4 percent a month, is in terrible shape. National income fell 28 percent in the first half of this year from the year before.
I.M.F. officials are to work with the administration in Kiev this summer to develop a program to keep monthly inflation in single digits, reduce the budget deficit and free prices. "We're talking of a far-reaching program," Mr. Camdessus said.
He cautioned, however, that this kind of program will require "ambition," a reference to the reluctance by the previous Government to carry out reforms. But Mr. Kuchma must also deal with a Communist-dominated Parliament that has already shown its aversion to market reforms like privatization.

HEADLINE: City and State to Announce Program of Arts Grants

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE 

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani are to announce a program today in which New York City and the state would provide a total of $10 million to cultural institutions in the city that can raise matching private money.
The program is intended not only to increase financing for the arts, but also to encourage arts groups to raise more private money and improve the public's access to the arts. It is a result of an agreement made in February between city officials and leaders of the arts world, who offered to raise $10 million in private contributions if the Mayor restored $4.2 million in arts financing that he wanted to cut from the city's budget and if the city and the state matched the pledge with $5 million each. 
 While the city put $5 million for the program in its new budget in June, the state, which has a different fiscal year, allocated half its share. Governor Cuomo says he plans to ask the State Legislature to provide the remaining $2.5 million in the next fiscal year.
Details of the program, which is to be jointly administered by the New York State Council on the Arts and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, are to be announced today at a news conference at the Brooklyn Museum.
 
'First Joint Effort'
 "New York State and New York City are working together in the first joint effort we have ever made to strengthen the city's status as the nation's arts and cultural capital," the Governor said in a written statement. "This joint investment will help draw more tourists and New Yorkers to arts attractions, strengthening our economy and creating jobs."
Under the program, a cultural group's operating budget would be used to determine how much money it could receive. Organizations with operating budgets of less than $500,000 could request up to $50,000, half from the state and half from the city. Institutions with budgets of up to $2 million could request up to $100,000, and organizations with budgets more than $2 million could get up to $500,000. Proposals for the program, which applies to institutions in the city's five boroughs, must also provide more opportunity for the public to enjoy culture.
The deadline for applications is Sept. 13.
Norma Munn, the chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, an advocacy group, said, "I think this was put together with a great deal of hard work from all of the people who've been working on it these last few days and together they took a vague idea and have improved upon it considerably."
She added: "I have two caveats. We will continue to monitor this program very, very closely, especially in terms of how the city makes its decisions. Second, we're pleased the city and the state are looking at the question of economic development and the arts, and we hope that now that the difficulties around the challenge program have been eliminated we can have a more serious and substantive discussion with the city's elected officials as to what constitutes substantive economic development in the arts."
In its budget, the city is providing financing for more than 400 cultural groups, including the 31 major institutions on city property (known as the Cultural Institutions Group). Any group or artistic program would be eligible to apply for the matching grants, but according to city legislation, $3 million of the city's $5 million must go to members of the Cultural Institutions Group..
Money for the arts in the city budget is being distributed by a formula in which some 60 percent goes to members of the Cultural Institutions Group, which includes, for instance, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the New York Shakespeare Festival. Roughly 20 percent is going to the other arts groups in the city who have received money in the past, and another 20 percent is going to cultural institutions that had not previously received city money, including the Whitney Museum for American Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In recent years, the major institutions received about 85 percent of the arts money and the other recipient groups got the remaining 15 percent.

HEADLINE: Where Generations Created Memories Of Summer

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
THERE was a time when the best one-wall handball in the world was played at the Brighton Beach Baths in Brooklyn. Thousands would crowd into its three swimming pools; men would smoke cigars and pat one another on the back; women would vie for the title of prettiest expectant mother.
On weekends, performers from Milton Berle to Lionel Hampton to Herman's Hermits entertained in a band shell resembling nothing so much as half a bagel. Scores of mah-jongg players clicked their 144 tiles with the concentration of nervous assassins. People competed so furiously in egg-cream and knish-eating contests that you can guess what happened. Each endless summer, the vain would wrap reflectors around their neck to capture a perfect tan. 
 Brighton Beach memories. The smell of roast chicken and ocean air. Tallulah Bankhead beguiling a war-bonds rally. Bobby Riggs dropping by to hustle a little paddle tennis. The parade of politicians: Mayor John V. Lindsay diving elegantly from the high board, Senator Jacob K. Javits beaming in his tennis whites.
Neil Sedaka, who grew up across the street, remembers hearing Jeannie Clair and Harold Stern, who played accordion and fiddle, sometime in the 1940's. Years later, he says his memory of their tunes inspired his hit songs "Love Will Keep Us Together" and "Solitaire."
"I love looking back," he said. Mr. Sedaka, who now has homes in Manhattan, Los Angeles and Westport, Conn., was recently crowned King of Brooklyn and had his boyhood street named after him. "I wish just for a day I could turn back the clock and relive those years," he added.
Sylvia Deutsch, former chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, remembers going to the baths years and years ago. She would ride the trolley from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and spend long days in the sun, staying to dance in the evening. "We'd sit by the pool and meet nice boys," Mrs. Deutsch said. Then her father and the fathers of her friends would arrive at 9 P.M. sharp to drive the young women home.
"The precious little jewels couldn't go home alone," she said with what sounded like a giggle.
The truth is that the baths will soon be nothing but memory. Membership has dipped to 1,136 from more than 13,000 in the late 1960's, and it appears certain that the baths will soon be replaced by an apartment complex. So it seemed a good idea to visit the 15-acre, table-flat recreation area that bills itself as the World's Largest Beach Resort while there is still time.
On a recent sweltering day, my family packed a picnic basket, slathered ourselves with sunblock and took the D train to the Brighton Beach stop. Guy, my 4-year-old son, surveys the brightly colored Adirondack chairs, the playground equipment and the cool blue pools, and immediately pronounces, "We like how it looks."
Well, yes, though perhaps through the same brand of wistful lens that filmed "The Flamingo Kid," about a similar old-time beach club. There are row upon row of wooden lockers, thousands of them, as well as steam rooms, card-playing-only areas and a solarium. From any vantage point, you can look out on the Coney Island boardwalk and see walkers and bicyclists floating by as if they're in another world, which, of course, they are.
After eight years of effort, the owners of the Brighton Beach Bath and Racquet Club -- it changed its name 15 years ago to differentiate itself from the many steam rooms then catering to homosexuals -- have received all necessary city approvals and won a court fight to build a 1,489-unit apartment complex on this site, scaled back from the original proposal of more than 3,000 units. Both owners and opponents agree that next summer will almost certainly be the baths' last, as one of Brooklyn's most famous institutions follows trolley cars, Ebbets Field and Lundy's restaurant down the lane to legend.
 
What Happened Here?
 "We've been in a holding pattern," said Hyman Cohen, the vice president and general manager of the baths. Explaining that he needs a working business against which to write off insurance, taxes and other costs, he said, "I lose less by keeping it open than closing it."
Opponents charge that the Miami developer that owns the baths, Alexander Muss & Sons, has deliberately run it into the ground to enhance the attractiveness of the development proposal. Paint is chipped, maintenance has lapsed, food is now available only from vending machines, and the high board from which Mayor Lindsay dived has been replaced with a modest low one. Last year, the season was cut to 8 months from 10.
"The people I know have just gotten disgusted and left," said Irwin Fruchtman, a board member of the Committee to Preserve Brighton and Manhattan Beach (the neighborhood just east of Brighton Beach), the apartment project's most vigorous opponent. He adds that price increases have not helped. An adult yearly membership is $1,050, compared with $35 for adults and half that for children in the mid-1950's, when many current members first joined. Children with two parents to supervise them today are charged $50 if they are 3 to 11, and $350 if they are 12 to 18. Younger children of single parents are charged $300, and older ones $400.
Mr. Cohen scoffs at charges that the baths haven't tried to make money. When times were good, he said, major investments were made. At one point, a $150,000 television ad campaign was even waged, he said. But promotion and upkeep have suffered in recent years as a dwindling membership supplied less revenue. One of the baths' biggest money-makers now is renting space to a summer camp for children.
"Older people are afraid to ride the trains and buses to get here," Mr. Cohen said. "There's no parking. Today people go to Florida or California or Arizona."
Other changes were also at work. In the mid-1970's fiscal crisis, many firefighters, police officers and other civil servants dropped out, never to return. While reporters and pressmen from New York's eight newspapers who worked nights spent lazy days at the baths, few Russian immigrants, who increasingly dominated Brighton Beach, joined. "The ocean is free," Mr. Cohen noted.
 
Changes for the Worse
 The socio-economics of the neighborhood have also been transformed as the successful have migrated to the suburbs and many old-timers who have stayed became relatively poorer. Dan Klores, a public relations executive who grew up in Brighton Beach and worked at the baths as his first job, says those who frequented the baths in the 1950's and early 60's tended to live in two-room apartments with a rollout couch, however large the family. "This was the upper stratum of the lower middle class," he said. "If you went to the baths, your parents were at least aspiring to be upwardly mobile."
Today's baths seem proof of humankind's downward mobility, of our corporal mutability, of how fast time flies. Entering the baths, you first encounter a lobby lined with fading photographs of generations of bathing beauties and athletic champions, each wearing a smile as wide as July. But the members shuffling past carry the load of years of living: walkers are not infrequent; today's smiles are creased with earned wisdom. Indeed, some of these veterans swear that the best way to make it to 85 is to come here regularly. Who could argue?
 
A Diverse Crowd
 Not everybody is an octogenarian, of course. A young Spanish-speaking couple arrives, pushing a baby in a stroller. They converse for a while, giggle, then pay the weekend day rate of $30 each; the baby is admitted free. The day charge is $25 weekdays. Included is nothing: no towel, no locker, no pillow for the Adirondack chair.
Day guests usually number only a dozen or so a day. Sometimes they include a man who arrives early at the entrance to wait and see if his favorite handball partners arrive. If they do, he pays the day fee and goes in.
After paying the day rate ourselves, my wife, Suzanne, goes into the ladies' locker area, and I head for the men's with our two sons. The first man we meet is an elderly chap looking for the cane he has lost. We then notice some old, old signs proclaiming the de facto men's clubs that existed on different rows of lockers. "Gentlemen's Alley -- Great Men Only," reads one. Others are "Jerry's Bar" and "Mustache Al's."
In the old days, not a few gentlemen deigned not to toddle beyond these aisles of conviviality, except perhaps to take the occasional steam bath a few steps away. The repartee remains sharp: one man allows as how he prefers not to play handball with a friend who clearly intends to continue smoking his cigar.
"I can throw my cigar away, but what are you going to do about your underwear?" is the reply.
There are 6,437 wooden lockers, each 4 feet wide, 4 feet deep and 8 feet tall. In the old days, people had to double up in the lockers. But today the vast majority have been covered with plastic to shut them off, thereby cutting cleaning expenses. We beg to use one, even though we are day-raters. The clerk is kind enough to acquiesce. Roy, our 6-year-old, thinks we should live in ours, at least until the weather turns cold.
Emerging from the immense locker area, we notice the handsome trees planted in the mid-1950's when the current owners bought the property. Signs define areas by use. "Sitting and Smiling, Yes. Card-Playing, No," reads one. One section is for mah-jongg only. Neil Sedaka as a young boy made a game of this geography of separation, calling one part of the baths the jungle, and other parts desert and forest. He would lead his cousins on detailed tours of this imaginary kingdom. Later, as a teen-ager, he said, he took Carole King to the baths on dates.
 
Songs and Innuendo
 By popular demand, our family's first stop is the miniature golf course, for which balls and clubs are provided. The 18-hole course never had windmills and other moving torture devices peculiar to this odd sport. But it is hard enough, particularly with Suzanne setting the stage. "Let's watch Dad," she purrs. "He knows how to do this."
That becomes demonstrably questionable as I hit my ball up hill after hill, only to watch it roll slowly back down. This, it develops, is a pretty stodgy approach in this foursome anyway. Roy is hitting his ball on the run, in something like field hockey. "Give it a kick, Roy," Suzanne yells. "Kick it right in the hole."
Play then bogs down when Guy decides he is a bird. He puts all four balls in the 12th hole and sits on them, tweeting periodically and refusing to move. After being all alone, we notice a group of men beginning to play. They are studying their shots before giving the ball a stroke -- not a kick -- and even keeping score. Fearful we might be less than amusing, we bribe Guy with the promise of a soda to move on to the next thing.
The next thing is the show at the band shell, held each weekend and holiday afternoon at 2 P.M. People take their own lawn chairs there, then politely fight for the better vantage points. Long gone is the tent that used to protect viewers from the sun. The faded flag on the stage commemorates the nation's Bicentennial.
Today's star is Tina Robin, the Little Songbird With the Big Voice. This self-described Dolly Parton wannabe wears a rhinestone tiara in her oodles of blond hair, and sings such favorites as "By the Light of the Silvery Moon" and "Secondhand Rose" to tunes her husband plays on the tape recorder. There is enough fast humor and sexual innuendo for the Catskills, not a little of it in Yiddish.
She announces that they are putting the faces of missing elderly people on prune-juice bottles. She asks if anybody likes calypso, then says she will do "a song of the islands: Long Island, Flushing." She also directs some of her jokes in this mostly elderly audience to "virgins only."
 
'Sexy Seniors Only'
 But the sun is bearing down. Time to hit the pools, all of which are filtered salt water. Guy's favorite is the baby pool, which varies in depth from 2 inches to 2 1/2 feet. Roy prefers the big one, 60-by-165 feet. We decide to live dangerously and invade the roped-off area designated "Sexy Seniors Only." The big pool, built in 1907, is wonderful summer fun, different from the way it was in the old days, when it was wall-to-wall people.
The afternoon ambles forward. A man with a mahogany tan, a flowing white mustache and a mat of white chest hair lies motionless in a courtyard. Some 20 older women struggle through an exercise class as 6 friends watch from lawn chairs. A handball thuds against a wall. A laughing group lays out a feast on two picnic tables. The 3 tennis courts and 15 paddle-tennis courts are well used. Dancers in a class in front of the bandstand kick their legs like chorus girls. A couple with a young boy splash in the pool, chattering in Russian. Everywhere is the sound of cards shuffling.
Suzanne takes the boys to play miniature golf one last time. I go to the steam room and listen to male pleasantries I imagine date back to the time Teddy Roosevelt was President, the Brighton Beach Baths were new and summers crawled by like fuzzy caterpillars. Leaving, I pass row upon row of empty chairs and notice the sun has dipped low in the sky.
Still searching for ghosts, I notice an elderly couple holding hands. "The end of a perfect day," she says.
"Yeah, perfect," he answers. "It almost could have been Florida."

The Struggling Class Hops Across the Channel

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STONY BROOK, L.I., July 27

 BODY:
When Al, the unemployed Yorkshire construction worker in John Godber's "April in Paris" at the Staller Center here, wanly describes himself as redundant, he's referring to his professional status. But the adjective has far broader applications in this slight, wistful two-character comedy, performed by the Hull Truck Theater Company, the troupe from northern England of which Mr. Godber is artistic director.
For Al (Iain Rogerson) and his wife, Bet (Susan Cookson), life in their tiny, blank-walled home is indeed an anesthetizing series of redundancies: repeated squabbles over household chores and limited options for filling time. The view to the grave stretches before them as an uninterrupted, monochromatic corridor. And Al, who has taken up painting since losing his job, finds that no matter how hard he tries, he always creates the same picture: a gray-toned landscape showing a tree and a factory. 
 The play itself, which has been directed here by Jane Thornton (Mr. Godber's wife, who created the part of Bet in England), is redundant in another sense altogether. The story of how the couple is transformed by a fleeting visit to Paris, on a trip to France that Bet has won in a magazine competition, rings only minimal variations on the theme of blue-collar innocents abroad.
With its time-honored jokes about ordering the wrong thing from a bistro menu and wandering blindly into a transvestite revue in Pigalle, "April in Paris," which will be at the Staller Center through Sunday night, exudes an almost claustrophobic sense of cozy familiarity. But that may be precisely the objective of Mr. Godber, one of England's most widely performed playwrights.
The spiritual malaise of the lower middle class has been endlessly rehashed by British writers since the aggressive kitchen-sink dramas of the 1950's. More recently, innovative film makers like Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and Terence Davies have brought a joltingly sharp-edged, stylized perspective to the same subject.
Mr. Godber, best known in the United States for "Bouncers," a manic portrait of aimless British youth in a provincial discotheque, takes a far less cerebral approach. And his Hull Truck productions, which tour Britain to popular acclaim, probably find a more receptive ear among the types of people he portrays onstage.
Mr. Godber has said he wants to make British theater "less of a middle-class icon and truly popular in the Elizabethan sense." Accordingly, since he knows that his audiences spend most of their leisure time in front of television screens, his plays are only one step away from the domestic sitcom. (Americans watching "April in Paris" may find themselves thinking of Ralph and Alice Kramden.)
But Mr. Godber also incorporates something far more elemental to theater. Battling spouses have been a favorite subject of popular entertainment in England since Punch and Judy. And "April in Paris" -- like Mr. Godber's earlier two-character plays, "September in the Rain" and "Happy Jack" -- is built around the push-and-pull rhythms of marital argument.
Accordingly, the play unfolds as a series of alternately feisty and dispirited exchanges that suggest vintage music hall put-downs by way of the modernist terseness of Pinter and Beckett. ("Give us a cuddle, then," says Bet. "Why, are you cold?" answers her husband.) And Al and Bet come across less as specifically detailed characters than as class archetypes, sort of latter-day, North Country versions of commedia dell'arte figures.
That classical sensibility is underlined by Robert Jones's ingenious, minimal sets, rendered in bleak black-and-white for the English scenes and splashy Impressionist colors for the Paris segments, with a backdrop inspired by Renoir's "Sunday in the Country." (Al and Bet's costumes also change to match their environment.)
There's not much point in describing what happens onstage. You've seen nearly all of it before -- the stomach-churning sea crossing, the couple's wide-eyed giddiness in gay Paree -- in "Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Paris," Willy Russell's "Shirley Valentine" and innumerable variety sketches.
But amid the sentimental corn, there's a visible sense of the melancholy born of stunted expectations and an anger with the country that produced it. Mr. Godber is at his best when he allows his characters moments of lyrical insight, usually delivered in narrative asides to the audience. And both Mr. Rogerson and Ms. Cookson find the tug of pathos in Bet and Al, although their characters remain broadly generic.
I wondered how accessible "April in Paris," with its Yorkshire dialect and scattered references to British brand names, would be to a Long Island audience, so I eavesdropped during intermission. One white-haired man, with an English accent, said he found it "quite tedious." But two young American women, in floral-patterned sportswear, offered another take:
Woman 1: "What do you think?"
Woman 2: "It's cute."
Woman 1: "I think it's depressing."
Woman 2: "Yeah."
Woman 1: "Like everyday life."
Woman 2: "I know."
Mr. Godber could have written the dialogue.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wants Quick Retaliation Against Serbian Attacks;
Russia Is Hopeful

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 28

 BODY:
With a weekend deadline approaching on Bosnia, Russia still expects the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan drawn up by the major powers, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, said today.
"There's still time," Mr. Kozyrev said in an interview before heading to Geneva for a weekend meeting of foreign ministers. "There're still two days before we meet in Geneva. And I hope in these days the message we communicated through General Grachev will be properly understood by the Serbs. We expect them, like the other sides, to say yes." 
 The Russian Defense Minister, Pavel S. Grachev, returned today from a trip to Serbia in a coordinated Russian effort to get the Bosnian Serbs to change their minds and accept the "take it or leave it" peace plan that they rejected last week.
Mr. Kozyrev said the Russians decided that General Grachev, better than any diplomat, would be able to speak to Bosnian Serb military commanders, like Gen. Ratko Mladic, in terms they would understand.
 
'No One Controls Them'
 "We're trying to provide them as persuasive an argument as possible," Mr. Kozyrev said. "That's what the international community wants and expects us to do, as traditional friends of the Serbs."
But he admitted to frustration with the Bosnian Serbs, saying, "No one controls them."
The United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, which drafted the current Bosnia peace plan, have warned the Serbs that they face tighter economic sanctions, increased military pressure and a removal of the international arms embargo if they do not back the plan.
But Western diplomats say there is reluctance on the part of the Russians, as well as the British and French, to start punishing the Serbs immediately if the plan is rejected. That is a topic Mr. Kozyrev refused to discuss.
Mr. Kozyrev said the Russians were offering the Bosnian Serbs another inducement to agree: a larger contingent of Russian peacekeeping troops, not only around Sarajevo but also in other areas the Serbs may specify.
But he emphasized the Russian position, also stated by General Grachev, that any Russian peacekeepers must be under the command of the United Nations, not NATO. "Who on earth would commit their forces under the command of an alliance they don't belong to?" Mr. Kozyrev said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wants Quick Retaliation Against Serbian Attacks

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
In the face of renewed attacks by Bosnian Serbs on Muslim enclaves and United Nations peacekeepers, the United States is pressing for quick retaliation, American and European officials said today.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to meet in Geneva on Saturday with the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Russia, and is expected to urge tighter economic sanctions and stricter enforcement of United Nations-designated safe areas. 
 "I'm very concerned about the situation that we will confront this weekend frankly," Mr. Christopher told the House Foreign Affairs Committee today.
The United States has long suggested lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia as one step in deterring the Bosnian Serbs, who are now much better armed than the Muslim-led Bosnian Government. But Britain and France, both of which have soldiers in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia, have opposed such a step since it could put those troops in danger should the Bosnian Serbs retaliate. British and French officials have expressed concern that the United States, which has no troops in Bosnia, may again pursue lifting the arms embargo in addition to the other punitive measures.
"It remains to be seen if the agreement in principle will be converted to practical steps," a senior Defense Department official said.
 
War of Nerves Seen
 Indeed, a war of nerves is developing. In what Western officials view as an effort to rattle the allies in advance of Saturday's meeting, Bosnian Serbs in recent days have attacked a United Nations convoy, killing a British soldier; shot and damaged a United Nations relief plane, and fired on Muslim enclaves in violation of United Nations ultimatums threatening air strikes.
"They're trying to intimidate the international community, and we need to rise to the challenge," an Administration official said.
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters today that he was "very alarmed by the decreasing security situation, specifically in Sarajevo and Gorazde."
"It's very important that this come to a very quick stop," General Shalikashvili said. "That means there needs to be more vigorous enforcement of the safe zones than has been necessary in the past."
 
Russian Meets With Serbs
 The Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, met with Bosnian Serb leaders in Belgrade this week, and delivered a letter from President Boris N. Yeltsin urging the Serbs to accept the compromise. In addition, Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, has also favored the deal as a way to lift international sanctions against Serbia.
But the speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly, Momcilo Krajisnik, wrote Mr. Yeltsin back today and rejected the plan as too sketchy. "Acceptance of an unfinished and unknown peace plan would be the beginning of the end for the Serbian people on its centuries-old territories and a prelude to national suicide," Mr. Krajisnik wrote.
The Serbs have cut the only commercial route into Sarajevo, apparently trying to show they can squeeze the Bosnian capital at will. Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the United Nations commander in Bosnia, called the Serbian action "very, very negative," adding that the "statement that they're making to the world is that they're no longer interested in pursuing the path to peace."
The Bosnian Serb rejection of a peace plan put forward by the so-called contact group of five nations sets up a showdown in Geneva this weekend. A senior French official said France would support tighter economic sanctions and stricter enforcement of the designated safe areas. "If we show strong determination on enforcement and on economic sanctions, I think we can achieve results," the official said.
 
Concern About Time Line
 But American and other European diplomats were less optimistic that the first two punishments would dent the Bosnian Serbs' position. American officials acknowledged that the new Serbian attacks had compressed the time in which Washington would phase in the punishments.
"We never had any set time line, but whatever it was, it's gotten shorter," an Administration official said. "Clearly those countries with forces on the ground, and the Russians, are inclined to take things more gradually. Our view is that the Serbs' behavior has made things a bit more urgent."
Administration officials said lifting the arms embargo remained a last resort, and only if done multilaterally. But the officials acknowledged that there was a limit to how long they could continue to deny arms to the Muslims. The United Nations has said it would pull out its peacekeeping force out of Bosnia if the arms embargo was lifted.
"We face a very practical deadline because Congress has told us their patience is running out," one Administration official said. "The pressure is already high in Congress, and it does not diminish over time."

HEADLINE: Legal Services, Still Embattled

 BODY:
The election of Bill Clinton ended 12 years of White House abuse and neglect of the Legal Services Corporation, the Federal body that subsidizes hundreds of law offices devoted to representing the poor. The program still has enemies in Congress, however, and only last week had to rally to survive an attack on the Senate floor.
In debating a $400 million appropriation for the program, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas sought to deny funds for lawsuits challenging any law "which seeks to reform welfare." That looks civic-minded: Why let Federal money pay for litigation to block "reform?" The answer is that not all reforms are legal or constitutional and that governments often break their own laws. They need the policing the poverty lawyers provide. 
 Senator Gramm was especially offended by a lawsuit attacking New Jersey's refusal to pay benefits for new children born to mothers on welfare. That law may be tolerable as an experiment but it is almost certainly misguided -- it will simply victimize innocent children without discouraging illegitimate births. But whatever its merits, the law's constitutionality and legality need testing. Legal Services of New Jersey is right to bring that test.
In another public service, the Western Center on Law and Poverty persuaded a Federal appeals court two weeks ago that California's welfare cuts were being administered unlawfully by officials who ignored pleas to consider the impact of the cuts on children and the disabled.
Even the Justice Department, which endorses welfare reform, opposed the Gramm assault, which failed on a 56-to-44 vote. Such attacks have been the lot of the program for two decades and will doubtless continue. Fortunately, the Clinton Administration has appointed new leadership to fortify the program -- a welcome change from the years when Reagan appointees lobbied to kill or sharply curtail their own agency.
The corporation deserves the added security that can come only from a law re-authorizing the program and insulating it from political interference. Congress must also provide a realistic budget that keeps pace with inflation and the growing needs of the poor for civil justice.

HEADLINE: Police Went to Israeli Sites After Tips On Bomb Plots

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Out of concern over the possibility of a bomb attack by terrorists, the gray brick office building that houses the Israeli Mission to the United Nations and the Israeli Consulate was cordoned off yesterday by heavy concrete barriers and squads of New York City Police officers.
Security was also stepped up at more than a dozen other places in Manhattan where the Israelis or Jewish organizations have offices, as well as other locations in Brooklyn and the Bronx, including the headquarters of the Lubavitcher Hasidic movement on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. 
 "We're here to stop a kamikaze," said an officer on guard in front of the Israeli Mission to the United Nations.
A colleague added, however: "It's been calm all day. And with all these cops around, I doubt anyone will try anything."
But the situation outside the Israeli Mission was far from calm in the hours before dawn on Tuesday when the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified the New York City Police that a trusted informant had said that terrorists were planning to strike two targets in New York: The Israeli Mission to the United Nations on Second Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets, and the Israeli Defense Mission on Third Avenue at 51st Street. Another target on the list, the informant said, was the Israeli Embassy in Washington.
Only the day before, terrorists had exploded two bombs in London, one near the Israeli Embassy and the other outside the headquarters of the Joint Israel Appeal, a fund-raising organization, prompting Israeli officials to warn of an international campaign by radical Islamic groups opposed to Middle East peace efforts. Eight days earlier, an explosion at a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires killed at least 96 people. The same day, a bomb exploded on a Panamanian commuter plane killing 21 people, including 12 Jews.
At 1:15 A.M. on Wednesday, Louis R. Anemone, the chief of patrol forces for the New York City Police Department, got a phone call at home from the police operations center. He knew about the bombings abroad and he listened intently as a sergeant spelled out the details. The sources of the information sounded reliable.
"I looked at the whole package," Chief Anemone said yesterday, "and I said, 'Louie, this might be the real one."'
Working on his home phone, Chief Anemone dispatched dozens of officers to the two spots in Manhattan, some of them Emergency Service Units equipped with shotguns and submachine guns.
He needed barriers, quickly. The Department of Sanitation loaded 10 dump trucks with sand and lined them up nose to tailgate in front of the two buildings. Later, the trucks were replaced by three-foot-high slabs of concrete that usually serve as highway dividers.
Before dawn, the bomb squad swept through both of the buildings with technicians and dogs trained to detect explosives. They made a second run through the Defense Ministry building later in the morning. But they found nothing.
By 2:45 A.M., Chief Anemone was on Second Avenue, in front of the Israeli Mission to the United Nations, directing his troops. A few minutes later he ordered that a message be sent to all 75 precincts in the city: Check on any facilities that might possibly be vulnerable to Middle East-oriented terrorists and step up security.
As the day progressed, Chief Anemone extended special protection to other possible targets, including Temple Emanuel-El at Fifth Avenue and 65th Street and the Israeli Tourism and Economic Development Office in the Empire State Building.
Yesterday morning at City Hall, about 150 leaders of Jewish organizations, concerned about the terrorist threat, met with top aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and senior police officials. Afterward, Mark J. Miller, the executive director of the New York Jewish Community Relations Council, said, "They're on top of the situation."
Chief Anemone said he thought his officers had been a "calming influence.
"I anticipate this crisis period will pass," he said, 'that we will get through this and that there will be a gradual return to normalcy."
Outside the Israeli Mission to the United Nations yesterday, the police wore their usual pale blue short-sleeved summer shirts and service caps. There were no helmets or heavy weapons in sight.
"The idea is to make people feel safe, not to frighten them," said John Miller, the Deputy Police Commissioner for public information, "Just because you don't see the hardware doesn't mean it isn't there."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 30, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about security measures in New York City after terrorist attacks in London and Buenos Aires misidentified the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. He is Michael S. Miller, not Mark J. Miller.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE COST;
From Budget Office, Surprising Findings

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office has found that the health insurance bill from the Senate Finance Committee would insure 20 million of the estimated 39 million Americans who now lack coverage and save the Federal Government money in the process.
The Finance Committee bill would not require either employers or individuals to buy insurance, relying instead on changes in insurance laws and on subsidies for people with incomes up to twice the Federal poverty level, or about $28,000 for a family of four. The bill provides that if 95 percent of Americans are not insured by 2002, a commission would recommend what Congress should do next, and Congress would be required to consider the proposal quickly. 
 The study was released as House leaders put the final touches on a very different measure, relying on employer payments and promising universal coverage, that they will unveil on Friday to House Democrats.
The report on the Senate Finance Committee measure by the Congressional Budget Office, on which Congress relies for estimates of the cost of measures it adopts, makes it clear that the bill would miss the 95 percent target its sponsors set. It concludes that the bill would raise the percentage of Americans insured from the current 85 percent to 91 percent by 1997 and 92 percent by 1998 -- and then not increase it further.
The report was something of a surprise, because when the committee considered the bill it cut taxes and added benefits liberally. But the budget office found that this bill would not only be in balance, but would also provide $13.3 billion in savings through 2004 to reduce the Federal debt.
The bill includes an automatic reduction in subsidies, and thus insurance coverage, if spending is about to exceed receipts. The budget office found that this provision would work if needed. But it concluded that without a deep recession, those cuts would not be necessary because the bill's taxes on tobacco, payrolls and insurance premiums would leave it solidly financed.
The findings are certain to fuel the debate between those who advocate universal coverage, with required insurance purchases and employer payments, and those who contend that almost as much progress can be made, much more simply, with voluntary changes.
 
White House Unimpressed
 The White House weighed in immediately on the critical side. Lorrie McHugh, its health care spokeswoman, said, "We doubt that leaving tens of millions of hard-working middle-class Americans without real health security will be acceptable to the public."
But supporters of the Finance Committee bill were surprised and pleased by the report. One of the two chief sponsors of the approach taken in the bill, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, called the report "shockingly good news. For the first time, the federal bureaucracy is realizing that marketplace reforms can work."
The report, like the Congressional Budget Office studies of other health care proposals, also offered widespread criticism of the plan. It expressed concerns about additional burdens the bill would place on state insurance departments. It said the dual systems of subsidies, one for low-income families and another specifically for low-income children and pregnant women, would offer "a confusing array of options from which low-income families would have to choose." And it found that the taxes on high-cost insurance might be higher than sponsors expected and would cause serious administrative problems for companies that provided such insurance.
There was no immediate reaction either from the committee chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, or from the majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine. With the cost estimates in the report, however, Mr. Mitchell can move ahead with final drafting of the proposal he will put before the Senate next week. That measure will combine elements of his own invention with provisions of the Finance Committee bill and a more liberal measure approved by the Labor and Human Resources Committee.
 
House Closes In
 On the other side of Capitol Hill, House committee chairmen met with their leaders tonight and emerged saying they were close to completing their bill, which would remain closely modeled on the measure passed by the Committee on Ways and Means.
That would reach universal coverage by requiring employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' insurance and by creating an extension of Medicare to cover people who cannot get insurance at work.
Issues still unresolved, the leaders said, included how to deal with abortion, whether government should pick up coverage for early retirees and when to implement fully the requirement that employers contribute to their workers' insurance. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, was expected to resolve most of those issues overnight.
Representative Sam Gibbons, the Florida Democrat who is acting chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the House was ready to lead. "I am 74 years old, and I've watched Congress for many years, and I've yet to find the Senate do any heavy lifting on those kinds of issues," he said, putting health care in the same category as Social Security and Medicare.
"The heavy lifting starts over here," said the 31-year Congressman.
 
Political Science
 Today the leadership gave the members a double-barreled lesson in the politics of the issues. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington attacked Republicans for "crass political obstruction of a problem that the American people think should be solved."
Earlier a pollster, Mark Mellman, went before a party caucus to tell Democratic members that even if health care was not at the top of their constituents' agenda yet, it would be if they failed to pass a bill. He said that to overcome anti-incumbent feeling the members needed to run "on a platform of accomplishment," and health care should be its centerpiece.
But even as Democratic leaders were concluding efforts to turn bills passed by committees into measures for consideration in the House and Senate, Republicans pressed for delay. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, told a meeting at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, "The American people are going to insist, they are insisting that we not rush to judgment."
He said that the Congress need not hurry, because there was no crisis in health care. "If you want to see a health care crisis," he said, "go to Sarajevo, or go somewhere in Rwanda.

An article yesterday about a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the health care bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee referred incorrectly in some editions to the number of Americans who would obtain health insurance under the bill. The report said 20 million, not 23 million, of the 39 million Americans without health insurance would be added to insurance rolls by the Finance Committee bill.

Chart: "DIARY: Health Care Developments"
 
YESTERDAY
The Congressional Budget Office concluded that a health care bill backed by the Senate Finance Committee would save the Government money and insure 92 percent of Americans by 1998, up from 85 percent today.
 
THE WHITE HOUSE
Mr. Clinton met at the White House with business leaders who support his plan, which calls for national health insurance financed by employer contributions. Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Senate liberals who said later they would try to amend the plan the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, is expected to offer next week.
 
CONGRESS
The budget office report found that the Finance Committee bill, which does not require either individuals or employers to buy insurance, would fall short of its own target of covering 95 percent of Americans by 2002 but the analysts concluded it was adequately financed and would actually cut the deficit by $13.3 billion through 2004. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, is expected to unveil a plan today that would expand Medicare to cover the poor, the uninsured and some small businesses, while also giving some workers the option of buying the same coverage that Federal workers and members of Congress get.
 
LOBBYING
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced that it would sponsor a one-hour satellite television broadcast on Monday night to showcase the Republican National Committee's ideas. G.O.P. leaders have been rebuffed by the commercial networks in their attempt to buy time for a similar show. People with satellite dishes will be able to view the program.

HEADLINE: ACCORD REACHED ON SWEEPING BILL TO BATTLE CRIME

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators today approved a sweeping $30.2 billion anti-crime bill providing for 100,000 new police officers, a ban on some assault weapons and the death penalty for scores of crimes.
 President Clinton hailed the bill as "the toughest, largest, smartest Federal attack on crime in the history of our country." But critics, including some law-enforcement officials, called it a social-welfare boondoggle and, in the words of Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, "the whole Emerald City of Oz." 
The bill, which is about seven inches thick, would spend roughly equal amounts of money on prevention, punishment and new prisons. It provides money for drug courts and to fight violence against women. It pays for sports leagues and provides anti-gang grants to give young people positive alternatives to crime.
 It also helps states pay for the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens, and it would expand the application of the death penalty to about 60 Federal crimes, including carjacking. But it no longer contains a House provision to allow death-row inmates to challenge their sentences as racially motivated.
 After a marathon session that started on Wednesday morning and broke up at 2:15 A.M. today in a dispute over money for prisons, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called his colleagues at 5:30 A.M. to meet before the full conference was to resume at 8 this morning.
 When the negotiators reconvened, they zipped through the remaining hurdles and forwarded the bill to the two chambers. The House is expected to act on it next week, and the Senate shortly thereafter.
 Despite some misgivings over the bill, most Democrats and some Republicans appear eager to pass anti-crime legislation in this election year. Congress has been on the brink of passing crime bills in the past, only to see them fall to partisan bickering.
 The President is anxious to sign the bill, which represents one of the few major promises he made as a candidate in 1992 that he has been able to turn into law.
 A happy Mr. Clinton, at a rally at the Justice Department celebrating passage of the bill, said, "This is one of the reasons why I ran for President."
 The money for the bill, an extraordinary amount at a time when Federal spending is stagnant, is supposed to come from a trust fund set up specifically to fight crime. "These are real dollars," Senator Biden said today at the news conference with Mr. Clinton. "This isn't funny money."
 The Administration says the trust fund will not increase the deficit because nearly the same amount of money -- about $30 billion to be spent over the next six years -- will be saved by the anticipated retirement of 265,000 Federal workers over the same period. But the Congressional Budget Office has said the Administration vastly overestimates its savings from the work-force reductions, and some Republicans remain dubious about the financing.
 The bill also authorizes programs that would cost an additional $3.1 billion, which would not come from the trust fund. Those programs would have to be financed, if at all, at the expense of other appropriations.
 An example would be a police corps proposed in the bill, a program that would provide partial college scholarships for students who agreed to serve as law-enforcement officers after graduation. The bill says it would cost $400 million for an unspecified number of students, but since the plan would not be financed from the trust fund, Congress would have to appropriate the money to implement the program.
 Mr. Clinton and the bill's supporters in Congress said the legislation was the first to meld prevention and punishment into one package. Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, said, "While this bill extends the harsh penalty approach, which hasn't worked but is politically popular, this is more than offset by a powerful set of prevention programs, including education, drug treatment and job training."
 The bill also represents the first major attempt by the Federal Government to deal with crime, which has traditionally been left to state and local governments.
 Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who steered the legislation through the House, said, "We are at a stage in America in the 1990's where we were on economic issues in 1910; state and local governments are unable to deal with the problem, and the Federal Government has to jump in."
 
Prevention and Punishment
 The bill divides the money equally over six years for prevention programs, punishment and new prisons.
 The bill gives $10.7 billion to state and local law enforcement, including money to put 100,000 new officers on the beat. The police officers are to be allocated on the basis of need. Mr. Schumer said that meant "New York will do very well." The city could hire 3,000 to 5,000 new officers, he said.
 Charles Moose, the chief of police in Portland, Ore., said at the rally, "This bill will allow local police officers to begin operating from a position of strength."
 Publicly, senior officials at Federal law-enforcement agencies have supported the crime bill. Privately, officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco complain that they are being forced to hold their budgets in line while billions of dollars are going to the many programs in the crime bill.
 
Seen as Political Gesture
 Many law enforcement officials say they doubt that those programs will put much of a dent in violent crime and view them as a political gesture by President Clinton to make him seem tough on crime. They are also fearful that the huge bill will mean many added responsibilities for Federal law-enforcement agencies without additional financing to carry them out.
 The bill would require mandatory life sentences for someone convicted of a violent Federal crime who had two previous convictions for serious felonies, Federal or state.
 Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said the session in the early hours had produced a mess of a bill, one that "could have been concocted by a university sociology department" because of its $9 billion for prevention programs like midnight basketball. But he stopped short of saying he would oppose the bill.
 The measure that has received a disproportionate amount of attention wound up not being in the final bill. That is the so-called Racial Justice Act, which would have allowed death-row inmates to challenge their sentences as motivated by racial bias.
 It was supported by members of the Congressional Black Caucus and various liberals but was adamantly opposed by a majority in the Senate, including by several Democrats. The measure was approved by House negotiators on Wednesday night, but in the final meeting, negotiators excised it for fear that including it would bring down the whole bill.
 "Our efforts were not in vain," said a disappointed Representative Don Edwards, the California Democrat who pushed for the provision. "It did bring to the attention of the American people and President Clinton the fact that this remnant of slavery, this ugly remnant where the judicial system considers a black life not as important as a white life, does exist."
 Money for prisons proved the sticking point early this morning as negotiators met at a closed session for what they said would be 20 minutes but which turned into three hours.
 Everyone agreed that states should have more money for prisons, but they disagreed over the requirements for the states to get the money. The Senate negotiators said the states should agree to stiff sentencing policies, while House wanted less stringent sentencing.
 They had already agreed on two other provisions that had blocked the conference from occurring for more than a month. Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a strong opponent of gun control, had threatened to hold up the entire bill if it included a ban on assault weapons, which had been approved by both houses. Mr. Brooks raised the issue in conference, calling the ban a "vendetta" against legitimate gun owners, but he lost.
 The ban covers 19 assault weapons as well as models altered to skirt the ban. The bill also makes it a Federal crime to sell handguns to minors or for minors to possess a handgun under most circumstances.
 As a consolation to Mr. Brooks, many members of the House negotiating team, and subsequently the Senators, agreed to a measure that would exempt pawnbrokers from the Brady law. The law requires people buying guns to undergo background checks; Mr. Brooks's exemption says pawnbrokers do not have to conduct such checks.
 Another gun-related measure is also included in the final bill. This is the "hunter rights" amendment, also drafted by Mr. Brooks, which prohibits even peaceful anti-hunting protests on Federal lands.
"It was a political chit that they fed to Brooks to compensate for the assault weapons," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the United States.

An article yesterday about Con gressional agreement on crime legis lation characterized the bill as "one of the few major promises President Clinton made in the 1992 campaign that he has been able to turn into law."
The characterization of Mr. Clin ton's record was overly broad. A number of initiatives for which he promised support in 1992 have been passed since he took office. Some of the most important were a deficit reduction bill, the North American Free Trade Agreement, rules allow ing abortion counseling in federallyfinanced clinics, a waiting period for handgun purchases and a national service program.

HEADLINE: Channel 13 to Pare Budget By Laying Off 60 Employees

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Facing a need to cut its budget once again, WNET-TV announced sweeping layoffs yesterday that will affect every department of Channel 13, the public television station that serves New York.
 Sixty of 480 positions will be eliminated, station executives said, as Channel 13 pares its budget to $105 million a year. Two years ago the station's budget was $137 million.
 The layoffs are the second the station has announced since 1991. That year 69 employees were eliminated.
 William F. Baker, the president of WNET, said the station had been slow to be hit by the economic recession that struck commercial television outlets in the last five years, but had been equally slow pulling out of that recession.
 The station continues to face economic pressures, Mr. Baker said, "because we have no operating margin, no cushion to ride out this storm."
 
Production Center Phaseout
 He said Channel 13 was close to a decision on phasing out its production center in Manhattan. If that happens, two national public television programs, "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour" and "The Charlie Rose Show," would have to find other studios.
 Mr. Baker said Channel 13 had subsidized both programs by providing production facilities for fees that do not cover Channel 13's costs. "We can't subsidize them anymore," he said. "We don't have the money."
 The staff cuts are extremely painful, Mr. Baker said, but the station had no choice.
 "We have to maintain a balanced budget," he said. "We don't want to get into a situation where we get into the red. Then we'll just constantly be adding bills we can't pay."
 The main shortfall in the budget has come about because of a decrease in corporate grants to the station, Mr. Baker said. "We have 325,000 members; that's more than we've ever had," he said, though another Channel 13 executive said that the income from memberships was actually flat.
 
No Long-Term Promises
 The cutbacks will be across the board, Mr. Baker said, and an effort will be made to keep the effects of the downsizing from showing up on the air. "In the near term, our hope is that viewers will not notice," he said. "But I can't make promises for the long term. If we have to phase out the production facilities, viewers are going to notice some effects on the shows we've been producing here."
 But he restated Channel 13's commitment to both "MacNeil/Lehrer" and "Charlie Rose." He said, "Those shows will have to continue, especially 'MacNeil/Lehrer."'
 Despite the continuing financial problems, Mr. Baker said, Channel 13's long-range future is secure. He said that a capital campaign to support the station, begun three years ago, has already obtained commitments of $40 million. That money will be used in the way that universities use endowments, Mr. Baker said.
 "When we have access to the money it will begin throwing off interest that we'll use in a variety of ways," Mr. Baker said. "But mainly it will give Channel 13 the financial cushion it has never had before."
 Mr. Baker said that Channel 13 hoped to have the funds from the capital campaign in place in three years. "The next three years are the tough years," he said.

HEADLINE: 10,000 Stampede as Russian Stock Collapses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 29

 BODY:
Russia's largest investment company virtually collapsed today as more than 10,000 outraged stockholders stampeded the colonnaded headquarters of Moscow's commodities exchange, smashing windows as they tried desperately to unload their shares in the plummeting fund.
After promising on Thursday that it would begin to buy back stock for the equivalent of about $60 a share, officials of the troubled company, MMM, announced this morning that they had cut the value to almost nothing. 
 Investors crowded the exchange building, where windows were broken. Told that they were at the wrong place to redeem their shares, they then raced across the city to the company's headquarters, hoping against all odds that somebody there would purchase their shares at a decent price.
But by this evening, a share of the nation's most popular stock -- owned by between 5 million and 10 million people -- cost less than 50 cents.
"Those who have been trading MMM stock have been gambling," said Sergei K. Dubinin, the acting Finance Minister, speaking after the Government held a special session of the Cabinet to discuss the dimensions of free-market Russia's most spectacular financial disaster, and how seriously it would mar the struggling image of capitalism here. "Sooner or later the game had to come to an end," he said.
That is because MMM was built on sand. It was the most aggressive and successful of the country's many new stock funds, with television ads that were becoming as well known here as Coke or Pepsi ads are in the United States. The Government has called MMM a classic pyramid scheme: its soaring stock prices were fueled only by the people who bought shares. The company reported no earnings, revealed no investments, explained no financial strategy.
It never had to. Until today at least, Russian capitalism, only really active since the collapse of Communism, remained almost wholly unregulated. Pyramid schemes, not uncommon in confused or troubled economies like those of Russia and the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, offer higher and higher returns to lure new investors.
Shares that cost the equivalent of about a dollar in February had rocketed to about $50 by Monday. Unlike the United States, where earnings and revenues are reported in many daily newspapers, this country has almost no such published information.
For most people, the facts didn't seem to matter. Even after repeated warnings from the Government, and after President Boris N. Yeltsin announced at a nationally televised news conference in June that he certainly would never invest in MMM, ordinary people kept buying the stock, attracted by promises of ever increasing prices and convenient salesrooms around Russia.
Asked what the company did to earn its income, not one of more than a dozen people interviewed this week could say. All, however, shared a firm belief that the problem lay not in the stock fund but in the country's leaders.
 
Investor Blames Government
 "This is a Government of liars and thieves," said Monya S. Yaliknova, as she stood along with 10,000 others outside the MMM headquarters in southern Moscow today. "They are attacking one company because it was able to make people prosperous and happy." Then, distilling the confusion that has affected so many investors in the new Russian economy, she added this: "Anyway, if there was a problem the Government should have stepped in and done something about it."
Now it may have to. MMM has so many investors -- the Government says five million, the company claims twice that number -- that its perils have become as much a political issue as a financial one. The president of MMM, Sergei Mavrody, has been artful in describing the crisis as one the Government made by harassing him. Although the assertion was made without a shred of evidence, a remarkable number of people here said they believed him.
The crisis came to a head last week when the Finance Ministry issued a stern warning about the questionable stock of MMM and other companies that are springing up across the country. Tax inspectors fined the company $29 million, closed some of its provincial offices and said Mr. Mavrody, who had suggested he would declare bankruptcy if the authorities did not leave him alone, was trying to blackmail them.
"The governmental persecution of MMM provoked a panic and the massive unloading of MMM shares," Mr. Mavrody said today in a statement to stockholders, some of whom had camped outside his headquarters for days. "Under such conditions it would be senseless to continue to buy up the shares. That would only lead to the firm's bankruptcy."
Mr. Mavrody asked shareholders to keep their stock for two or three months and said that despite the fact that the price was cut a hundredfold in a day it would soon soar again. "We, unlike the state, have never deceived you, and never will."
Most economists said today that despite many Government entreaties during the last month imploring buyers of MMM to beware, it would be very difficult for the Yeltsin Administration to ignore the plight of millions who have now lost their savings and their belief in the free-market system. They said the most damaging effect of the collapse could be to turn people away from free enterprise permanently, before they have had time to learn the meaning of risk and reward.
"MMM's collapse will certainly undermine people's confidence in the market economy in general," said Stanislav Shatalin, a well known economist here. "The Government will also suffer from this crisis, despite all its warnings."
Several members of Parliament, which is on vacation, suggested that a special session be called for next week to discuss the affair. Government tax officials, financial auditors and political leaders said they would begin investigations. Even Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev, made public comments that MMM was a fraud and people should stop supporting it.
But one influential group, the Russian Business Round Table, a loose association of employers and unions, said both the company and the Government were ultimately to blame.
"The Government did nothing to protect the population against violations of the principles of business ethics," the group said in a statement. "As a result unscrupulous businessmen were able to use the opportunities that opened up before them."

HEADLINE: Economy Is Up 3.7% but Signs Hint of Slowing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
In a report that cheered the Administration and financial markets for different reasons, the Commerce Department said today that the nation's economy grew at a brisk annual pace of 3.7 percent in the second quarter. But the report also showed that while businesses were expanding their production, unsold goods were piling up on store shelves as consumer spending slowed sharply.
The stock and bond markets rallied strongly on the announcement as investors decided that well-stocked retailers would stop ordering new goods and, as a result, the pace of economic growth might slow in the months ahead. Slower growth would help keep inflation, which is now just below 3 percent, in check and could reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.67 points today to 3,764.50, while the interest rate on the closely watched 30-year Treasury bonds plunged to 7.39 percent from 7.54 percent, the biggest one-day drop in months. [Page 35.]
But as the markets welcomed the prospect of a slowdown, the Administration saw the report as signaling that economic growth was still robust and creating new jobs. Officials predicted that retailers and wholesale distributors would quickly sell their extra inventories, clearing shelves for factories to fill again.
"The U.S. economy continues to turn in a fine performance," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "So far, everything we've seen in 1994 confirms our forecast of a sustainable investment-led expansion with low inflation."
Despite the enthusiastic reception from the financial markets and the Administration, some analysts warned that both could be disappointed. Still unclear is whether the economy is really as strong as a 3.7 percent growth rate might suggest. And a price index in the economic figures today showed that inflation may be beginning to creep up again because of brisk economic growth and low interest rates last winter.
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that "all the aspects of the report that were happy were questionable." He said personal income growth was still strong, hinting at a rebound in consumption. As soon as next Friday, when the employment report for July is released, Mr. Lipsky said investors hoping for slower growth could be disappointed.
The most compelling figures in today's report concerned inventories. But because analysts offered differing explanations for why they increased so much, it was still unclear what the inventory buildup meant for economic growth the rest of this year.
The nation's stores and warehouses filled up with an extra $50 billion in unsold goods during the quarter. It was the biggest increase in inventories since the fourth quarter of 1987, when the stock market crash produced a drop in spending.
Slow sales were partly to blame. Consumer spending plunged, falling to an annual rate of just 1.2 percent in the second quarter from 4.7 percent in the first quarter. In a sign that this year's rising interest rates may be starting to have an effect, the slowing was most pronounced for big-ticket purchases for which consumers often borrow money. Sales of cars and car parts, for instance, fell slightly.
But Ms. Tyson said that much of the increase in inventories took place because business managers believed that they could sell a lot more merchandise -- an interpretation of the data that points to steady or more growth, not less.
She contended that business executives were reacting to polls showing high consumer confidence and to the nation's rapid growth in jobs, which means that more Americans have spending money. She also pointed to historical evidence that inventories have stayed unusually low during the current economic expansion.
"I think there are a number of indicators that really are consistent with the view that this inventory accumulation we've seen in the second quarter is actually a planned phenomenon responding to the belief in the longevity of the expansion and in the size of its continued forward momentum," she said.
Congressional testimony last week by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that he might agree with Ms. Tyson. But that view could prompt him to raise interest rates at some point, because continued momentum in the economy would raise the risk of inflationary bottlenecks in production, with companies bidding up the price of scarce materials and skilled workers.
"To be sure, some hints of moderation in the growth of domestic final demand have appeared, and the recent indications of accelerating inventory accumulation may suggest an unwanted backing up of stocks," Mr. Greenspan said, drawing out the word "may" in a tone that suggested skepticism. "Conversely, the inventory accumulation may reflect pressures on firms who had brought inventories down to suboptimal levels and now need to replenish them. In the latter case, stock-building may continue at an above-normal rate, supporting production for quite some time."
A further interest rate increase could set the stage for a confrontation with Administration officials, who have made it clear that they believe the Federal Reserve's four increases this spring in short-term interest rates have already been enough to forestall inflation.
Taking the other view, some Wall Street economists said that retailers might cut back their orders sharply until the inventory backlogs were cleared. James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan, said that he reduced his estimate today of third-quarter growth to 3 percent from 4 percent because he expected retailers to draw down their stocks now before ordering more goods.
David B. Bostian, the chief economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., a New York brokerage firm, predicted that economic growth could drop sharply because of the inventories. "I conclude from this report that we're really on the precipice as far as the economy slowing down," he said.
But Mr. Bostian added that he doubted that this risk would dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates yet again, particularly because the price index in the report rose 2.9 percent, suggesting that inflation was no longer falling and might be creeping up again..
Rising exports also buoyed economic growth during the second quarter, as did a slowing in the shrinkage of military procurement of goods and services.
 
Statistics Are Revised
 The Government today also revised slightly its statistics on economic growth for the last three years. Using information recently compiled from annual surveys of various industries, the data showed that quarterly and annual fluctuations in economic growth were less than previously thought.
For instance, last year's torrid fourth-quarter growth of 7 percent was revised down to 6.3 percent. But the department also revised first- quarter growth last year up to 1.2 percent from eight-tenths of a percent. The figures produced no change in the department's previous estimate of overall growth last year of 3.1 percent.
The Commerce Department also revised its figures to show that the recession in 1991 was a little milder than previous estimates, and the recovery in 1992 was a little less brisk.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1994 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNVEIL PROPOSAL FOR HEALTH BILL

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders unveiled a national health care plan today that promises universal coverage by 1999, and they immediately embarked on what is expected to be an epic, two-week legislative struggle to assemble a Democratic majority behind it.
"This bill is about the courage of this Congress," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, who urged his colleagues to step up to a moment in history, just as previous Congresses did with Social Security and Medicare. 
 As expected, the plan announced today was modeled on the measure passed last month by the Ways and Means Committee. It would achieve universal coverage, in large part, by requiring employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' insurance, with subsidies to cushion the burden on small, low-wage companies. It would also create a vast new extension of the Medicare program to serve as "a safety net" for people who are unemployed, have part-time jobs, or otherwise cannot get coverage through work.
It would enact sweeping new rules for the insurance industry intended to make coverage easier to get, particularly for people with "pre-existing conditions." It would also define a new basic benefit package that would be guaranteed every American, and create a new system of subsidies to help low-income working people afford coverage.
President Clinton hailed the plan as "simpler, more flexible and more sensitive to the needs of small business" than his original proposal, but achieving the same goals of universal coverage and holding down costs. "The House bill tells the American people that they have been heard," Mr. Clinton declared, underscoring the recent drumbeat from the White House and Capitol Hill that the President's own much-maligned plan is no longer in play.
But even the most committed partisans of the House leaders' plan acknowledge that getting the 218 votes necessary for passage is an extraordinary challenge. They face fierce and unrelenting opposition from businesses to any new requirement that employers help pay for insurance. The United States Chamber of Commerce characterized the plan today as a "Bride of Frankenstein" proposal.
Democratic strategists also face House Republicans who made it clear again today that their votes are simply not to be had for a bill from the Democratic leadership. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said the leadership's plan "lunges too far, at too great a cost, with too much government, and the truth is, it will do irreparable damage to the American system."
But of greatest concern to House Democratic leaders is the unrest and apprehension in their own ranks: among moderate and conservative Democrats who argue that the plan goes too far to the left, and among the many members who seem torn between their desire for universal coverage and their fear of the political cost of voting for an employer mandate.
That fear was articulated in a closed Democratic caucus today, when Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee and a staunch critic of the leadership on health care, warned his colleagues that this kind of plan did not have a prayer in the Senate. Thus, Mr. Cooper asserted later, House members would "walk the plank one more time," only to be overturned by the Senate.
 
Dueling Debates
 In the Senate, where resistance to the new requirement on business is, in fact, considered to be far greater, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, announced today that he would unveil his plan on Tuesday. He also announced that floor debate, originally expected to begin in the Senate next week, would be delayed until the week after.
That means that both the House and the Senate will take up the health care bill in the week of Aug. 8. The House, with its tighter rules, is expected to complete action by the end of that week; no one has a firm prediction on how long the Senate will take.
Democrats in the House have been imploring their leaders to wait for the Senate to vote on the controversial employer requirements before asking the House to act. But Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, said today that the House would push ahead regardless of the Senate schedule. Tying the House pace to the Senate, leadership strategists suggest, would cede operational control of the Congress to Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, who has vast powers to slow down the Senate.
"We have never, ever keyed our action in the House to any schedule, possible, probable, potential, or otherwise, in the Senate," Mr. Foley said today. "Frankly, we could not do it if we wished to."
Amid all the political scrambling, House leaders today tried to reach for the broader significance of what they are attempting to do. "This is truly, in my judgment, a bill of the magnitude of the Social Security Act and the Medicare Act and other seminal acts taken by Congress that have redounded to the benefit of our citizens," Mr. Foley declared at a leadership news conference this afternoon.
Leaders also underscored, again and again, how much this bill has changed during its six-month journey through the committees, followed by the process of final drafting and melding by the leadership. "This is not the Clinton bill," said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the majority whip. "Our plan cuts bureaucracy, cuts the cost to taxpayers, cuts the alliances that everyone calls big government, cuts the automatic price controls, cuts red tape and cuts the burden on small business."
 
No Purchasing Alliances
 There are, in fact, some important differences with the Clinton plan: The large insurance purchasing pools known as alliances, which most Americans would have been required to join and which had substantial regulatory powers, are gone.
Democratic leaders also argued that they have taken pains to respond to the concerns of small business. The mandated employer financing would be phased in, applying to companies with more than 100 employees by January 1997 and to smaller companies by January 1999. Moreover, businesses with 25 or fewer employees would be eligible for subsidies up to 50 percent of their costs, and those with 26 to 50 employees would be eligible for subsidies up to 37.5 percent.
Mr. Gephardt argued that the hourly cost of this employer mandate would be "not unlike a minimum-wage increase." And, he suggested, it might take the place of one, arguing that if the plan passed, "we won't have a minimum-wage increase."
 
Unresolved Issues
 In addition to contributions from employers and employees, officials said, the plan would be financed by slowing the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid, raising the tobacco tax by 45 cents a pack and imposing a 2 percent surcharge on private health insurance premiums.
Even as the bill moves toward the floor, there are some issues unresolved; chief among them is how abortion should be treated in the basic benefit package. The lobbying is expected to escalate dramatically in the coming days, particularly on issues that affect how vast segments of the health industry do business; one of those is a provision requiring health maintenance organizations and other networks to work with "any willing provider" in a region.
Leaders today acknowledged, however, that the debate is still on the fundamental issues: Should the country move toward guaranteeing coverage to every American, or should it settle for more incremental approaches? Mr. Gephardt warned today that more modest insurance reforms would only result in higher premium costs to the middle class, as sicker people enter the system and the young and healthier opt out because of rising costs.
But there is an influential contingent in the House, led by Mr. Cooper, among others, that is working on an incremental bill that neither promises universal coverage nor requires employers to contribute. Those members today described the leadership's plan as to the left of the Clinton plan. "I didn't think the President's would fly, and I don't think this will either," said Representative Roy Rowland, Democrat of Georgia.
These members are working with a handful of Republicans on a bipartisan bill, which they said will be ready next week. This could be the real rival to the leadership's plan.
For now, ready or not, Democrats are heading toward a historic debate -- with great uncertainty on whether the outcome with be another Social Security or a legislative catastrophe.
At the news conference today, the leaders and the whip organization, ordinarily a loose and jovial crew, seemed solemn and intense. "We're going to have a debate," Mr. Gephardt said. "This is going to be a fire and light show. We're going to debate this bill and we're going to test our adversaries and they're going to test us. And when it's over, we're going to vote."

HEADLINE: Americans in Haiti Fear an Invasion

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 29

 BODY:
More than a dozen American warships are now stationed just off Haiti with the stated purpose of protecting the Americans living here. But many of the people who are supposed to feel reassured say they would be a lot happier if the ships would sail away and leave them alone.
"We are safe down here, and have been for many years," said Mickey McLaney, who came to Haiti two decades ago to run a hotel and a swimsuit business, neither of which is now open. "We don't need that kind of help. Before they put this embargo on, we were doing just fine." 
 Disagreement with most aspects of the Clinton Administration's policy toward Haiti is widespread among Americans living here, especially executives who resent the American-sponsored economic sanctions that have cut them off from markets and suppliers in the United States and forced them to close their businesses.
 
Anxiety and Depression
 "We can't put money in banks, and we can't write checks," complained Ed Gollon, an Arkansas native whose interests here range from maintaining sewing equipment to making alcoholic beverages. "The whole country is kaput, and there is a great deal of frustration, anxiety and depression as this thing drags on and on and on."
The sanctions against Haiti will turn a notch tighter on Saturday with the departure of the last regularly scheduled airline flight.
But many Americans here say they are especially leery of becoming pawns in Washington's struggle to force the military leadership under Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras to step down and to restore the country's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom many of the Americans do not trust or like. They recall previous American invasions of Panama and Grenada, when the safety of Americans became the justification for sending in the troops.
"I don't think that any American in this country wants American soldiers to die for the return of this man," said Don Moore, operations manager for Brasserie Nationale d'Haiti, the country's leading brewery and beer and soda distributor. The real solution to Haiti's crisis, he said, "is to keep that priest in the United States, not here."
But another, probably smaller, group dismisses the complaints of their fellow Americans and is more sympathetic to Father Aristide and the social changes he espouses.
 
'The Expatriate Life-Style'
 "A lot of these people have gotten used to the expatriate life-style, with the big houses, the servants and the parties, and don't want to see it threatened," said one relief worker, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The United States Embassy estimates that about 3,000 Americans remain in Haiti, less than half the number who were living here before the economic sanctions were imposed. The expatriate community, most of whom live in the capital and maintain a system of neighborhood "wardens" to act as intermediaries with the embassy, includes black, white and mixed-race Americans.
Many are businessmen who came to Haiti with their families to start or run the assembly plants that sprang up here during the Duvalier dictatorship, though a few have lived here longer. Others came to work for international aid and relief agencies on development projects, or at hospitals and feeding stations, while some are naturalized citizens of Haitian descent.
The American community here ranges in age from Victor Wynne, 95, a former Navy engineer who arrived during the 19-year American military occupation that ended in 1934, to hundreds of young children born in New York or Miami to parents who fled Haiti under the Duvaliers and their successors and later chose to return.
 
Many Young Children
 Mr. McLaney said that about 70 percent of the more than 700 Americans for whom he was responsible as a warden were children 10 or younger, a fact that worries him.
"What am I supposed to do about a 2-year-old who is an American citizen, but whose parents are not?" he asked. "If there really is an invasion and we have to have an evacuation, how do I tell the rest of that family the child is entitled to protection but they are not?"
As tensions between Washington and the military government here have mounted, there have been a few isolated incidents in which Americans have complained of being harassed by government supporters, as well as one in which a black Canadian was beaten by the police. But overall, Americans have been relatively immune from the horrible violence that has affected Haitians, said Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the American Embassy.
But some Americans fear that the barrage of talk about military intervention could make things dangerous for them.
The crisis has to some extent strained relations between American residents and the embassy, which some expatriates see as a center of efforts to topple the military government. Several complain that the United States Government has been treating them almost as a hostile force -- for instance, opening mail they have sent to the United States, looking for checks and money transfers that might violate the embargo.
But most of all, they complain that official Washington is ignoring them.
If there is a single piece of advice they have to offer the Clinton Administration, Americans here said over and over, it is this: Stay out of Haiti. Don't invade and, above all, don't get mired in a repeat of the 1915-1934 military occupation.
"We did that already, and what did it solve?" asked Wally Turnbull, whose family has operated a Baptist mission in the hills above the capital since the 1940's. "You can't impose democracy with a big stick. The Marines were here all those years, but Haitians are not interested in following the American way. They have their own agenda, and they don't like to be told what to do."

HEADLINE: Rates Fall And Stock Prices Rise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Short- and long-term interest rates fell sharply yesterday and stocks jumped, as traders and investors concluded that the most recent economic reports indicated that the Federal Reserve Board would not push up interest rates as much or as quickly as they had previously thought.
 The catalyst for the markets was the Commerce Department's early morning report that gross domestic product, the sum of economic activity in the second quarter, grew by only 3.7 percent after inflation. Because consumer spending grew by only 1.2 percent in the second quarter, down from an average of 4.2 percent over the previous three quarters, while business inventories rose rapidly, economists said that businesses might soon cut back on production, thereby helping reduce economic growth in the current quarter to less than 3 percent.
 
 Such a slowdown in growth would be welcome news in the bond markets. Bond investors generally believe that the Federal Reserve favors a 2.5 percent growth rate, viewing that rate as one that would allow employment to grow while keeping inflation in check.
 
Market on a Gallop
 "The market took off on a gallop because some traders were fearful of a much stronger economic report," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, an affiliate of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 The gallop was fastest for long-term Treasury bonds, where the bellwether 6 1/4 percent issue due in 2024 rose nearly 1 3/4 points, or slightly more than $17 per $1,000 bond, to 86 /15 32 to yield 7.39 percent. That yield was the lowest since June 23, and down from 7.54 percent a day earlier.
 Stocks also rallied across the board, decisively reversing losses earlier in the week. All the leading indexes were up sharply, led by the Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 33.67 points, to 3,764.5. [Page 36.]
 Many traders said yesterday's bond trading was dominated more by securities firms and other speculators, than by institutions, which bought only modest amounts.
 Mr. Fine noted that the slower economic growth reported for the second quarter, which is widely expected to continue in the third quarter does not mean the end of the Fed's six-month push to raise short-term interest rates. Inflation is sure to rise in coming months, he said, and the Fed will be more concerned about the risk of accelerating inflation than about the risk that higher rates could cause economic growth to falter.
 Marshall B. Front, a managing director at Trees Front Associates, a Chicago investment counseling firm, said fears of inflation and rising interest rates, were overdone in recent weeks. Now that there are signs of slower economic growth, Treasury bond yields could drop as low as 7 percent, he predicted.
 But because the Federal Reserve will continue raising short-term interest rates, he said, most investors will continue buying intermediate-term issues due in seven years or less, rather than long-term bonds, which suffer the steepest price declines when interest rates rise.
 Many analysts are now debating whether the Fed's next move to raise interest rates is likely to come at its next policy-setting meeting -- on Aug. 16 -- or afterward. Until yesterday, they had been debating whether the next increase in rates would come on or before Aug.16.
 
Federal Funds Rate Watched
 The Federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks and is a benchmark for other short-term interest rates, has been about 4 1/4 percent since mid-May. The Fed controls the rate closely, and traders are now debating whether the Fed's next move will be to 4 1/2 percent or 4 3/4 percent.
 Yesterday's rally came as securities firms were beginning to look ahead to one of the largest Treasury financings of the year. Next Wednesday, securities dealers expect the Treasury to announce plans to sell more than $17 billion of three-year notes on Aug. 9, followed by about $12 billion of 10-year notes on Aug. 10, and $11 billion of 30-year bonds on Aug. 11.
 In yesterday's trading, the most recent three-year issue, the 6 1/2 percent notes due in May 1997 rose one-half point, to 100 5/8 to yield 6 1/4 percent, while the 7 1/4 percent notes due in about 10 years rose 16/32 to yield 7.10 percent.
 
Muni Bonds Rally, Too
 The rally in Treasury bonds spilled over to the municipal market. Despite a flurry of warnings this week by the New York State Comptroller and the Financial Control Board, an oversight agency, that New York City's budget for the coming year could become unbalanced, traders said prices of city bonds increased enough to reduce their yields by a tenth of a percentage point or more.
 "The market has heard it all before," said Duncan Smith, a mangaging director at Lebenthal & Company, when asked about the impact of recent warnings that the city might not collect some revenues it expects or fail to control spending. "People seem to think that the mayor is tough and will make the right choices when he has to," Mr. Smith said.
 The Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, for one, remains confident that the city will handle its budget woes without any defaults. On Thursday it told securities dealers it would sell an undisclosed additional amount of insurance to guarantee principal and interest on outstanding city issues. Insured bonds carry top-notch triple-A ratings and carry yields that are about four-tenths of a percentage point lower than bonds backed by only the city's promise to pay.
 City bonds now have medium grade ratings of Baa-1 from Moody's Investors Service and A- from the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which has warned that it might reduce its rating.
 By late Friday, New York City bonds due in five years were available in the wholesale market at yields of 5.30 percent, or about 5.10 percent for smaller orders. Bonds due in 10 years were about 6.05 percent wholesale and 5.90 percent retail, and yields of 6 percent or higher were available to individual investors for bonds due in about 15 years or more.

HEADLINE: Ambitious Plans for Iraqi Oil

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 28

 BODY:
Expressing confidence that the United Nations embargo on Iraqi oil exports will be lifted by early next year, Iraq's Oil Minister is preparing to triple oil production over the next few years from an initial two million barrels a day.
 Revenues from the increasing oil production could offset the cost of the reparations that Iraq must pay for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But it could also put pressure on world oil prices, unless demand keeps growing and production declines elsewhere.
 
 In an interview here, the Iraqi Oil Minister, Safa Hadi Jawad Habubi, estimated that Iraq would have the capacity to export slightly more than two million barrels of oil a day after the embargo is lifted.
 But he said Iraq intended to raise production to its OPEC quota of 3.6 million barrels a day, the same level as Iran, within 10 to 14 months, once it obtains the parts needed to repair oil installations damaged during the Persian Gulf war. Iraq was producing an estimated 3.3 million barrels a day before the war.
 
Plans for More Oilfields
 In the next six to eight years, the minister said Iraq would almost double this level of output, increasing production to six million barrels a day by developing new oilfields in the south of the country in joint ventures with foreign companies. Southern Iraq's undeveloped oil reserves are estimated at 20 billion to 30 billion barrels.
 Iraq's hopes have been bolstered by recent movement within the United Nations toward relaxing the embargo on Iraqi oil exports. Although the Security Council agreed not to remove the trade sanctions when it reviewed them recently, a number of countries, led by Russia and France, made clear that they would like to see sanctions relaxed early next year if Iraq continues to cooperate with United Nations disarmament efforts.
 Dr. Habubi's optimistic projections come at a time of rising oil prices. In the United States, crude oil for current delivery has surged above $20 a barrel from about $14.50 in late March.
 If Iraq succeeds in pushing up its oil production sharply, and if oil prices do not plunge because of increased supply, Iraq may by the end of the century be offsetting the painful economic consequences of invading Kuwait. It would be pumping enough new oil to compensate itself for the 30 percent slice of oil revenues that it must pay in reparations under the United Nations Security Council's terms for the gulf war cease-fire.
 Assuming Iraq can produce six million barrels of oil a day, it will be required to hand over the revenue from two million barrels a day to the Kuwait compensation fund, but it will still retain control over the other four million barrels a day. That would give it oil revenues comparable to those it reaped before the war, assuming oil prices remain unchanged.
 So far, compensation claims exceeding $100 billion have been filed with the United Nations against Iraq arising out of its attempted annexation of Kuwait.
 To reach an output of six million barrels a day, Dr. Habubi said Iraq and its foreign partners would need to invest $30 billion to $40 billion in its oilfields. "The investments will be shared between Iraq and the foreign oil companies," the minister said.
 Iraq has already signed agreements with two French oil companies, Total S.A. and Elf Aquitaine, to develop two big southern oilfields once sanctions end. Dr. Habubi said he would announce agreements with other foreign oil companies "in the next two or three months."
 To insure that Iraq's return to the oil market did not depress prices, Dr. Habubi said he expected Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to accept lower production quotas from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 In the longer term, however, he predicted that Iraq's plans to raise oil production would not weaken oil prices because rising Iraqi exports would merely fill the gap left by expected production declines in Algeria, Indonesia and the North Sea.
 
Outlook on Consumption
 World demand for oil is also likely to increase as North America and Europe continue to rebound from recent recessions and China and the Asian economies keep up their present rates of growth, he said.
 [Analysts in the United States did not seem surprised by the Iraqi Oil Minister's projections. Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said Iraq's goals were only somewhat more ambitious than what his firm was forecasting. "Give or take a year or two, they were more or less in line,' he said.
 [Mr. Stanislaw said he doubted that the extra production would cause an oversupply of oil or a decline in oil prices beyond a momentary dip because demand was rising worldwide. "The Prime Minister of China was just in Germany saying all Chinese families should have a car," he said.]
 Dr. Habubi, a French-trained engineer who wears an olive green military uniform, as do all high officials of the ruling Baathist Party, appeared confident that the oil embargo would be lifted by early 1995 at the latest. The Security Council would act, he contended, because Iraq was fully complying with its demands.
"Yes, I'm very hopeful that it might be earlier than that," he said, sitting beside a big black desk in his office furnished with spotless white leather sofas and armchairs.
 Under Resolution 687 setting out the terms for ending the Persian Gulf war, the Security Council said the oil embargo would have "no further force or effect" once its 15 members were satisfied that Iraq was disarmed of its most dangerous weapons and could build no more weapons of mass destruction.
 A United Nations commission has almost completed the disarmament part of its mission and is now installing a system for monitoring Iraqi industry intended to insure that Iraq does not again try to manufacture nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or build long-range rockets.

HEADLINE: Airwaves Auctions Bring $833 Million For U.S. Treasury

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The Federal Government set out to sell blue sky this week, and it succeeded beyond anybody's wildest expectations.
Concluding an unprecedented experiment to auction off the nation's airwaves, the Federal Communications Commission raised $617 million today from the the sale of 10 licenses for nationwide advanced paging networks. On top of that, it took in $216 million from the sale of some 300 licenses that may be used for interactive television services in the future. 
 The biggest winners today were companies already prominent in wireless communications.
Since the auction began on Monday, Paging Network Inc., the nation's largest paging company, dueled in round after round of bidding with McCaw Cellular Communications, the nation's biggest cellular telephone company. Today each ended up buying two advanced paging licenses for $80 million each -- some 20 times what anyone had expected a license to bring when the bidding began.
A fifth $80 million license went today to a company backed by the Microsoft Corporation and its billionaire founders, William H. Gates and Paul Allen.
These big licenses will be used for nationwide two-way paging networks that will go beyond today's paging systems by letting customers send and receive both spoken and written messages through small wireless devices. The companies expect these networks to be built within five years.
Most of the companies that won paging licenses today plan to offer a new service called "acknowledgment paging," in which a pager automatically responds to a message with a signal indicating that the message got through. But holders of the most valuable licenses also plan more elaborate networks that would allow people to type messages on their computers or hand-held communicators and transmit them anywhere in the country.
Five other nationwide paging licenses, for less powerful networks, were sold for $37 million to $47.5 million each. Paging Network, based in Plano, Tex., also won one of these, giving it 3 of the 10 licenses auctioned.
 
 
'Huge Potential Appetite'
 Today's results vividly demonstrated how precious the nation's airwaves are at time when the wireless communications business is seeing explosive growth.
"This is very valuable spectrum," said John Chapple, executive vice president of McCaw Cellular. "There is a huge potential appetite for two-way paging and messaging services."
But this week's sales prices may seem like pocket change compared with the levels expected in an F.C.C. auction set for later this year. The real money and true frenzy will be unleashed around December, when the Government starts to auction off a much bigger portion of the airwaves for a rich array of new wireless telephone, fax and data services.
Nobody knows what those auctions will yield, but there is no doubt they will involve billions, rather than millions, of dollars. Last year, the Clinton Administration drew snickers from the communications industry when it predicted that this invisible real estate would be worth $10 billion. Now skeptics are not so sure.
"As much as I hate to see so much money being voluntarily handed over to the Government, I think it's plausible that they could raise the $10 billion," said Ira Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research Inc. in Wilmette, Ill., a consulting firm that specializes in wireless communications.
 
 
Dominated by Big Companies
 Despite their value in whittling the Federal budget deficit, the auctions raise questions of whether contests of raw financial muscle are really the best way to manage the radio spectrum -- a precious public resource that has always been viewed as having a social value beyond its economic worth.
Indeed, the main criticism raised during this week's bidding was that small and minority-owned concerns were quickly overwhelmed by large bids from big companies, even though the F.C.C. rules would have given the small bidders a 25 percent discount on any licenses they won.
And even for the winners, the amounts they are spending for licenses raise questions about whether the competing networks will earn enough money to justify the high bids. Time, and the communicating public, will determine that.
By any measure, this new embrace of market forces represents a fundamental break from past practice. Until now, the Government has given radio licenses away. They have done so either by trying to select the company most likely to serve the broad public interest, as is done with broadcasting licenses, or by holding winner-take-all lotteries, which is how most cellular licenses were awarded in the 1980's.
The new policy of using auctions for most nonbroadcasting licenses has been strongly supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Last year, Congress authorized auctions amid a growing consensus that the "public interest" was so amorphous that marketplace mechanisms were better suited to identify the best use of the airwaves.
Auctions are also seen as ending what many critics have described as a billion-dollar give-away in airwave licenses, which allowed lucky speculators to make fortunes while depriving taxpayers of compensation for their largess.
"This is a window on the future," Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said the other day as the bidding escalated. "What you see in this auction is a slugfest. But what it means is no-holds-barred competition for providing wireless services."
The companies are drawn by the popular demand for wireless services. Already, more than 18 million people subscribe to paging services. Another 16 million people own cellular telephones, and despite high prices for the service, the number of cellular customers is rising about 40 percent a year.
Yet, auctions pose enormous financial risks for companies rushing to stake out claims on the wireless frontier.
When the next round starts in December, for licenses for personal communications services -- called PCS networks -- there will be more than 2,000 licenses up for grabs. Some will be for single metropolitan markets, others for large regions.
Companies hoping to put together enough licenses around the country to create a nationwide PCS network will probably have to bid hundreds of millions of dollars. And then they will have to raise billions of dollars to build the systems. And they must do this at precisely the time when the competition among wireless communications is rougher than ever before.
The biggest of the coming PCS licenses will offer enough capacity, or "band width," on the airwaves to start at least three full-fledged competitors to today's cellular telephone networks. PCS is expected to expand on cellular service by adding data communications, and perhaps even limited video capabilities, to conventional voice transmission.
Today, the cellular business is a $10-billion-a-year industry with rich profit margins. At least two of the nation's billionaires -- John Kluge, the head of Metromedia Inc., and Craig O. McCaw, the founder of McCaw Cellular -- made their fortunes by snapping up cellular telephone licenses, whether winning them by lottery or subsequently buying them from the lottery winners.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration estimated several years ago that the combined market value of cellular telephone franchises was somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. Currently, the AT&T Corporation is trying to complete its acquisition of McCaw Cellular for $12.6 billion.
But in the cellular industry, competition has been limited because the F.C.C. a decade ago created only two cellular licenses for each local market. Industry experts warn that many companies may fail to appreciate the enormous competitive challenges ahead for the new rivals.
"This is where auction theory leaves off and company egos kick in," said Janice Obuchowski, president of Freedom Technologies Inc., a telecommunications consulting firm in Washington.
"You have a whole, large tranche of people who may come in here and think this is a reprise of cellular, which it will not be," she said. "These companies are going to have to gut it out through some very tough times."
In the advanced-paging auction that was concluded today, the winner of three licenses, Paging Network of Dallas, already has 3.3 million paging subscribers.
KDM Messaging, which won two of the $80 million licenses today, is owned primarily by McCaw Cellular -- which has extensive paging operations in addition to its cellular holdings.
Nationwide Wireless Network, which won an $80 million license today and one for more limited service for $47.5 million, was formed by Mobile Telecommunications, the big paging company in Jackson, Miss., that is known as Mtel. Microsoft has invested $30 million in the venture, along with its founders, Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen.
Before the auction began, Mtel had already been given an F.C.C. "pioneer's preference" license for one-way advanced paging, because it was an early developer of the technology.
Another winner today was BellSouth Wireless, a subsidiary of the BellSouth Corporation, the regional telephone company, which has extensive cellular and paging properties and owns part of a wireless data service called RAM Mobile Data. It paid just over $47 million for a license to operate a lower-capacity two-way network, as did Airtouch Communications, a wireless company recently spun off from Pacific Telesis, another regional Bell company.
The other company winning a license today was Page Mart II Inc. of Dallas, a paging company with $60 million a year in sales. It has been developing a wireless messaging service for use with personal computers and paid $38 million for a one-way paging license.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar In a Broad Decline But Is Steady Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark and other currencies yesterday after a Government report showing slower-than-expected economic growth convinced many traders that the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise interest rates soon.
But the dollar remained steady against the Japanese yen on speculation that American and Japanese negotiators are making progress in talks aimed at curbing Japan's swollen trade surplus with the United States. 
 The dollar's slump against the mark started after the Commerce Department said United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the second quarter, slightly below what many economists and traders expected.
With the economy growing at a moderate pace, the Federal Reserve will have less incentive to raise rates on overnight bank loans in order to keep inflation under control, traders said. Higher rates would make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
"The numbers show that there is no need to raise rates in the U.S.," said Victor Polce, head of foreign-exchange marketing at Commerzbank A.G. in New York. "Now the Fed may grant a stay of execution until the last quarter of the year."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5840 marks, down from 1.5920 marks on Thursday. But it was unchanged at 100.10 yen.
Speculation that British interest rates are poised to rise next week for the first time since 1989 also helped drive the British pound higher yesterday. It rose to $1.5440 from $1.5274.
Mr. Polce and other traders suspect the dollar's losses against the mark will be temporary because prospects for steady, noninflationary growth helped stocks and bonds to rally strongly yesterday.
Treasury bonds and the dollar have been locked in a tight embrace for much of this year. The slumping bond market meant that foreign investors sold dollars as they bailed out of American assets. In turn, the weak dollar prompted more bond sales as investors sought to stanch losses from currency depreciation. With bonds rising, the dollar's prospects appear brighter.
"The bond rally should keep the dollar in demand," said Jim Raphael, assistant vice president in currency trading at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Troubles in Nigeria Send Oil and Cocoa Up Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Rioting and labor strife in Nigeria drove crude oil and cocoa prices up sharply yesterday on worries the unrest would disrupt exports from the African nation.
Striking Nigerian oil workers demanded that Royal Dutch/Shell's Nigerian subsidiary halt all production in the country. 
 On other commodity markets, cotton futures plunged and precious metals fell. But most grain and livestock futures rose, helping to push up the Commodity Research Bureau's index 1.45 points, to 233.65.
Nigerian tensions have roiled crude oil prices since the country's two oil labor unions went on strike on July 4. The turmoil escalated into chaos yesterday after the police killed a top human rights official and protesters emptied a prison amid rioting in Lagos, the capital and largest city, and surrounding towns.
 
Oil Rises by 53 Cents
 Shell said the strike would probably reduce by one-third its Nigerian crude output of 900,000 to one million barrels a day -- about half the country's production of 1.95 million barrels a day. It did not respond to the strikers' insistence that it shut down operations.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September delivery rose 53 cents, to $20.30 a barrel.
Other energy contracts also surged, with September heating oil gaining 1.78 cents, to 53.25 cents a gallon, and September unleaded gasoline rising 1.55 cents, to 58.71 cents a gallon.
The Nigerian situation also contributed to a sharp rise in cocoa futures on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, where September cocoa beans rose $45, to $1,490 a ton.
Nigeria is the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer but harvesting will not begin there for about two months, said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.
"Only if the current unrest were to persist into the harvest period would it become a serious factor," he said.
Of greater concern, Mr. Stevenson said, is the Brazilian secondary cocoa crop, currently being harvested, which could be the smallest in 20 years.
Elsewhere, October cotton plummeted 1.5 cents, to 71.60 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange after the International Cotton Advisory Committee raised its estimate for 1994-95 world production to 18.77 million metric tons from 18.26 million.
And gold and silver weakened in reaction to a report that the gross domestic product grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, which was slower than traders expected. The news eased inflation anxieties. August gold fell $1.80, to $383 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, while September silver fell 2 cents, to $5.332 an ounce.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
XEROX CORP. (XRX,N)

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation reported yesterday that its second-quarter profits jumped 50 percent, in part because of rising productivity and higher equipment sales.
Xerox, the giant copier maker based in Stamford, Conn., earned $168 million, or $1.31 a share, in the three months that ended on June 30, compared with $112 million, or 96 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenues rose 4 percent, to $3.58 billion from $3.43 billion. 
 The gains were driven in part by an increase of 11 percent in equipment sales. In addition, the results from the comparable period of 1993 reflected a revamping of the company's 3,500-member American sales force and the weak European economy, the chairman of Xerox, Paul A. Allaire, said.
Xerox cut about 1,400 jobs from its core document processing business in the second quarter, part of a revamping announced in December that eliminated 5,600 positions, or 6 percent of the work force, in the first half of the year.
For the first six months of the year, net income fell to $297 million, or $2.36 a share, from $301 million, or $2.73 a share, in the first half of 1993. Six-month revenues rose 3 percent, to $6.86 billion from $6.66 billion.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Bright Skies in Mexico Bode Well for A.D.R.'s

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
IT'S getting sunny in Mexico again, and one way investors can bask in the warmth without heading south is through American depository receipts.
 But they should know that the storm clouds have just parted. In Mexico earlier this year, "everything that could go wrong did go wrong," said Maria-Elena Carrion, a vice president at Bankers Trust. Kidnappings, the Chiapas rebellion, a political assassination and nail-biting over the Aug. 21 presidential election brought the Mexican market, the Bolsa, 20 percent off its all-time high of 2,895, reached Feb. 9.
 
 Lately, everything is going right. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, candidate of the governing party, has emerged as the probable next president; investors like the relative certainty and his pro-growth platform, too. Interest rates may be peaking. And second-quarter earnings were not as bad as expected, said Gene Frieda of NatWest Securities.
 The Bolsa responded with a 7 percent rise last week, to 2,462. And many, at least on Wall Street, predict new highs. "We expect it to go to 3,100" by June, Mr. Frieda said.
 To join in, investors can try international mutual funds, but diversification, currency hedges and fees dampen fund returns. No fund can match the run-up of a single hot stock; Cemex, a Mexican cement company, grew nearly 300 percent from July 1991 to December 1993.
 Because the direct purchase of foreign stocks is impractical, the risk-tolerant investor may seek A.D.R.'s -- foreign stock certificates that trade here like domestic equities. The number of Mexican A.D.R.'s -- nearly 50 companies, big and small, listed and unlisted -- adds to the appeal.
 Which A.D.R.'s carry the most promise? Growth-related ones.
 For Mr. Frieda, that means construction, an industry sorely needed in emerging nations. He favors Bufete Industrial, Mexico's fourth-largest builder. Bufete dominates energy construction and "is diversifying well, building factories in Mexico and hotels in Uruguay," he said.
 Jay Pelosky, director of Latin American research at Morgan Stanley, likes Grupo Tribasa, another big builder. And Ms. Carrion -- noting the nation's shortage of hotels and housing -- likes Cemex, which has 63 percent of the Mexican market and has acquired cement operations in Spain, Venezuela and the United States.
 Growth is good for banks, too, and high interest rates have pushed their prices down to attractive buying levels. Mr. Pelosky likes Grupo Financiero Serfin, which closed yesterday at $17.375 -- 51 percent off its 1994 high.
 No economy can grow without phones, and Telefonos de Mexico, with both listed and unlisted A.D.R.'s, is a favorite despite the looming loss of its monopoly in 1997. "Lots of the potential competitors are in long distance," said William F. Truscott, co-manager of the Scudder Latin America Fund. "Telmex should still do very well in local phone business." Cautious investors use Telmex, which constitutes 26 percent of the Bolsa and often tracks it, as an index play.
 Growth also means rising consumer demand. In soft drinks, for example, "we expect 4 percent growth annually for 14- to 45-year-olds," Mr. Frieda said. His pick is the Pepsi bottler, known as Grupo Embotellador de Mexico, or Gemex. While Coca-Cola Femsa has 56 percent of the market to Gemex's 23 percent, "we like the Pepsi story better," he said. Gemex "just opened a $50 million plant in the Yucatan tourist area, and it refines its own sugar -- one of soft drinks' biggest costs."
 A growing Mexico will need stores, too. "There are 500 square feet of selling area per 1,000 inhabitants of Mexico, compared to 19,000 square feet per 1,000 inhabitants in the U.S.," said Alberto Montagne, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. After accounting for income differences, Mexico would need 3,000 square feet for 1,000 people to be comparable.
 Mr. Montagne has buy recommendations on two companies vying to fill the gap. In a joint venture with Wal-Mart, Grupo Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer, will spend $900 million on new outlets by 1996. And the third largest, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, plans to add 73 sites to its existing 156 stores. Like Cifra, Controladora has an American ally -- the Price Company, owner of Price Club discount centers.
 Advisers have many other A.D.R. picks. Mr. Pelosky likes Grupo Industrial Maseca, a major tortilla maker with listed and unlisted A.D.R.'s. Ms. Carrion favors Desc Sociedad de Fomento Industrial, a conglomerate in auto parts and agribusiness, and Grupo Industrial Durango, a maker of fiberboard and corrugated boxes.
 But Wall Street is not completely sunny about Mexico. Surprise election results or credible claims of vote tampering could darken the market, it says. And advisers warn that their bullishness applies to the long run. For in emerging markets like Mexico, the short-term forecast is always iffy, even if it is sunny today.

HEADLINE: Americans Buying More On Credit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Americans are piling on the debt, with monthly totals for car loans, credit cards and other installment loans growing at a ferocious pace in recent months.
 The increase, in part a result of pent-up consumer demand, casts some doubt on the widely held notion that consumers emerged from the last recession financially savvier and less willing to take on high-cost debt.
 
 "Apparently, everyone is charging away like crazy," said Ruth Susswein, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group based in Salem, Va. "I think it is definitely a cause for concern."
 Not everyone expresses alarm, but the numbers are striking. Consumer installment debt, which includes credit cards and auto loans but excludes home loans, grew more than $10 billion each month in March, April and May, ending the period at $838 billion, according to the Federal Reserve. The heady growth, at an 18.7 percent annualized rate, harks back to the conspicuous consumption heyday of the mid-1980's.
 During the recession, officially dated from July 1990 to March 1991, such debt contracted slightly, producing the first sustained decline since the Depression. As consumers paid down and consolidated debt, financial advisers saw signs that educational efforts were paying off. Consumers appeared less willing to skate on the financial edge, wary of what could happen in tough times.
 The new credit boom appears to be fueled not by distress borrowing from consumers who have exhausted all other options, but primarily by discretionary borrowing. People have grown more comfortable with the idea of shouldering additional debt and in some cases more willing to run up purchases on credit in return for frequent-flier miles and other credit card perks.
 "Consumers feel the economy's doing much better," said Gary R. Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons, a brokerage firm based in St. Louis. "There's been a lot of pent-up demand," he added, noting that American households reaped a bonanza last year from refinancing mortgages that gave them cash for down payments on big-ticket items like cars and appliances.
 Likewise, Thomas A. Layman, research vice president for Visa USA, sees no credit binge, merely the usual rebound that occurs when business expansions take hold. Visa card charges in this country leaped 22 percent, to $240 billion, in the 12 months ended in March, he said.
 But it doesn't come as any surprise to Louise Shaler that Americans are taking on prodigious amounts of debt. "My salary is no longer keeping pace with the cost of living," lamented Ms. Shaler, a baby boomer who designs continuing education courses at Pennsylvania State University. "And when you have a cash flow problem, the credit card is the only option."
 Ms. Shaler carries several thousand dollars in debt on five Visa and other credit cards, which she periodically replaces with similar ones promoting lower interest rates. Among people who maintain a balance on their bank cards, the average amount is $1,700, up from about $400 10 years ago, said Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research in Frederick, Md.
 Credit cards are the largest portion of the mounting debt burden, and generally the highest-cost debt. At the end of May, the latest period for which Federal Reserve figures are available, revolving credit on bank cards and store accounts represented 37 percent of installment debt and automobile loans 36 percent, with the rest split among education, mobile home, vacation, boat and other loans scheduled for two or more payments.
 Many bankers are disinclined to fret about the mounting debt, suggesting that consumers have become not only more proficient managers of their finances, but also good judges of prospects for jobs and incomes.
 Richard Aspinwall, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan, attributed the credit surge to job growth, the benefits of mortgage refinancing and improved confidence. "The distress argument lacks underpinning," he said, implying that people like Ms. Shaler, though vociferous in bemoaning hard times, are in the minority.
 Among the positive indicators, installment debt as a proportion of disposable personal income peaked at about 18.5 percent in mid-1989, eased to less than 16 percent in late 1992 and remains under 17 percent. Moreover, lenders report that charge-offs of debt that cannot be collected and late payments by consumers have fallen significantly this year.
 And more people are watching their credit card balances. Mr. McKinley of RAM Research said 32 percent of bank card holders paid their bills in full each month, up from 29 percent two years ago. He suggests the trend will continue through the 1990's, although the portion will probably remain far shy of the 55 percent recorded 10 years ago when annual interest charges exceeded 20 percent.
 Interest rates, however, are ticking up for card holders. About 70 percent of bank cards now have variable interest rates, with adjustments generally made quarterly. That means July statements also herald significant rate increases for many card holders. The average interest rate on a bank card is now 17.66 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor of North Palm Beach, Fla.
 Ultimately, the shift toward higher interest rates could curb credit card purchases, but Ms. Susswein of the bank card holders group does not expect consumers to modify their behavior unless rates truly soar. "The danger with credit card debt is the increases are incremental," Ms. Susswein said. "You don't feel the pain until the damage is done."
 She and many others find it unsettling that so many American families live right up to and beyond their means, only a job loss or illness away from financial disaster. "A dangerously consumerist attitude is still part of our culture," said David F. Seiders, economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "I can see it in my own kids. Nobody seems to have any concept about saving."
 As financial advisers routinely point out, the best return on an investment is often paying off credit card and other high-rate debt. On a bank card at the current average rate, paying the bill in full results in an effective annual return of 17.66 percent. Not many investments have come close in the choppy financial waters of this year.
 Another strategy popular with rate-sensitive consumers like Ms. Shaler is to churn cards, shifting balances to cards that have low initial rates for six months or a year. Mr. McKinley noted that inquiries to RAM Research and its Card Track unit have risen recently as consumers search for lower-rate cards.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Rates and Bond Funds
 
Q. How will a change in interest rates affect the dividend amount of my municipal bond fund?
ROBERT KANDEL, Little Ferry, N.J.
 
A. There is no immediate relationship between interest rate changes and the dividend paid by a municipal bond fund. That's because such a fund is composed of individual bonds that have their own fixed interest rate. The total of these individual interest payments is the dividend paid by the fund, which is generally stable even during shifting markets. Of course, when interest rates rise, the net asset value of the fund falls.
 
 "A municipal bond fund's dividend will change as the composition and the fixed interest rates of the portfolio change over time," said Tom Spalding, a portfolio manager at John Nuveen & Company. "As a result, turnover in bond portfolios will tend to lead to dividends that reflect broad market trends, though dividend changes lag market changes."
 
Zeroes and I.R.A.'s
 
Q. In an individual retirement account of only Treasury strips maturing 1997 through 2001, how do I determine the total money in the account in December 1996? Can the accrued interest of the strips be figured at that time and is it essential to know?
ARTHUR MESIBOV, Brooklyn
 
A. United States Treasury strips are zero coupon bonds, whereby interest is not paid periodically, but accrued until maturity. Most brokerage firms give the current market value of these strips in their monthly statements, and some newspapers also publish their value.
 "It is not necessary to know the amount of interest separate and apart from the total value of the strip, since the I.R.A. is not taxed on any gains," said Edward Mendlowitz, a partner in the accounting firm of Mendlowitz Weitsen in New York and East Brunswick, N.J. "The participant is taxed based on the full value of the distribution at the time of the payment from the I.R.A."
 
Financial Planners
 
Q. Are all financial planners accredited by a single governing body?
J.T. PHILLIPS, Manhattan
 
A. Financial planners are not regulated by either the Federal or state governments, meaning anyone can use the title of financial planner. Many of them are registered investment advisers with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but because of infrequent inspections, there is little supervision of their activities.
 Some colleges offer degrees in financial planning. And a number of professional organizations grant designations to those who have met specified educational and experience requirements.
 The five leading financial planning organizations, the designation used by their members and their toll-free numbers for information are: the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, personal financial specialist, (800) 862-4272; the American Society of CLU and ChFC, chartered financial consultant, (800) 392-6900; the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, certified financial planner, (800) 282-7526; the International Association for Financial Planning, (800) 945-4237; and the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, (800) 366-2732.

The Labor Negotiations: Ball's in Whose Court?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
On the day major league baseball players set Aug. 12 as their strike date, Richard Ravitch put the ball in Donald Fehr's court. But yesterday, Fehr deflated the ball. A salary cap by any other name, he said, is still a salary cap.
Fehr, the players' labor leader, was responding to Ravitch's repeated request to the players that they respond to the owners' desire to know "what it will cost us to play baseball." 
 A salary cap is the owners' way of making that determination, but Ravitch, their chief labor spokesman, has said he would listen to any idea the players might have, and after the players set their strike date on Thursday, he said, "I consider the ball to be in Don's court."
Asked yesterday if the players would respond in the manner Ravitch has requested, Fehr said: "It's like saying, 'We don't need a salary cap, but if you can come up with an absolute restriction on salaries by any other name, we'll talk about it.' So this business of the ball being in our court gets ridiculous."
 
Meetings Next Week
 The two sides tentatively plan to resume their negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement next Tuesday, then meet again Wednesday and Thursday.
With the owners and the players on opposite sides philosophically and economically, what might they talk about at the next bargaining session?
"Hopefully, people will continue to work and re-examine what's there, keep trying to search for avenues," Fehr said. "Sometimes you go through what you said before. You keep plowing on. We'll probably discuss why owners are still reluctant to come to meetings because Dick says he has no objections."
The absence of owners from negotiating meetings has angered players, a group of whom always attends sessions, depending on when and where they're held.
"We keep raising it," Fehr said. "Players are absolutely mystified and teed off. They want to know why people won't talk to them and treat them as equals at the bargaining table. That's meaningful in terms of demonstrating the kind of good faith players want to see. One conclusion players draw from their refusal to attend is they don't care enough to show up."
 
Players in Attendance
 A contingent of players from the Boston Red Sox attended Wednesday's meeting, and Mike Greenwell was especially interested in the owners' absence, pressing Ravitch for an answer.
"When are the owners going to come?" Greenwell asked repeatedly.
Finally, Fehr said that Ravitch replied: "It's not me. I have no personal objection to their coming." But the owners obviously have made the decision to leave the negotiating to their negotiator.
"In multi-employer negotiations," Ravitch said yesterday, "people pick a negotiator. The board of directors of General Electric does not participate in negotiations. They designate someone to negotiate for them. That's what the owners have done here."
 
Owners Have Been There Before
 Owners have attended bargaining sessions in previous negotiations. In 1990, for example, Fred Wilpon of the Mets, John McMullen of Houston, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Carl Pohlad of Minnesota sat at the table at various times.
If the owners came to the table, Fehr said: "There would be a much more real dialogue. We don't have any decision makers there or anyone involved in operations. Let's say a club has lost money and is one for whom relief is being sought. Maybe we could discuss what has occasioned that. Does it have to do with league structure? What are the facts of relocation? You could have a lot of discussions you otherwise couldn't have."
 
Fehr Has the Access
 Ravitch said Fehr does not need owners to come to the table to talk to them.
"Don tries to communicate with owners all the time and he succeeds," Ravitch said. "It's not like he doesn't have access to them. He meets with them. I know of quite a few owners he has met with over the last year. Some have called and asked me if there's anything wrong with meeting with him and I say no."
Players, though, have not attended those meetings.

Redefining The Yankees' Community

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
THE walk to Yankee Stadium took about 10 minutes: Down the 155th Street viaduct, over the blue Macombs Dam Bridge, over the Major Deegan Expressway, down and around the street leading to the employees' parking lot.
 This was yesterday morning and I was on the way to an impromptu meeting with Brian Smith, the Yankees' new director of community relations.
 
 Twelve days ago, it's doubtful that many people in the Bronx knew that the Yankees even had a community relations department. Then Richard Kraft, the department's former director, was quoted as speaking of "monkeys" hanging on basketball rims in the park adjacent to Yankee Stadium, and of "colored boys" losing their roots.
 Kraft resigned under pressure last Saturday -- although he denied making those statements -- and the job was rightfully given to Smith, his energetic assistant.
 I put in a call to the Yankees on Thursday hoping to set up an interview with Smith, who turned 25 on June 19. I wanted to find out what plans he had for reaching out, connecting with the community. But the team's media relations director said that the new community relations director would not be communicating at this time.
 They're protecting him. The man explained, "We don't want to throw him into the fire."
 Sorry. He's already in the fire.
 I arrived at the Stadium around 8 o'clock and sat in the outside bleachers, in back of the handball court next to the employees' entrance.
 What troubled me, more than anything Kraft said, was the reaction from various circles to Smith's being named to replace him. There were a number of comments to the effect that it was an "affirmative action" move, intended to appease black and Hispanic fans. A Steinbrenner ploy to blunt deep-rooted, long-standing anger directed at the Yankees for demonizing the community in order to extort favors from the city.
 Certainly the fact that Smith is African American wasn't lost on Steinbrenner, but neither were his credentials for the job.
 Smith was raised in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and played football at Mount Vernon High School. He earned a scholarship to the University of Tulsa where he played linebacker for four years and as a senior was a member of the 1991 team that defeated San Diego State in the Freedom Bowl.
 Smith earned his undergraduate degree in four years and received his master's in sports management in 1992. When he returned to New York, Smith taught math and economics in a development program in the Bronx. Last April he took a gamble: he quit the teaching job and accepted an internship with the Yankees. In two months, the Yankees hired him full time for their marketing and public relations department. Last October, they promoted him to assistant community relations director. On Saturday he replaced Kraft.
 Dave Rader, Tulsa's head football coach, isn't surprised by Smith's accomplishments. "He will get the job done," Rader said. "As a coach, Brian's the type of guy you want to point to. The focus is always on the kids who drop out, flunk out or don't make it. A kid like Brian is the essence of college football. He leaves Mount Vernon, comes to private school in Tulsa, Okla., doesn't really play a whole lot, gets his undergraduate degree in four years, stayed and got his graduate degree. Went home, beat the bushes, found a job, making the most of it.
 "All I can tell people who don't know him is to stand back and watch him go," Rader said. "We need to hear more about the Brian Smiths."
 We will. But not now.
 Smith arrived at the stadium at 9:15. Neat, clean-cut. Surprised. He didn't expect his day to begin with me. He politely declined my request for a formal interview. "I just want to get started, get organized, get things going," he said. Maybe down the road, when things get settled, we would talk.
 Smith looked at his watch and said, "I don't mean to brief with you, but I have to go." He disappeared into the employees' entrance.
 Brian Smith doesn't have an easy task. He must convince a community that someone at Yankee Stadium truly cares at a time when many are convinced that no one does.
 Smith has the personality and energy to pull it off. Whether he'll have the support and sincere backing of Steinbrenner -- beyond this highly publicized juncture -- is a different matter.
 By promoting Smith, the Yankees took a step toward making their community relations department more than a whistle stop on the ol' boys network. The next step is letting him answer his own phone.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
Conference Officials Weighing Bowl Bids

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
As conference commissioners began weighing bids yesterday that could bring college football more than $50 million a year from just three bowl games, four Florida State football players were suspended for taking part in an agent-financed shopping spree last year.
The two developments pointed up the economic anomalies of college football, a multibillion-dollar business built upon players barred from receiving more than their scholarships. 
 There seemed to be no limits in Dallas, where nine bowls backed by corporate sponsors and television networks submitted big-money bids for designation as one of the three bowl games the College Football Bowl Alliance hopes will dominate post-season play.
The alliance, organized by eight major conferences plus Notre Dame, plans to anoint three premier bowls, which will virtually be guaranteed annual games involving the six top teams in the nation.
 
A Jan. 2 Championship
 But the Big Ten and Pacific-10 champions will continue to meet in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day under a contract running through the 2000 season.
Under the alliance plan, which is to take effect for the 1995 season, the three designated bowls will rotate holding a putative national championship game on Jan. 2 each year. After the Jan. 2 bowl makes the first two selections, the Jan. 1 bowl would have the third and fifth picks and the Dec. 31 bowl the fourth and sixth.
A day after the nine bowls made their presentations, Gene Corrigan, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner who serves as the alliance chairman, said yesterday that the commissioners would consult with member schools before coming to a decision, perhaps late next week.
As the Dallas participants were making their multimillion-dollar moves, Talbot D'Alemberte, the president of Florida State, announced that Derrick Brooks, an all-America linebacker, and tailback Tiger McMillon had been suspended for the first two games of the season for their part in a sporting goods shopping spree financed by sports agents last year. Offensive guard Patrick McNeil was suspended for three games and offensive tackle Forrest Conoly was suspended indefinitely.
 
Violating the Rules
 "These players knew that they violated the rules and they must suffer the consequences of their actions," D'Alemberte said.
But D'Alemberte also suggested that the rules might be excessive. On Thursday he told a House committee that college players should be allowed to receive more than their scholarships, a proposal that offended some high-paid coaches.
"Players are well-paid now, when you consider the value of a college education," said Bill Curry, the Kentucky football coach.
Indeed, like National Football League players, big-time college players are paid to play football, but unlike their N.F.L. counterparts, most of whom earn more than their coaches, even the best college players are limited to scholarships valued at between $10,000 to $25,000 a year.
"There's a lot of money being made off us," said Jack Jackson, a Florida receiver. "There's a lot of people being paid megadollars to run this sport. But they don't see fit for the players to be compensated."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: COMPARE AND CONTRAST;
A Closer Look at the Two Plans

BYLINE: By MONICA BORKOWSKI 

 BODY:

THE CLINTON PLAN
 
Coverage: Universal coverage by 1998. 

Benefits: Basic package includes comprehensive benefits including some coverage for mental health and drug and alcohol abuse; prescription drugs; rehabilitation services; hospice, home health and extended nursing care services, and abortion services.
 
Providers: Most Americans would be required to obtain coverage through regional insurance purchasing alliances. All companies with 5,000 or fewer employees must do so. Medicare is retained as a separate program for people 65 and over.
 
Financing: Employers would pay about 80 percent of the costs of the average health insurance plan in their areas for a single person and about 55 percent of the cost of the average family plan, but no more than 7.9 percent of their payrolls. Individuals would pay up to 20 percent of the premiums. Other financing could come from a 1 percent payroll tax on companies with 5,000 or more workers and an increase in the Federal tobacco tax from 24 cents-a-pack to 99 cents.

Subsidies: Companies with 75 or fewer employees and average annual wages of less than $24,000 would be eligible for subsidies that limit employers' costs to 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of the payroll. Employees earning less than 150 percent of the Federal poverty level would also be eligible for subsidies. Non-workers with incomes up to 250 percent of poverty are eligible for subsidies.
 
Cost Contaiment: A national health board would establish national and regional spending limits and would limit increases in insurance premiums.
 
Health Insurance Reforms: Health plans could not deny coverage or renewal to any eligible group or individual, even people with pre-existing conditions. Premiums would be uniform for everyone in an alliance.
 
HOUSE LEADERSHIP BILL
 
Coverage: Universal coverage by 1999.
 
Benefits: The proposal calls for nationally guaranteed, comprehensive coverage including prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse services, preventive care and a new long-term care program to provide home and community based services to people with severe disabilities. House leaders say they are seeking a compromise on abortion.
 
Providers All employers would be required to offer at least one health plan offering unlimited choice of providers and one managed care plan. Individuals employed in small firms (fewer than 100 employees) that offer private coverage could buy insurance through the program that covers Federal employees. Some small employers could choose to enroll their employees in the new Medicare Part C program, which would also offer coverage for the unemployed, for low-income families, and for part-time and seasonal workers.

Financing: Employers would generally pay 80 percent of the premiums, and employees 20 percent. Large companies would have to start paying their share by 1997. For companies with fewer than 100 employees, the requirement would take effect in 1999. Other financing would come from gradually increasing the Federal tobacco tax, now 24 cents a pack, to 69 cents a pack, by imposing a 2 percent tax on health insurance premiums and the expenses of self-insured plans andfrom slowing the rate of growth in Medicare.

Subsidies: Federal subsidies would be provided to low-wage businesses with 50 or fewer employees and to people with incomes up to 2.4 times the Federal poverty level (up to $38,400 a year for a family of four).

Cost Containment: If greater competition in the health care market fails to control costs in five years, a system of cost containment would go into effect, with the Government imposing fee schedules for doctors and hospitals in states where health spending exceeds Federal targets.

Health Insurance Reforms: Health plans could not deny coverage or renewal to any eligible group or individuals, even people with pre-existing conditions. Plans sold to groups of 100 or fewer would have to base rates on average costs for all people covered in a particular area.

HEADLINE: The Failed House Health Bill

 BODY:
The health-care bill that the Democratic leadership will take to the full House for debate early next month would do more harm than good. Though it starts off correctly -- achieving universal coverage by requiring employers to pay for most of the cost of insuring their workers -- it proposes insurance "reforms" that would bury the most innovative, cost-effective plans that many Americans routinely choose today.
The bill would be a victory for highly paid physicians and would reward those in Congress who want to control the huge health-care industry. But it would be a defeat for patients who expect high-quality care at a reasonable price. 
 The leadership bill, announced yesterday, would create Medicare C, a public, fee-for-service plan, to enroll the poor and otherwise uninsured. That might sound like a sensible way to provide fail-safe insurance to relatively few families because it would build upon Medicare, the existing plan for the elderly. But Medicare C, unlike the program limited to the elderly, threatens to trigger an inevitable roll toward government-run medicine for most Americans.
The Government cannot supervise treatment provided under Medicare. The only way it can control costs is to clamp down on prices it pays providers. Medicare pays doctors and hospitals less than their costs; that forces providers to make up the loss by jacking up prices to private patients. This "cost shift" is already widespread. But the leadership bill would add to Medicare the poor, who are now covered by Medicaid, as well as the unemployed and other uninsured people; that would bring 50 percent of the population under Medicare, according to Congressional staff estimates. The cost shift to the remaining patients would become devastating. Fees to private patients would skyrocket, driving premiums up and private insurers out of business through no fault of their own.
Other detrimental features of the leadership bill are provisions that render illegal the approach used by most existing managed-care plans -- which charge enrollees a fixed annual fee regardless of medical need in exchange for limiting care to a fixed panel of doctors and hospitals. The leadership bill would, for example, require most plans to hire any qualified doctors who apply -- thereby eliminating the plans' ability to control the quality and cost of treatment by closely supervising a small panel of doctors. Most managed-care plans would have to hire specialists, like chiropractors, that they believe are unnecessary.
But the special interests were too powerful for the leadership to resist. The effect of the bill's anti-managed-care provisions is to lock in fee-for-service medicine that lies at the core of the existing system's penchant for wasteful and often inappropriate care.
The leadership did not have the gall to forthrightly propose a government takeover. But it has proposed a bill that would achieve the same end through stealth. When it comes to the floor, the bill's provision for universal coverage through an employer mandate is worth fighting for. Much of the rest deserves to be scrapped.

HEADLINE: Heal the 'Bad Paper' Veterans

BYLINE: By Maxine Waters and Jonathan Shay; Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, is to sponsor a bill in the House to upgrade discharges for combat veterans. Jonathan Shay, a psychiatrist, is author of "Achilles in Vietnam."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
American involvement in Vietnam ended two decades ago, and the wounds suffered during the conflict are finally healing. The nation has built memorials to our men and women who fought and died in the war. American companies are establishing business relationships in Hanoi. Hollywood continues to reinterpret how the war touched our national psyche. There is, however, unfinished business.
More than 560,000 Vietnam-era veterans received less-than-honorable discharges for such offenses as being absent without leave, using or selling drugs or assaulting their superiors. A great number were in combat. Because of their "bad paper," these veterans are not eligible for health and other benefits available to veterans with honorable discharges. 
 Many bad-paper veterans are among the 250,000 ex-combat soldiers who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. They have a higher incidence of unemployment, violent behavior, alcohol and drug abuse, family problems and homelessness than other veterans. Yet we won't give them the treatment that could help them heal. They served their country and deserve treatment for their war wounds, physical and mental.
Most soldiers discharged less than honorably committed their offenses after their combat duty; many did so because of psychological injuries suffered in battle.
Some were also victims of racism: the rod of military justice did not fall with equal force on all offenders in Vietnam. A Defense Department task force reported in 1972 that African-Americans received much harsher punishments than white offenders who committed offenses of comparable seriousness. A 1971 N.A.A.C.P. study found that 45 percent of all less-than-honorable discharges went to black soldiers.
Whatever the circumstances surrounding combat veterans' bad-paper discharges, it is self-defeating to deny them benefits. We don't save money by shutting them out; it costs taxpayers much more in unemployment compensation and support for prisons, homeless shelters, substance abuse treatment and emergency health care programs.
These ex-soldiers fill prisons and homeless shelters in disproportionate numbers around the country. The New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans, a 225-bed treatment center in Boston, is typical: 25 percent of the those who use it are bad-paper combat veterans.
Under the current system, veterans can upgrade their discharges only after a complicated, expensive case-by-case process during which the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Military Review Board re-evaluate infractions that occurred more than 20 years ago. It can take years to reach a result. But a prompt upgrade can mean the difference between addiction and employment, a life marked by despair and a future with hope.
Legislation is being prepared in consultation with veterans' groups that will establish a procedure for combat veterans to automatically upgrade their bad-paper discharges. When it is introduced in the House next month, it will be a major step toward insuring that those who risked their lives in battle are not abandoned to the streets, prisons and margins of our society.

LONDON FOG CLOSING U.S. PLANTS OVER UNION DISPUTE

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
London Fog Industries said yesterday that it would close its last three United States manufacturing plants by the end of October, putting 700 people out of work, after failing to settle a dispute with its main union. The maker of raincoats and other outerwear said it cost $18 more to produce a garment in its domestic plants than overseas. Officials of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers could not immediately be reached for comment. Workers at the Baltimore, Hancock and Williamsport, Md., plants were notified of the closings yesterday morning. London Fog, best known for its trench coats, was founded in Baltimore in 1922.

HEADLINE: Where News Is an Obsession;
In the Hamptons, Competition for Readers Is No Summer Picnic

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I., July 27

 BODY:
Word of the break-in at Peggy Siegal's weekend home spread fast. Within days, The East Hampton Star, a local weekly newspaper, had broken the story. A few days later, a reporter for a rival Hamptons weekly tipped off a columnist for a major metropolitan daily, who wrote it up as yet another scintillating tidbit from summer central on Long Island's East End.
Ms. Siegal, a movie publicist based in Manhattan, was bewildered, not so much by the lifting of property from her house in Wainscott, but by the news media's interest in it. "It was just my CD player and answering machine," she said. "This is big news?" 
 If the break-in had occurred anywhere else, it probably would have been dismissed with an editor's yawn. But this was not anywhere else. This was the Hamptons, a place where normal news conditions do not exist.
Per capita, the East End may be the most heavily covered vacation spot on earth, a resort area so obsessed with itself that it is chronicled by more than a dozen newspapers and magazines, all vying for the attention of well-heeled readers and retailers who fill the chichi shopping districts and the seaside mansions hidden behind hedgerows.
 
Ad Dollars and Influence
 The Hamptons have become such an attractive and competitive news battlefield that some of the most prominent figures in New York City publishing have joined the fray, attracted by the opportunity for advertising dollars and influence. Arthur L. Carter, owner of The Nation and The New York Observer, acquired 33 percent of the venerable East Hampton Star in 1991. Three years earlier, Jerry Finkelstein, the retired publisher of The New York Law Journal, bought Dan's Papers, a freebie filled with gossip and celebrity profiles.
And this month, Jerry Della Femina, the Manhattan advertising mogul who owns a restaurant and food store in East Hampton, announced plans to buy 20 percent of The East Hampton Independent, a weekly that was founded last September and that has turned tony East Hampton, population 14,000, into one of the country's smallest two-newspaper towns.
"We have more newspapers than New York City," Mr. Della Femina said of the East End, where he also happens to be a columnist for The Independent. "It's kind of fun to write in a town full of writers."
The presence of hordes of influential people in the news media and the arts -- the list of those with homes in the Hamptons runs the gamut from A (Arledge, Roone, president of ABC News) to Z (Zuckerman, Mortimer B., owner of The Daily News) -- may help explain why the Hamptons are in the grips of what can only be described as a case of newslock. Media people tend to be news junkies.
Ms. Siegal, for instance, said that one of the first things she does when she gets off the seaplane that takes her to the Hamptons each week is pick up four or five local weeklies -- among them The East Hampton Star, The Southampton Press, Dan's Papers, Hamptons magazine and The Sag Harbor Express -- for her weekend reading.
Tim McDarrah, a former reporter for the Page Six gossip column of The New York Post who is now associate publisher of Dan's Papers, said the other day that he finds he is still in the middle of the action. "Some people thought that when I left Page Six I would be moving out of the loop. But I didn't. The loop is here."
Throughout the Hamptons, reading is fundamental. In Sag Harbor, where the local literati include the authors E. L. Doctorow and Wilfred Sheed, The Sag Harbor Express boasts a circulation of 2,500 -- in a village of 2,100 people.
"You've got some pretty aggressive media out here," said Bryan Boyhan, editor of The Express, which was engaged in a fierce weekly newspaper war with the short-lived Sag Harbor Herald until The Herald's demise in 1992, a battle that proved that even in the Hamptons, there is only so much news that people can digest.
 
Serious and Silly Reading
 But failure remains rare here in the world of resort journalism. In fact, despite an economic downturn in the late 1980's and early 1990's, old ventures thrive and new ones emerge all the time. Dan's Papers, a 34-year-old Hamptons institution, has gone from an average of 48 pages an issue in 1988 to 150 today, according to Dan Rattiner, its founder and publisher. There are two new radio stations and plans for a commercial cable television station. And newsstands are packed with an assortment of serious and silly papers that run everything from analyses of zoning disputes to photographs of vacationing news anchors in khakis and Topsiders.
It isn't just the local media barons who are gladdened by the richness of the Hamptons marketplace. Those who give the benefits and balls and openings and screenings, which are as ubiquitous here in warm weather as Range Rovers and Jaguars, are thrilled by the bonanza. Elaine Benson, owner of the Bridgehampton art gallery that bears her name and a well-known local party-giver, said the press corps is so large that invitations to cover her benefits are frequently accepted.
"We can have as much press as you would get at a New York City big thing," Ms. Benson said.
Of course, this being the Hamptons, where the major local diversions appear to be sunbathing, party-going and writing articles, Ms. Benson, a former reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer, contributes a weekly column to Dan's Papers.
 
Covering Local Issues
 While Dan's Papers and Hamptons, a weekly magazine aimed at the younger crowd, focus on the Hamptons scene, most Hampton papers, like The Hampton Chronicle-News, The Long Island Traveler-Watchman and The Shelter Island Reporter, do not specialize in covering the summer crowd. Like community weeklies everywhere, they devote much of their space to articles about school board meetings and highway-widening projects, issues of concern to the 100,000 permanent residents of the five towns on the north and south forks of Long Island that constitute the East End.
"You have such an interesting mix," said Mr. Boyhan, the editor of The Express. "You have this urban chic New York influence, and then you have this rural local community."
On balance, however, a story about the valedictorian at Pierson High School in Sag Harbor will always be more important to his paper than who shows up at which party.
"Our readership may include literary celebrities, but that's a small percentage," he said. "You're not writing for them."
 
Summer Is Serious Business
 Still, in such a competitive environment, even the most conscientiously civic-minded of periodicals has to take notice when Paul Simon, the singer, is fielding grounders at a famous-writers softball game, or Kathleen Turner, the actress, is posing for stills at a Hadassah fashion show. Summer is bread and butter to every paper here, and not just because advertising revenue has to be strong enough now to get them through the leaner winters. It is the time of year when the world is watching -- and reading.
Helen S. Rattray, editor of The East Hampton Star, an elegantly written 109-year-old weekly, wonders just how star-studded to make The Star to keep up with the competition. While some East End journalists say that The Star already caters to summer people -- with a circulation of about 16,000, it is, like Dan's Papers, available in Manhattan's more prosperous neighborhoods -- Mrs. Rattray says that she is loath to do anything that would make her paper a People magazine-by-the-sea.
"We don't have a gossip column," she said, adding that only in the last three years has the paper even begun running photographs taken at benefits and charity balls.
 
Policy Decisions
 But now Mrs. Rattray worries about the slippery slope: does she have to yield to the example of Dan's and other papers and devote space to photos of the rich and famous at the more exclusive private parties? "What I've learned is that people love to see their name in print, no matter who they are," she said with a sigh.
The Independent, Mrs. Rattray's newest competition, is trying to position itself as a paper of community news, stories of interest chiefly to year-round residents. But the paper, whose editor is Thomas Clavin, who has contributed freelance articles to the Long Island Weekly section of The New York Times, is struggling with how aggressively to cover the summer scene.
A few weeks ago, Bridget LeRoy, The Independent's culture editor and the daughter of Warner LeRoy, owner of Tavern on the Green, was sent with a camera to cover the opening of an art exhibition, where she spotted Billy Joel, the singer. Nervous about disturbing Mr. Joel -- "I was raised in show biz, and all my life I've heard how much these stars value their privacy," she said -- Ms. LeRoy decided to conquer her fear. She approached and quickly snapped a single frame.
"The picture didn't come out," Ms. LeRoy said ruefully. But no matter. A photographer from a competing Hamptons paper made the shot.

HEADLINE: WHY I SPIED;
Aldrich Ames

BYLINE: By Tim Weiner; Tim Weiner is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
RICK AMES, A LIFELONG employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, betrayed at least 12 of the best secret agents working for the United States from within the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc during the 1980's. All were jailed and most were executed. "They died because this warped, murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar," says the Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey.
From 1975 to 1985, the C.I.A. promoted Aldrich Hazen Ames, an alcoholic underachiever going through a financially ruinous divorce from a fellow spy, to increasingly sensitive posts, unaware that he was thinking all the decade about selling the agency's deepest secrets to Moscow. For the next decade, it remained unaware that he was hand-delivering reams of top secret papers to the Soviets and talking his vodka-soaked heart out with his Communist case officers in annual all-nighters. 
 Now Ames has to face the brutal consequences.
In 1962, Ames joined the C.I.A., where his father worked as an analyst. After three years undercover in Turkey, he married a C.I.A. colleague and they spent the 70's in Washington and in New York, where he hobnobbed with Soviets assigned to the United Nations and began to think about a double life. The marriage fell apart. He went alone to Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met Maria del Rosario Casas, a Colombian cultural attache working for the C.I.A., the woman who would become his second wife and who would be charged as his accomplice. Deemed mediocre by his superiors, he was nonetheless elevated to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division. His job was recruiting and running foreign agents.
In 1985, Rick Ames recruited himself. He sold a Soviet Embassy official the names of two K.G.B. officers secretly working for the F.B.I. in Washington. The price: $50,000. The next month, he volunteered the names of every Soviet intelligence official and military officer he knew was working for the United States, along with whatever else he knew about C.I.A. operations against Moscow. In September of that year, shortly after he and Rosario married, he received a wedding present from the K.G.B.: $2 million. He claims he was shocked; the money was far more than any other American spy is known to have received from the Soviets. But then the Soviets never had a spy like Rick Ames.
He continued spying for nearly nine years, first in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989, and then from inside the agency's headquarters in Langley, Va. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe against the Soviets and their satellites, ran spies in Czechoslovakia and worked in the C.I.A.'s Counternarcotics Center, flying to meet his Russian handlers in Bogota and organizing efforts against the heroin trade in Moscow -- all the while waltzing out of his offices with classified papers to sell.
The arrest of Rick and Rosario Ames this February played first as tragedy, then as farce.
The C.I.A. had known since early 1986 that there was a traitor within. Meanwhile, Ames was flunking lie detector tests, plunking down a half-million dollars in cash for a new house and idling in a new Jaguar at the agency's gatehouse. Woolsey concedes that "appropriate resources were not dedicated promptly in the Ames case." After the arrest, newspaper cartoonists skewered the agency mercilessly, depicting a mole in a trench coat working unnoticed and unworried in a secret warren. The C.I.A. has been admired, feared and criticized during its 47 years. Now it is being ridiculed by Congress and the public, and that is a dangerous thing. Woolsey says he must "change the culture of the C.I.A" so that it will not be "a fraternity . . . wherein once you are initiated, you're considered a trusted member for life."
Rick Ames now spends three days a week being grilled by F.B.I. and C.I.A. officers. He says the sessions are going fine; his interrogators are not sure he is telling them the whole truth. Hanging in the balance is the fate of Rosario Ames, who is to be sentenced Aug. 26. Her husband's cooperation may help her to get out of prison in a few years and be reunited with their 5-year-old son, Paul. But the spycatchers who spend their days in the labyrinth of Rick Ames's double life are nowhere near the end of their journey.
We began more than eight hours of one-on-one interviews on July 7 at the Alexandria, Va., city jail, Ames's temporary residence before he is transported to a maximum-security Federal prison for the rest of his life. Since the 53-year-old Ames was arrested, his hair and skin have grayed perceptibly. On the surface, he is smooth, beguiling, sometimes charming. He fumbles for words only when he considers the nature of his treason and then that calm exterior cracks. His interior? There is an emptiness where pain or rage or shame should be. Maybe that is the cost of a secret life. Maybe it was the alcohol; he was drunk for a good part of his three decades with the C.I.A. Maybe it is the fact that, in exchange for a fortune, he sold out a dozen men and condemned them to death or prison. He deals with this by saying he has sentenced himself to a living death too: "The men I sold. . . . What happened to them also happened to me."

Q: When you first signed up with the C.I.A. in 1962, what was it like?
A: I felt proud and selected. They made a great effort, as do some units in the military, the Foreign Service, to cultivate a sense of being in the elite. Kids respond to that. Young men and women respond to that. And certainly I did. The ethics of espionage, of telling lies, cover stories, this didn't bother too many people. It didn't bother me. People saw it as part of the struggle. . . . There was a sense of fun.

Q: When did it stop being fun?
A: I don't know that it ever stopped being fun, O.K.? I always thought it was fun. I don't think everyone else did, but I -- yes. It was always fun. Turkey was wonderful. New York was probably the most fun I had. Mexico City was fun. And the job I had in '83 to '85 was the most fun headquarters job I had. It was really interesting. I mean, there were other things going on. My feeling that we had never done right by Soviet operations, never spent enough money, put enough people on it, took enough risks. But then that came together with a feeling of "well, wait a minute. Even if we did, would it be worthwhile?"

Q: When did you make the decision to work for the other side?
A: Some of that started in the 70's in New York.

Q: Why?
A: You know, I knew some Soviets in New York who were very interesting. The chief Pravda representative in New York and I had lunch together every couple of weeks for about three years. And he didn't directly teach me a lot, but indirectly I learned an awful lot . . . in terms of what the Soviets were all about. What happened later, frankly, is I got myself in the position where I thought, and still think -- call it arrogance, if you will -- but I'd say: "I know what's better. I know what's damaging and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security. . . . And I'm going to act on that."

Q: What were your motives?
A: Money -- money was the -- money was the motivation. These other ideas and reasons were only enablers, if you will. I mean, plenty of people need money. A number of people throughout the agency's history have stolen money from the agency and have done terrible things for money. Very few have sold secrets to the K.G.B., and I think one of the reasons is because many of them would have found -- there were a lot of barriers in the way. For me, by 1985, some of those barriers weren't there any more. I don't believe that I was affecting the security of this country and the safety of its people. . . . I didn't give that stuff to the Soviets because I thought espionage is a dirty game. I mean, that's trivial.

Q: How did you segregate the K.G.B. side of your life from the C.I.A. side?
A: It's a normal human faculty. I adapted a little more in the sense of being able to deny things, to avoid thinking about consequences. I never spent a lot of time thinking about my relationship with the K.G.B. When I would meet them, when I would have personal meetings with the K.G.B. officers, say in Bogota, when I left that meeting, at maybe 2 A.M., having had the better part of a bottle of vodka also, but when I left that meeting, I would have made a few notes about the communications planned for the next year. When I left that meeting, I just filed it in the back of my mind. I never once sat back and said: "Now, let's see. What did we talk about?"

Q: File it and forget it.
A: File and forget. And I told the K.G.B. I worked that way, too. And it caused me problems. I mean, I would forget things. I would screw up meetings. And this is partly just pure negligence, but partly just -- there was some mechanism operating that not only allowed me to do that but motivated me to do that in the first place. I didn't want to sit and mull it over.

Q: Did drinking factor into any of this, as a means of forgetting?
A: Yeah. The actual meetings I had with Soviets, for example, I would -- I usually had several drinks before a meeting. I would drink during the meeting. They would try and keep it very paced and everything, and so I wouldn't be completely drunk, but I would definitely have had more than just enough to put an edge on. I have had a kind of on-again, off-again binge drinking problem that occasionally reached the edge of scandal, but never quite fell off.

Q: You attacked espionage as a farce at your sentencing in April. What about the argument that the C.I.A.'s successes are all secret and only its failures are trumpeted?
A: You know that fellow Tolkachev? [Adolf G. Tolkachev, a Soviet military official spying for the United States, was betrayed in 1985 -- probably by Edward Lee Howard, a C.I.A. officer -- and was executed in 1986.] Tolkachev provided an awful lot of very valuable information on Soviet avionics, and I heard people that described his contribution in terms of, "He pays the rent on the headquarters compound." The thought expressed was that what he was able to tell us meant that N.A.T.O. would have clear air superiority in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. Well, that certainly sounds like a spectacularly successful espionage operation, but then you've got to take a little reality check. No. 1, nobody in the U.S. military, in the Administration, in N.A.T.O. seriously believed that N.A.T.O. air superiority was ever in question anyway. That was not an issue. Reality check No. 2, the Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe? What's the percentage of that occurring? Vanishingly small. So when you put even some of the spectacular successes under scrutiny, you come up saying, "Do we need to be doing all this expense, all this risk, all the things associated with espionage -- for this end?"

Q: There's been quite a bit of debate inside and outside the C.I.A. -- what's the agency's mission now that the cold war is over and the Soviets are gone?
A: Everyone is pretending things haven't changed. And by God, the scales have to drop from our eyes at some point.

Q: What would we see?
A: We don't have a special mission. We have been . . . deluding ourselves politically and convincing ourselves that we have a special mission.

Q: What do you think this delusion is?
A: To connect the repression of however you want to describe movements for economic and social justice in this country with a hyped-up threat from abroad, and to try and link the two, and to attack both. I hate to sound like an old-line Stalinist or something, but. . . .

Q: An enemy within?
A: Right.

Q: Someone once wrote that a nation can't be great without a great enemy.
A: I suppose that's a condemnation of greatness. If you look at any great nation, it's inherently evil or acquisitive or aggressive. Greatness is based primarily on values that we abhor.

Q: After '85, after you gave up the names of the Soviets working for the C.I.A. and went to the Rome station, how did you get information to pass to the K.G.B.?
A: I just passed what I had access to. And I had access to a wide range of stuff, but not to Soviet, sensitive Soviet operations. Except little bits and pieces. But I had a wide range of other information that the K.G.B. was eager to get, and happy to get. Generally, operational stuff. In Rome -- you would find it hard to believe, probably, I know the K.G.B. found it very hard to believe -- that as much paper washes through our overseas stations as does. Every day, I would have a stack of paper like that [holds his hands a foot apart], from headquarters, from stations elsewhere in Europe and elsewhere around the world who for some reason thought to put Rome on the routing. Just tremendous volumes of stuff. Most of it rather trivial, but some of it was of interest. And so I passed a lot of that.

Q: How would you arrange to contact the other side and meet?
A: Through a go-between, a Soviet Embassy officer, who's not a K.G.B. officer. We had an overt relationship -- I was assessing the guy to see if he'd be of value as a target and did develop him a little bit -- so this was all approved. I would give him a bag with some magazines in it, and then with a couple of envelopes with documents. A stack about this high [holds hands six inches apart] in the bottom of it. And I'd give him that after lunch, and he would give me usually a box of Cuban cigars. I don't know where he got the idea I was a cigar smoker. They weren't really high quality. And that would contain some money. We never discussed the operation. He had a pretty clear idea of what was happening, about the kind of person I was, and we got very friendly. But we never talked about it. And then from time to time, a K.G.B. officer involved with the case would travel to Rome and we would have a meeting in the Soviet residential compound. We had a late-night meeting. I would be picked up in the car and they would drive around for about 40 minutes, making sure there was no surveillance. I would have a jacket and a baseball cap on, take my glasses off, hunch down and we'd go zooming in, and then they'd take me up to a little room they'd constructed up in the attic for me. And we'd sit there for about four or five hours. And then we'd zoom back out.

Q: What were the immediate consequences of your acts?
A: In '85, '86, as a result of the information I sold to the Soviets, it was as if neon lights and searchlights lit up all over the Kremlin, shone all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, saying, "There is a penetration." No reasonable counterintelligence officer, F.B.I. or the C.I.A., was under any doubt by the spring of '86 that a penetration of S/E [the C.I.A.'s Soviet-Eastern Europe operations division] was the single, most logical reason for the disasters that had occurred. . . . It was almost inconceivable that the K.G.B. found itself doing what they did on the basis of the information I gave them. They went around and they wrapped all the agents up. I was amazed. I was anxious and amazed and shocked and scared. And in the course of the following years, all of the agents I told them about were recalled, transferred, arrested, whatnot, and then later on some of them were shot. . . .
The scale of what I had given them, it just went too high, and the K.G.B. later told me that they regretted acutely that they had been forced to take those steps. Had I known they were going to do that, I either would not have gone and sold them that information or I would have passed them out one by one. Had the K.G.B. not handed the proof that there was a penetration on a silver platter to the world, would there have been a continuing effort over eight or nine years to keep on looking for the source of a problem? Good question.

Q: Why do you think it took so long to catch you?
A: You've got two or three or four thousand people running around doing espionage. You can't monitor it. You can't control it. You can't check it. And that's probably the biggest problem with an espionage service. It has to be small. The minute you get big, you get like the K.G.B., or you get like us.

Q: Did you have any inkling that you were going to get busted?
A: None. . . . I always found reasons not to engage in a serious sit-down and think, "Where have things come to?" Had I done that, I might have seen what was coming. I shrank from it, I guess. Because had I come to the conclusion, it would have meant taking steps, untakebackable steps.

Q: You were scheduled to go to Moscow the week you were arrested. There was never any thought of, O.K., this is it, we're going to pull the plug and stay there?
A: No, I hadn't thought that way and I wasn't planning to do that.

Q: Getting out didn't cross your mind?
A: No. Well, it crossed my mind, but it was never a serious plan.

Q: A dozen people died or disappeared. People who, for whatever motives, -- personal, psychological, financial, political -- broke with their service to work for the United States. Deliberate acts of yours --
A: Yes. Yes.

Q: Led to their deaths.
A: Yes.

Q: Talk about that.
A: It's really hard to talk to an outsider about it. It is hard to -- there is a mystique, and it has nothing to do with facile things, like falling in love with an agent, but there is an old tradition in the agency -- maybe it's still around. You get older, you tend to think it's faded by now. But I was a strong believer in the kind of bond -- in addition to the overriding duties that you had as a case officer toward an agent, and your responsibilities to the agency and all that, you also had a kind of professional, personal, obligation. I think many, many people certainly felt that way, and probably still do. The process that enabled me to just suddenly -- because it wasn't gradually -- suddenly justify turning my back on the whole complex of what I just talked about, not to mention just the normal sense of human responsibility. . . .
This -- this -- this has so many consequences, and is such a burden. There was a sense in which, perhaps -- and it's hard for me to articulate it, or to fully understand it -- in which I was saying: "Over to you, K.G.B. You guys take care of me now." You know, I have done this. I have demonstrated that I'm holding nothing back. You guys take care of me. There may have been a component like that. There also was a sense in which I was saying, "It will help protect me in the future if these guys go away." But it's not untrue to say that they took similar risks. That is a callous thing to say, but there is a certain amount of truth to that. These two guys in the K.G.B. residency in Washington, and lots of people elsewhere. You know, they took similar risks. So there's that reciprocity, if you will. I don't mean it to be taken in terms of dismissing the men I sold and trivializing that. In other words, what happened to them also happened to me. So.

Q: Do you think it would have been better if you'd left the agency 10 years ago?
A: Yeah. [Long pause.] My son would have his parents. [Long pause.] My wife would have a husband. [Long pause.] That's it.

HEADLINE: The President's Past

BYLINE: By Michael Kelly; Michael Kelly is the staff writer of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
A good place to begin thinking about how Bill Clinton became who he is today is the Arkansas town of Springdale, where a short, red-faced man known as Mr. Chicken sits in a room modeled after the Oval Office of the President of the United States (although not precisely; the White House's Oval Office does not have doorknobs shaped like hen's eggs) and tells a story about the political education of a bright young fellow.
It may seem an act of considerable vanity for a chicken farmer to build himself a copy of the President's office. But Don Tyson is a realist to his thick fingertips, as befits a man who presides over the largest abattoir the world has ever seen -- every week, Tyson Foods reduces 25 million chickens to plucked and gutted shadows of their former selves -- and he sees politics as a series of unsentimental transactions between those who need votes and those who have money. His office decor is an accurate, not immodest statement about where, in a world where every quid has its quo, power lives. 
 Money men like Tyson are strong in politics everywhere, but the realities of Arkansas favor them particularly. Power in Arkansas rests upon two enduring conditions complicated by an enduring contradiction. The first condition is that most people in Arkansas have very little money while a few people have a great deal. The second condition is that Arkansas is not really a democracy. It has been ruled for almost all of its existence, and is largely ruled still, by a thin upper crust of Democratic Party officials and Democratic legislative leaders and important landholders and businessmen. This elite, bound together not by party or even ideology but by mutually advantageous relationships, holds sway over a small and politically disorganized middle class and a large but well-beaten population of the poor. The contradiction is that Arkansas voters, in a class-based reaction against this condition, perpetually favor politicians who are "common" in touch, populist in theology and reformist in policies.
What results is a system in which voters consistently reward candidates who promise change, but in which men like Tyson consistently reward those who preserve the pro-business status quo. Because each candidate must, in the absence of real party politics, build his own organization, and because the money men are the only dependable sources of the heavy financing that this requires, Arkansas's wealthy corporatists possess far greater clout than they would in a state with a strong party system, large professional class or powerful unions. They are the equivalent of Broadway's "angels," determining who appears on the big stage and who does not. There are a few Republicans among the angels, and perhaps one or two mild ideologues, but most of the heavenly host fit the description Don Tyson applies to himself: "businessman's Democrat," which means they support Democrats who support them.
"The Arkansas system had always been to find some good young people and encourage them to work on the local level," Tyson ruminates by speakerphone from his oval office. "The system kind of weeds them out, and out of that comes a United States Senator or a governor. . . . It's like a horse race. You back three or four, so you always got a winner."
The Tyson family has been backing winners in Arkansas politics since 1954, when John Tyson, Don's father and the founder of the family business, bet on a promising young man named Orval Faubus. "Orval was my dad's first political deal," Tyson recalls, speaking of the six-term Governor with the nostalgic affection of an old horseplayer remembering a 5-to-1 shot that paid off. "Orval was a little newspaper editor 25 miles east of here in Huntsville. He got over here one day and had a lunch with a bunch of Springdale people here in a restaurant. He said, 'I want to run for Governor and I need $1,500 and don't have it.' Dad was one of the three people who gave him $500 apiece so he could pay his filing fee."
The generation that entered Arkansas politics in the 1970's was exceptionally rich in talent, but even so, Bill Clinton caught Tyson's eye. "He was young and he was impressive," Tyson recalls. "I don't believe we ever talked about his politics; hell, he was a Democrat." Tyson put a modest sum of money on Clinton in his yearling race, a Congressional run in 1974. Although Clinton lost that election, he showed excellent form, and Tyson backed him again in his successful 1976 run for State Attorney General; and again in 1978, when the 32-year-old ran as the overwhelming favorite for Governor.
But before Tyson made his gubernatorial choice for 1978, he posed a question. In the relentless drive of expansion and acquisition that would make Tyson Foods the largest poultry processing company in the world, Tyson faced a serious obstacle. In recent years, most other states had raised their legal truck weight limits from about 73,000 to 80,000 pounds. Arkansas, though, still stuck to the old limit, which put the state's poultry and trucking companies at a disadvantage with their out-of-state competitors and cost them millions of dollars. Would a Governor Clinton take care of that problem? Candidate Clinton, recalls Tyson, said he would be happy to.
"Bill promised a bunch of us that he'd raise the weight limit on trucks," Tyson remembers. "Damn right he did. He promised me, personally, in my car driving to the airport three or four months before the election. He said that if he was elected, he'd do it. He said he'd take care of it. Now, there's a bunch of chicken folks in this state, and we all had a big interest in this weight thing, so we supported Clinton."
It was, by Tyson's account, several months after this private talk that a great windfall came into the lives of a young and relatively poor couple named Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham. The windfall fell from the hand of the Clintons' close friend James Blair, an important Arkansas Democrat of the back-room genre and a Springdale lawyer whose most important client was Don Tyson and Tyson Foods.
Blair was a man who greatly desired to be rich. In 1977, he began plunging deep into a string of commodities speculations that he expected would make him so. Trading in cattle futures through the Springdale branch of the Ray E. Friedman and Company (Refco) chain run by Robert (Red) Bone, a commodities broker (and former Tyson executive) of dubious reputation, Blair had already made several hundred thousand dollars by October 1978, and expected to make millions more. With Clinton up 30 points in the polls less than a month before Election Day, Blair approached Hillary Rodham to urge her to invest in his sure-thing scheme, telling her that "it was one of those rare chances to put aside some money," and that "she wouldn't have to be the expert. I'd give her advice."
Mrs. Clinton put up $1,000, and on her first day made a post-commission profit of $5,300, trading on 10 cattle futures contracts. She continued to invest with Blair and Bone for nine months, during which time her husband was elected and sworn in as Governor. Although Mrs. Clinton was a small, inexperienced and cash-poor customer, Bone's Refco office accorded her privileged treatment generally reserved only for investors with deep pockets or proven records. The Blair-Clinton investments ended in July 1979, having netted $99,537, a nearly 10,000 percent return.
On April 22, 1994, Hillary Rodham Clinton, soft-edged in a warm pink sweater and smiling sweetly at the badgering White House reporters, acknowledged that she had opened her account at Blair's "very strong recommendation," that Blair had always guided her about which trades to make and that "often" he had simply placed the trades for her. Her role, as she described it, was largely limited to approving Blair's suggestions. But, Mrs. Clinton insisted, Blair had done this large favor only because he and his wife were "among our very best friends." Scorn crisping the edges of her voice, Mrs. Clinton dismissed the idea that Blair might have meant to guarantee good will towards Tyson Foods with his $100,000 boon to the Governor and his wife. "I found it a little bit surprising that anyone would suggest that," Mrs. Clinton said, "because, in 1980, right during the time that this was all going on, when my husband ran for re-election, Tyson supported his opponent."
Mrs. Clinton's artful explanation notwithstanding, the records show that she had concluded her commodities trading with Blair by July 1979 -- more than a year before the next gubernatorial campaign. For his part, Tyson says today that he never knew about the financial arrangements between his attorney and the Clintons until he read about them in The New York Times earlier this year. But Tyson also says the reason he didn't support Bill Clinton in 1980 is not because he couldn't buy Clinton's favors in 1978. It was because Tyson thought he had indeed obtained a favor -- the promised truck weight increase. But Clinton had failed to deliver his part of the bargain. "He didn't raise the limit," Tyson says.
The fact is, even if he had wanted to, Governor Clinton could probably not have pushed the higher truck weight through the Legislature. The opposition of the powerful Arkansas Highway Commission -- on the grounds that heavier trucks would damage the state's highways -- was just too strong. But Tyson blamed the young Governor for not even making the fight. "He never even tried to get it through," Tyson says.
And so, when Clinton ran again for Governor in 1980, against a little-known Republican businessman named Frank White, Tyson took revenge: "I said, 'Hell, I'll support Frank White.' "
Clinton lost the 1980 election, a defeat that threatened to end his political career. But in 1982, after a brutal campaign against White, he won back the Governor's seat. Tyson, who had backed White a second time, watched with interest to see what the resurrected Governor would do about the truck weight limit, which remained unchanged despite White's support of an increase. Almost immediately after taking office again in 1983, Clinton maneuvered the 80,000-pound limit through the Legislature by linking it to a special tax on the heavier trucks, to pay for potential road damage. And when Clinton ran for re-election in 1984, Tyson supported him, as he has in every election since. He is refreshingly candid about why. "He started running the state better and learned a few lessons," Tyson says, "And, hell, my trucks were running full, 80,000 pounds."
HE 42D PRESIDENT IS AN IMPRESSIVE THINKER, a talented political performer and something of a visionary. Indeed, although Bill Clinton has been largely successful (for better and worse) in presenting himself as a moderate, he is, in a true and unpejorative sense of the word, a radical, committed to a level of change far more ambitious than that of most Presidents. Through his ability to speak with both uncommon intelligence and a common touch, he has advanced issues that had been frozen for years in a left-right stalemate, most notably health care, welfare and crime. The expanded earned-income tax credit program he won from Congress last year was a historic measure, the Government's first real attempt to guarantee that no one who works full time and has a family to support would fall below the poverty line. The health care reform he is trying to get through Congress this year would be the most significant expansion of entitlements since the creation of Social Security and among the most ambitious efforts at social engineering in the nation's history. The Clinton Administration is the first to openly (if at times gingerly) embrace the idea of according protected minority status to homosexuals. The Clinton welfare-reform bill may not entirely meet the grand campaign promise of "ending welfare as we know it," but it nevertheless represents a genuine attempt to impose the toughest work requirements ever attached to welfare, the first serious effort by any President, Democrat or Republican, to stop the disastrous generational cycle of America's dole society. Because Clinton is President, it has become harder now for criminals and lunatics to arm themselves, and easier for parents to take time off work without losing their jobs.
So why doesn't all of this seem to matter more? Why doesn't Bill Clinton get more credit for his successes, and less vilification for his failures, which seem to loom so large? Why does the President get so little respect? The problem is not just criticism from the right, where many passionately loathe Clinton. That is to be expected; conservatives understand, if liberals do not, how serious the President is about dramatic change. What threatens this President seems to be much larger than mere partisanship. There is a level of mistrust and even dislike of him that is almost visceral in its intensity. In Washington, where power is generally treated with genuflecting reverence, it is no longer surprising to hear the President spoken of with open and dismissive contempt. In mainstream journalism and even more so in popular entertainment, President Clinton is routinely depicted in the most unflattering terms: a liar, a fraud, a chronically indecisive man who cannot be trusted to stand for anything -- or with anyone.
Bob Woodward, in his book "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House," describes the President as a lost leader, berating himself and his aides for selling out the populist promise of his campaign to satisfy Wall Street, being berated in turn by his own Vice President to "get with the goddamn program." At a television town-hall gathering in North Carolina, a woman confronted the President: "Many of us Americans are having a hard time with your credibility. How can you earn back our trust?" At another public event, a newspaper editor informed the President that his explanations on Whitewater reminded him of his young daughter's excuses for undone homework. The political columnist Joe Klein, once one of Clinton's great fans, writes that the President's idea of character is "adolescent, unformed, half-baked," and that "with the Clintons, the story is always subject to further revision," as "trust is squandered in dribs and drabs."
Much of this is unfair, some of it is irrational and some of it has more to do with the savagery of an angry and fearful time than it does with Clinton personally. It is true as well that Clinton suffers from a fundamental handicap; in the unusual three-way race of 1992, he was elected with only 43 percent of the vote, putting him in office with one of the weakest bases of support any President has ever had. But there is a fundamental reason for Clinton's plight. Bill Clinton is the first President since Richard Nixon to be threatened with the awful intimacy of rejection not simply as a leader or as a politician but as a person. As was also true with Nixon, this threat flows from a deep source, an abiding public doubt about the ethical content of the President's character. Such doubt is quite different from the criticisms of job performance that plague every President. It is an assessment of the man as a whole, of what is bred in the bone, one of those national gut decisions that happen in politics, something that solidifies after the accumulation of evidence passes some unseen tipping point: Lincoln is honest, Carter is weak, Reagan is decent but doddering, Bush is a wimp. Only Richard Nixon and now Bill Clinton have been tagged with nicknames that reflected a popular suspicion that the President of the United States could not be fully trusted: Tricky Dick and Slick Willie.
What plagued Nixon, and now Clinton, is that this sort of judgment is extremely difficult to overcome; it is almost entirely impervious to the machinations of speech writers and political consultants, and even to substantive achievements of office. Bill Clinton ran for President promising to revive the economy and bring about universal health care. Less than halfway through his term, the economy is in strong shape and health care reform in some form is almost assured. Most Americans acknowledge these achievements. According to a New York Times-CBS poll in mid-July, 53 percent of Americans view the economy as healthy, compared with only 23 percent when Clinton took office. Seventy-nine percent think universal health care is "very important." Yet the public is strongly disinclined to give Clinton credit. The Times-CBS poll found that 63 percent of Americans think Clinton has made no progress in improving the economy. Even more startling, 60 percent say Clinton has made no progress in advancing health care insurance. The President's overall approval, which has never risen more than about 10 points beyond the 43 percent mark, has dropped precipitously in the past six months; 47 percent of the public disapprove of the way Clinton is doing his job and only 42 percent approve.
Nixon's problems were rooted in the record of his life, and Clinton's are, too, in the things he has said and done to get where he is today. Clinton's life trails him like a peculiarly single-minded mugger, popping out from the shadows every time it seems the President is for a moment safe -- to whack the staggering victim anew. The past has slugged Clinton so often, so publicly and so brutally, that its attacks have become known, in the pop-culture shorthand that signifies universal acquaintanceship, by their tabloid handles: Gennifer, the Draft, I Didn't Inhale, Whitewater, Troopergate, Hillary's Commodities, Paula Jones. Each episode has moved the national assessment closer to the tipping point.
What makes this sad, even tragic, rather than merely sordid, is that Bill Clinton's predicament owes itself directly to Bill Clinton's promise. The President's problems did not come about because he was a cheap political hack. They came about because he was not. For what has happened to Clinton has happened because he wanted, more than anything in life, to get to where he is today, and because he wanted this, at least in part, in order to do good -- and because the great goal of doing good gave him license to indulge in the everyday acts of minor corruption and compromise and falsity that the business of politics demands. Bill Clinton was perceptive enough to master politics -- but not perceptive enough to see what politics was doing to him.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF BOTH NATURE and nurture set Bill Clinton up for a life in politics. The Hollywood version of Clinton's life, produced for his 1992 Presidential campaign, centered on his early childhood "in a place called Hope," a parable of small-town innocence and working-class roots. But Clinton really grew up in the old gangster city of Hot Springs, where his mother, Virginia, had moved when he was 6. As she describes it in her recent, posthumously published memoirs, "Leading With My Heart," Hot Springs was "a town in which the con job was considered an art form," and the home of the some of the most thoroughly crooked politics in America. The city of Clinton's youth was a place where whorehouses and illegal gambling halls thrived under police protection, where the retired New York mobster Owney Madden was a celebrated citizen and the town's leading madam was another, where illegal gambling and liquor sales were routine -- a place, Virginia writes, "where gangsters were cool, and rules were made to be bent, and money and power -- however you got them -- were the total measure of a man."
Virginia and her second husband, Roger (Dude) Clinton, were not peripheral citizens but successful members of the Hot Springs business and political establishment. Virginia built what was for three decades a successful practice as a nurse-anesthetist, and Roger was employed at his brother Raymond's thriving Buick dealership. In her memoirs, Virginia Kelley (as she was known at the time of her death in January) describes a family that always had a big, comfortable home, at least one late-model Buick convertible in the garage and enough spending money to indulge in frequent night-clubbing and gambling with a group of "running buddies" that included many of the men who ran Hot Springs. Indeed, the Clintons themselves were important political players: Roger's brother Roy was a member of the State Legislature from 1951 to 1954, and his brother Raymond, the family leader whom Clinton has described as a father figure, was a behind-the-scenes power in town. He made his Buick dealership "a gathering place for powerful, politically savvy men in Hot Springs," Kelley writes. "The big wheels."
One critical point that the young Clinton could not have failed to notice was that people who had power and connections could do things that other people could not. Kelley's unblushing account makes it clear that Roger Clinton and his friends had a long history of getting away with crimes and acts of drunken violence. She writes, offhandedly, that before she met Roger, Raymond had used his influence to get Roger out of trouble with the Hot Springs police after he had "bashed a Puerto Rican boy in the head with a cue stick." In later years, Kelley recounts, there was a litany of violent occasions: "the night I danced with a man at the Tower Club and Roger Clinton beat him to a pulp"; Roger punching and kicking her at a public dance; Roger and his drinking buddies driving roaring drunk down the highways; nights the cops were called to the Clinton home to protect her and her sons.
And the lesson was not merely that the right people could get away with doing wrong. As Kelley describes her philosophy, the right people -- herself, her family and friends -- couldn't really do wrong.
In the two years and eight months of her marriage to her first husband, Bill Blythe, Kelley writes, he never told her of his previous three marriages or that he had fathered at least one child besides Bill. Of her third husband, Jeff Dwire, Kelley writes that her friends suspected him of being "a con man," and of running a house of prostitution out of his beauty salon. Kelley says she "never believed" those "awful rumors." In 1961 Dwire was indicted on 25 counts of stock fraud (for which he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison) for his part in a scheme in which he and a partner bilked small-time investors of more than $32,000 by pretending they were producing a movie on the life of the gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. As far as Kelley was concerned, "that one mistake wasn't a reflection of the inner man."
Kelley calls her approach to life "brainwashing," and describes it in clear terms: "Inside my head, I construct an airtight box. I keep inside what I want to think about, and everything else stays beyond the walls. Inside is white, outside is black . . . Inside is love and friends and optimism. Outside is negativity, can't-doism and any criticism of me and mine."
Also outside the parameters of Kelley's construct were the past and the future; she insisted on living in the present. "I've always felt the past is irrelevant," she writes. "I've always maintained that whatever's in someone's past is past, and I don't need to know about it." As for the future: "I've trained myself not to worry about what-ifs, either. . . . And when bad things do happen, I brainwash myself to put them out of my mind." Kelley's relentless accentuation of the positive must have been a great help in dealing with years of adversity, and Bill Clinton clearly owes much of his own optimism, tenacity and resilience to his mother's inspiration. Clinton also may owe to Kelley the character trait that was perhaps the essential determinant of his political success -- an unusually large need for adulation, a hunger for afffirmation from others so intense that approval is seen almost as an entitlement. "I think Bill and Roger and I are all alike in that way," Kelley writes. "When we walk into a room, we want to win that room over. Some would even say we need to win that room over, and maybe that's true. Roger says the three of us, if there are 100 in a room and 99 of them love us and one doesn't, we'll spend all night trying to figure out why that one hasn't been enlightened."
This powerful need doubtless had a great deal to do with turning Clinton into the remarkable political performer he is, a campaigner driven to treat each encounter with a prospective voter as an occasion for seduction, an opportunity to win another's love. But this need also made him peculiarly vulnerable to the universal temptation of political life -- to tell people what they want to hear. Kelley's philosophy could only have encouraged this behavior. Her world view taught, ultimately, that people are not to be judged by their actions, but are endlessly free to reinvent themselves, to be whatever the moment demands. Since "what ifs" do not exist, one needn't worry that the promise of the moment cannot be met in the future, or that the action of the moment might have a harmful consequence. Since the "irrelevant" past does not really exist either, the actions of the moment cease to exist once the moment becomes the past, and cannot be held against one later.
Kelley describes herself as a natural performer who craved to be the center of admiring attention, and it is noteworthy that the early ambition of both of her sons was to be a popular music star like Kelley's idol, Elvis Presley. Roger Clinton never advanced beyond that adolescent dream; Bill Clinton, recognizing his true talents, put aside his saxophone and turned to politics.
Clinton's career began while he still a student at Hot Springs High School, where he was president of his junior class, the Beta Club (for academic achievers) and the Kiwanis Key Club. By his late teens, Clinton was already a semi-professional politician, so greatly in demand as a civics club speaker and leader of charitable fund drives that his high-school principal had to limit his engagements in order to protect his schooling.
It was clear early on that Clinton possessed great political gifts. He was intelligent, charming and driven, and he had an extraordinary gift for intimacy, a chameleonlike quality of immense value in politics. All sorts of people, meeting Clinton, saw someone much like themselves. Like his hero, John F. Kennedy, he was at home on stage or in front of a camera.
Moreover, Clinton was precisely the kind of budding politician to appeal to the Arkansas powers. In an age of radicalism, he was an instinctive establishmentarian. He was a joiner: the calculus club, the advanced math club Mu Alpha Theta, DeMolay (an organization of "future leaders"), the Junior Classical League, the Bio-Chem-Phy Club, the marching band, concert band, stage band and pep band. He was the right kind of achiever: a National Merit Scholarship semifinalist, winner of the Hot Springs High School Civitan Junior Businessman Award and the Elks Youth Leadership Award for Arkansas, accepted at Georgetown, Oxford and Yale. He was not a bomb-thrower or even a boat-rocker. He ran for his first college office, the 1964 freshman class presidency of Georgetown University, on a platform of solid, modest reform. After his victory, he informed the college newspaper that "the freshman year is not the time for crusading, but for building a strong unit for the future. You must know the rules before you can change them."
A young man of such obvious promise would have been encouraged in any state, but in a poor, chronically put-upon state like Arkansas, he was particularly prized. As A. J. Liebling once noted, the states of the old Confederacy are always searching for those exceptional "national" political talents, the bright young men who will go to Washington and make those damn Yankees stop their endless sneering. But neither Clinton's inarguable appeal nor his inarguable talent for wooing support explain why so many people were willing, and would always be willing, to do so much to further his ambitions. The real explanation lies in the conviction, held by Clinton's elders and friends, as well as by Clinton himself, that he was ambitious for the right reasons -- because he wanted power in order to do good.
"We all believed, at that time, that the most noble direction we could take was to serve in elective or appointive office," recalled David Mixner, a longtime Clinton friend and liberal political activist, in an interview with the Clinton biographer Robert E. Levin. "He really deeply believed that Government could feed people, that we could end war, that poverty did not have to be a permanent condition, that we could make our country great and prosperous and that our generation would be the one to do it."
The danger in this admirable thought was that it led, almost inevitably, to a logical successor: that the advance of a generational idealist like Bill Clinton was a moral imperative -- one that justified any means necessary. The acceptance of this rationalization was the signal event in the development of Clinton's character -- the ur-compromise from which all later compromises would flow. It occurred when Clinton was only 23, in response to the first great crisis in his life, the Vietnam War.
For Clinton, as for so many men of his generation, Vietnam would be the crucible, the testing ground that would shape their characters forever. Clinton's successful multiyear effort to avoid the Vietnam draft reached its apex in April 1969, when he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford and received an induction notice from the Hot Springs draft board. At his request, the induction was postponed for two months so that he could finish his term. That summer, he returned to Arkansas and won a deferment on the strength of his pledge to enroll in the Reserved Officers Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas, whose law school he said he planned to attend once he'd finished at Oxford. It was a move of desperation. The R.O.T.C. deferment could protect him for four more years, but would at the same time commit him to two undesirable courses of action: attending the University of Arkansas Law School instead of the far more prestigious one at Yale and serving a lengthy stint in the Army reserves after graduation. The deferment was granted on Aug. 7, 1969, and was put into effect immediately, protecting Clinton from the draft for two crucial months in which the Hot Springs draft board inducted two younger men.
On Oct. 30, Clinton was reclassified 1-A. He has said that this was his idea, and that he took this step because he had come to feel, after several years of maneuvering to avoid the draft, a moral obligation to take his chances along with the other young men of his community. But Clinton's timing suggests otherwise; he changed his draft status only after President Nixon had announced that inductions would be sharply decreased and that graduate students, like Clinton, would be allowed to finish the school year even if drafted, thus guaranteeing protection through the late spring of 1970. Moreover, Nixon had begun winding the war down; 25,000 troops had already been withdrawn, and the Administration was reportedly considering withdrawing all troops by the end of 1970. On Nov. 26, Congress enacted the new draft lottery system, and on Dec. 1, Clinton's birth date was assigned the number 311, high enough that he knew he would never be called. On Dec. 2, in violation of his promise to enroll in the R.O.T.C. program at the University of Arkansas, Clinton applied to Yale Law School. On Dec. 3, he sent a letter explaining his actions (and seeking the approval he craved even from someone he had deceived) to Col. Eugene Holmes, the Army R.O.T.C. commander at the University of Arkansas.
The now-famous Holmes letter, made public during the 1992 campaign, captures the young Clinton at a crossroads. On one hand, the writer of this letter is obviously and passionately concerned with doing, and being, good. But the letter also captures, with shattering clarity, a young man learning to rationalize acts of deception and compromise as necessary in the pursuit of that good -- which Clinton now regarded as inseparable from his own political advancement.
In his carefully crafted explanation of his thinking, Clinton made clear that he regarded the draft as 'illegitimate," and the Vietnam War as immoral. He described two close friends who had openly resisted the draft as heroes, and portrayed the path of the conscientious objector as the honorable one for anyone opposed to the war. But in the end, Clinton wrote, he decided to put the moral imperative of his political success above his principles:
"I decided to accept the draft in spite of my beliefs for one reason: to maintain my political viability within the system. For years, I have worked to prepare myself for a political life characterized by both practical political ability and concern for rapid social progress. It is a life I still feel compelled to try to lead."
Here, astonishing in its hubris, is the idea at last expressed in its all-excusing force. Other young men of Clinton's generation might justify their actions regarding Vietnam on the grounds of simple self-interest: they did not want to lose their lives to a stupid war. Clinton decided that his self-interest was the same as his country's. He was acting for the sake of the nation's future.
The Arkansas that Bill Clinton came home to in the summer of 1973 after getting his law degree at Yale was in middle of the most significant generational reform movements since the late 1940's. Clinton plunged immediately into it, with a 1974 challenge to the popular Republican Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt of the Third Congressional District, which covered most of northwestern Arkansas. That included Fayetteville, where Clinton had accepted a teaching position at the University of Arkansas Law School. Although Clinton was unlikely to win against Hammerschmidt, he nevertheless attracted strong backing, beginning with his family connections and expanding quickly throughout the Democratic establishment.
In the Democratic primary and in the general election, both the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Arkansas Education Association supported Clinton, as did consumer groups, the United Mine Workers and some of the angels of Arkansas politics, most notably Don Tyson. According to Meredith Oakley, the author of "On the Make: The Rise of Bill Clinton," Clinton was able to outspend Hammerschmidt by $20,000. In his campaign, Clinton was much aided by his de facto campaign manager and wife-to-be, a young woman whose reformist zeal surpassed even his. By running hard on an anti-big-business platform and by unfairly tarring Hammerschmidt with Watergate, the young candidate nearly pulled off what would have been a tremendous upset, winning nearly 49 percent of the vote.
Falling back on his teaching job, Clinton immediately began planning his next race, a run for Attorney General that he won as expected in 1976. The new Attorney General was a populist reformer in the classic Arkansas style: anti-utilities, anti-big-business, pro-environment, pro-working class. Every week, he and his young staff attacked the utility companies over rate hikes and other issues, pushed environmental issues and energy conservation and sued local dairy farms and General Motors. He worked all the time, and kept his name before increasingly impressed voters through frequent photo ops and media shows that demonstrated his deepening understanding of the new performance art of television politics. After only one two-year term as Attorney General, Clinton won the Governor's seat, becoming, at 32, the youngest chief executive in the nation.
Much of what the new Governor did in his first term, in 1979 and 1980, was relatively uncontroversial. For instance, he increased spending on public education by 40 percent and expanded legal, health and social services for the elderly. But a good deal of it directly challenged the moneyed interests. Clinton did not merely alienate Don Tyson and his fellow poultry barons; he took on the entire host of Arkansas angels: the utilities, the timber interests and the trucking companies.
The Administration's most famous and popular battles were fought against the Arkansas Power and Light Company, a perennial target of reform governors. The "whiz kids" who ran Clinton's new Energy Department -- Scott Trotter, Walter Nixon 3d, Basil Copeland and Jerry Lawson -- made headlines with a suit that forced the utility to refund to its customers $8.5 million in overcharges, and challenged the company over its secret plans to pass on to Arkansans up to one-third of the cost for Grand Gulf nuclear plant, which was being built near Port Gibson, Miss., by A.P.&L. and two other Southern utilities.
Thus, in 1980, when the first-term Governor ran for what was expected to be an easy re-election, it wasn't just Don Tyson who was looking for revenge. Much of the entire corporate establishment of Arkansas lined up behind Frank White, a Little Rock investment banker and political neophyte. The timber companies and the Stephens family, financiers who wielded immense political power, either supported White or sat on their wallets. Both A.P.&L. and Southwestern Bell openly endorsed White, contributing heavily. When financial disclosure reports were filed a few weeks before Election Day, Clinton, who had expected to far outraise his relatively unknown opponent, was shocked to learn that White had collected an impressive $400,000.
The fat cats' backing allowed White to run an aggressive, late-campaign series of television commercials attacking the arrogance and incompetence of the Clinton Administration. White won the election, and Clinton became the youngest ex-governor in the nation. White's first official act as Governor was a gift to A.P.&L.: he abolished the Energy Department and fired the whiz kids.
Clinton brooded about his first real political setback, potentially fatal to his long-term ambitions. Publicly, he blamed himself for losing touch with the people. In private conversations with friends, he attributed his failure at least equally to losing touch with the moneyed interests.
"During his lame-duck period, I went to his office to visit him," recalls Trotter. "He was in this real funk, and he told me that after the news got out about Grand Gulf, A.P.&L. went out and raised a lot of money for Frank White, and that this money had enabled White to run the negative TV ads late in the campaign that Clinton figured cost him the race. The message was: If we hadn't done this thing, he'd still be Governor."
Clinton's traumatic defeat took its place alongside the Vietnam draft as a watershed in his development. His first term as Governor had been a grand experiment in reform, motivated both by ideals and by political instincts that told him change was what the voters wanted. Where had all this got him? The voters had paid little attention to his successes, and had held his failures greatly against him. The angels, on the other hand, had paid close attention to what Clinton had done, and had punished him for it.
The lesson was clear: to be successful, a politician had to appear hugely concerned with bettering the lives of ordinary citizens but had to be careful to avoid acting on those concerns so aggressively that they threatened the interests of the business elite. Exiled to an office in the Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey & Jennings, Clinton pondered how he could win votes as a populist reformer and still raise money as a businessman's Democrat. Arkansas political observers credit two people, Jim Blair and a tough political operative from Texas named Betsey Wright, with teaching the defeated Governor how to walk the line between the two competing demands. "It was Betsey who taught him -- hammered it into his head, really -- the idea that perception was reality," recalls Brownie Ledbetter, president of the reformist Arkansas Fairness Council. "That became the battle cry of the new Clinton approach."
Bill Clinton had never been much good at the old style of populism, the bellowing, wisecracking, denunciatory style practiced by Arkansas candidates since the days of Jeff Davis. But his own natural style -- his intuitive desire to please, his chameleonesque habit of becoming whoever he was with, his talent for losing himself in the moment -- was ideally suited to the new style of perception-based populism, primarily defined by television. The small screen did something perverse. It diminished and distorted the traditional thunderers of politics, translating their grand oratorical sweeps and outsize physical gestures into cartoons. Clinton realized that the new medium permitted a much more sophisticated level of communication with voters, by playing intimate scenes before the camera as if the camera weren't there. He understood that the camera rewarded the evocation of a different kind of sincerity in politics. It transmitted more than words; it transmitted performances, and the performances it transmitted most effectively were all about seduction.
The right words and the right nonverbal signals -- the way in which a politician stood, sat, listened, laughed, smiled, frowned -- combined to create a message that overrode the content of the words alone. If a politician was good at this, he could create not only a political reality out of perception, but also several conflicting realities at the same time, subtly manipulating the nuances of language, voice, expression and body posture so that each member of his audience saw and heard what he wanted to see and hear. It was possible to speak even on a subject that aroused sharp division -- abortion or affirmative action or welfare -- and have people on opposing sides perceive the speaker to be one of them.
Bill Clinton was beyond good at this new political performance art. When he spoke, perception was not only reality. It was a reality that changed, quicksilver-quick, from eye to eye and ear to ear. "You and Clinton might disagree totally on a subject and you'll never know it unless you listen closely to every word," marveled Robert S. McCord, executive editor of The Arkansas Democrat, in 1978. "Most people don't. They rely on tone of voice and facial expressions, which from Clinton, will never be harsh or unpleasant . . . Liberals and conservatives alike go away from him thinking he's one bright fellow."
In the 1982 campaign to regain the Statehouse, Clinton appeared to run hard as a populist. He accused White of being the tool of the moneyed interests, telling a Democratic Women's Club audience: "He's got half a million dollars because the people who wanted decisions from the Governor's office paid for them." Diane Blair, an Arkansas political scientist (and the wife of Jim Blair) later wrote that Clinton's ads "portrayed White as an untrustworthy, interest-dominated plutocrat who might run with the good-old-boy hounds by day but slept with the utility foxes at night, while Clinton was just a caring and concerned, down-home Baptist family man who wanted nothing more than another chance to fight the fat cats on behalf of the little guys."
Publicly and frequently, Clinton embraced his former energy whiz kids Trotter and Nixon, who were themselves campaigning for a 1982 ballot referendum to reform the state's regulation of the utilities. "Clinton made a big media deal out of signing our petition to put the reform on the ballot, and during the primary season, he exploited the hell out of the issue," Trotter says now. "We had a flat commitment from him that he would enact our reforms if he got back in."
But offstage, Clinton took pains to establish a cordial and lucrative relationship with the big-money interests against whom he was railing. To that end, he appointed as his finance chairman a small-town banker named W. Maurice Smith, a second-generation political heavyweight and formidable fund raiser. "Smith's wealthy friends were numerous," the Arkansas columnist Oakley has written. "His selection as finance chair in the 1982 campaign -- and all subsequent Clinton re-election campaigns -- was one of the smartest decisions Clinton made." With Smith's help, Clinton raised more than $1 million, then a record. When Clinton regained office, Smith came along as the resurrected Governor's executive assistant.
From 1983 until he resigned halfway through his fifth term to seek the Presidency, Governor Clinton achieved a number of moderate reforms. He opened up high-level government jobs to blacks and women. He helped win passage of the first ethics law for elected officials in Arkansas's history. He greatly increased spending on social services. He developed tax-credit and bond-issuing programs to create thousands of new jobs, although most of them were low-paying. He and his wife, who had established herself as a powerful figure in Arkansas political and legal circles, worked to fashion a settlement that ended a long-running lawsuit over Little Rock schools, which had resegregated along residential lines. He established some regulatory controls on Arkansas's largest pollution problem, animal wastes. His showpiece act, the 1983 education reform, primarily designed and sold by Mrs. Clinton, won large increases in tax-generated financing for state schools and established a mandatory competency test for public-school teachers and standarized testing of students. He sponsored improvements in the prison system, the child-welfare system and the administration of juvenile justice.
But he would never again take on the angels with anything like the vigor of his first term. "A big intersection of interests -- timber, farms, A.P.&L., the Stephenses -- was aligned against Clinton when he took office again in the early 80's, and I think there was basically a conscious decision not to antagonize any of these guys anymore," says Ernest Dumas, a veteran Little Rock political writer and editor. "Clinton, in essence, said, 'Fellas, I'm going to concentrate all my energies on education reform.' Well, that was fine with the interests. They were for education reform. It would be nice to be able to hire people who could read and write, and it didn't hurt them any."
And Clinton's other reforms -- many of which came about as a result of Federal court decisions forced by class-action and interest-group litigation -- often turned out to be much grander in the selling than in their real effects. Clinton's 1983 education reform was a classic case in point. With the promise that teacher testing would rid the schools of incompetent educators, Governor Clinton had won broad public support for a tax increase to finance his education program. What was actually delivered struck many in Arkansas as a cynical exercise: a test that could be passed by teachers possessing only eighth-grade-level skills in language and math. Teachers were coached in special workshops, and those who failed were allowed to retake the test.
Perhaps the most striking example of the discrepancy between what Clinton the populist Governor promised and what Clinton the businessman's Democrat Governor delivered came in his handling of issues involving Arkansas Power and Light.
Two of the original energy whiz kids, Scott Trotter and Walter Nixon, maintain that Clinton won re-election in 1982, at least partly, on the strength of his opposition to the utilities. "But when he was re-elected, we did not go back to work," Nixon recalls. "He did not recreate the Energy Department, did not re-engage on the energy issues which he believed had helped get him defeated in 1980, never followed through again with any fervor on energy reform."
Publicly, Clinton remained committed to the fight. In his first month back in office, the Governor introduced eight utility reform bills that encompassed many of his campaign promises. But only three of the weakest bills passed, and the four that were the centerpieces of his reforms were killed. Trotter charges that Clinton, while officially urging passage of the bills, never really fought for them. "We pushed and pulled and poked, but he was completely dilatory," Trotter said. "He and I argued about it in his office before I quit, and he just said that he didn't need the utility issue anymore. He was going into education."
Clinton's handling of Don Tyson evolved similarly. During the 1980's, Tyson Foods grew at an explosive rate, climbing to $4.2 billion in sales in 1993. It became the largest chicken processor in the world, controlling more than 20 percent of the American market and churning out more than 80 million pounds of chicken products every week. Critics among Arkansas's environmental and labor groups found much to object to in the way Tyson did business. One growing complaint was that the huge volume of animal waste -- especially the euphemistically named "litter" from chicken houses, much of it generated by Tyson's ever-expanding empire -- was seriously polluting Arkansas's crystalline rivers and streams. In one famous incident that took place shortly after Clinton was restored to office in 1983, the sewage system in the town of Green Forest, which had been for years overloaded by Tyson-produced animal waste, dumped so much raw sewage into Dry Creek that a giant sinkhole formed, sending largely untreated sewage into the aquifer that supplied much of the local drinking water at a rate of one million gallons a day.
Clinton's response to the pollution issue was typical of his new style. Seventeen months after the Green Forest crisis, he declared a state of "disaster emergency." That same year, the state environmental agency, which had been given enforcement powers for the first time by Clinton, began enforcing long-ignored directives to Tyson to pretreat waste from its Green Forest processing plant. But the state failed to levy any fines against the company or to sue it for damages. That was left to a group of outraged citizens, who eventually prevailed in a 1989 judgment that found Tyson Foods guilty of 43 violations of the Clean Water Act.
On the question of how poultry wastes should be handled in general, Clinton waited until 1990. He appointed a commission, the Animal Waste Task Force, which deliberated until November 1992 and then issued guidelines that called for state-enforced regulation of the liquid animal wastes produced by cattle and hog farmers, while allowing the poultry industry to comply with the guidelines voluntarily. "Thousands of Arkansas poultry producers should be pleased," declared Poultry Times, the industry newspaper.
Certainly, the people at Tyson Foods noticed a difference in the Governor. "I think the defeat of 1980 was a watershed in his poltical career," says Archie Schaffer, a Tyson public relations official. "He came back in '82 with a different attitude, much less confrontational with the business community and others in the so-called establishment, much more conciliatory. . . . After he was reelected, he pushed some mildly controversial, progressive things, but I don't remember him ever again pushing any big controversial thing that he was willing to die for."
Clinton and his supporters have long argued that these sorts of compromises were necessary in a chronically poor state like Arkansas, where the urgencies of economic growth necessitate concessions to business. The point is, to a degree, valid. But it is also true that early in his career Clinton began to garner a reputation in Arkansas that now besets him nationally, a reputation for slipperiness and waffling in excess of even the norm of politics. The nickname Slick Willie, originally made popular by the Arkansas columnist Paul Greenberg in 1982, passed into common usage among the Governor's critics on the right and the left and soon stuck with the public. Jokes about Clinton's honesty, about his predilection for saying whatever his listener of the moment wanted to hear, about his willingness to reverse himself, were common midway through his second term and grew steadily through his five terms as Governor.
One Clinton characteristic that attracted increasing critical attention was his readiness to do favors for current or potential financial supporters. There were two paradigmatic cases, both involving revenue bonds issued by the Arkansas Housing Development Agency and its 1985 successor, the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.
In 1989, the nation's largest nursing home company, Beverly Enterprises, was in deep financial trouble. The company, with more than 1,000 nursing homes in 40 states, had suffered crippling losses in 1988 and 1989, and had agreed to a restructuring requiring it to sell off some facilities to pay off its debt by 1991. The fate of Beverly was of intense interest to the Stephens family, whose brokerage house, Stephens Inc., held all of the company's preferred stock, worth approximately $100 million. Three Stephens appointees sat on Beverly's eight-member board, and the Stephenses also served as Beverly's well-paid financial advisers.
Beverly, guided by the Stephenses and the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Hillary Rodham Clinton had become a partner, put together a $149 million plan to sell off all of Beverly's nursing homes in four states. A Rose lawyer, William H. Kennedy 3d, served as counsel to Beverly in the matter. (Kennedy, who had joined Mrs. Clinton, Vincent Foster and Webster Hubbell to form a powerful clique at the firm, is currently serving as an associate White House counsel.) The deal worked out by Beverly, with advice from Stephens and the Rose firm, was precisely the sort of arrangement the future First Lady would have called a health care rip-off. It was designed to take advantage of a loophole in the 1986 Tax Reform Act by using government-issued bonds to finance the sale of Beverly's nursing homes to nonprofit "shell" companies that were, in fact, fronting for for-profit companies.
The first sale was completed in August 1989, when Beverly sold 45 nursing homes to a Texas investor named Bruce Whitehead. The deal, essentially a tax-exempt, leveraged buyout, was structured around a series of transactions that ended with Whitehead holding most of the homes in a nonprofit shell company called Care Initiatives. Whitehead put up no money in the deal; the creation of Care Initiatives (then Mercy Health Initiatives) was capitalized almost entirely through the issuance and sale of $86 million in tax-exempt bonds from the Iowa Finance Authority. Iowa courts later ruled that the entire transaction had been designed to generate "millions of dollars of excessive profits" for the principals in the transaction -- at the expense of Iowa taxpayers. All told, the courts found, the businessmen, lawyers and underwriters involved made in excess of $20 million, a profit that District Court Judge Gene L. Needles called "unconscionable."
The second deal put together by Beverly, the Stephenses and the Rose firm was a replication of the first, involving the same parties and structure. The only difference was that it was set up in Arkansas. Pride House Care Corporation of Dallas, another Whitehead concoction, would buy Beverly's 32 nursing homes or leases. The sale was to be financed by $81 million in revenue bonds issued by the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.
The Finance Authority's preliminary limited-offering memorandum describing the proposed bond issue made it embarrassingly clear that the state agency knew Whitehead's companies were nothing but shells. As the offering put it, Whitehead's Pride House Care "has no assets and has not acquired any facilities, nor does it operate any" and has "no current operations and therefore has no employees." The state justified the sale on the grounds that Arkansas could not afford to see Beverly collapse and that the large institutional investors who would finance the deal through their bond purchases would, in any case, bear all the risks. As was the case in Iowa, the proposed deal would greatly enrich those who fashioned it. Whitehead was to make an immediate $1.9 million profit, and lawyers and underwriters would make off with $6.4 million. The Finance Authority, presided over by its Clinton-appointed president, Robert Nash, had already tentatively approved the transaction when news reports began to raise serious questions.
Clinton, who, as Governor, had the power to stop the Finance Authority bond issue, remained silent through weeks of mounting public outrage. It was not until the Arkansas Attorney General, Steve Clark, announced that "a Beverly-Stephens Inc. representative" had offered him $100,000 in campaign contributions if he would end his opposition to the deal that Clinton urged the agency under his control to kill the bond issue. (The lobbyist maintained that his offer did not constitute a bribe, and Stephens denied any connection with the incident.)
Afterward, Clinton claimed he had opposed the deal from the beginning. Writing in his Arkansas Gazette column, John Brummett declared: "The Governor's assertion that he was against this proposal all along is false. The fact is that Clinton sat by as Nash and the board approved this deal Sept. 21 -- back when it contained those personal profits for Bruce Whitehead that the Governor now says are so obscene."
The second controversial Finance Authority-related affair centered on a well-known Little Rock figure named Dan Lasater. A flashy young millionaire -- at the age of 22, he had founded the Ponderosa Steakhouse chain -- Lasater, in 1980, opened a bond house that, within a year, was selling $1 billion worth of bonds a month. In the tradition of Witt Stephens, Lasater quickly made himself a prominent figure in local politics and society, contributing heavily to the campaigns of Governor Clinton and other politicians. In three consecutive Clinton gubernatorial campaigns, Lasater contributed thousands of dollars personally, and hosted fund-raising events that netted many thousands more. But the services did not stop there. Lasater provided Clinton use of his private jet and hired the Governor's famously unemployable brother, Roger, as his driver and stable hand. Once he even lent the Governor's brother $8,000 to pay off Roger's debt to his cocaine wholesalers.
In 1982, after strongly supporting the campaign that reseated Clinton in the Governor's office, Lasater and his partners asked to be included in Arkansas state bond issues. Clinton agreed. "They wanted to do some business, and I said I thought they ought to be able to compete for it," Clinton told U.S. News & World Report in 1982. The name of Lasater and Company first appeared as an underwriter of an Arkansas Housing Development Agency bond issue in 1983, after Clinton was sworn in for his second term.
Over the next three years, until Lasater was convicted of distributing cocaine in the fall of 1986 and served six months in prison, the company won assignments to co-manage 13 bond issues from the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, handling a total of $664 million worth of bonds, and received brokerage fees of $1.6 million.
As in the case of Beverly nursing homes, what is telling about the Lasater affair is Clinton's evident willingness to risk the reputation of his state and his Administration in order to benefit a powerful financial supporter. Dan Lasater was, to put it mildly, a known quantity in Little Rock. In the 80's, he was the king of the city's "bond daddies," hustlers who used high-pressure, dishonest sales tactics to peddle wildly overpriced and risky bond deals on the telephone, and who became so famous that they gave Little Rock a new nickname in financial circles: "Slam City," a term derived from the daddies' word for a successful hustle -- "slamming."
Lasater and Company was one of the most prominent of the bond daddy firms, with a downtown office where 72 salesmen worked the telephones from desks arranged in tiers around a central pit. There, Lasater hosted after-hours, high-rolling parties where cocaine was passed around on silver trays. "They were crooks pure and simple," said Vernon Giss, a longtime adviser to Witt Stephens at Stephens Inc. "They would sell bonds that had been defaulted, absolutely crooked stuff."
Warren Stephens, the president of Stephens Inc., is among the many in Little Rock who say Bill Clinton had full knowledge of Lasater's character but allowed him to win state business anyway. "You didn't even open the door to these places, 'cause of all the snakes down there," Stephens says. "These guys, these firms, smelled to high heaven."
Asked if he believes Lasater's campaign support and his helping Roger Clinton had anything to do with the Governor's failure to oppose Lasater, Stephens says dryly, "I would think they played a role in it, I would."
The criticism Governor Clinton faced over the Beverly and Lasater affairs were part of a larger pattern. One of the great paradoxes of Clinton's career is that during the years he was winning a national reputation as a courageous truth-teller -- particularly about the problems of Democratic politics and policies -- he was winning a reputation at home as someone who, as John Brummett writes in his forthcoming biography of Clinton, "Highwire," "seems to have an almost pathological inability to tell the whole truth."
Politics, in its own strange fashion, is an honest business. The rules of the game allow small lies of omission, waffling, fudging and any amount of hedging. But flat-out lying and acts of direct betrayal are much rarer than cynics believe, and greatly frowned upon. The survival of the system demands this. Every relationship in politics -- whether between voter and candidate or between lobbyist and elected official -- is based on the assumption that a bold statement of fact or an unhedged promise can be taken as true. And almost every statement or promise, from the back-room deal to the campaign pledge, is unwritten and therefore vulnerable. A politician who blatantly goes back on his word threatens the entire fragile structure, and is likely to be punished harshly. Consider the example of George Bush and his "read my lips" promise. Long-term successful politicians typically measure the consequences of their words, carefully couching the language of every pledge they make and deal they cut in the knowledge that no one ever forgets, and almost no one forgives, anything.
What became increasingly clear in Arkansas was that Clinton was different, blithely and flatly promising what he couldn't deliver, reversing himself on a position to which he had been, only moments before, firmly committed. It sometimes seemed he would say anything to win support, or even to get through a conversation without conflict, ignoring the consequences.
One famous evening in 1985, for example, the Governor vetoed a bill providing a tax credit for private contributions to Arkansas colleges and universities. After the bill, stamped "Disapproved," had been slipped under the door of the legislative clerk's office, Clinton called the state's university presidents to explain his decision. When they protested vehemently, the Governor sent a state trooper to retrieve the bill. With a coat hanger, the trooper fished the bill out from under the door and returned it to Clinton, who crossed out the prefix "Dis" and had the trooper return the bill to the clerk's office, now "approved." Later, after the bill caused the state unacceptable financial losses, as the Governor's advisers had warned, Clinton was forced to call a special session of the Legislature to amend it.
Of all the bonds of politics, the handshake deal made to insure the passage of legislation matters the most. As Governor, Bill Clinton quickly earned a reputation as someone who didn't understand that these agreements between professionals were inviolate. During the legislative battles to pass the 1983 education reform, J. Bill Becker, president of the Arkansas A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Brownie Ledbetter of the Arkansas Fairness Council, led a successful effort in the Arkansas House to block the 1-cent sales tax increase Clinton needed to finance his program, complaining it would hurt the poor and working class. The Governor then proposed a deal in which he asked that Becker and Ledbetter agree to drop their opposition in exchange for his support of an amendment offering a rebate to poor people for the sales tax they paid on groceries. "Bill called Becker and me in," recalls Ledbetter. "And he said, 'If you let me get this through the House with the low-income rebate on it, I'll help you in the Senate so the tax bill will come out in the end with the rebate attached.' So we did, and he shafted us. When it came to the Senate, the Governor's man on the bill made no effort at all." Clinton, speaking to reporters, explained that his promise to Becker and Ledbetter had been nothing more than "a 24-hour commitment." (In retrospect, Ledbetter says, it is clear that Clinton never had the power to effect Senate passage of the amendment but should not have made a commitment he couldn't meet.)
In 1983, Clinton said that the tax increase he was seeking for education reform would be earmarked entirely for primary and secondary schools. But after personal lobbying by Jim Blair, then chairman of the University of Arkansas board of trustees, Clinton peeled off a third of the allocation for higher education.
In 1987, Clinton promised several journalistic organizations that he would kill a bill that had been proposed to deny public access to previously available tax records, including those of the state's corporations. He then turned around and supported passage of the measure. Carol Griffee, an Arkansas reporter who was then regional director of the Society of Professional Journalists' Freedom of Information Committee, spoke openly of the "betrayal by the Governor."
By 1990, when Clinton ran for his fifth and final term as governor, his honesty had become an open issue. It was in this race that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president Becker memorably described Bill Clinton as a man "who will pat you on the back" and micturate down your leg.
The candidate found himself dogged by a well-founded suspicion that he would not serve out his four-year term if re-elected Governor, but would instead use the job as a platform from which to run for President in 1992 -- a move he had publicly considered in 1988 and for which he had been busy positioning himself with his work on the Democratic Leadership Council. In a televised debate, Craig Cannon, a reporter, asked Clinton a simple but encompassing question: "Will you guarantee to us that, if re-elected, there is absolutely, positively no way that you'll run for any other political office and that you'll serve out your term in full?"
This was exactly the sort of question that most politicians would have answered with an un-Shermanesque hedge: "I have no intentions of running for President. . . . I certainly am not planning to run for President."
But Clinton responded with a stunning lack of equivocation. "You bet," he said. "I told you when I announced for Governor I intended to run, and that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna serve four years. I made that decision when I decided to run. I'm being considered as a candidate for Governor. That's the job I want. That's the job I'll do for the next four years."
When a year later Bill Clinton announced his candidacy for President, not many in his home state were surprised. "He has always wanted to be President -- that was his whole idea in life, and Hillary's whole idea was to be Mrs. First Lady," says the veteran Little Rock liberal activist Edwin Dunaway. "He talked a good game and he had big ideas, but he never followed through. I fell out with Bill because he never followed through on anything. His word is no good."
The Newsweek writer Joe Klein recently quoted the President on the subject of character: "Character is a journey, not a destination." No, Klein responded, life is a journey; character is a destination reached by the actions of a life. What you are, by the time you are the President's age, is the cumulative result of all that you have done, all the thousands of decisions that build an adult. Bill Clinton's problem isn't merely that his past haunts him. It is that his past has made him what he is today.
But Clinton's definition of character reveals an essential truth about him. The President does still seem to be on a journey to maturity; he is a brilliant young man who has not quite arrived at a clear understanding of himself. It is as if, in the hard, ambivalent business of getting to where he is, he has somehow put off the business of who he is, of what he stands for and of what he will not stand for.
A line of consequence runs from The Draft to 'I Didn't Inhale' to Whitewater to Hillary's Commodities to Dan Lasater to Lani Guinier to Somalia to Bosnia to Haiti: the episodes of rationalization and compromise from Clinton's Arkansas past are the progenitors of the indecision and betrayal that have done so much damage to the White House present. Bill Clinton is today, as he was 20 years ago, clearly concerned with doing the right thing, and his Presidency still holds some of the promise that stirred so many Americans to such hope in 1992. But there is a hollowness to the Clinton Presidency, a sense that it lacks a center because the man at its center lacks one of his own.
No one is surprised any more when the President reverses himself on a matter of policy, or breaks a promise, or axes an old friend. In both houses of Congress, controlled by Clinton's own party, there is a nearly collective assumption that the President's stated intention on a policy or a piece of legislation is not to be taken as his final word; the legislators all remember how the White House whipped Democratic House members into line to vote for the unpopular B.T.U. energy tax in 1993, and then dropped it when it encountered strong resistance in the Senate Finance Committee. After the Administration's flip-flops on Haiti, Bosnia, Somalia and China, the conventional diplomatic wisdom is that the pledges of the President of the United States are to be regarded more as well-meaning sentiments than actual commitments.
The President is a ubiquitous electronic presence, always on the go and on the tube, in some vivid new tableau that is a masterwork of the campaigner's art. But the scenes that Clinton so brilliantly conjures seem more and more disconnected from the realities of his actions. The President evokes the memories of World War II to warn against the dangers of appeasement, isolationism and cowardice while his Administration declines to call the slaughter in Rwanda "genocide," for fear such honesty would force America to do something to stop it. The President denounces the influence of big-money special interests in politics while the Democratic National Committee, under his de facto control, raises $40 million in "soft money" contributions from the rich, corporations and unions.
Two contrasting events from the Clinton Presidency perfectly capture the disunity of the man's character:
On Nov. 13, the President delivered a passionate and, in part, extemporaneous address to a group of black ministers in Memphis. He asked them to imagine Martin Luther King Jr. suddenly appearing by his side on stage, to issue a report card on the progress of black America over the last 25 years.
King would tell the ministers, Clinton said, that they had done a good job in creating a large black middle class: "But he would say: 'I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others. That is not what I came here to do. . . . I fought for people to have the right to work, but not to have whole communities and people abandoned. This is not what I lived and died for.' "
Seven months later, Bill Clinton walked on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, with three veterans of the bloody D-Day battle that had been fought there. The walk had been planned by the President's media advisers as part of an overall attempt to reshape the President's image as Commander in Chief, a mantle that had never rested comfortably on his shoulders. The event, staged as carefully as a small movie, was duly noted in the White House press schedule of the day: "6:15 C.E.T. President Clinton visits Omaha Beach with the American veterans of that beach. Note: no remarks are planned during this walk."
The President and the three men who had fought on the beach walked slowly along, talking in hushed tones among themselves, as a dozen or so photographers and television cameramen walked backward in front of them, recording the scene. After a few minutes, White House aides pulled the veterans off to one side, so that the President could continue his beach walk in Kennedy-esque solitude. At a certain point, where some beach stones had been gathered into a small pile to form a marker, the President stopped, and the photographers took up their positions so that he was nicely framed by the hulks of the old warships in the sea behind him.
The President stood for a moment, staring silently out to sea. Then he knelt down, his knees not quite touching the ground, in a pose that suggested worship. He reached for the pile of stones in front of him and slowly began rearranging them into the shape of a cross. A journalist who was there watching the scene recalls "getting that sick feeling you get sometimes with him, thinking 'Oh God, please don't do this.' "
As the cameras clicked and rolled, the President bowed his head as if to pray. Later, White House aides said the moment of silence had been planned, but that the cross of stones had been entirely the President's own idea.
The problem with Bill Clinton is that the same man is capable of playing both of these scenes. He is capable of delivering, as he did to the ministers, a message of breathtaking clarity, candor and courage. And when he does, it is impossible to doubt that he believes utterly in what he is doing. He is equally capable of kneeling on a beach where 2,000 American men were slaughtered and acting out an intimate communion with God in front of a platoon of cameras. And when he does this, it is also impossible to doubt that he believes utterly in what he is doing.
A former friend says, bitterly, that Clinton has become "a performer of empathy." The President's face is a screen upon which plays a loop of expressions that have become insistently familiar: the open-mouthed grin of joyous wonder; the scowl of righteous but controlled anger; the lip-biting, eyes-lowered glance of pondering humility, the near-tears of a man who is not afraid to show that he feels. In an important sense, these expressions are entirely honest; Clinton's empathy is wholly real. But it exists only in the moment. The President's essential character flaw isn't dishonesty so much as a-honesty. It isn't that Clinton means to say things that are not true, or that he cannot make true, but that everything is true for him when he says it, because he says it. Clinton means what he says when he says it, but tomorrow he will mean what he says when he says the opposite. He is the existential President, living with absolute sincerity in the passing moment.

Blacklist: Memories of a Word That Marks an Era

 BODY:
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE cold war in the 1940's and 50's and increasing anti-Communist sentiment in the United States, the House Un-American Activities Committee, set up in 1945 as a standing committee, carried on Government investigations of Americans suspected of being Communists or of having sympathy with the Soviet Union. The entertainment industry, especially in Hollywood, and unions were major targets of hearings that began in 1947.
Ultimately, 10 blacklisted screenwriters, directors and producers were imprisoned for their refusal to answer questions from the committee. Along with this group, known as the Hollywood 10, several hundred others in the movie industry lost their jobs for actual or suspected Communist affiliation. While television and radio also felt the committee's influence, the New York theater world seemed to be affected least. 
 A current exhibit about the period that focuses on theater, television, radio, concerts and nightclubs -- "The House I Live In: American Performance in the Era of Blacklisting" -- is on view through Aug. 27 at the Vincent Astor Gallery at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
As part of the exhibit, five people whose lives were forever changed by the hearings and the blacklist, talked about their experiences at a symposium at the library, moderated by its executive director, Robert Marx. The participants in "Remembering the Blacklist" were the author and screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr.; Frances Chaney, an actress who is married to Mr. Lardner; Merle Debuskey, a theatrical publicist; Madeline Lee Gilford, an actress and the widow of the actor Jack Gilford, and the actress Kim Hunter. Here are adapted excerpts from the symposium.
 
RING LARDNER JR.: In 1947, 19 of us were subpoenaed to appear before the committee. We discussed among ourselves the various alternatives we had and determined that the choices were not very good. If you were not a Communist, you could say no to that question but you would be acknowledging the committee's right to ask the question. If you were a Communist and said yes, the next question was all about who else was, and asking you to name names where you had even less constitutional protection than about yourself.
We went to Washington. We appeared before the committee, which included a new Congressman, Richard Nixon, and the chairman of the committee, J. Parnell Thomas, Republican of New Jersey, with whom I later became reacquainted when I went to the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn., where he was already an inmate, having meanwhile been convicted of misappropriating Government funds. Ten of the 19 of us did appear before the committee. We did take the attitude that they had no right to ask these questions. We were all cited for contempt. We did lose the case in the courts and were convicted.
A month after the hearings, the heads of the motion picture companies met in New York and decided that they would fire any of us who were working -- five of us were at the time -- and not hire any of us until we cleared ourselves. And so we became the first blacklisted people of several hundred more in Hollywood and in New York in radio and television.
 
FRANCES CHANEY: At a very young age I was marching in a May Day parade. And that's when my career as a leftist began. After that came the Spanish Civil War. All of the young people I knew were terribly involved in what had happened in Spain. And then before we knew it, Jews were being incarcerated in Germany and we began hearing all about that.
Many of us had our leftist leanings strengthened by the events in the world. They were already fairly strong because before all this we had gone through a very terrible Depression in our country. So young people in those days marched under banners that said "Black and white, unite and fight" and "We want scholarships, not battleships." The world was very clear: you were either bad or good. You were either pro-working-class or you were against them. And we understood that.
In 1946 I married Ring Lardner Jr. and he was blacklisted. And everybody assumed poor Frances, she never would have been blacklisted if it hadn't been that she married Ring. Not true.
When Ring and I came to New York in 1954, I was determined that I could work. I kept saying: Blacklist or no blacklist, I'm going to get a job and, by God, I did. I got a lead on the Philco Playhouse in 1954. And then Paddy Chayefsky, who had written that script, wrote another script with me in mind. And I was called to please come in and talk salary. And then the phone calls started. And somehow or other this whole thing dissolved. And it dissolved with a program called "Marty." And that was 1954 or maybe 1955 by then. And I didn't have a nighttime television show again until 1963.
 
MADELINE LEE GILFORD: I not only had a dossier from the time I was around 14, but my parents were very active socialists and pacifists and my father was a terrific union member. They were immigrants and very proud of the union tradition. From the time I was a child actress I was involved in Equity and then the American Federation of Radio Artists, which preceded the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). It was a very exciting time. You were proud of being invited to participate in benefits, concerts, plays with ideals about bettering things for the greater good. Here was a profession in which you were supposed to be egocentric and self-seeking and instead they were people of good will who banded together.
As we got blacklisted, we laughed at it. We thought it was ridiculous. New York, unlike Hollywood, was not a company town, so it was almost never implemented in theater because the people who were in theater -- Kermit Bloomgarden, Arthur Miller, Herman Shumlin and Lillian Hellman -- they were almost as blacklisted as we were, certainly in Hollywood.
 
MERLE DEBUSKEY: Unlike the others here, I don't know if I was blacklisted. I also don't know if I was not blacklisted. But what I do know is I should have been blacklisted.
Wondering how come nothing bad happened to me, I went to get my records under the Freedom of Information Act. And this is one of quite a number of sheets that came back [see photograph on page 3]. And this is under the Freedom of Information Act. So I had my lawyer appeal and asked again. And we got back a rejection based on the fact that this information was in the interest of national defense.
There was absolutely nothing that came out of this except exploitation. No plot was unfolded. It was a hollow drum that was being beat, and beat loudly, which gave rise to headlines. Nothing happened. The whole thing was a hoax. And the First Amendment, which had been in existence since the creation of this Government and was one of the great documents in the history of man, was diminished. And the right of people to have their political convictions and not have to reveal them if they didn't wish to do so was destroyed.
There are reasons why the theater was not subject to the rigors of the blacklist as was television and radio and Hollywood. It was never an industry as one would imagine Hollywood as being an industry. The theater always was made up of some of the strangest bedfellows you can imagine. In one year I represented Mike Todd, Cheryl Crawford and Arthur Laurents, I think it was. If you put them in one room and told them to agree on anything, you were wasting your time. Except they had one thing in common: all of them were not going to let anyone tell them what to do. That's what the greater part of Broadway was. They were not subject to an industry fear of anything, except the Times review. So it was really difficult to come down on them in a fashion that would inhibit them and their choices.
I represented many shows that did have people in them who were blacklisted. I think that the theater was probably the last refuge for people who could no longer work in film or television or radio.
 
KIM HUNTER: What started it for me was that when I was in "A Streetcar Named Desire" in 1949 I got a thing in the mail, at the Barrymore Theater, asking me if I would become one of the sponsors of a world peace conference at the Waldorf Hotel sponsored by the National Council for the Arts, Sciences and Professions. They were bringing people from all over the world -- in 1949, the cold-war era, it wasn't easy -- to come and share opinions and see if we couldn't figure out a way to somehow clear up this cold-war problem. I agreed to do it. I thought it was a good idea. But I learned later that they noticed that and said uh-oh, watch out for that one.
Gradually it became sort of clear. I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then finally it was NBC, and then by the time I won my Oscar for the movie of "Streetcar" I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.
I was curious about it, wondering: Am I making this up? Is it happening to me? And why should it? I went to Bill Dozier, who was one of the executive producers at CBS, and said, "Am I dreaming it? Can you hire me here at CBS?" And he said, "No, Kim, we cannot." And I said, "Is there anything you can do about it?" And he said, "No, I'm sorry, my hands are absolutely tied."
I went to AFTRA and they said talk to the F.B.I. So I called the F.B.I. and they came to my apartment and said: "You have no problem as far as we're concerned with your Government, with the country. You're not anti-American. But we think you have a problem with your union." What that really meant was the unions not fighting the pressure on the sponsors.
 
MADELINE LEE GILFORD: You have no idea of the impact on personal lives, on families. Divorces, suicides, illnesses, heart attacks. That impact, because people were not working, was the price we paid. And there was a lot of anti-Semitism underlying a great deal of this blacklist.
The F.B.I. followed me the first Tuesday of every month; this was the 1950's. How did I know it? The superintendent had a son in jail for armed robbery and she hated the F.B.I. So she considered us in trouble the same way she was. She would tell us that they would come on the first Tuesday: "They've been here. They wanted to look in your garbage. They wanted to look at the mail that has been thrown out."
I had to walk my daughter to school because Jack would be working somewhere in the theater and he would be sleeping in the morning. One of these cold windy days in January, the two F.B.I. guys were in their thin raincoats and their hats. So I said, "O.K., I'm going to give them a run for their money."
I had gained 45 pounds with my last pregnancy and had gotten a huge blue fuzzy coat in a thrift shop that made me look like a giant navy blue bear. It was early January -- Sam Gilford was born Jan. 17 -- and it was terribly cold. I couldn't tie my shoelaces, so I don't know how they thought I was going to overthrow the Government. Anyway, they went to school with me and then I decided to swing around Washington Square Park.
It was Alger Hiss's first day in Washington Square Park, with his son, Tony. He had just gotten out of jail. I didn't know him, but I knew what he looked like, so I said, "Oh, I think I'll give the F.B.I. something to write about."
And I went up to him -- they couldn't hear what I was saying -- and I said: "Mr. Hiss, I'm Madeline Lee Gilford. I'm Jack Gilford's wife." Oh, yes, he knew him. And he was tall and thin and handsome in the cold. And I wanted to chat with him long enough so that they would think that I had a date to meet him in the park away from phone taps. And I said, "I want to welcome you back to the Village, and may I kiss you?" So I kissed Alger Hiss in Washington Square Park. And I sent for my file under the Freedom of Information Act but so much of it is blacked out I don't even know.
 
RING LARDNER JR.: I don't think there is any danger of the kind of blacklist that existed then on political grounds. But there certainly is a great threat of censorship today. The people behind it are basically the fundamentalists, the Christian right, and I think the First Amendment is being threatened in a great many ways from this censorship effort. The same sort of struggle may emerge.
 
MERLE DEBUSKEY: I have no conviction whatsoever that it won't happen the day after tomorrow. Things happen and they happen very quickly. I'm still in shock about how the most recent ex-President to be buried was buried with full honors. I don't know how long ago or how long after the blacklist Nixon was still around with his hit list. There was an enemies list. Which is no different than a blacklist.
I have no conviction that something analogous couldn't occur once again because the root of it is that if you challenge the economic security of the Hollywood studios or the networks, they will turn in a second. So it's important that we have assemblages like this.

Fall Events in Mexico
Q. I am planning a fall trip to Mexico's colonial cities of Guanajuato, Queretaro, San Miguel de Allende and San Luis Potosi. Can you tell me of any interesting events during October or November? -- Louise Lander, New York, N.Y. 
 A. Your timing seems to be good; several events are taking place then.
In Guanajuato, the 22d annual International Cervantino Festival will take place Oct. 5 to 23 and will feature art exhibits, dances, concerts and films. This year's performers include the Kiev Ballet and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.
Organizers are expecting over 1,400 performers and artists from 33 different countries to participate, and urge anyone interested in attending to make hotel reservations and buy tickets as far ahead as possible. Tickets range from about $3 to $27, figured at a rate of 3.3 pesos to the United States dollar. For more information write to: The International Cervantino Festival, 273 Alvaro Obregon, Cuarto Piso, Colonia Roma, 06700, Mexico D.F.; telephone 533-4121 in Mexico City or 209-59 in Guanajuato. (The country code for dialing Mexico is 52; the local code for Mexico City is 5, for Guanajuato 473.) Closer to the festival date tickets may be bought through TicketMaster in Mexico City; telephone 325-9000.
A festival celebrating the patron saint of San Miguel de Allende will be held there in late September and early October. St. Michael's Day is Sept. 29 this year; festivities will run into the weekend of Oct. 1 and 2, centered around the plaza and the cathedral, and will include bullfights, fireworks, religious processions and dances. No tickets are needed, but hotel reservations are recommended.
On Nov. 1 and 2, all of Mexico celebrates the Day of the Dead by erecting shrines and visiting cemeteries. Nov. 20 is Revolution Day in Mexico; there are parades of students and athletes in many larger cities (including San Luis Potosi) to celebrate the Mexican Revolution.
 
Cultural Tours of Greece
Q. I am interested in joining an educational tour group planning a trip to Greece next spring. Can you provide information about such groups? A tour geared to older travelers would be fine. -- Mrs. David M. Goldring, Red Bank, N.J.
A. There are abundant educational tours of Greece. Here are a few that are planned for next spring:
Classical Cruises, which arranges voyages with sponsoring educational institutions, has an Undiscovered Greek Islands cruise, co-sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, April 30 to May 13, starting at $6,845 a person, based on double occupancy, on the all-suite Queen Odyssey (the former Royal Viking Queen). The itinerary includes Athens, Nauplia, Seriphos, Siphnos, Naxos, Amorgos, Astypalaia, Leros, Patmos, Chios, Skopelos, Thasos and Samothrace. The guest lecturer has not yet been confirmed.
Classical Cruises, 132 East 70th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021; (212) 794-3200 or (800) 252-7745.
Elderhostel, a nonprofit educational organization based in Boston, runs programs for travelers 60 and older combining classwork with field trips; there are about 20 trips to Greece departing from March to May. Accommodations are generally in modest local hotels with private baths.
Elderhostel's 18-night Ancient World of Greece program, in cooperation with the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, visits major sites in the capital, Eleusis, Corinth, the island of Aegina, Nauplia, Mycenae, Epidaurus and Crete. The price of $3,080 a person, double occupancy, includes air fare from New York, room and board. There are several departure dates, including April 7.
Some Elderhostel programs combine land tours with study cruises on topics such as Aegean Civilization and the Greek Island Society. The cruises are on air-conditioned motor-powered sailboats averaging 116 feet in length. The double-occupancy cabins have private baths.
For example, a package combining a week's study tour focusing on Greek Philosophy, based at the Hellenic American Union in Athens, with a week's Aegean Civilization cruise, departs April 6 and costs $3,501.
Elderhostel is at 75 Federal Street, Boston, Mass. 02110; (617) 426-7788. Mail queries are preferred; specify international or domestic catalog.
Interhostel, a travel-study program for adults over 50 sponsored by the University of New Hampshire Division of Continuing Education, is planning to repeat this year's Athens and the Greek Islands tour from May 10 to 24, 1995, in cooperation with the American College of Greece, Deree Campus. The 1995 price has not yet been set, but it is expected to be higher than this year's rate of $3,295 a person, which included round-trip flights from New York.
In Athens, the group will stay in dormitories at the American College, about three miles from the city center. Shared bathrooms are on each floor. In addition to sightseeing while based in Athens, the tour also includes a three-day stay on the Aegean islands of Mykonos and Delos. Ancient Greek culture, modern history, economics, philosophy, music and dance will be among the study topics.
Interhostel: University of New Hampshire Division of Continuing Education, 6 Garrison Avenue, Durham, N.H. 03824; (603) 862-1147.
 
Downtown Digs in Manhattan
Q. My son lives in TriBeCa and when I visit I've been unable to find a place to stay in the area. Do you know of a nice hotel or bed-and-breakfast that would be convenient to Chambers Street, preferably within walking distance? -- Judith Hietter, Atherton, Calif.
A. There are several large hotels in the neighborhood that cater to business travelers in the financial district; you may be able to get a good discount on weekends.
Millenium Hilton, 55 Church Street, (212) 693-2001 or (800) 835-2220; fax (212) 571-2316.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Mexico Moves to Limit Projects Along Its Coast

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
AFTER 20 years of favoring big developments like Cancun that gobble up miles of coastline and pave over thousands of acres of sensitive wetlands, the Mexican Government is trying to switch directions and limit what can be built on the beach.
A new accord among federal, state and local governments reached in June will drastically curtail building on the 60 miles of coast from the high-rise hotels and chain restaurants of Cancun down to the 1,000-year-old walled city of Tulum. 
 Until recently, the Cancun-Tulum corridor, with its unspoiled white sand beaches, was probably under more development pressure than any other area on Mexico's long coasts, though to some extent the situation is similar at the tip of Baja California and nearly all Mexican beach resorts. Putting the brakes on development between Cancun and Tulum sent a strong message that Mexico has recognized the tradeoffs that come with commercially successful -- but environmentally disastrous -- projects like Cancun, where the construction of 120 hotels in 20 years has obliterated sand dunes, contaminated a large lagoon and led to the disappearance of large numbers of fish and shellfish just offshore.
"The new law clearly represents the need to control tourism development and avoid the excesses, to reduce the deterioration of the environment and to try to preserve as much as possible the natural resources of the area," said Jesus Silva Herzog, Mexico's Secretary of Tourism. "It's an accord I would consider historic."
Investors might consider it differently. The new law on development comes just as Mexico is trying to attract foreign capital with a new foreign-investment law that liberalizes land purchases on the coast, and the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which brings the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States closer. But Mr. Silva Herzog said it was necessary to do something before the very attributes that attract tourists were lost. "Some developers have been planning to build at much higher densities than this ordinance allows and now they're going to have to reduce their densities and probably redesign their projects," he said. "This might make the projects less attractive financially but they'll have greater respect for the environment."
For a long time, Cancun was considered the benchmark of Mexico's modern, computer-guided approach to developing tourism. Before 1973, when officials put data on climate, water temperature and beach conditions into a computer and hit on Cancun as the place to build a huge new tourist mecca, that far-eastern part of Mexico was largely uninhabited and almost totally unknown. In 1970, the population of what was then the territory of Quintana Roo -- it became a state in 1974 -- was only 8,850.
With Government assistance, more than 115 hotels have been built in Cancun, and now there are more than 250,000 permanent residents just in the resort. More than 1.5 million tourists a year visit, making it Mexico's most popular tourist destination.
Perched dramatically on a seaside cliff, Tulum is now the most visited site in the Maya world, receiving more than one million tourists a year. Tour buses from Cancun pass through the corridor, presenting developers an irresistible target. Already, the narrow two-lane highway cuts through areas pockmarked by failed housing developments and a few attractions like Xcaret, a water park with an underground river.
Some critics have long seen Cancun's success as excess and fought against the spread of megadevelopments. Homero Aridjis, head of the Group of 100, one of Mexico's leading conservation organizations, said the corridor is a natural breeding area for marine turtles and other rare species. The organization tried through much of 1993 to convince President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that allowing intense development in the corridor would undo previous laws he had signed to protect the turtles there. "It would turn the coast into a concrete paradise," Mr. Aridjis said, "and turn away precisely those tourists Mexico is trying to attract."
Mr. Salinas signed the agreement limiting development on June 5. Essentially it establishes 45 zones along the Cancun-Tulum corridor, from development areas with densities of from 5 to 25 rooms per acre, less than half of that allowed in Cancun, to a couple of conservation zones inland and right on the beach, especially in the area around Tulum, in which nothing can be built.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Brooklyn Paramount;
Once a Rococo Palace, Now a Citadel of Learning

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
A MODERN axiom is that the movie palace of the 1920's has vanished. But many survive -- as performance halls, as churches, as multiplexes and, at the Long Island University campus in downtown Brooklyn, as a basketball court.
Now, after three decades of ad-hoc alterations to the 4,124-seat Brooklyn Paramount, the university is beginning a $5 million program designed to finally change a palace for fantasy into one for learning. 
 It was in the 20's that the movies finally overwhelmed the older, traditional uses of the theater building, as the growing film conglomerates developed into businesses of national scope. Earlier theaters had often aimed towards an individual elegance, often reflecting the personality of a particular producer or star, but the 20's movie palace was a corporate affair, designed with no less calculation than a Disney project.
Although the interior formula was almost always rococo or Renaissance, the basis of the movie palace was very modern economic engineering, selling the maximum number of tickets to the maximum number of people, and processing them with peak efficiency. Cost per seat, location analysis and orchestra overtime were of far greater concern to architects than the gilt and velvet that the patrons saw.
Paramount Pictures was one of the new conglomerates, formed in 1916 by the rivals Jesse Lasky and Adolph Zukor who, by the 20's, controlled an empire of motion picture production, distribution and exhibition.
Unlike, Loews, its chief rival, Paramount favored building combination theater and office buildings, like the 1926 Paramount Building it built in Times Square.
In 1928 Paramount built a new theater/ office building at the corner of DeKalb Avenue and the Flatbush Avenue Extension, designed by the Chicago theater architects Rapp & Rapp. This was Brooklyn's theater district; A.D. Buttler, a theater photographer and archivist, estimates that, with the new Paramount, there were 25,000 seats within a few blocks.
The exterior of the building is not much, a factory-style facade of buff brick, where the huge signs and marquees once constituted the only real decoration.
THE interior followed most of the conventions of movie palace design: a giant, rectangular "grand foyer" 147 feet long and 42 feet high, leading to the auditorium and also to the many lounge and ancillary spaces that served the huge crowds.
There is mild variation in the styles of the still existing lounge areas -- ranging from Renaissance to Art Deco -- but the auditorium is in a rococo both more ostentatious and effective than usual.
The theater opened Thanksgiving week in 1928, with "Manhattan Cocktail" starring Richard Arlen. At the same time the Brooklyn & Manhattan Rapid Transit Company -- which built the subway line known as the BMT -- was moving into 8 floors of the adjacent 11-story office building.
Perhaps it was bad timing to build just before the Depression, or bad strategy to throw another few thousand seats into a sea of velvet, but in the 1930's the theater closed on at least one occasion, and in 1936 The New York Times reported that the Brooklyn Paramount had lost $1.5 million since its opening.
But it continued operating, later offering stage shows with Little Richard and other rock 'n' roll acts. Long Island University bought the building in 1950 and took over the office space for classes and administration. But the Paramount remained open, and in 1959 announced a modernization plan that included "streamlining" the theater.
This did not go through, and in 1963 Long Island University took over the auditorium for a gym.
In two stages, the projecting balcony and box seats have been cut back, and now the basketball team plays in what is one of the few, if not the only, gilt, rococo-style college athletic facilities in the country.
At the same time the steep, upper balcony was walled in and converted to lecture halls, and the college sprinkled what other uses it could throughout the building. But the wide, long corridors and the huge stairways meant to accommodate a single rush of 4,000 moviegoers represents a considerable loss of usable space.
This summer the university, working from plans by Mitchell/Giurgola Architects, begins a more methodical reworking of the spaces. One of the wide banks of stairs has already been cut out to accommodate a third floor walkway, part of a network the university hopes will unify its broken, urban site.
The surviving lounges downstairs will be spiffed up and the wide hallways ringing the back of the balcony will be converted to student clubrooms. The ticket and entry area at the corner will be converted to a cafeteria. And the grand foyer will become a combination eating-studying area, with quiet-study areas along the sides.
In a later phase, the university will have its name in lights, much plainer this time, with a single sign running eight floors to the top of the 11-story building.

LIVELY STREETS OF SONO
It has been 18 years since the first SoNo Arts Celebration was held on Washington Street in South Norwalk. Growing annually and spreading to neighboring streets, it attracted more than 80,000 visitors last summer, with more than that expected this weekend. Washington Street will be closed to traffic during that time.
More than 25 performance groups will keep the music, dance and storytelling flowing continuously, free of charge. The festivities begin on Friday at 6:30 with a parade of antique automobiles and music of the silent screen era, starting at the Maritime Center on North Water Street, proceeding up Washington Street to the SoNo Cinema where the Silvermine Guild of Artists Moving Image Society has scheduled a silent film fest at 7 P.M. The guild has also provided a selection of films and videos produced by emerging comedy talents, to be shown on Saturday at 1:30 and on Sunday at 11:45 A.M. and 1 P.M. Free tickets are available today at 29 South Main Street. 
 More than 200 artists will exhibit their work in a sidewalk show stretching across four or five blocks, and SoNo's many art galleries will be open as well. Festival hours on Saturday are 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. and on Sunday, noon to 6 P.M. A dance party will take place under the stars from 8:30 to 11:30 Saturday night with live music from Milo Z and EO, Funk and original pop-rock ensembles.
The Kinetic Sculpture Race, the festival's most popular attraction, will begin at noon on Saturday. Artists who create the weird contraptions must propel them over a one-mile course through South Norwalk Streets by any human-powered means, vying for prizes totaling $1,400.
Children will have their own section for innovative hands-on art projects, entertainment, and a puppet parade at 4 P.M. Saturday. Food will be plentiful and varied, and the soon-to-open New England Brewery and Restaurant on Marshall Street will conduct preview tours and tastings of their brews on Saturday and Sunday at 1, 3, and 5 P.M.
For more information call 866-7916.
 
DISHING UP THE PAST
 A four-day festival featuring foods from America's past will begin on Thursday at Mystic Seaport. Each day from 11:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. the costumed staff will dish up 19th-century recipes in various locations on the 17-acre grounds of the riverside maritime village.
For example, a meat and vegetable stew called scouse can be sampled on board ship, where it was once served to the seamen, while a proper afternoon tea will be available in the parlor of one of the cottages. Blueberry pudding, molasses cream cake, corn soup, fish chowder, smoked ham, bread and freshly made ice cream are among the many other dishes. Visitors may also try the clams, shucked to order and slurped from the half-shell. Foods range in price from $1 to $4, and can be washed down with a variety of beverages including beer and wine.
All the tall ships, shipbuilding workshops, craft shops, village houses and the planetarium will be open, with children's games and outdoor activities on offer. Admission is $15, $7.50 for children over the age of 5. Tickets may be validated for returning the next day in order to see all there is to see. For more information, 572-5315.
 
KENTUCKY FOLK WORKS
 Minnie Adkins, a recent recipient of the Folk Art Society of America's Annual Award of Distinction, makes her living by carving, painting and selling sculptures of animals made from rough-hewn logs supplied by her husband, Garland. Along with the work of a dozen or so other self-taught artists from the Kentucky mountains, her sculptures may be seen in "Kentucky Folk Artists," opening today at the Silo in New Milford, and remaining through Aug. 28.
Primitive acrylic paintings of detailed rural scenes by Janice Harding Owens, and large wood carvings of Uncle Sam and Santa Claus by her husband, Ron, will also be on display. The Owens and their seven children are making their first trip out of Kentucky to attend the opening today from 1 to 3 P.M.
Handmade quilts, walking sticks, textiles, watercolors, oils and a wide variety of wood carvings make up the more than 60 items that will be sold for prices ranging from $100 to $2,000.
The Silo, at 44 Upland Road, is open daily from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and the phone number for directions or more information is 355-0300.
 
AGGIES' OPEN HOUSE
 Willam W. Ginsberg, Assistant Secretary for Economic Development at the Federal Department of Commerce, will deliver the principal lecture at the annual Plant Science Day in Hamden on Wednesday.
Each year the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station holds an open house, free to the public, during which pertinent issues for Connecticut growers, scientists and backyard gardeners are explored. The session will be held at Lockwood Farm, Kenwood and Evergreen Avenues in the Mount Carmel section, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.
A sampling of talks by several experts in various fields, and barn exhibits, includes mosquito-borne viruses in the state, growing healthy pumpkins, understanding dogwood diseases, improving plants by genetic manipulation, reducing tick-bite risk and new crop technologies.
Among the field experiments to be viewed with the guidance of maps are tick and lyme disease, potatoes, compost, rhododendrons, bees, chestnut trees, eggplants, asparagus and many other plants and vegetables.
Shuttle buses are provided for tours of the plots, walking tours will be scheduled, and sandwiches are available for those who do not bring lunch. Coffee, punch and parking are free. Call 789-7272 for more information.
 
OLD LYME FEST
 The 1994 edition of Old Lyme's midsummer festival opens next weekend. Art and music are featured, beginning with a free concert of George Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein music on Friday at 7 P.M. on the lawn of the Florence Griswold Museum.
The museum, designated a National Historic Landmark last fall, was a favorite summer haunt of many American Impressionist painters during the late 19th and early 20th century. Artists are invited to recreate that scene on Saturday by taking their equipment to the site and painting whatever appeals to them.
A walking tour of Lyme Street will step off from Town Hall on Saturday at 10 A.M., and a tour of William Chadwick's studio begins at 2:30. Maritime crafts will be demonstrated on the museum's front lawn by the Connecticut River Museum, including paddle- and sailboat-building, marlinspike seamanship and uses of 19th-century shipbuilding tools.
Nearby, at the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts, the 93d annual Summer Juried Exhibition will be in progress on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sunday from 10 to 4:30, along with a sale of artwork by alumni and students.
From 1 to 1:45 on Saturday children will be entertained with stories presented by the National Theater of the Deaf, and at 3 P.M., an all-Mozart concert will be performed with an ensemble of pianists, string instrumentalists and vocalists. Tickets are $12. A second concert, of works by Alban Berg, Samuel Barber, Glazounov, Beethoven and Haydn, is scheduled on Sunday at 5 P.M., when admission will be $15.
Sales of homemade foods, toys and children's clothes as well as pony rides and a barnyard of goats, rabbits and miniature horses are some of the other features. For concert tickets call 434-0131; for more information call 434-7802 or 434-5542. ELEANOR CHARLES

Inventories Are Rising for the Right Reasons

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
JUST in time is justly starting to vanish.
That is probably the real meaning of the bulge in business inventories that has left economists shaking their heads, and that on Friday sent bond prices soaring. 
 The Government's first estimate of economic growth in the second quarter showed surprisingly slow final demand, and a big surge in inventories. One way to look at that -- the traditional way -- is to suspect that falling demand has caught businesses by surprise, leaving them with mounds of unsold products. If so, then one can expect a slowing economy as production is cut while all that inventory is worked off.
But there is another explanation. The era of "just-in-time" inventories, in which everyone from manufacturers to retailers kept as little inventory on hand as possible, may be coming to an end. That fad was based on the assumption that more could always be ordered, and quickly delivered, and that the price for such new inventory was likely to be no higher than the price of the old. If those assumptions are true, then why would anyone want to tie up good money in inventory?
The trouble is that the mini-boom of last winter exposed the wishful nature of the theory. There have been shortages, and rapid price hikes, in some commodities. Some companies have been unable to meet demand for their products. Suddenly, higher inventories seem to be prudent.
At the same time, companies that were having trouble meeting demand chose to raise prices, particularly in consumer products. Inflation in the second quarter is estimated at 3.2 percent a year, or twice what it was in the third quarter of 1993, before the surge in growth that surprised everyone and helped send the bond market into a panic.
Thus both the inflation and inventory figures can be read as indications that businesses saw signs of economic strength -- not weakness. Some may have overreacted, but the probability is that business is better than was indicated by the figure in Friday's report that so encouraged the bond market -- that final sales of domestic products grew at a slow 1.5 percent rate in the second quarter. There is a good chance those sales will rebound in this quarter.
The stock market in 1994 has had to deal with two big negatives: rising interest rates and some fears that those rates would shut down the recovery. Perhaps it is remarkable not that stock prices suffered but that they fell so little, with the Dow keeping its maximum decline under 10 percent. A big reason is that mutual fund investors plowed more into American stock funds in the first half of this year -- $43 billion -- than they had in the last half of 1993.
If the above analysis is accurate, it is quite possible that the bulls will be vindicated as it becomes clear that the Federal Reserve's moves to tighten credit are not threatening a new recession. If the perception spreads that interest rates will stop rising while the economy stays healthy, a new surge in the stock market could follow.

In Mexico, a Case of Political Jitters

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
UNCERTAINTY is getting to be an unwelcome economic fixture here. Last week offered a mirror image of last year. Through most of 1993, Mexico's stock exchange and money market were whipsawed by the changing fortunes of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had so much riding on passage of the pact that when any obstacles arose, the Mexican stock exchange plummeted. The more likely approval seemed, the more spirited was trading on the floor of the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. 
 Mexico's economy now has another case of the jitters, caused this time by a nightmarish collection of political problems leading up to the Aug. 21 Presidential election and the possibility that for the first time in 65 years the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (known as PRI) could lose power.
The Bolsa's week began with the kind of upswing that set analysts to presenting rosy scenarios and buy recommendations. A dip Thursday was cause for a reassessment. By week's end, the realists here were saying that not much had really changed, despite the fact that the market closed at 2,462 on Friday, up 1.4 percent on the day and 7 percent for the week.
Overall, since Jan. 1 the battered Bolsa has lost more than 18 percent of its value in dollar terms, and the Mexican peso has dropped almost 10 percent of its value. Interest rates for Government securities have hovered around 17 percent, stemming the outflow of foreign investment but strangling a nascent economic recovery. Second-quarter company reports filed last week indicated sluggishness, and many analysts believe it unlikely that the economy grew much more in the second quarter than the 0.5 percent first-quarter increase.
"No financial market anywhere in the world likes uncertainty," said Jonathan Heath, director of MACRO Asesoria Economica, a Mexico City financial consulting firm. "If you want to understand the Mexican financial market at this time you have to understand Mexican politics."
Many investors already have taken money out of the Bolsa and the American Depositary Receipts for Mexican companies that are traded in New York. Some have tried to hedge by shifting to fixed equity instruments.
But even such drastic moves have proved inadequate because of pressure on the peso and doubts about whether Mexico can avoid a devaluation. So the Central Bank recently started issuing notes called Tesobonos, backed by a pledge that they will be redeemable upon maturity for United States dollars at a fixed exchange rate.
The new guarantees have proved attractive, especially to foreigners. At the end of last year, the amount of Government securities held in tesobonos was 4 billion new pesos, about $1.3 billion, while the regular 28-day treasury notes called cetes equaled 47.7 billion new pesos, around $16 billion.
By June 19, cetes holdings had dropped to 32.3 billion new pesos, about $10.5 billion, while tesobonos had surged to 34.7 billion pesos, around $11.3 billion.
Foreigners holding Mexican notes basically just shifted from cetes to tesobonos. But many Mexicans involved in the market were much more skittish. Many of them simply took their money out, went to exchange houses, and cashed in pesos for dollars. Exchange levels indicate that most of them were small- and medium-sized investors.
According to Deborah Riner, chief economist of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City, through the first six months of the year, there has been an outflow of about $1 billion from the Mexican equity market, while during essentially the same period there was an inflow of $1.5 billion into Government obligations.
"That means that in spite of everything that's happened, foreign investment in Mexico is pretty much sitting tight," she said.
Other such mixed signals abound. Despite the peso's problems, exports are up, but so are imports. Foreign reserves are believed to have dropped below $18 billion dollars, the lowest point since 1982, but the Central Bank remains committed to defending the peso. In recent days, the interest rate for 28-day cetes dropped .66 percentage points, to 17 percent. Meanwhile, second-quarter earnings, while disappointing, were not as bad as had been expected, fueling the Bolsa's slight rebound.
As the election nears, opposition candidates are showing surprising strength, although the ruling party's replacement candidate, Yale-trained economist Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, is considered to be in the lead. Concern has focused on the possibility of chaos or violence after the election.
Opposition parties have vowed to take to the streets if the governing party wins in a way that seems fraudulent. A new President will not be confirmed until a new Congress is installed in November, and then he doesn't officially take office until Dec. 1. The pact between the Government, business and labor that controls wages and prices, and sets the band of peso exchange rates is due for renewal in October. Analysts expect that could be the time for an adjustment of the exchange-rate band, thus avoiding the harmful political effects that followed previous devaluations.
"All the uncertainty caused by the Nafta was cleared in one day and then the next day the sun came out," said Abel Beltran del Rio, president of Ciemex-Wefa, an economic study organization in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., that focuses on Mexico. "This time, after the election, it won't be resolved so quickly."

If G.M.'s Making Billions, Why Is Its Stock Just Sitting There?
In the spring, Americans' fancy turns to wheels -- wheels, that is, with alarm systems, sunroofs and CD players. The spring quarter is always the strongest for auto makers, and when you mix that with Detroit's recent good times, the numbers become potent. Last week General Motors said its quarterly earnings were the highest ever: $1.92 billion. (A day earlier, Ford had also posted record profits: $1.71 billion.) G.M. could have earned even more, it said, but it just couldn't build light trucks fast enough to feed voracious buyers. Not that this gave G.M. money to burn. It's billions short on its pension i.o.u.'s, so it immediately socked away $2.5 billion for retirees. So why is G.M.'s stock looking less than spectacular? Perhaps, as one analyst put it, "most of the cost-cutting has already been accomplished" and the momentum of this spectacular comeback is easing. And it still earns far less on each car than Ford or Chrysler. 

One Investor Who Likes Viacom
When a big investor buys a chunk of a company's stock, sometimes it's time to worry, sometimes to celebrate. Viacom hoped it was the latter last week when Kirk Kerkorian, the financier who keeps buying and selling MGM/UA, said he'd bought 5 percent of Viacom. He said it was an investment, but wolves have been known to wear such verbal clothing. There seems little worry of takeover, though, because Sumner Redstone owns more than half of Viacom, so the hope was more that Mr. Kerkorian's magic investing touch (he bought Chrysler when most people wished they'd bought Chrysler) would sprinkle down on Viacom. Viacom's stock was bruised by the Paramount battle, and a rising stock price -- because of the terms of that deal -- would save Viacom some money.
 
The Cellular Mating Game
If you want to get into the cellular phone business, you'd better be quick, because the big guns, like hyperactive Monopoly players, are rapidly joining forces to carve up the territory. First there was an AT&T-McCaw deal, followed quickly by MCI-Nextel and Nynex-Bell Atlantic. Then last week U S West teamed up with Airtouch to create another cellular giant. Sam Ginn, head of Airtouch, saw "the landscape of the wireless industry for the next century" being shaped by these deals.
 
Biotech, From Cold to Hot
Biotech investors are like teen-agers in love -- their mighty passions come and go in an instant. Just recently, one former star, Synergen, plunged to ugly-duckling status when its key drug proved flawed; its stock price was halved. And last week investors flocked to a new love. After Biogen said its multiple sclerosis drug was looking good, its shares vaulted more than 50 percent. It was a "home run" for Biogen, one analyst said, the sports metaphor proving this was serious stuff indeed. And sure enough, the whole biotech stock index rose, though it's unclear what help Biogen's drug will be to other companies.
 
If They Only Had Hair
It's common knowledge: a bald man has no future. Only those with blow-dried plumage need apply at the corner office. (Just think what Barry Diller, say, or Laurence Tisch could have done with hair.) No wonder men take desperate measures -- wearing ill-fitting wigs (the pre-jail Michael Milken) or sending those lonely strands on a meandering tour of the offending scalp (and living in fear of a brisk wind). Or the truly desperate can try drugs, like Rogaine. Upjohn, which makes Rogaine, wants to make it easier for men to try it and has asked the F.D.A. to let it sell Rogaine without a prescription. But last week an F.D.A. panel urged the agency to say no, saying people should not be encouraged to waste money on a drug with limited effectiveness.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
What's Russian for 'Pyramid'?
In America, capitalism has evolved into such a flawless creature that investors are never led astray by out-and-out scams -- well, hardly ever. But for investors in Russia -- where capitalism is still on all fours -- things can get wild. A company called MMM promised the world, effortlessly and risk-free, and for a time its stock had so many buyers that it delivered. But last week those investors got a crash business course. Lesson No. 1: pyramid schemes. And when the MMM pyramid collapsed, investors acted like jilted lovers, camping on the company's grounds to be among the first to sell their shares, and saying things like "They promised everything."
 
Now They Lend Ford Money
When the American auto industry was down a decade ago, Japan had no qualms about kicking it some more, dangling all those good, cheap Hondas and Toyotas before car buyers. So by some odd logic, now that Detroit is definitely up -- just look at last week's record earnings at Ford and G.M. -- Japan extends a hand. Showing just how badly Japan wants to shed the villain's cape in the trade drama, Japan's Export-Import Bank wants to lend Ford $300 million to help it build right-hand-drive cars for export to Japan. And with an interest rate that's a gift -- just over 4 percent -- it will be hard for Ford to resist.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
The July Sky, On the Block
In simpler days, no one gazed at a July sky and wondered what it would sell for by the inch. But simpler days are history; anyone worth his pinstripes has a pager, and even cows have beepers. So a while ago the Government looked at that sky and realized it was giving away something it could easily sell. And last week, in the first auction of the nation's airwaves, the F.C.C. received more than $600 million in bids just for scraps of the radio spectrum for fancy paging services -- an amount so high it surprised just about everyone. And that was just the beginning. Around December it will auction off a bigger chunk of thin air -- for a wide array of wireless telephone, fax and data services -- and then the numbers will be in the billions.
 
The Politics of Sand
Republicans put it in almost existential terms, saying the need for protecting a California wilderness didn't exist because elitist Democratic environmentalists never went there -- they just liked the sound of the word "wilderness." Or, if there are no Democrats in a desert, does that desert exist? And for years the Republicans got their way. But California's got two Democrats as Senators now, and that turned the tide -- or rather the sand. Last week the House voted to turn 9.4 million acres -- including Joshua Tree National Monument -- into a national park, the largest bit of land conservation since the 1980 Alaska Lands Act. Passage is virtually certain, since the Senate has passed a similar bill.
 
The Buck Stopped There
Financial markets think in round numbers; crossing a threshold always commands attention. Sure enough, when the dollar slid below 100 yen recently, people suddenly stopped talking about derivatives and mutual funds and QVC and mourned the poor, wounded American currency. On July 12, it hit what one trader called its "drop-dead low," 96.6 yen, the lowest since World War II. But take heart: last week, with the possibility looming of eased trade tensions with Japan, the dollar clambered out of that pit, hitting 100.1 yen.
 
Good News? Yes and No (Pick 2)
Anyone trying to tell if the economic glass is half full or half empty faced a muddle last week. (Remember, of course, that good economic news is bad market news, since growth signals inflation.) But when word came that the economy grew at a brisk 3.7 percent pace for the quarter, the quick qualifier was that inventories were piling up because consumer spending was off. So: good news or not? Fortunately the financial markets sorted it out for us, as stocks and bonds rallied -- so, of course, it's bad news.
 
At Kidder, He Was in Charge
When the Joseph Jett case exploded, the instant reaction was, "Who's in charge here?" What supervisor could possibly be oblivious to a bond trader inflating profits by hundreds of millions of dollars? And many eyes turned on Edward Cerullo, Mr. Jett's boss at Kidder, Peabody. But Mr. Cerullo wasn't talking -- at least not until last week, when, right after resigning from Kidder, he came out swinging. "It was I who questioned Jett's profitability," he insisted. "I took the initiative." And: "If I need to fall on my sword, fine." But what he clearly wanted was to turn that sword firmly toward his critics after having it pointed at him for so long. And he no doubt wanted to get his licks on the record before the results of an inquiry come out this week.

HEADLINE: The New Deal at American Express

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
IMAGINE Tiffany's admitting that most of its customers don't need gold necklaces and would look just as elegant in beads. Or that Saks reacted to flagging couture sales by opening a discount warehouse.
Well, that's essentially what Harvey Golub is about to do at the American Express Company, a little more than a year after taking over as chairman and chief executive of the giant financial services business. 
 Mr. Golub has concluded that more than half of the 11 million people who carry American Express charge cards in the United States would be better off with a much less expensive credit card.
And so this fall, he is going to turn American Express's product line on its head. No longer will the company depend on a card that trades prestige for a hefty annual fee and the obligation to pay bills in full each month -- the classic charge card. Instead, Amex will issue the first of a dozen or more revolving credit cards, traditionally the bailiwick of banks affiliated with Mastercard and Visa. The new cards will come in all flavors, with some carrying no fees and some issued in conjunction with another company, like a car maker.
The change is overdue -- and essential if the company's card business is going to grow again, Mr. Golub said. "Affluent business travelers like the charge card," he said. "But we took a product that was very upscale, added frills to it and sold it to an increasing number of people who didn't need it in a utilitarian sense. An ideal product meets actual needs."
The needs have changed -- as have the times. When Mr. Golub was named president of the company and head of its card business in 1991, the card operation was rapidly crumbling after a decade of explosive growth, with tens of thousands of cardholders canceling their accounts each week. Consumer psychology had turned against the snob appeal that worked so well for the company in the 1980's. And banks that issue Mastercard and Visa cards were in the midst of a vicious price war: lowering interest rates, eliminating cardholder fees and enticing customers with all manner of goodies from airline miles to free gasoline.
Making matters even worse, American Express botched its first venture into credit cards with the Optima card, racking up more than $1.5 billion in unpaid charges since Optima was introduced in 1987. Largely because of that, profits from cards plummeted to $243 million in 1992, from $956 million in 1990.
Mr. Golub put the brakes on the free fall. He sharply reduced Optima losses and overall operating costs, and he cut fees charged to merchants, who were starting to boycott American Express. He was also bailed out by Amex's mileage program, which started just before he took over and which increased spending per card. By the time Mr. Golub succeeded James D. Robinson 3d in February 1993 as head of the whole company, card profits had started to rebound.
Still, Mr. Golub has been unable to stanch the loss of cardholders -- two million dropped away from 1991 to 1993 -- making the future uncertain. Enter the company's new deck of credit cards, each meant to offer more "value" to a specific segment of customers.
Yet as American Express takes on the banks, it lags badly in the number of places its cards are accepted.
"The strength of the hand they have is to be a real force in the travel and entertainment market," said Peter S. P. Dimsey, president of Mastercard International for the United States. "Now they are trying to be all things to all people and make themselves look like a bank card, where they have a disadvantage."
And by offering cards that appear to be aimed more at mass than at class, American Express risks diluting its brand name, and losing more of its remaining base.
"In the past, they have been revolving-credit bashers," said Carl F. Pascarella, president of Visa U.S.A. "Now, all of a sudden, they come in with a revolving-credit product. It creates confusion in the minds of consumers. At the same time, merchants may say this is no different from Mastercard or Visa, so why should we pay a premium for it."
Mr. Golub argues that the American Express brand name is broad enough to incorporate both credit and charge cards. Indeed, he is hardly giving up on the elite market, with plans to offer a new charge card with enough extra services to warrant a $100 fee. And he insists that the company will be much more savvy in avoiding bad credit risks than it was with Optima. Still, he acknowledges that the company's cards need to be accepted by more merchants, so for the first time Amex is trying to sign up virtually every place its cardholders might go to spend money. (Wal-Mart is still a holdout, but not Sears and Kmart.)
One thing is clear: Mr. Golub increased the stakes of his bet on credit cards when he got rid of the Shearson and Lehman brokerage units, ending Mr. Robinson's failed effort at fashioning a financial supermarket. Now 70 percent of the company's earnings come from its card and travel agent subsidiary, Travel Related Services. The rest comes from IDS Financial Services, a mutual fund and insurance company.
This year, Travel Related Services will earn about $1 billion, analysts estimate, up about 10 percent, mainly because of the reduction in Optima losses and the pickup in spending from remaining cardholders. The company's charge cards, known as travel and entertainment cards, will take in about $4 billion in fees from merchants -- amounting to about 2.8 percent of purchases -- and another $1.7 billion from fees paid by holders. Those range from $55 for a standard green card to $300 for platinum. (Some corporate accounts are free.)
Mr. Golub's only avenues for growth are new customers, more spending from existing customers and, perhaps most promising, interest charges on unpaid balances, the main revenue source for bank credit cards. Over the next five years, Mr. Golub hopes to increase those balances to about $30 billion, from $7 billion, earning another $450 million to $600 million a year. At the same time, he expects even faster growth from corporate travel cards and new cards specifically designed for corporate purchasing agents.
These are ambitious goals in a highly competitive business. Still, as a single entity, American Express should be able to produce more effective advertising and offer more sophisticated card features than the fragmented Mastercard and Visa systems, which are associations of competing banks.
HOWEVER powerful the American Express franchise may be, when Mr. Golub took over the card business in July 1991, he felt company executives were not paying enough attention to its problems.
"We were headed toward marginalization -- becoming a largely irrelevant factor in the marketplace," he said last week in his wood-paneled office in lower Manhattan overlooking the Hudson River. "I thought that at least some people said things about the business that were not related to marketplace reality. They were saying things like our relationships with merchants were in good shape and that competitive actions had not hurt the company."
Mr. Golub disagreed, and did so in a far more confrontational way than the smooth and cocky charge card executives were used to. Big, blunt and brainy, Mr. Golub has not lost the in-your-face style of the Brooklyn streets on which he grew up.
"You could get into some real battles with Harvey where he would be pounding the desk and yelling," recalls Jill M. Considine, then a top executive at the company and now head of the New York Clearing House, a commercial banking group.
Still, some found him to be a refreshingly direct and honest change for a culture that had long been known for its slick and intricate corporate infighting. "Everyone at American Express was polite, but there was always a leitmotif of subterfuge," Ms. Considine said.
Among other things, the 54-year-old Mr. Golub, a former McKinsey consultant, demanded that charge card executives back up their arguments that the business was not in trouble. As a result, Bain & Company, the Boston-based consulting firm, asked customers why they were canceling their cards. It confirmed Mr. Golub's suspicions: many customers wanted to borrow money with credit cards and wanted to shop in places that accepted bank cards but not American Express.
"There were a lot of rationales given that said the problem is not as bad as it seems," said Kenneth I. Chenault, whom Mr. Golub put in charge of the United States card business. "Harvey forced the company to face the reality that we had a substantial problem."
Armed with this research, Mr. Golub decided that it was futile for the company to try to hold on to yuppies and other cardholders who signed up in the 80's and instead should concentrate on keeping the loyalty of business travelers.
The best customers were identified and given better treatment by customer service representatives. More important, the company used its Membership Miles program to counter similar programs by bank cards that had attracted many of its biggest-spending customers.
More frightening, however, merchants began to rebel against Amex's high fees, which averaged 3.2 percent of every purchase, compared with about 2 percent for the Visa and Mastercard systems. Indeed, in 1992, a group of Boston restaurants attracted national attention when they all agreed to drop American Express.
THIS time, Mr. Golub commissioned McKinsey to determine what Amex is worth to merchants in terms of how much sales go up by accepting the card.
It found that Amex didn't need to cut fees much for travel-oriented merchants, like rent-a-car companies, even though they were its biggest accounts. But Amex did cut the rate sharply for mass-market retailers, who gained less from the card.
This tough pricing strategy allowed American Express to limit its fee cut to 0.3 percentage point, on average, instead of the 1 to 1.5 points some had feared. Moreover, the lower fees in some categories permit it to sign up more merchants. Indeed, its sales force is now calling on a prospect list of one million businesses, ranked by order of priority.
The effort is paying off. In 1992, American Express holders could use their cards in only 70 percent of their purchases, company studies showed. That number has risen to 80 percent, although it is still far from Mr. Golub's target of 95 percent, or virtual parity with the banks.
Even as he was calming the merchants and trying to slow the losses from Optima, Mr. Golub concluded that the company's fate increasingly was going to be tied to credit cards.
"There was one point of view that the lending business did not fit with the company's T&E business," he said. "I did not share that view. All during the time we were fixing the lending business we were fixing it for growth."
By the end of 1992, it was clear inside the company that the crisis with Optima was ending. And so Frank Skillern, a longtime associate of Mr. Golub who was put in charge of the Optima rescue, quietly began to develop the approval systems necessary to offer credit cards to new customers.
It quickly became apparent that the initial plan to introduce a souped-up version of Optima wouldn't work.
"The original quest was for one great credit card," said Phillip J. Riese, who took over credit cards last summer. "But when we did our research and showed customers a broad array of products, different customers went for different products. There was no silver bullet."
By the beginning of this year, American Express came to the conclusion that it needed 10 to 15 different cards, each meant to attract about 1 million customers.
The one premiering this fall, which will use the Optima name, is meant to appeal to people who want to borrow a lot and will feature low interest rates, although the company won't reveal the details. Next year it will likely introduce a card with no annual fee and additional cards with benefits tailored to various demographic groups, including students, yuppies and middle-class people who are not frequent business travelers.
At the same time, Mr. Skillern, who replaced Mr. Riese as head of the green, gold and platinum cards, is trying to revive that business by breaking it up into half a dozen smaller customer groups.
The most important group, of course, are the frequent business travelers, who represent about 45 percent of charge card customers.
"These are customers we make the most money from," Mr. Skillern said. "We will treat them differently."
For example, Amex is reprogramming its approval system to accept charges for these top customers that would previously have been denied because they were unusually large.
Amex is also creating special versions of the charge card for customer groups that don't want a credit card but aren't served well by the traditional card. For example, Amex cut the card fee for senior citizens to $35 and added such benefits as an "ask the pharmacist" information line.
ON the other hand, the company is cooking up a card that will have an annual fee of at least $100 -- $25 more than the gold card -- and will offer even more features for business travelers. Also in the works is something called "The Plan," a program that will allow customers to use one card as a charge card, credit card or debit card. The latter deducts purchases as they are made from the customer's bank account.
With all these card programs in the works, the biggest risk facing American Express may be the very complexity of its plans. The sheer range of proposed card programs increases the chances of making another mistake on the order of Optima or creating a different kind of snafu. Moreover, the company risks muddying its message to the consumer.
In response, American Express plans to continue to emphasize the charge card in its advertising even as it hopes more of its customers use credit cards to go further into debt. "The charge card is going to remain as the central part of the positioning of the brand," Mr. Skillern said. "It is our equity and our history."
In other words, put the gold necklace in the window but put the beads out to sell.
 
 
 
GOLUB'S AGENDA
 HARVEY GOLUB has put American Express on a diet, selling its Shearson brokerage house to the Travelers, spinning off its Lehman brokerage to shareholders and selling most of the First Data Corporation, a processing company. As a result, he has mostly disassembled the financial supermarket built by his predecessor, James D. Robinson 3d.
"A financial supermarket says anybody can buy anything from the same organization," Mr. Golub said. "I don't think that's possible."
Yet in a narrower way, Mr. Golub does see the potential to sell much more than credit cards to his customer base. He has appointed Pete Talbott, a veteran of Citicorp and First Boston, to develop a new business in "virtual banking," offering banking and investment services over the phone and through computers, much as Fidelity Investments sells mutual funds.
More immediately, he wants to tie IDS Financial Services far more closely into the corporate family, with more aggressive marketing to the company's card customers. One way is a new name: American Express Financial Advisers.
Mr. Golub is so confident that the American Express panache, along with access to the charge card customer list, will improve IDS sales that he is cutting off one of the unit's main sources of new clients: unsolicited phone calls.
"Customers hate cold calling," Mr. Golub said. And he is afraid that disgruntled recipients of such calls might cut their cards in protest.
 
 
 
MOVING THE MERCHANDISE
 THE card business at American Express is rapidly becoming more than a financial service, turning into an advertising medium as well.
Because the company has a wealth of information about its customers gleaned from their buying habits, it already mails all manner of precisely targeted offers, like a coupon for a new Chicago hotel to those who travel frequently to that city.
Now it is developing a far more significant system that will print these offers right on the monthly card statements. The system is already in use in Britain, where Harrods has offered sales only to American Express holders who regularly shop there.
Soon the company will be able to offer bonuses based on spending over time, sort of mini-frequent-buyer programs appearing unsolicited on a statement. For example, Brooks Brothers might offer a free shirt to those making purchases of, say, $1,000 within six months.
Merchants generally will not be charged for these programs, but of course Amex gets a cut of everything cardholders spend.
American Express is also planning to make its Membership Miles program more of a promotional vehicle. In some countries, including Canada, the program is already known as Membership Rewards, providing customers with points good for merchandise or services other than frequent-flier miles.
As envisioned, companies that have products with excess inventory -- say soon-to-be-outdated computers or unreserved hotel rooms -- would sell them at a deep discount to American Express, which would offer them for points. Some companies might even offer products to American Express at no charge just to induce its affluent customers to sample their wares.
Harvey Golub, American Express's chairman, even envisions the day when the company would be paid to run frequent-buyer programs.

HEADLINE: Closing of Flea Market Would Add to Jobless

 BODY:
As a resident of East Meadow and president of the Roosevelt Raceway Flea Market Merchants' Association, I feel compelled to respond to "Flea Market Plan Raises Opposition" [July 3] regarding the proposal to shift the current flea market to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
Regardless of the weather, my members engage in a tradition older than the Bible, selling their wares at an open-air market where they are audited regularly by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. 
 Some merchants are single parents determined to make a go of it. Others are new American citizens, using the time-honored pushcart strategy in order to become part of the economy. Some are East Meadow storeowners who need the extra retail income to make ends meet.
So it is no small irony that my community's own Chamber of Commerce now opposes the survival of the flea market and the preservation of some 2,000 jobs.
As reflected in your article there is a growing awareness among members of the East Meadow community that the flea market deserves to survive. It is unfair and unconscionable to simply "red line" thousands of people into unemployment because a Chamber of Commerce president has decreed it so.
Unlike some corporation told by residential neighbors they can't build a headquarters locally, our merchants can't simply relocate. If the chamber puts us out of business we will walk past their membership on our way to unemployment everyday until the bank takes away our homes.

HEADLINE: Beyond Security;
The Hopes for Peace Begin To Build Upon Themselves

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
DAN MERIDOR, a former Justice Minister, was chatting last Tuesday about how much Israel has changed -- how its economy has taken on vigor and its people self-confidence, how the nation itself is emerging triumphant from decades of conflict to be recognized as a regional superpower.
 As he spoke in Parliament's cafeteria, a sprawling room set against a panoramic view of Jerusalem, Mr. Meridor kept glancing at a most striking illustration of this new Israel: its legislators staring, transfixed, at televised images of King Hussein of Jordan and their own Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, addressing a joint session of the United States Congress. In the audience was Rehazam Ze'evi, leader of a far-right party that advocates the expulsion of Arabs; barely 10 feet from him were a dozen photographers jostling to shoot pictures of Yasir Arafat's sister-in-law, Hala Tawil, paying her first visit to Parliament as the guest of another legislator. "These are good days for Israel," said Mr. Meridor, a leading figure in the right-wing opposition Likud Party, flashing a mischievous smile of appreciation at the scene.
 
 Indeed they are. As the reality of a negotiated peace between Arabs and Jews keeps unfolding in dramatic chapters, Israelis are finding themselves less obsessed with the question of security that has dogged them so insistently for nearly 50 years; instead, they are turning toward other aspects of life. And as the siege mentality of the ordinary person lifts, the new optimism in turn is accelerating the peace process.
 Even the considerable roadblocks that remain on the path to peace and that were so evident in recent days -- Syria's hesitance about joining in, Yasir Arafat's lack of a sure hand in administering self-rule, and terror bombings against Jews in Argentina, Panama and Britain -- do not hold the public imagination prisoner as they might once have. Attention, instead, remains on the country's relentless climb toward the elite status of a first-world nation, where people think first of things like travel, cable television, new cars, portable phones, and the next visit to the latest high-fashion shopping mall.
 "I have been here for 30 years," says Hirsh Goodman, editor-in-chief of the bimonthly Jerusalem Report. "There is change at every level. The economy is being privatized. People have more disposable income. The country's population has increased by nearly a million new immigrants in the last three years with unemployment falling at the same time.
 "After the Madrid conference it seemed everyone wanted to reach out to Israel. We could do business anywhere. We are exporting more than $20 billion of goods from high-tech to swimwear. I can go to Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation."
 To a reporter who has covered the Arab world for much of the last 15 years and has also traveled regularly to Israel, this sense of Israeli self-confidence helps explain the most stunning revelation of the unfolding peace process -- the widening acceptance of each other by former enemies on both sides of the Mideast divide, as the politics of peace achieves breakthroughs in the psychology of peace, and this in turn paves the way for the next political agreement.
 Last week, for example, as Mr. Meridor's colleagues in Parliament watched the address in Congress on live television in Jerusalem, so did millions of Arabs across the Middle East -- even in Syria. For the first time, it turned out, President Hafez al-Assad felt that it was wise to let his people witness such a spectacle.
 Meanwhile, in Jordan, television commentators referred to Mr. Rabin as "the Israeli leader," "His Excellency the Prime Minister" and "Mr. Rabin." There was none of the "Zionist entity" venom of past years. Israeli reporters were greeted in Amman warmly, if sometimes awkwardly. Saudi newspapers gave the event banner coverage. Once-militant Algeria proclaimed its support publicly for the agreement to end hostilities between Jordan and Israel. Only in the capitals of the most radical regimes -- Teheran, Baghdad and Tripoli, for example -- was the old abusive language still in use.
 
Seeking to Talk
 Zeev Schiff, who writes for the Israeli daily Haaretz and who spent a week in Jordan this month as the personal guest of Crown Prince Hassan, said the most important change he has tracked in the Arab side of the Middle East equation has been a broadening of appreciation that a relationship with Israel is necessary. "They need to have a dialogue with the Israeli people," Mr. Schiff said. "The Palestinians understood that when they went to Oslo for secret talks and so did the Egyptians long before, as do the Moroccans, Tunisians, Qataris, Omanis and others in the Arab world now."
 Syria, of course, has not been so forthcoming, but last week President Assad, even as he opened the airwaves to peace oratory from Washington, also used friendly journalists to put out a tantalizing signal: that he would not mind if a joint Lebanese-Syrian delegation began direct talks with Israel.
 Among Arabs, the drive to make peace is in strong measure the result of economic necessity; if for Israel the cost of security had become painful over the years, for many Arab lands the cost of permanent war had become unbearable. Egypt was practically bankrupt when it made peace in the late 1970's. Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries are not as wealthy as they were, and the Palestine Liberation Organization had lost the ability even to pay its employees' salaries. Jordan faces a worsening economy and accumulated debts.
 In Israel, a year after beginning to deal openly with the P.L.O., economic pressures of a different kind underpin Mr. Rabin's aggressive moves toward peace, as a newly affluent population of 4.5 million begins to see life with more optimism.
 It is one of those moments in a nation's history in which military prowess and economic prosperity conspire to alter a country's image of itself and of its neighbors. And the more Israelis come to believe in their own future, it seems, the more willing Arabs are to believe they can deal with Israel to their mutual benefit.
 In recent months, the hottest issues consuming Israeli attention have been efforts to reform the health care system, lower import duties on consumer goods and create the country's first private university, as well as a boom in the building of new highways. Abroad, the country has been fascinated by the crack medical team it has sent to help Rwandan refugees. Per capita income has climbed to $13,000, placing Israel among the top 10 nations in the world, and since 1990 the economy has been growing at a remarkable 6 percent a year. Even as 500,000 to a million immigrants arrived in the last three years, Israel managed to lower its unemployment rate from 11 percent to 8 percent.
 The blossoming of Israel has triggered envy and soul-searching among its neighbors. More and more, Arab commentators have stopped blaming outside conspiracies for Arab problems. The new message in Arab intellectual circles is that the Arab world must learn to negotiate differences because the ideology of all or nothing has cost too much.
 Meanwhile, Israel's military might remains unquestioned, and this has been the other essential ingredient for the optimism that Mr. Rabin is capitalizing on, as he leads his people ever further into coming to terms with their enemies of a half-century.
 "It is not a new Israel," says Meron Benvenisti, a historian and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem. "It was all there except that people never allowed the reality of our strength to penetrate their psyche because it would betray their paranoia. Now this dichotomy is over. What we see now is that Mr. Rabin is bringing Israel into its proper regional superpower role."
 As long as peace still seems attainable, the process continues to strengthen itself. Barry Rubin, a political scientist, says military service has been quietly cut from 36 months to 32 months for men and from 24 months to 20 months for women, further changing Israelis' lives as manpower is gradually cut in favor of high tech. "People no longer want their lives to revolve around conflict," he said. "They now perceive peace as possible and the status quo as impossible to preserve."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
In Search of a Vision For the City of the '90's

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
WHERE have you gone, Lewis Mumford and Jane Jacobs? A nation's cities turn their lonely eyes to you.
 O.K., granted Mr. Mumford and Ms. Jacobs, the most insightful prophets and critics of the 20th-century American city, are no Joe DiMaggio. For Paul Simon, the songwriter, Joe was the larger-than-life icon of a lost age of American innocence. But something has also been lost from what passes these days for the art of urban planning. And that is precisely what those two intellectuals once brought to the field: a vision of the future of the big city.
 
 This is a particularly critical issue today. With the vast expansion in the last two decades of multiple "edge cities" well away from the traditional downtowns, big cities no longer dominate the industrial and commercial life of the United States. "Given new communications technologies, relentless shareholder pressure and mobile labor markets, many large corporations no longer believe they require an urban presence," writes Joel Kotkin, a Los Angeles-based author and senior fellow at the Center for the New West. "Many are retreating to smaller cities and rural locales, where they enjoy special tax breaks, slavish local governments, weak union movements and feeble environmental controls."
 In response, city planners and policy makers from Boston to San Francisco have sought to keep big companies from leaving by pouring vast resources into rebuilding their tired old downtowns. But for all the success of megaprojects like Baltimore's Inner Harbor, they have failed to reverse a broader decline or put much of a dent in inner-city poverty and crime.
 What is needed instead, contend some of the new thinkers about urban issues, is more attention to bringing vitality to those small businesses and urban communities, largely ignored by real estate developers and city planners, where millions of immigrants and minority families have settled in search of opportunities to get ahead.
 "Two themes dominate the conventional wisdom about cities: the effort to revitalize downtown office centers and despair over inner-city poverty," says Richard P. Nathan, author of "A New Agenda for Cities," and provost of the College of Public Affairs at the State University of New York at Albany. "But the real hope for the future of our big cities rests on the rebirth of the old neighborhoods by new immigrants and working families of blacks and Hispanics. We can't afford to neglect them anymore."
 There is only so much, of course, that city planning can do alone. In contrast to many European cities, most American metropolitan areas have been shaped far more by powerful economic and technological forces than by any master planning.
 But the obsession with downtown development that still animates most urban planners appears to have blinded many city officials to possibilities elsewhere.
 
'A Different Direction'
 "Throughout history, the central city was always the central focus of urban areas," says Witold Rybczynski, a leading urban theorist at the University of Pennsylvania. "That is no longer true."
 "You can't blame Mumford and Jacobs for not dealing with this," he adds. "Cities have just taken off in a different direction."
 Urban theorists like Mr. Mumford and Ms. Jacobs helped define and influence the unruly shape of the American city that emerged from the crucible of the auto-industrial age. For all their differences, both shared a critical outlook toward Robert Moses, the master builder whose mixed legacy of vast public construction and equally vast private destruction still rests uneasily over New York and other big cities affected by his example.
 
Mumford and Jacobs
 To Mr. Mumford, the ideal urban area was something like the small town writ large. He championed a nostalgic image of a rational, orderly moderate-density city nestled within broad swaths of greenery. While far from anything that Mr. Mumford envisioned, much of upper-middle-class suburban life today and such planned garden cities as Reston, Va., and Columbia, Md., outside Washington, D.C., represent imperfect expressions of that model.
 By contrast, Ms. Jacobs, author of the seminal 1961 book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," was the anti-utopian exponent of the unpredictable, even anarchic jumble of the traditional urban neighborhood. To her, the ideal -- also writ large -- was something like the bustling diversity of the Greenwich Village where she lived in the 1950's and 1960's.
 Almost singlehandedly, Ms. Jacobs inspired the opposition to massive urban renewal schemes. And out of an amalgam of ideas propounded by Ms. Jacobs and other social critics like Herbert Gans and William F. Whyte, there emerged a new approach to city planning. Density and active street life was good, went the new litany, autos were bad. Planned superhighways that would have bulldozed still-thriving city neighborhoods were stopped; the building of large-scale public housing projects placed in bleak and forbidding plazas was halted. But, faced with the powerful forces that have been loosening the ties that once bound corporate America to its traditional urban bases, something more is needed.
 To Mr. Kotkin and others, a fresh approach to the cities would start with the recognition that most Americans live elsewhere. Cities no longer can be all things to all people. As forums for trade, travel and art, however, big cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles still serve as centers of economic creativity that can only be fostered in an atmosphere of intense competition and person-to-person contact. Instead of trying to compete with the dozens of big new peripheral job centers built primarily for white-collar, middle-class workers, urban centers can focus on their own unique abilities to bring diverse groups and cultures together.
 "From ancient times," Mr. Kotkin says, "urban centers are unique for their ability to nurture what could be seen today as outsider groups -- minorities, immigrants, women entrepreneurs, gays, young singles -- who could have an extraordinarily difficult time thriving in the more conventional and homogeneous society in the hinterlands." But without some rethinking of the role cities should play in American society, they could end up even further from center stage than they are today.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS ATTRACTING NEW MONEY POOL

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
The United States has found an unlikely benefactor to replace Japanese investors in paying for the nation's continuing budget and trade deficits: foreign government banks, mainly in developing countries.
The flood of money from these unlikely sources into the United States is the latest shift in the powerful currents of capital flows that underlie the global economy. In the 1970's, Arab nations flush with oil money recycled their profits into American investments. 
 In the 1980's, Japanese investors, riding their country's export boom, plowed hundreds of billions of dollars in trade surpluses into the United States, buying everything from Treasury bonds to Columbia Pictures to control of Rockefeller Center in New York. Their investments in the United States propped up the dollar and held down interest rates here.
Now a new trend has appeared, Government and International Monetary Fund figures show. While net private investment in the United States has dropped 89 percent in the last seven years, to $12.8 billion last year, net government investment here nearly doubled last year, to $70 billion, according to Commerce Department statistics.
International monetary officials say most of that new investment has come from the central banks of countries like India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. According to figures released this week by the I.M.F., nine-tenths of the increase in central bank dollar holdings occurred in developing countries.
These central banks are similar to the Federal Reserve, printing money and setting interest rates. They are flush with cash because Western pension and mutual funds have invested heavily in their countries, seeking higher returns than they could find in industrialized countries, which are growing more slowly.
Officials in developing countries said in telephone interviews this week that they were buying the dollars flowing into their economies to keep the money from feeding inflation or driving up their currencies, making their exports too expensive in world markets. They pay for the dollars by selling government bonds, and invest the dollars in American bonds.
But the long fall of the dollar this summer has inflicted losses on these central banks and their taxpayers, giving American policymakers a new worry. They fear that if the dollar continues its slide, foreign central banks may switch to other currencies.
If foreign central banks shed dollars on a large scale, economists say, the dollar will fall further, prices will rise for imported goods and interest rates will climb.
Foreign central bank investments now equal one of every 12 dollars of savings in the United States. But these investments have not reached the levels of the late 1980's, when the flow of capital from Japan was at its peak.
Japanese investors cut back their investments in the United States during the early 1990's. But the effects were less severe than expected, because the retrenchment coincided with a recession in the United States that pushed down interest rates. As the American economy has expanded, rising central bank investments have filled the gap left by Japanese investments.
 
Strong Dollar Sought
 Clinton Administration and Federal Reserve officials are loathe to test the patience of the foreign central banks. In recent testimony to Congress, some officials have said they want a strong dollar that is attractive to currency reserve managers at foreign central banks.
"We are going to be, will have to be, and as far as we at the Federal Reserve are concerned, need to be the principal reserve currency in the world for the indefinite future," Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Banking Committee on July 20. "And if we allow the dollar to weaken as a reserve currency, we will have consequences not only within our domestic system, but I think we will have significant problems with the necessary responsibilities that we have as a world leader in financial markets and in the economy."
Already there are warning signs for the American reliance on these funds. On July 12, Taiwan, which holds the largest amount of dollars in the world, said the portion of its $90 billion portfolio invested in dollars had dropped by three percentage points, to a record low of 56.73 percent, because of the declining value of the currency.
 
Large Reserves Held
 Other central banks retain large dollar holdings because they want to pay for their country's imports in dollars if exports suddenly drop. The Reserve Bank of India, for example, keeps three-fifths of its reserves in dollars, but reassesses the ratio weekly to determine if it is hurting its balance sheet, said O. P. Sodhani, the bank's executive director.
"Over 90 percent of our trade, exports and imports, is in dollars, but some changes do take place depending on how the currency is moving," he said in a telephone interview from his home in Bombay.
The Reserve Bank of India is one of two dozen central banks in developing countries that have spectacularly increased their reserves in the last few years. India's reserves have soared tenfold since 1990, to $16.19 billion in May of this year, from $1.55 billion, as new, free-market economic policies have brought a surge of foreign investment.
But foreign central banks are becoming increasingly sophisticated investors, and no longer dump reserves into the dollar automatically.
"Central banks 10 years ago put their money into Treasury bonds," said Charles H. Dallara, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in the Bush Administration and is now the managing director of the Institute of International Finance, the research and lobbying arm of the world's biggest multinational banks. "There's no longer the passive tendency that there was 10 years ago."

HEADLINE: Crossing the River: The Israel-Jordan Pact -- A special report.;
Amid Debt, Doubt and Secrecy, Hussein and Rabin Made Peace

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
On the evening of May 19 in a quiet London living room, two war horses of the Middle East -- men who were present at the creation of the conflict between their countries nearly half a century ago -- met secretly to end it once and for all.
As King Hussein remembers it now, he looked across at Yitzhak Rabin and said to himself, "You know, Yitzhak, you and I have been at this a long time." 
 The King of Jordan and the Prime Minister of Israel had met before, in secret places and often in disguise. But, always, either Jordan wasn't ready, or Israel wasn't ready or the Palestinians weren't ready.
That night in London, the King was visibly distraught. For months both the Americans and the Israelis had accused him of dragging his feet. "How am I not serious?" he asked Mr. Rabin directly.
Mr. Rabin, the King recalled in an interview this week, said that he knew Jordan was serious about the concept of peace, but that it was time to do business.
"Fine," the King replied, "Let's get on with it."
And so they did.
Over the next few hours the two worked out the basis for the Israeli-Jordanian pact signed last Monday at the White House. The King agreed to take small but meaningful steps toward normal diplomatic relations, to move toward direct, high-level public contacts and to begin work on a formal peace treaty; Mr. Rabin agreed to discuss Jordan's territorial and water claims even before securing a formal peace.
When Mr. Rabin returned to Israel from London, he told his aides: "We found the way for the breakthrough. Something happened to Hussein. He passed a psychological barrier."
What the two old adversaries produced in more than a year of secret diplomacy has ended the state of war between their countries and opened the way for a normal relationship.
But its effect goes beyond the borders of Israel and Jordan: it has left Syria isolated as the only major party to the Arab-Israeli conflict that has not reconciled with Israel, and it has created a competition between Jordan and the Palestinians for areas of the West Bank and East Jerusalem over which Israel might cede control.
Interviews with Jordanian, Israeli and American participants disclosed many details of the secret diplomacy.
The crucial link between King Hussein and Mr. Rabin was not, as it had been so often, an American mediator, but rather the deputy director of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service. Mr. Rabin has described the official, who has worked with King Hussein secretly for 25 years, as the Israeli whom the King trusts most. The official -- whose name the parties declined to disclose -- arranged the secret contacts, made several visits to Amman and even briefed Americans on the King's thinking.
The pace and scope of the breakthrough were directly tied to the talks between Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
When King Hussein detected progress between those two men, he speeded up his own negotiations with Israel to insure that he would not be frozen out of the West Bank or East Jerusalem. When the King sensed that Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat were having problems, he slowed down.
The other key factor motivating King Hussein was economics. Facing a crushing debt, he desperately needed relief that only Washington could provide. Throughout the talks, money came up more often than missiles, and economic security was talked about as much as national security. Even on the day of the White House signing, Israeli officials pleaded with Washington for aid for Jordan.
 
Jordan, Early 1993
King and Clinton Exchange Letters
 In the spring of 1993, King Hussein was in a bad way. He was recovering from cancer surgery. He was estranged from his natural protector, the United States, for siding with Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. His country had run up a foreign debt of $6.5 billion, larger than Jordan's $4.5 billion gross national product, but he had been told by other countries that if the United States forgave its $700 million in debt, they would follow suit.
It was in that context that King Hussein, while in the United States for a medical checkup, came to the Oval Office on June 18 to meet President Clinton for the first time -- and to put Jordanian-American relations back on track.
The meeting went well, and six days later King Hussein wrote Mr. Clinton a long personal letter, sharing what he described as the peaceful vision of his grandfather King Abdullah, who was assassinated in 1951 in Jerusalem by a Palestinian as the young Hussein stood at his side.
"I am determined to fulfill that part of my grandfather's legacy and leave my own," the King wrote. Last week, recalling the letter, he said he asked himself: "What is life all about? What is my responsibility? What will I be remembered for?"
On July 4, 1993, Mr. Clinton wrote back, saying how moving the letter had been, and assuring the King of his "full support."
"You will not be alone as you proceed with your efforts to make peace with Israel," Mr. Clinton said. A short time later, the Administration asked Congress to resume military aid to Jordan.
 
Norway, August 1993
Israeli-P.L.O. Pact Startles Hussein
 At the same time, unknown to either King Hussein or to the Americans, an informal Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Norway had grown into formal negotiations between Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat. When an accord was announced at the end of August, King Hussein was thunderstruck.
For 26 years the King had counted on Israel to control the P.L.O. for him, at least in the West Bank, and he was worried that Mr. Arafat was going to take up residence there in some sort of independent capacity. The King urgently summoned Mr. Rabin to Aqaba, the Jordanian port, for a secret meeting at which the Israeli tried to reassure him that Israel was not forming an alliance with Mr. Arafat.
Nevertheless, the King recalled, the accord "finally drove home to me the need to look at Jordan and look at its future, a Jordan that has shared with the Palestinians everything, that gave them a home."
In early October, the King sent Crown Prince Hassan to Washington to a conference called to raise money for the new Palestinian entity, and to meet with the President. The White House responded that a meeting was possible on one condition: that it include Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel.
After checking with the King, the Crown Prince agreed. The three men met in the Oval Office and pledged to set up a working group to deal with economic concerns. Mr. Peres even joined the Crown Prince in appealing to Mr. Clinton for debt relief.
At a news conference that day, Mr. Clinton spoke for the first time of the importance of easing Jordan's debt burden. But Jordanian officials found little sympathy in meetings with Treasury officials. "Everyone put a damper on it," said one senior Jordanian official. "They said it couldn't be done."
 
Amman, Nov. 3, 1993
Trip to a Palace Across the Border
 As the Israel-P.L.O. talks quickened, King Hussein decided to take his own relationship with Israel to another level. With the mediation of Israel's deputy intelligence chief, the King arranged a secret meeting with Mr. Peres in Amman, the Jordanian capital.
On the evening of the meeting, Mr. Peres voted in municipal elections in Israel and then secretly drove with a top aide to the Allenby Bridge, on the border, where a Jordanian limousine was waiting. Talking in the palace until dawn, Mr. Peres and the King drafted and initialed a four-page document that laid the foundation for what would come later.
It included a commitment to sign a peace agreement as soon as possible, a plan to hold an Arab-Israeli business conference in Amman to discuss regional development and a vague Israeli reassurance to respect Jordan's historic role in maintaining the Muslim holy shrines in Jerusalem.
Mr. Peres, locked for decades in a fierce competition with Mr. Rabin over credit for breakthroughs, could not control his excitement. Upon returning to Israel he told a television reporter, "Remember this date" -- Nov. 3, 1993. And he began what he called a "storming strategy" to push peace with Jordan and temporarily elbow Syria aside.
 
Amman, Winter 1994
King Paces Talks To the P.L.O.'s
 King Hussein was furious with Mr. Peres's indiscretion. In the document he had signed with the Foreign Minister, he had not agreed to any specific dates. Facing parliamentary elections at home and with the Syrians monitoring his every move, the King wanted to proceed slowly.
More important, Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat were making little progress in negotiating the details of their agreement. The King saw no incentive to take risks as long as those talks could still collapse.
For the next five months, the King took a tough line. He told the Israelis he would move forward with them only if they first agreed to create a border commission to discuss Jordan's demand for the return of about 147 square miles along the border and for more access to water from the Jordan River.
Mr. Rabin arranged delivery of a blunt message: "You can forget about it."
The King insists he was not stalling. The Israelis and Americans, preoccupied with the Syrian and Palestinian talks, simply "did not take us seriously," he says.
Still, Jordan and Israel did move forward in two small areas: an agreement to open branches of a large Jordanian bank in the West Bank and Gaza, and a strategy to control infestations of flies that breed in uncovered manure pits in the Jordan Valley.
But the Americans were so irritated with the King that when Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited the Mideast in late April and in May, he did not stop in Jordan.
 
London, May 19, 1994
West Bank Worry Provides Impetus
 On May 4 the political landscape changed. To the King's astonishment, Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin reached agreement in Cairo to carry out the accord they had signed on the White House lawn eight months earlier.
More important for the King, the May agreement spelled out in detail an economic relationship, including how to manage trade with the West Bank. It specified which goods could be imported into the West Bank from Jordan -- and excluded many in which Jordan specializes, like cement.
At the same time, Mr. Arafat's talk about setting up a Palestinian currency and banking system, a plan the Israelis later rejected, prompted many West Bank residents to sell Jordanian dinars into dollars, and the dinar briefly plunged.
"Their agreement with the Israelis affected us," King Hussein said. "People began to speculate. We were headed for another serious situation."
Suddenly the King revived the Israel-Jordan channel. On May 19 Mr. Rabin, his deputy intelligence chief and two other senior officials donned disguises and boarded a corporate jet on the private runway of Israel Aircraft Industries for the trip to London, where the King and his aides were waiting.
 
Washington, June 1994
Focus on Debts And Military Aid
 Still, there was a long way to go. The Israeli intelligence official was skeptical whether this secret understanding worked out in London would survive. "This is where they are," the official told the Americans about the Jordanian position. "But I cannot tell you when you talk to them, when you see them, that this is where they will be."
On June 7 in Washington, the Israelis and Jordanians disclosed the rough outlines of their deal. Under the cover of the Trilateral Economic Committee, comprising the United States, Jordan and Israel, the two countries agreed to discuss borders and specific economic projects, to transfer their economic and bilateral talks to Jordan and Israel and to elevate the level of their public meetings -- but not yet to the level of heads of state.
The first hint that the King was willing to meet Mr. Rabin in public came during the King's visit to Washington later in June. In talks in his hotel suite with Dennis B. Ross, the chief American negotiator in the Mideast, and Martin S. Indyk, the chief Mideast specialist at the White House, the King made clear what he wanted from the United States: debt forgiveness and assistance in modernizing Jordan's military.
The deputy Israeli intelligence chief was also in Washington, sent by Mr. Rabin to assist the King and to serve as a liaison with Jerusalem and with the State Department.
 
'Never Been Afraid of Daylight'
 In daily meetings with Mr. Ross and other Administration officials, the Mossad officer pressed the King's case so hard that at one point Mr. Ross turned to him and said: "Look, I understand what's going on here. The Jordanians are using you to try to convince us to do more. But they have to understand that if they want us to do more, they have to give us more to work with."
On June 20, King Hussein began to do just that, saying in a news conference that he would have no problem meeting Mr. Rabin. "I've never been afraid of daylight, sir," the King told an Israeli reporter.
Two days later, when the King visited Mr. Clinton to appeal for debt relief and military assistance, the President was ready.
He said he understood Jordan's difficult economic situation and was eager to help clear the debts -- but at a price. Given the budget constraints and the hard lobbying it would take to persuade Congress that such an investment in Jordan was worthwhile, the President told the King, "I'm not going to offer something that I can't deliver on."
 
Clinton's List
 Mr. Clinton suggested the King do "something dramatic that unmistakably accelerates the process toward a peace treaty," like a meeting in Washington with Mr. Rabin.
But there was another aspect of the meeting that impressed the King. Mr. Clinton referred from memory to a letter from the King delivered the night before that requested help in eight specific areas, and he listed precise ways the United States could meet them, including an expansion of agricultural assistance and risk insurance for private investment, Export-Import Bank financing for purchases of Boeing aircraft and military equipment from surplus stocks.
By the time the King left Washington, the Americans had concluded that he would be ready to meet Mr. Rabin by October.
 
The White House Finale
Former Enemies Frame an Accord
 Once again the King had broken a psychological barrier. "I had it in my mind when I spoke to the President," he said. "When I left the U.S,, I had already made up my mind." En route home, he decided to go forward as soon as a meeting could be arranged.
In Amman on July 9, the King warned the lower house of Parliament that there were pressures on Jordan and no superpower to support him. If a public encounter with Mr. Rabin would serve Jordan's interests, he added, "I will not hesitate and I would consider that a duty."
Three days later, the King wrote Mr. Clinton that he was ready to invite Mr. Rabin to the opening of bilateral meetings between Israel and Jordan on July 18 on the border, as long as Washington was willing to support the forgiveness of Jordan's debt.
Mr. Clinton replied that the way to get the greatest impact from the meeting both in the Mideast and with Congress was to come to Washington. He did not state the obvious: that the realization of a major foreign policy success on the White House lawn would provide an immediate boost to Mr. Clinton's sagging popularity.
Neither the King nor Mr. Rabin objected.
 
10 Days to Communique
 On July 15 Mr. Clinton announced that the two leaders would meet for the first time in public on July 25 at the White House. That would let Washington codify points of agreement so the event would not be dismissed as a dressed-up photo opportunity.
But when Secretary Christopher arrived in the Middle East the following week with the draft declaration, he discovered that such help was not needed: Mr. Rabin and the King wanted to write the declaration themselves.
To allay the King's fear of a leak, a secret Israeli negotiating team set up shop in a Mossad site north of Tel Aviv where Mr. Rabin came to consult. Even Mr. Peres was left out.
So were the Americans. While Mr. Christopher, Mr. Peres and Jordan's Prime Minister, Abdel Salam al-Majali, met at a Dead Sea spa, the first time Israeli and Jordanian officials had met officially on Jordanian soil, a Christopher aide stayed behind in Amman to offer his ideas to Crown Prince Hassan. Every time the American side raised a point included in the American draft, the Crown Prince would say, "Yes, we've covered that."
Finally, last Sunday, Mr. Rabin showed the declaration to Mr. Christopher at the Israeli's suite at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. The Americans did not get an official copy of what would be called the Washington Declaration until 11 P.M. Sunday, just 12 hours before the ceremony.
 
Washington Follow-Up
Hussein Succeeds In a Key Demand
 When King Hussein and Mr. Rabin shook hands at the White House, they came not only as former adversaries, but by now also as old friends.
And it was not simply the history of the moment that was on their minds. After the handshake for the cameras, they retreated with Mr. Clinton to the White House cabinet room for their first official session together. They had many things to discuss.
The top item was cash -- how to get the Congress to wipe out Jordan's debt. After King Hussein explained once again the importance of this step, Mr. Rabin picked up on the theme and in his deep, slow baritone told the Americans: "It is essential."
In the days that followed, the Administration came up with a three-year plan to wipe away Jordan's debt to the United States, a gesture meant to free King Hussein to accelerate the pace of peace with Israel.
"As far as the future is concerned, for us to be able to get on with it, we have to receive the assistance of all those friends of ours to remove this burden," the King said in the interview. "Our people have got to feel -- apart from their conviction and commitment that peace is so important -- that peace means a change from where we are to where we should be."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Goes to Truman Land In Push to 'Give 'em Health'

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: INDEPENDENCE, Mo., July 30

 BODY:
Trying to draw some magic from the lodestar of political scrappers, President Clinton came to Harry Truman's hometown today to start a homestretch push for a health care bill that provides universal coverage.
Wrapping himself in the reputation of the first President to propose legislation to guarantee universal health insurance, Mr. Clinton likened the opponents of such legislation today to Truman's opponents. He said that both relied on appeals to division and fear. 
 "All this screaming and yelling, what's really hurting America today is that we're shouting too much and listening too little, and speaking in respectful tones too little," Mr. Clinton told a crowd of several thousand in the courthouse square.
Mr. Clinton tried to cast the health care fight as a battle against nay-sayers against the President. Speaking in front of a statue of Truman, whose feistiness has worn well with history, Mr. Clinton jabbed his finger into the podium and offered an impassioned defense of his overall record as President.
"They said we would wreck the economy," he said. "Instead we brought it back because we wouldn't give in to this hatred and rhetoric of division and destruction and we moved forward."
He said that just as Truman had to guide Americans in the transition after World War II, he was trying to guide Americans into the 21st century. Just as Mr. Truman faced attacks, Mr. Clinton said, he faces attacks.
"When people leave one era, when everybody can look at the future through the same set of glasses and they have to pick up another set of glasses to figure out how to understand things, we are always vulnerable," he said. "You think about your own life. Every time you've been asked to change you may have a mixture of hope and fear. And the real test every time is, are your fears going to overtake you and are you going to give in, or are you going to live by your hopes and your courage and charge forward and grow and become better? That is the test for the United States today."
Comparing the attacks on Mr. Truman to those he now faces, Mr. Clinton said: "What did they say? 'Harry Truman's a radical liberal. He's for socialized medicine. He's for big government. He's going to take this country down.'
"Well, the truth is, Harry Truman had Independence, Mo., values. He had this old-fashioned notion that we value work and family and faith. And people who work hard and play by the rules ought to help one another when they need it, ought to join together to help themselves and to help their children have a better life."
 
Political Double Date
 The President arrived holding hands with his wife, Hillary, and Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were right behind. It was the first time the two couples had gone on a political double date since the 1992 Presidential campaign. They hoped their appearance would provide a spritz of excitement for a final push for some version of a health care plan to be passed this year, as both the Senate and the House prepare to take up bills before their summer recess.
Mr. Clinton praised the bill unveiled on Friday by leaders of the House, and he stressed its differences from the plan he introduced in September, which has proved unpopular even with Americans who support its goals.
"It is simpler, more flexible, more sensitive to small business," the President said of the House bill. "Gone is the bureaucracy people didn't like. All Americans can keep their health plan and their doctor, and everybody will have coverage."
Though the final version of a health bill may no longer be in their control, the Clintons were still pushing one facet. "The bottom line is, the President wants universal coverage," said Ginny Terzano, a White House spokeswoman. "So he and the First Lady and the Gores and the Cabinet will be pushing Congress over the next two weeks to provide universal coverage."
The two White House couples met up with four buses that had traveled from Portland, Ore., as part of the Health Security Express, a caravan of health care supporters, paid by for unions and advocacy groups, wending its way to Washington with the message "Pass it now!" The caravan has been drawing less enthusiastic crowds than the one that inspired it, the Clinton-Gore campaign bus caravan, when the two men attracted so many admirers out this way that one newspaper crowned them the Heartthrobs of the Heartland.
Susan Crowthers, the mother of Rachel Crowthers, a teen-ager who has serious health problems, alluded today to the protests the caravan had attracted when she said it had experienced both affection and conflict.
As Rachel, who has cancer and epilepsy, talked to the crowd today, the jeers of the protesters outside the square could be clearly heard.
 
'She Kept Working
 Mrs. Gore, recalling the routine during the Presidential campaign, took the podium first to warm up the crowd. "Well, hello, I'm Tipper Gore and it's great to be back in the Show Me State," she said in her bubbly style.
Telling the crowd how much she loved the First Lady, she introduced Mrs. Clinton, pointing out that "she lost her father and that did not deter her -- she kept working day in, week out to help every single American" get health care coverage.
Then it was Mrs. Clinton's turn. She held up a letter she had been handed when they landed in Kansas City, Mo. The letter, she said, was from 8-year-old Jennifer Dawn Lucas and was written in pencil on stationery with a picture of the St. Louis Zoo train.
Jennifer told Mrs. Clinton that she had needed surgery as a baby because she had been born with a hole in her heart. "Insurance don't want to mess with me because I have a pacemaker," she wrote.
Holding up the letter, Mrs. Clinton told the crowd, "I don't want our country to have a hole in its heart anymore when it comes to taking care of sick children like Jennifer."
 
Attack on Dole Plan
 Vice President Gore made the blunt attack on the opposition. "What we don't need is Bob Dole's plan," he said. "It cripples the middle class; it hurts the middle class. It gives insurance companies the final say on what gets put in and left out. The Dole plan tells insurance companies it's all right to charge older Americans up to four times as much as younger Americans."
The crowd seemed to reflect the total range of support, opposition and confusion about health care. "Give 'Em Health, Hillary" signs warred with ones reading "Hillary's Health Care Makes Me Sick." As the Presidential motorcade turned to Osage Street from Truman Street, the White House delegation could see about 200 protesters lining the street, holding signs denouncing abortion coverage in the health plan and socialized medicine.
Gerry Ray Carl, a 57-year-old school bus driver from Independence who had managed to wangle six tickets to get inside the event, said she had not come to support the President on health care. But she had not come to oppose him either.
"I came to see Willie Nelson, what else?" Ms. Carl said.
Mr. Nelson performed his old favorites like "Whiskey River" and "Mama Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys" before the President spoke.
Margaret Emefiena, 47, a Kansas City secretary, held a protest sign that read, "Abortion is the ultimate child abuse."
Describing herself as part of the working poor, Ms. Emefiena said, "Government should not have no part in it; government should not take another dime out of my paycheck toward abortion or socialized medicine."
 
Inspired by Canada
 On the other hand, Vickie Riddle, 46, who was eating a bratwurst with mustard as she waited to get into the square, believed that the President was not going far enough. A social worker, she said that she wanted a system like the one the Canadians have, and that she was pleased to see one protester, a man with an anti-abortion placard, wearing a T-shirt that said, "Help, I've fallen and I can't reach the beer."
"That says it all," Ms. Riddle said, biting her bratwurst.
The White House planned today's event to evoke memories of the ceremony 29 years ago today, when President Lyndon B. Johnson flew to Independence to sign the Medicare-Social Security bill and offer a tribute to Truman, who was beaming at his side. Johnson chose Independence, as Mr. Clinton did, because Truman was the first President to propose a Federal program of health insurance under Social Security.
Mr. Clinton said today: "Folks, 60 years ago this fight started. "Fifty years ago, Truman tried it three times and failed. Twenty-nine years ago, President Johnson came to this city to sign Medicare into law and to give Harry and Bess Truman Medicare cards 1 and 2.
"Let's finish Harry Truman's fight. We're halfway home, and we can go all the way."

HEADLINE: The Push Is On for Link to Airports;
Port Authority Confident of Rail Plan Despite Opposition

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Standing before a plastic model of the sleek automated train the Port Authority plans to run from Manhattan to the airports in Queens, an elderly woman took one look during a public hearing last week and turned away. "It'll never happen," she said, in a sneer of weary dismissal.
Edward J. O'Sullivan, the director of the Port Authority's airport access program, rolled his eyes. 
 "That's what we're up against," said Mr. O'Sullivan, the rail link's most tireless promoter. "No one thinks you can build anything like this in New York anymore. But they're wrong. This time, it's going to get built."
A growing coalition of opponents and critics is working to thwart Mr. O'Sullivan's prediction, raising significant questions about the effect on neighborhoods and whether the proposal fits properly with the region's existing rail system.
Nonetheless, the Port Authority remains firmly, even sunnily optimistic about its $2.5 billion plan. First proposed three years ago, the project got favorable marks in an environmental impact review just completed by the Federal Aviation Administration and the New York State Department of Transportation.
If built and opened on schedule in 2003, it would be the city's largest transit project since the construction of the IND subway in the 1930's, and skeptics are already comparing it with such unfinished promises as the Second Avenue subway or the 63d Street Tunnel system. Many recall that rail service to LaGuardia and Kennedy International airports has been discussed and studied for more than 20 years, with the only concrete attempt -- the Transit Authority's unbeloved Train to the Plane -- shut down in 1990 after years of losses and low patronage.
But there is something quite different about this project, one that may give it a greater likelihood of completion: it has its own dedicated source of capital funds, quite separate from the shallow pool of tax money that pays for transit and road projects and can barely keep the subway system operating.
Since 1992, the F.A.A. has collected a $3 fee added to the ticket of every passenger at the three major regional airports. The funds can be used only for airport-related purposes, and the agency has ruled that improved access to the airports is an eligible purpose.
But there is one catch: such projects cannot serve general transportation uses; they can be used only by patrons or employees of the airports. That is why the Port Authority designed a system independent of the existing rail network. Though it allows transfers to and from the subway and Long Island Rail Road at several points, it would use incompatible trains, and it could not feasibly be used by riders whose trip does not begin or end at an airport. The one-way fare is expected to be comparable to express-bus fares, currently $9 to $12.
The line would begin at an underground station near East 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. Trains would move above ground just before the Queensboro Bridge, and would cross the East River on the lower outer roadways of the bridge. Through Queens, the trains would use existing railroad or highway right-of-way, first to LaGuardia (stopping at all the terminals except the Marine Air Terminal), then south to Kennedy.
In addition to the airports and 59th Street, there would also be stops and rail connections at Queens Plaza in Long Island City, Shea Stadium in Flushing, Jamaica station and Howard Beach. To conform to Federal limits on non-airport riders, the system would double the fare for anyone who did not start or stop at an airport. (Computerized turnstiles and fare cards would record where riders got on, and would demand extra money to get out.)
Anyone who has spent more than an hour and $45 to take a taxi from Manhattan to Kennedy can appreciate the lure of a comfortable train that will get to Kennedy in 35 minutes, or to LaGuardia in 12. For years, transportation planners have bemoaned the congestion and air pollution caused by airport traffic on the Van Wyck Expressway or the Grand Central Parkway, and economists have produced studies showing that the problem is hurting the region's economy and future growth. Travel time to Kennedy is the longest of the country's top 20 airports.
 
Integration Urged
 But many of those same planners are leery of the Port Authority's proposal. Because New York is in desperate need of improvements and expansions to its crumbling, overcrowded transit system, the idea of a 22-mile system strictly for airport passengers does not sit well with rail advocates. Many are urging the Port Authority to integrate its proposal better with the existing system.
Robert Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, notes that his private organization has long urged the construction of an airport rail link. But he agrees with East Side residents that the proposed 59th Street station would cause too much taxi and limousine congestion in the already overburdened area, and says the authority would be better off using existing transit links, like the 63d Street Tunnel, rather than remove car lanes from the Queensboro Bridge.
"The lower half of that tunnel was designed to bring railroad access into Grand Central Terminal," he said. "It's been sitting there unused for 20 years. We built it, we paid for it, it's ours. So let's use it."
Mr. O'Sullivan of the Port Authority said he would love to use the tunnel in order to begin the airport rail line at Grand Central. But he cited the Long Island Rail Road's figures that building the connection from Long Island City through the tunnel to the terminal would cost $2.4 billion, almost the cost of the entire airport rail system. And he said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had sent the Port Authority a letter saying the tunnel was not available for airport rail.
John Bennett, the L.I.R.R. vice president for infrastructure and systems, said the railroad hoped to use the lower half of the tunnel for its own trains to Grand Central, sometime after 2010. He urged the Port Authority to consider scaling back its plans, building only a rail system from Jamaica Station to Kennedy, and from the Woodside station to LaGuardia. Manhattan passengers could take regular L.I.R.R. trains to those stations and transfer, he said. (Proponents of the Port Authority plan say travelers with luggage will never transfer.)
 
Grand Cenral Platform
 William Wheeler, the head of planning for the railroad's parent body, the M.T.A., said the Port Authority should simply extend its tunnel from the planned 59th Street station around to Grand Central, thus alleviating the congestion and much of the political opposition from the East Side. But Mr. O'Sullivan said that would cost an extra $600 million and would not substantially change the congestion.
Given the disagreements between government bodies and the inevitable opposition from neighborhoods -- all part of what Mr. Yaro calls the "stylized Kabuki theater" of building public works in New York -- it is no wonder that proponents of the rail system are eager to run with a proposal that might actually be built, even if it is flawed. Much of the Queens business and political establishment is solidly behind the plan, despite the fears of some residents living near the route.
Claire Shulman, the Borough President of Queens, said the system would provide a vital boost to the borough's economy by improving the popularity of the airports and reducing congestion and air pollution. Aviation-related companies would be able to locate in struggling neighborhoods like Jamaica and still have easy access to the airports, she said.
"Those folks in Manhattan want to kill the project because of a few extra taxicabs," she said. "Well, we live with these airports every day of the week, with their congestion and their noise. I would hope they would have some sense of cooperation, considering that they are the ones who use these airports."
The impact study prepared by a consultant to the F.A.A. confirmed that Manhattan residents are the largest single bloc of airport patrons, constituting 48 percent of LaGuardia's market and 35 percent of Kennedy's. A quarter of all airport users, in fact, live in the two zip codes immediately adjacent to the 59th Street station. But the study also showed that of the 32,000 riders expected to use the system in 2003, 42 percent would get on at 59th Street, and most of those would get there by car.
 
Well-Organized Opponents
 Neighborhood residents fear those idling taxis, in combination with the loss of two lanes on the bridge, would make their streets permanently impassable. Wealthy and well-organized, they have already begun to enlist their politicians and to mount a strong campaign against the plan. In this effort, they have found natural allies in the airlines, which want to see the $3 ticket fee used exclusively for improvements at the airports themselves and are working with some of the neighborhood groups.
The system must still be reviewed by the city next year, and given the climate in New York, no one involved would be surprised to see a flurry of lawsuits once the plan moves toward detailed engineering work and bids in late 1995. Mr. O'Sullivan acknowledges that possibility, but is counting on the mystique of a fast train and an extensive public relations campaign -- including a staff that publishes a regular airport rail newsletter and has addressed hundreds of community meetings -- to sway a majority of the city.
"There is a logic to this that will appeal to most people," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "New York City has been trying for 40 years to implement some sort of air access system, and here we have a window of opportunity we have to take advantage of. If people step back from their parochial concerns, we can work together to minimize the intrusion on various neighborhoods and make this thing work."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE ADVOCATES;
Many Health Groups Fight House Democratic Leaders' Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
A broad assortment of doctors, hospitals, private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, state officials and big employers said today that they disliked a central element of the House Democratic leaders' health plan, which would more than double the size of the Federal Medicare program.
Under the proposal put forward Friday by the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Government would create a new Part C of Medicare, open to people who are unemployed, receive welfare, work part time or hold jobs at companies with fewer than 100 employees. The new program is one of the Democratic leaders' main tools to guarantee health insurance for all Americans. 
 Mr. Gephardt's proposal differs from President Clinton's plan because it calls for a new Federal program. The President's plan calls for private health insurance.
Democratic aides to the House Ways and Means Committee estimated that 40 million to 60 million people would join the new program. Experts at the Congressional Budget Office said enrollment might exceed 90 million in the year 2004. Medicare already finances health care for 32 million elderly people and 4 million who are disabled.
 
A Concern of Businesses
 The new Part C of Medicare is intended to solve one type of concern created by requiring all employers to buy health insurance for their employees. But in trying to minimize business opposition to the bill, House Democratic leaders have left some supporters of universal coverage deeply unhappy.
The National Governors' Association, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the Health Insurance Association of America, the Group Health Association of America and the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group that represents many Fortune 500 companies, criticized Mr. Gephardt's proposal to expand Medicare.
The proposal for a new Part C of Medicare confronts these groups with difficult questions of tactics and strategy. On the one hand, the groups share Mr. Gephardt's desire to expand coverage and control health costs, and they will fight to achieve these goals. But their deep reservations about the new Medicare program may cool their enthusiasm at a time when the White House is counting on them to lobby aggressively for the overall bill.
 
Option for Some Employees
 Mr. Gephardt's bill offers another option to people who work for companies with fewer than 100 employees: they can sign up for a private health plan offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The conservative Heritage Foundation described that program as "a showcase of consumer choice," and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said today that he liked this feature of the Gephardt bill.
But Mr. Dole scorned the proposal for a new Part C of Medicare, saying it would enlarge the Government's role to an unacceptable degree. Nearly half of all Americans would be enrolled in some type of Medicare program, he said.
Mr. Gephardt's hopes for success depend on moderate Democrats. Representative Jim Cooper, a conservative Tennessee Democrat, said: "In many respects, the leadership bill is more liberal than the Clinton bill. Part C of Medicare would lead to a single-payer system for about half the U.S. population." In a single-payer system, the Government raises taxes to pay medical bills, and there is little role for private insurers.
 
Hospitals' Opposition
 Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said there were several arguments against Part C of Medicare. First, he said, hospitals are rushing to link up with doctors, clinics and other hospitals in health care networks that can provide a full range of services to customers.
"The new Medicare program moves in the opposite direction," he said. "It perpetuates the fragmented fee-for-service system" in which hospitals are paid separately for each admission and patients can go to virtually any doctor.
Moreover, Mr. Pollack said, hospitals have had 12 years' experience with a process in which Congress sets Medicare payment rates, and they do not like it.
"Medicare rates are set in the middle of the night behind closed doors, based on what's necessary to meet deficit-reduction targets that have nothing to do with health policy," he said.
 
Same Method of Payment
 Under the new Medicare program proposed by Mr. Gephardt, doctors and hospitals would be paid in the same way they are now paid under the regular Medicare program.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said the new Medicare program "would perpetuate cost-shifting to the private sector" because Medicare pays less than most private insurance plans.
If the new Medicare program was limited to companies with fewer than 20 employees, he said, "it would be more palatable, though not necessarily acceptable."
Supporters of the Medicare C plan say it is crucial to the political and practical success of the bill.
 
No Haggling With Insurers
 It does give small employers a relatively easy way to get insurance for their workers; they will not have to haggle with private insurers. And it gives people a way to pool their purchasing power without forcing them to join the purchasing cooperatives, or alliances, proposed by President Clinton.
The main argument for Part C of Medicare is that it is simple to administer and easy to understand because it is modeled on Medicare, which has become immensely popular with beneficiaries since it was created in 1965. "Medicare is simple: no new rules, no new bureaucracy," said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, the chief architect of Part C.
But Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, criticized Part C of Medicare as "a huge expansion of a Government program." It "fragments the market and picks people out of the big insurance pools we are trying to build," she said.
 
'Insurer of Last Resort'
 Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Stark evidently believe that "the Government needs to establish an insurer of last resort, a safety net available to small employers," said Ms. Lehnhard. But, she said, that view was wrong because the health care legislation moving through Congress would require insurers to provide coverage to all applicants at standard rates, regardless of any medical problems they might have.
When the Federal Government imposes such requirements, she said, "every health insurance company, every managed care company will be an insurer of last resort."
The National Governors' Association criticized the Gephardt plan on the grounds that it would limit states' flexibility to deal with health care costs.

HEADLINE: Last Flight Out of Haiti Strands Some

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 30

 BODY:
Haiti's last commercial air link to the rest of the world was severed today. The final regularly scheduled flight, an Air France jet bound for French Guiana, departed just ahead of a Monday deadline that was intended to increase both the economic pressure on the country's military-backed government and its isolation.
Though the suspension of commercial flights does not affect the vast majority of Haiti's seven million people, most of whom are too poor to afford foreign travel, it promises to have an important psychological impact, especially on the country's commercial and governing class. 
 "We are sealed in, the whole country," Raymond Lafontant, executive director of the Association of Haitian Industries, said in an interview Friday. "I have a sense I am in jail."
 
Looking for Letter-Carriers
 Aware that the flight was their last chance to leave or to ship cargo abroad, many Haitians arrived at the airport early, including some who did not intend to travel but were merely looking for passengers willing to carry letters.
Radio stations here, citing postal officials, have been saying in recent days that mail deliveries to and from foreign destinations will have to be suspended unless the Government finds a way to bring in mail from overseas aboard charter flights.
In a radio interview this afternoon, a postal official said the Government hoped soon to begin using boats to bring in overseas mail. But he also said it was proving difficult to find shipping companies willing to take on the job, because they feared problems with American naval vessels patrolling just offshore.
Originally, Air France refused to join American Airlines and other carriers that suspended their flights to Port-au-Prince on June 25 as part of the economic sanctions against Haiti. But when the Haitian military expelled a combined United Nations and Organization of American States human rights monitoring mission on July 11, France retaliated by announcing that service would end by Aug. 1.
 
Mothers Seeks to Get Home
 At the airport this morning, the police allowed only passengers with confirmed reservations or boarding passes to enter the terminal, turning away more than a score of people who arrived with valid tickets only to be told their seats had been given to others. Among them was Yolande Brunache, who was planning to fly to Cayenne, French Guiana, to join her husband and year-old son.
"I don't know what to do now," Ms. Brunache, 31, said, clearly stunned after being turned away at the terminal entrance by an Air France ticket agent. "This is the last flight, and I have got to get on it."
In a similar situation was Erla Desrameaux, who flew here from her home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn last month to care for her 22-year-old daughter, who was ill at the time. Ms. Desrameaux, 48, a housekeeper at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, said she had bought a ticket with an open return but had been unable to reserve a ticket back to New York, where she has lived for 25 years.
"For the last three weeks I've come out to the airport every day there has been a flight, but every day it's been the same thing," she said. "I need to get back, because I have an 11-year-old son who I left with a friend, and he needs his mother."
As the deadline for the suspension of service approached, plane reservations became a coveted black market item, trading for more than 10 times their face value.
 
U.S. Hopes to Charter Flight
 On Wednesday's flight, American officials here said, Air France bumped about 100 Haitian political refugees who have been granted asylum in the United States to give seats to other customers, many of whom appeared to be French nationals.
A man who identified himself as the Air France manager here, but declined to give his name, refused to discuss the company's ticketing procedures. "My company says no interviews here, only in Paris," he said.
American Embassy officials said they hoped to obtain permission from the military government for charter flights that would take those refugees, and more than 1,000 others whose applications for political asylum are being processed here, to the United States. "We are confident that will happen," Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the embassy, said earlier this week.
Also left behind are a large group of foreigners. Diplomats here estimate that about 3,000 Americans, 2,000 Canadians and 1,500 Britons are in the country, most of them residents who remain willingly.
 
Consulate Closes Doors
 In addition, the American consulate has closed its doors as of Friday. From now on, United States officials here said, the consulate will no longer grant visas of any type to Haitians, and will only be open to provide emergency services to American citizens.
The United Nations embargo of Haiti is likely to tighten even further next month, when an international force is expected to begin patrolling the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. With American vessels sailing the waters off Haiti and interdicting shipments of goods proscribed by the sanctions, the country has been receiving essential items like gasoline mostly through that porous land frontier.
But the United States has authorized $15 million to improve the policing of that border, and is ready to send helicopters, vehicles and technical advisers as part of the effort. American officials said an agreement with the Dominicans had been in the works for several weeks and was awaiting the approval of President Joaquin Balaguer, who in the past has been friendly to the Haitian military.

HEADLINE: After Carjacking Surge, Puerto Rico Is Wary Behind the Wheel

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R.

 BODY:
Whenever she goes out now, Nellie Pena pulls her long hair up in a bun and takes off her earrings. The windows of her 1983 Camaro have been tinted dark.
"That way they can't tell a woman is driving," the 52-year-old Ms. Pena said.
Jorge Mate, 23, routinely circles the block around his condominium at least once before parking on the street. He is always ready to jam down on the gas pedal. 
 "I look at people more," he said. "I'm more attentive to the clothes they are wearing. If a guy is wearing his shirt untucked, he could have a gun in the back."
Ms. Pena and Mr. Mate are both recent victims of carjackings, and they are not alone in feeling somewhat paranoid. Those who have never confronted an armed car thief here almost invariably know others who have, and the risk of getting in and out of the car is by now so ingrained in the collective psyche that it has changed driving and social habits. For many, it often dictates whether to go out after dark.
In 1992, the latest year for which comparative figures are available, San Juan was second only to Los Angeles in the number of carjackings and led all major American cities in carjackings per capita, officials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Puerto Rico said. Los Angeles, a city of more than 3.4 million people, had 7,187 carjackings that year; San Juan, with a population of less than 450,000, had 3,192. The authorities say an export market in the Caribbean and Latin America helps make the crime particularly prominent here.
 
The Fear Persists
 Since 1992, when the taking of a vehicle with a firearm was made a Federal crime, with penalties of up to life in prison, the number of carjackings in Puerto Rico has dropped dramatically, police statistics show. There were 4,522 carjackings in Puerto Rico in 1993, compared with 8,669 the previous year. And the number is likely to fall further this year: the totals for each of the first five months of the year were lower than the corresponding figures from 1993.
But many Puerto Ricans have barely noticed the decline. The crime is still so prevalent that one newspaper, El Vocero, a tabloid, tracks the number of carjackings daily in a box on its second page.
"I don't believe there are fewer carjackings," said Carmen Gutierrez, 55, who had just made her husband drive three times around the parking lot of the Plaza Las Americas mall until he found a spot near a store entrance. "The other day they stole 23 cars in one day. I heard it on the radio."
About 80 percent of the armed thefts occur in San Juan and its metropolitan area, and it is here that residents are the most apprehensive. In June the island was powerfully reminded of the danger when Jose Jaime Pierluisi, 28, an economic affairs adviser to Gov. Pedro Rossello, was shot to death shortly before midnight during a car theft in front of his home in San Juan's affluent Condado section as he returned from seeing his girlfriend.
 
Changing Routines
 Two years ago, the father of Mayor Hector Luis Acevedo of San Juan was also shot dead during an attempted carjacking in Rio Piedras, in the southeast part of the capital.
"The Pierluisi case reminds us that we're all vulnerable," Governor Rossello, who declared three days of national mourning, said.
Drivers have made adjustments, big and small. Some now keep their car keys separate from other keys in case they have to hand them over quickly. Many avoid late movies or nighttime stops to make telephone calls or use cash machines.
Fear has also helped drive up sales of cellular telephones and sophisticated security systems. One car alarm company, Asset Conservation, has been advertising a system in which the driver reports a carjacking to a computer command center. The center then sends a computer message to a communications satellite to turn off the ignition and make the car lights flash and the horn blow.
So far, 300 drivers have paid $595 each, with a monthly fee of $15, for the product, the company said.
Mr. Rossello, who was elected on an anti-crime platform and has undertaken policies like increasing the police force and complementing it with National Guard troops, said the car thefts were a manifestation of a drug problem that was also responsible for a disproportionately high homicide rate. The authorities say crime on the island has dramatically increased in the last decade as Puerto Rico has become the major entry point for drugs from South America into the United States.
As in other places, carjackings became fashionable here partly as security systems made it harder to steal unoccupied vehicles. But unlike in the states, where most carjacked vehicles are recovered, less than 20 percent of the stolen cars reappear here, F.B.I. officials said. There is an export market for the stolen vehicles in Latin America and the Caribbean, the officials and the police said, and the cars are often chopped for parts or shipped whole.
 
Cracking Down
 Superintendent Pedro A. Toledo, head of the Puerto Rico police, called carjacking "an extremely serious problem" but said he expected the downward trend to continue because of heightened public awareness and vigilance. Mr. Toledo said the authorities had begun random inspections of junkyards, chop shops and car fairs to make it harder on the thieves to profit from the thefts. There is also a 25-member carjacking task force of F.B.I. agents and police officers to investigate cases that involve the use of a firearm.
Most carjackings involve handguns, but injuries and deaths are unusual, police and F.B.I. officials said. Most carjackings occur between 7 P.M. and 6 A.M., near stores and gas stations, the police said.
 
Fighting the Paranoia
 Ms. Pena, an administrative assistant, said she was on her way to buy milk with a neighbor in the early evening last December when she stopped on the shoulder of the road to check a tire. She said a man came running toward her, pulled out a gun and ordered her and her neighbor to lie on the ground.
He took Ms. Pena's keys, her purse and her 1983 Camaro. The car was recovered, but Ms. Pena said she is still a wreck. She said she no longer goes out after dark.
"I've lost interest in everything," she said.
Some residents are more nonchalant, shrugging off carjackings as part of the price of living in the city.
"What city in the world isn't dangerous?" asked Jose Soto, 57, a former manager with a car rental company.
Frank Corey, who moved from Chicago with his wife and four children to work on the island for three years as manager for a household product company, said he still drove with his windows down. He said that "almost everybody I know has been carjacked, most in broad daylight" but that he refused to be intimidated.
"The paranoia to me is worse than the carjackings," Mr. Corey, 44, said. "Everybody is so scared."
Oscar Morales, 40, an optometrist, agreed. That is why he left the city last year to move to Cabo Rojo, on the southwestern tip of the island.
Mr. Morales said he was the victim of a carjacking in 1989 as he dropped off his girlfriend at 11 P.M. The two men who took his car later robbed a gas station and a night watchman. The two were arrested, and he helped identify and convict them.
But Mr. Morales said the incident traumatized him more than he had expected. "The experience left me with fear," he said. "I was always looking over my shoulder, always on the defensive."
Now in Cabo Rojo, he said, he is so carefree that sometimes he leaves his car doors unlocked.
"You're not constantly thinking about carjackings," he said. "The change was obvious."

HEADLINE: 13 Years Later, an Arrest in a Manhattan Doctor's Slaying

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Nearly 13 years ago, Dr. John Chase Wood Jr., a 31-year-old resident in surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, was accosted by three young men as he strode back to the hospital from dinner at home nearby with his pregnant wife.
One brandished a gun, and they demanded his money. Dr. Wood, a tall, husky man who played spirited rugby and elegant classics and jazz on the French horn, apparently resisted, and there was a brief scuffle. One shot was fired, and Dr. Wood, struck in the heart, died an hour later in the hospital where he worked. 
 The assailants took his wallet -- a few credit cards and $5 in cash -- and fled from a moment of madness that destroyed a promising life, shattered a family, stunned colleagues and friends and stirred outrage in a city that had seen too much senseless killing.
Scores of detectives joined an investigation that went on for months. In the meantime, the doctor's widow, Diana Newton Wood, gave birth to a boy in March 1982. But gradually the leads and headlines faded, and hopes for tracing the suspects dwindled. Even so, Detective Jerry Giorgio never gave up.
And yesterday, after years of checking hundreds of sources and leads, 30-year-old Patrick McDowell, an unemployed Washington Heights janitor who spent 10 of the last 13 years in prison for another killing, was charged with the murder of Dr. Wood.
Mr. McDowell, married and the father of three children, was seized by the police after a foot chase Friday morning and was found in possession of a gun and two bags of marijuana, the police said. After long questioning in which he may have tripped himself up, the police hinted, he was charged early yesterday.
 
The Crucial Link
 "I've often described this case as a big jigsaw puzzle," Detective Giorgio said at a news conference at the 34th Precinct station house. "It came down to talking to neighborhood people -- friends and associates of the suspect -- and hoping at some point that a person might just walk in wishing to discuss the case."
But in the end, it was apparently the suspect himself who provided the police with the crucial missing piece. "McDowell made a statement -- it was not a confession," Detective Giorgio said. He declined to give details, but the suspect apparently said something that the police felt no one but the killer might have known.
Relatives of Mr. McDowell expressed doubt yesterday that he had killed Dr. Wood. They acknowledged that his past had been troubled, but said he had become a Jehovah's Witness since his release from prison in April 1992 and had held various jobs, including one as a cleaner at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center -- an assertion that was denied by the hospital and was not confirmed by the police.
Mr. McDowell had long been a suspect in the case. Detective Giorgio said he came to his attention early in 1982, when he questioned him in another killing, and had since closely tracked his movements, in and out of prison. He also said investigators believed that Mr. McDowell fired the shot that killed the doctor, and that they had identified the two other suspects, who are still being sought.
Dr. Wood's widow, now an anesthesiologist at a Boston hospital, was told of the arrest, as were his parents, who live in Yardley, Pa. Diana Wood yesterday recalled days of trauma in the aftermath of her husband's killing and years of struggle to raise a child and rebuild her life with the help of relatives and friends of the slain doctor, whose life and career at the time of his death appeared to hold outstanding promise.
 
Wife Was a Nurse
 A graduate of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, he had been a pediatric resident at Presbyterian Hospital for three years and a resident in surgery for two years, and planned to specialize in pediatric surgery. His wife, a nurse at the hospital, was five months pregnant with their first child.
At 8:45 P.M. on Nov. 2, 1981, clad in his physician's white jacket and trousers and a green surgical shirt, he was returning to work at the hospital at 168th Street and Broadway from dinner at his apartment nearby when the thugs approached him on Riverside Drive at 165th Street, one drew a .22-caliber pistol and the robbery and fatal shooting occurred.
While the killers escaped, a half-dozen witnesses to the shooting were found by police officers canvassing the neighborhood. They were unable to identify possible suspects from police photo files, however, and within months the trail seemed to grow cold.
In February 1982, Detective Giorgio, then a member of the Manhattan homicide squad, arrested Mr. McDowell, then 18, for killing Gina Martin, a Playboy bunny, in a robbery in the lobby of her apartment building on East 55th Street on Dec. 10, 1981. Mr. McDowell admitted shooting the woman but called it an accident, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and drew a 10-year prison term.
The sentence was served in various state prisons, including the Fishkill Correctional Facility, where relatives said Mr. McDowell took college courses and in 1990 received a certificate in juvenile justice from Marist College in Poughkeepsie. His brother-in-law, David Williams, said Mr. McDowell made the dean's list in 1989.
 
Hundreds of Interviews
 While Mr. McDowell gave his address as 800 Riverside Drive, where some of his relatives live, Mr. Williams said he actually lives elsewhere in the area with his wife, Carmella, and three children, a 13-year-old girl and 2-year-old and 4-month-old boys.
Detective Giorgio, 60, a 35-year police veteran who joined the 34th Precinct eight years ago and worked on Dr. Wood's murder with Detective Robert Small, gave few details yesterday of the effort to track Mr. McDowell, beyond saying that the investigation involved hundreds of interviews with potential witnesses, countless hours of surveillance and cooperation by state parole authorities and other police agencies.
The arrest appeared to mark the end of an obsession. "I didn't think about it every day," the detective said, but he added, "I certainly thought about it every week." Many times, he said, he took his thick file on the case to prosecutors for review, only to be told to get more evidence.
Detective Giorgio said the break came unexpectedly Friday morning after two 34th Precinct police officers, William Mendez and James Hosey, were told by a group of people on a corner in Washington Heights that a man in a gray suit and red tie had just threatened them with a 9-millimeter pistol.
Several blocks away, they saw a suspect, who fled at their approach. They jumped out of their car, gave chase and captured Mr. McDowell in front of 504 West 157th Street. Nearby, they said, they found a discarded 9-millimeter pistol and in the suspect's pocket two bags of marijuana.
Detective Giorgio soon learned that the man he suspected in Dr. Wood's murder had been picked up, and joined in interviewing the suspect throughout the day at the 34th Precinct station house. Shortly after midnight Mr. McDowell was taken to central booking at One Police Plaza in lower Manhattan.
There he was charged with second-degree murder and robbery in Dr. Wood's death, and with possession of a weapon and marijuana.
The police said they had roughly known Mr. McDowell's whereabouts and had made enough progress in their investigation that they would have arrested him within weeks. But proceeding with the gun charge first might have complicated a murder case, they said, so they charged him with murder right away. "There was no way I wanted to lose him in the court system," Detective Giorgio said.
Relatives, including Mr. McDowell's brother-in-law, Mr. Williams, expressed skepticism over the allegations. They said he had not been in trouble since his release from prison, insisted he had nothing to do with drugs or guns, and said that his troubled life had been lifted by commitments to education and religion.
 
'Mountain Out of a Molehill'
 Mr. Williams said Mr. McDowell hoped to help troubled youths and recently registered for September classes at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. His arrest, Mr. Williams said, had stunned the family. "We're in shock," he said. "We don't want nothing to happen to him. Because of what he's been through in the past they can take little things that happen and make a mountain out of a molehill."
But to Detective Giorgio, the arrest was the end of a long quest. "I think it's a rhetorical question," he said when asked about his feelings. Then, beaming, he added: "Just look at me and you can tell."

HEADLINE: Latin Nations at U.N. Delay Resolution on Haiti Invasion

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 30

 BODY:
Latin American and Caribbean nations are delaying United Nations approval of the Clinton Administration's proposal for the possible invasion of Haiti if sanctions fail to remove the military Government from power.
The key resolution would in effect allow the United States to invade and occupy Haiti, the first such invasion in the Western Hemisphere that would have Security Council support. 
 The resolution would approve the creation of an invasion force composed mainly of United States troops, ships and planes under American command.
The force would be allowed to take control of the country, disarm the Haitian armed forces, unseat the ruling military junta, and finally try to restore the country's constitutional Government with United Nations help. But general objections and questions about the details have led to a series of changes in the proposal.
The mounting objections over the course of the week seemed to reflect ineptness by the United States, said a Latin American delegate, who insisted on anonymity. "In the United Nations it is very hard to vote against the United States," he said, adding that he expected the United States resolution would eventually be approved in some form.
 
First Draft Raises Questions
 A first draft of the resolution was passed around here last Monday by the United States, which has worked for months to gain support from Latin American nations and commitments to take part in a post-invasion peacekeeping force. But the wording immediately raised questions about why force is necessary, what guarantees there would be that a democratic Government would be installed, why other nations should get involved in an American political issue -- the influx of Haitian refugees -- and who would pay for the operation.
 
A Question of Imperialism
 Beyond those questions, the old issue of Yanqui imperialism started to bubble up again. The 33 countries of the Caribbean and Latin America represented in the United Nations pull much more weight than would seem evident from their collective gross national product.
They are deeply involved in the North-South division of the world into the economic haves and have-nots. A multiplier effect is at work, and these countries have kindred spirits in Africa and Asia, where even a hint of colonialism is abhorrent.
In the middle of the week United States officials denied that anything was amiss, although they conceded that there might be a few ruffled feathers. They said they would deal with the objections by amending the resolution.
But in seeking to please everyone the United States may have made things worse. The resolution was rewritten over and over.
 
'The Rolling Resolution'
 After the sixth rewrite, a chagrined United States diplomat started calling it "the rolling resolution."
Some delegates felt that they were being manipulated and pressured by the Americans, and the undercurrent of unhappiness came into the open. On Thursday a regional bloc within the United Nations, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries, met to consider what action, if any, should be taken.
Participants in the meeting said that many representatives -- including those from Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Belize, Cuba and the Dominican Republic -- opposed the idea of an invasion.
The objections go back to William Walker's illegal expeditions into Central America in the 1850's. A dozen other American invasions in the region, including the occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934, were capped most recently by incursions into Grenada and Panama.
At the meeting, Cuba and Mexico objected to the plan. The chief United States delegate, Madeleine K. Albright, left the meeting, although the representative from Argentina, which was supporting Washington's position, urged her to remain.
After the meeting Venezuela demanded and eventually got a letter sent from the exiled Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali that called for "swift and determined action" to restore his presidency. The letter was believed to be swinging several votes in favor of the resolution.
Argentina contended that backing the United States resolution was a practical solution to a messy problem, but few others did. When the meeting broke up, some of those who had not spoken started referring to themselves as "the silent majority" because while they did not like what Washington wanted they could not afford to oppose it.

HEADLINE: A Deficit Revisited

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
He came into office promising to be the Mayor who finally seized control of New York City's finances. And in his first budget, he closed a $2.3 billion gap, cut spending by $1.1 billion and pared 15,000 municipal jobs.
But for all that, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani still found himself under attack last week, accused of not having done nearly enough to solve New York City's financial problems. In a series of rebukes, the city's fiscal monitors said that even if this year's budget held together, New York still faced a budget gap of $2 billion next year and ever-larger ones down the road. 
 The problem really is simple. For all its austerity, Mr. Giuliani's budget has not solved the recurring gap between the amount of money the city raises from taxes and fees, and the amount it plans to spend -- a fiscal reality known as the "permanent deficit" or "structural imbalance."
But righting the imbalance is no easy task, arguably one the Mayor does not even have the power to fix by himself. Much of the city's budget is controlled by others.
The fact is that almost two-thirds of the $31.6 billion budget is already earmarked, by law or by lawsuit, for specific services, from helping the poor to paying off the municipal debt, leaving precious little room for Mr. Giuliani to maneuver.
Reduce the skyrocketing costs of paying health and pension benefits for municipal workers? The unions have to agree, and just slashing jobs saves too little money to keep up with the growth. Cut the city's share of soaring Medicaid costs? Mr. Giuliani and mayors before him have gone pleading to the state Legislature before, and they have failed.
 
Others Have Tried and Failed
 "He's beginning to learn the lesson," said Norman Steisel, the former First Deputy Mayor under David N. Dinkins, whose stewardship of the budget encountered the same criticisms -- and frustrations -- that Mr. Giuliani is facing.
Mr. Giuliani, the Republican who has sought to show he is more fiscally adept than his Democratic predecessors, says he is "reinventing government" to make it more efficient, that he is forcing the city to live within its means.
He points to his efforts to merge New York's three police forces and to turn over jobs like running hospitals and parks to private companies. And, indeed, fiscal watchdogs praise him for those steps, although they say that he has not provided enough details of his plans.
He also says that only so much can be done in one year.
"I can tell you that you cannot solve the structural deficit that has built up over the years in this city in one fiscal year," Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said. "This administration in six months has taken enormous steps to make sure that happens in the future."
But the fiscal monitors -- the New York State Financial Control board and the state Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, whose reports are expected to be echoed this week by the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi -- all said that the Mayor had done little to resolve the problem.
Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the control board, pointed out as an example that the reduction of 15,000 jobs saved $450 million, but added that was barely enough to keep up with the growing salaries and benefits of the workers who remained.
"At some point, you can't cut any more people," Mr. Proctor said. "You have to address the growth in costs."
The board's analysis found that Mr. Giuliani produced a budget with $100 million less in spending than the year before, but the city's expenditures are projected to grow at least 2.5 percent, not including costs of new labor settlements, between now and 1998. At the same time, the city's tax revenue is projected to grow 1.4 percent -- and that is before the tax cuts Mr. Giuliani has promised.
That means that, by the board's estimate, the city's budget gaps start at $2.5 billion next year and grow to $3 billion and $3.3 billion in the years after that -- deficits higher than those under Mr. Dinkins.
To do that, many experts say, the Mayor has to slow the increase in benefits for workers, reduce Medicaid outlays and lower the cost of servicing the debt, which means borrowing less to fix schools or potholes.
And as Mr. McCall's report put it, those problems "are largely beyond the city's control and are likely to continue for the foreseeable future." Without huge reductions in services, the state Comptroller said, the Mayor's plan to cut taxes appeared in doubt.
Mr. Giuliani has few options because he cannot keep balancing the books by cutting spending the city controls -- on everything from parks to the police -- which this year totaled about $11 billion of the $31.6 billion budget.
 
Dinkins Ideas Discounted
 A panel of experts convened by Mayor Dinkins last year offered a menu of alternatives, including charging fees for garbage collection and tolls on the East River bridges, to resolve the long-term gaps. But Mr. Giuliani dismissed those recommendations as "old thinking," limiting his options even further.
By all appearances, Mr. Giuliani seems to rest his chances for fiscal success on his ability to get help from Albany and Washington, from the unions and, perhaps most important, from a revival of the city's economy.
In the meantime, he has his hands full keeping this year's budget balanced. Already, some of his major initiatives have moved more slowly than anticipated, having encountered the inertia of municipal government.
His pledge to cut the number of jobs financed entirely by the city by 15,000, to 201,000 -- which he made to secure $200 million from the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to pay for severance costs -- is a case in point.
The number of workers actually rose to more than 217,000 in March, despite a hiring freeze he had imposed. The Mayor also had to suspend job cuts in the Human Resources Administration after advocates filed suits contending that he had no plan to preserve services for welfare recipients. Thus, even after almost 6,000 workers accepted severance to quit their jobs, the Mayor still has a payroll of 211,000 -- with 10,000 more jobs to cut in the next 11 months.
Further, his ability to redeploy workers from department to department, a right he won from the unions as part of the severance deal that was hailed by the monitors as one of his most important structural changes, has so far succeeded in transferring only five mechanics from the Department of Sanitation to the Department of Correction.
"The Mayor is clearly committed to reducing bureaucracy," an administration official remarked. "The bureaucracy has its own ways."

HEADLINE: Skirmish on Welfare Plan Highlights the Chasm Between Right and Left

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Congress concluded its first round of welfare skirmishing this week, ending four days of hearings in which members rained insults on each other, their witnesses and President Clinton's proposal to overhaul the system.
As expected, Republicans accused Mr. Clinton of offering a soft measure that did too little to demand work or discourage out-of-wedlock birth. 
 But more surprising were the harsh attacks from Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, an influential Democrat whose wife, Doris, is a senior White House official responsibile for building support for the President's programs. Leading the liberal opposition to the bill, Mr. Matsui accused Administration officials of using "hot rhetoric" to score political points at the expense of poor children.
Mr. Clinton's welfare plan has been central to his claim of being a "new Democrat," and it represents a test of his ability to forge centrist coalitions. He wants to expand training programs for welfare recipients but require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program.
Taken at face value, the week's hearings, before a House Ways and Means subcommittee, suggests that Mr. Clinton faces an uphill battle. Democrats insulted Republicans, both insulted witnesses, and witnesses responded with professions of outrage. All sides maintained that they had the best interests of children in mind.
"There is no consensus at all on this stuff," Mr. Matsui said.
 
Posturing vs. Disagreement
 But the subcommittee may be more divided than the Congress at large, and it remains difficult to distinguish deep disagreements from election-year posturing. Mr. Clinton's plan has gotten a respectful reception from centrist Democrats.
And a Republican alternative shares the basic outline of a two-year limit, followed by a work program. The Republicans would phase in the work requirements faster, with fewer exemptions, and finance their plan with deep cuts in programs for legal immigrants.
"We're arguing over the stuff at the margins," said Avis Lavelle, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. "Now these are important things at the margins, and, as we can see from the hearings, they produce great emotions. But I think there is more in common than these hearings would suggest."
While that is a plausible assessment, few participants are predicting that a bill will pass before Congress adjourns this fall. Republicans appear reluctant to hand Mr. Clinton an election-year victory, and the President wants to avoid a fight that could detract from his effort to pass a health care bill.
The bickering began on Tuesday when Mr. Matsui conducted a harsh examination of David T. Ellwood, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services and one of the main architects of the Clinton plan.
 
Supporting Data Is Lacking
 Mr. Matsui asked Mr. Ellwood, a former Harvard professor, to specify the scientific research that suggests that a two-year limit would help recipients. Mr. Ellwood offered none.
Mr. Matsui also attacked Mr. Ellwood for referring to welfare as a "check-writing system," saying the phrase insulted poor women and children.
"I don't think that David Ellwood would have gone before a group of senior citizens and said that Social Security is a big check-writing machine," the Congressman said. "But it's easy to attack welfare recipients that way."
Mr. Matsui continued the attacks on Friday, saying that Mr. Ellwood had insulted recipients by questioning their motives for seeking aid. By contrast, he said, some people might question Mr. Ellwood's motives by suggesting he is "pushing welfare this year to enhance his resume." Mr. Matsui added, "We would never suggest that."
Mr. Ellwood declined on Friday to comment. "He just feels sort of beat up right now, and he's not going to get into it," Ms. Lavelle said.
On Wednesday, the Democrats stopped fighting among themselves and started fighting with Republicans. Representative Harold E. Ford, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on Human Resources, was arguing that the welfare program is inexpensive, with the Federal share costing less than $20 billion a year.
 
Political Motive Is Seen
 Representative Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican running for the Senate, called the figure misleading. He said that when other aid programs like Medicaid and food stamps were added, the costs soared to more than $200 billion a year.
Mr. Ford exploded, saying, "You're not going to use this as a senatorial platform on welfare and the poor."
Mr. Santorum said Mr. Ford also mispronounced his name, calling him "Santorium or Sanitorium." He said Mr. Ford later apologized and asked that the remarks be stricken from the hearing record.
Mr. Clinton's bill drew more criticism on Friday, this time from Representative Kweisi Mfume, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Black Caucus. The bill's provisions for job creation are "woefully inadequate," Mr. Mfume said, and the time limit could punish recipients who need assistance through "no fault of their own."
 
Conservative Is Ridiculed
 The sharpest disagreements came in a questioning of Charles Murray, a conservative researcher who argues that welfare promotes out-of-wedlock births. Mr. Murray advocates the abolition of the welfare system, saying it would immediately cut in half the number of out-of-wedlock births.
The Democrats were eager to discredit Mr. Murray, who has become increasingly influential in the past year. Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan, ridiculed Mr. Murray's recent statement that men had as much responsibility toward out-of-wedlock births as "a piece of chocolate cake has in determining whether a woman gains weight."
Mr. Murray said he was simply criticizing laws that denied men a say in decisions about adoption and abortion. He accused Mr. Levin of offering "an outrageous misrepresentation of what I have said."
Representative Michael J. Kopetski, Democrat of Oregon, then joined in the fray, criticizing Mr. Murray's use of the phrase, "illegitimate child."
"I believe every child is legitimate in the eyes of God," Mr. Kopetski said.
Mr. Kopetski argued that a nation without welfare would begin to look like Bombay, with starving children stalking the streets. Mr. Murray repeated his view that Government programs had only made things worse. "What is happening today to children in the United States is scandalous," Mr. Murray said.

HEADLINE: G.I.'s Tally Macedonian Traffic Flow

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TABANOVCE, Macedonia

 BODY:
"I understand what's going on," said Sgt. Scott Culver, as he gazed down from the small American Army camp here at a long line of trucks waiting to cross the border into Serbia. "You don't need a Ph.D. for that."
What was going on, as it does every day, was that the United Nations trade embargo on Serbia was being violated. Dozens of trucks loaded with merchandise were heading north into Serbia, meticulously observed by United States soldiers of the 2d Battalion of the 15th Infantry Division, based in Schweinfurt, Germany. 
 Over the past 24 hours, Sergeant Culver and Staff Sgt. Charles Inderrieden had logged six oil trucks, 34 regular trucks and two double trailer-trucks heading north, and 71 cargo cars on a train going into Serbia from Macedonia. They had also observed and reported 68 cargo cars going south from Serbia into Macedonia, and a few donkeys with carts heading in both directions.
"It's not my job to wonder why," Sergeant Inderrieden said. "If I'm told to count it, I count it."
The bizarre scene at this shabby border crossing underscores the complexity of United States policy toward the former Yugoslavia. Committed to the stability of Macedonia -- the most southern of the former Yugoslav republics -- the Clinton Administration has dispatched a battalion of soldiers as part of a United Nations force.
 
Turning a Blind Eye
 But that very stability depends in part on turning a blind eye to Macedonia's growing trade with Serbia, one of the few economic outlets for this landlocked country whose southern border has been sealed to trade by the Greek Government that claims an exclusive prerogative over the name "Macedonia."
"If we are supporting the stability of Macedonia, can we really threaten them with sanctions for flouting the trade embargo on Serbia?" asked one Western diplomat in Skopje. The diplomat noted that 80 percent of Macedonia's trade used to be with other lands of the former Yugoslavia.
Already one third of the Macedonian work force is unemployed, and salaries have not been paid for close to two months in several state-owned enterprises. The economy is reeling from the Greek embargo, which has cut off the nearest access to the sea and to important raw materials.
But if the difficulties of Macedonia are real, so too is the damage its trade with Serbia does to the effectiveness of the United Nations sanctions. The Serbian economy, which was collapsing beneath hyperinflation late last year, has stabilized as goods have begun to pour in.
 
Empty Threats
 Indeed, at a time when the United Nations is threatening even stricter sanctions if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject a peace plan for the territorial division of Bosnia, the scene at the Macedonia border makes a mockery of such threats.
The Bosnian Serbs are well aware of the gap between announced international policy and the reality of the situation along the borders, a gap that has yawned since the beginning of the Bosnian war in 1992.
Moreover, it is clear that by adopting a moderate course with Greece, the United States is acquiescing in a Greek border policy that virtually obliges Macedonia to trade with Serbia. Even though it has recognized Macedonia, the Clinton Administration has declined to send an ambassador to its capital, Skopje.
The American presence in Macedonia was recently bolstered from 300 soldiers to more than 500. That move, one American official in Skopje said, reflected a desire to "show we are doing something about the problems in the former Yugoslavia."
 
Showing the Flag
 In Macedonia, that effort is limited to the northern border with Serbia, although tensions are at least as great on Macedonia's southern border with Greece and on the eastern border with Albania, where official support for restive ethnic Albanians in Macedonia has irritated the Macedonian Government.
The mission of the American soldiers is essentially to show their presence and so help keep the peace, but the United Nations force has no mandate to stop the expanding Macedonian-Serbian trade.
Asked about the trucks going over the border, the commander of the American battalion, Col. John Baggott, said, "I don't know if it's smuggling or what."
The people who do follow the Macedonian-Serbian trade closely come from a United Nations mission in Skopje made up of about 50 officials. But they, too, say they are powerless to enforce the embargo.
 
Truck Traffic Triples
 "Our job is to assist the Macedonian authorities and to report what is happening to the United Nations sanctions committee," said Pierre Gravel, the chief of the mission. "We restrict ourselves to that role. We cannot prevent the local authorities from allowing trade with Serbia if they choose to.
"Of course," he added, "the sanctions committee has made a number of formal protests."
Mr. Gravel said the number of trucks crossing the border each week had increased to about 1,000 from about 300 last year. Some of these trucks were empty, he said, and most of the others contained food. But many contained oil, clothes, leather, chemicals, fertilizer and cement.
Vast business interests are clearly at stake in this traffic. Earlier this month, a Canadian official arrived in Skopje to take up a job monitoring the border trade. It was to be his second assignment in Macedonia.
But the day after he arrived, he was threatened in his hotel room by local thugs who said he and his family would suffer if he interfered in the Macedonian-Serbian trade. "I arranged for the official to leave for Canada the next day," Mr. Gravel said. "We are not going to take any risks."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Mets Let It Slip Away, And Streak Is Over

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, July 30

 BODY:
Jim Lindeman wished he had played Carlos Garcia's 10th-inning shot into left field on one hop. Dallas Green pondered whether he should have let Bret Saberhagen pitch the ninth.
You play for the Mets in '94, second-guessing is an art form. 
 They had a 2-1 lead and were one out away from victory in the ninth inning tonight at Three Rivers Stadium with Saberhagen, their ace, on the mound when the Pirates scored the tying run.
And one inning later, Lloyd McClendon's pinch-hit single off reliever Eric Gunderson scored Garcia from third, providing the last bit of drama as Pittsburgh eeked out a victory over New York, 3-2, before a crowd of 29,516.
"Any time you throw eight innings of quality ball and you lose, it irks you," said Saberhagen, who gave up nine hits, two runs and struck out six with just 103 pitches in his nine full innings of work. "I'm not going to sleep well tonight. This one really ticked me off."
 
Mason Instead of Franco
 As well it should have after the Pirates' Steve Pegues fisted a single to left-center and drove home Jeff King to tie the score at 2-2 with two out in the ninth.
Electing to give John Franco, the National League's co-leader in saves, a night off after using him in five of the last six games, Green, in the 10th brought in one of his set-up men, Roger Mason, and inserted Lindeman in left field.
Garcia ripped a double, which Lindeman tried to make a sliding catch of in shallow left field. The ball scooted under his glove. "It was a ball I should've let drop," Lindeman said. "I was overly aggressive and I didn't need to be. Instead of just keeping the ball in front of me and throwing it in and making them move him over on a sac bunt, I made a major mistake."
Mason walked Jay Bell and Garcia went to third on a bungled forceout attempt at second base after Jeff Kent fielded Orlando Merced's grounder. Instead of going to first with the ball, Kent tried to go to second, and his throw pulled Jose Vizcaino off the bag.
 
Let the Debate Begin
 McClendon then lined an 0-1 pitch over a five-man infield and into right-center. The game had ended, but the second guessing had started.
Mason (2-5), who had loaded the bases before Gunderson came on with none out, took the loss. Pittsburgh's Dan Miceli (2-0) picked up the victory in relief.
The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for the Mets, who were bucking to move within two games of .500. They're now 49-53.
"I thought about using Johnny," Green said. "But he'd pitched five out of the six on this trip. Sabes was dominating in the eighth, and I thought he had enough left.
"And then Bobby slips on that ball in the ninth," Green said, referring to Bonilla's allowing a double by King to get by him down the line. "Turns out I made a bad decision."
 
Bonilla Slugs His 19th
 Until the ninth, everything was going swimmingly for the Mets. Bonilla's 19th homer of the year with Vizcaino on base in the seventh was about to send the Mets on to their first five-game winning streak of the season.
Bonilla's errant throw to first led to the Pirates' first run in the seventh when Midre Cummings's single drove in King.
The Pirates received a sharp three-hit performance from the left-handed Denny Neagle before Vizcaino's double down the right-field line in the seventh. Bonilla's homer then greatly disenchanted the Three Rivers crowd, which booed its former star lustily.
Bonilla hears the boos every time he returns to Pittsburgh. Barry Bonds heard them at the All-Star Game. Jeering their former stars has become a tradition here, so please excuse Bonilla for taking them with a smile.
"I don't care about the boos," he said. "Once you've done the Tour de New York through the tabloids, it doesn't matter anymore."
If Saberhagen was economical, Neagle was stingy. He allowed two base-runners through the first five innings and used 10 pitches to strike out the side in the fifth.
A 13th victory for Saberhagen would have given him more than any Mets pitcher in two years; Dwight Gooden had 12 last season. Saberhagen hasn't lost since June 25 against Pittsburgh.
Despite the defeat, the Mets completed their first winning month since July of 1992.
McClendon, for one, wasn't about to second-guess the Mets.
"Sabes had real good stuff, so I don't know if I would have changed that," he said, hinting that he wouldn't have brought in Mason. "Don't say we stole a game. Say we earned it. He was pitching too well to say otherwise."

HEADLINE: J.A.L. Service Comes at a High Price

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Susan Fishman Orlins asserts that "auto makers are not the only ones who could learn from Japan" after she compares customer service in trans-Pacific flights on United and Japan Airlines (Viewpoints, July 3). But Ms. Orlins neglects to mention that J.A.L.'s service comes at a high price. 
 With one of the airline industry's highest cost structures, J.A.L. has expenses that are an estimated 30 percent higher than United's (and 60 percent higher than the average for United States airlines). These high costs produce the "attention to detail" service of which Ms. Orlins is so fond. But J.A.L. survives only on the basis of Government subsidies and protection.
Yet since deregulation 14 years ago, United and other American carriers have slashed costs to emerge as the world's most efficient and lowest-cost providers of air transport -- without Government subsidies or protection. Perhaps Ms. Orlins would like to go back to the old days of high fares and lavish service in United States skies. But as the success of the bare-bones carriers like Southwest Airlines demonstrates, the overwhelming majority of American consumers prefer low fares to gourmet cuisine. The real problem is that restrictive Japanese regulations prevent Japanese fliers from making the same choice.

Exxon Will Pay $20 Million to Alaskans

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
Last week Exxon agreed to pay $20 million to Alaskan native villagers who are among the plaintiffs seeking billions of dollars in a mammoth Federal lawsuit.
 The agreement, which affects 3,500 people, is meant to pay for damage to fish, seals, kelp and other foods that native Alaskans in 18 villages harvest from coastal regions polluted by the country's worst oil tanker spill five years ago. The settlement helps solidify an evolving legal theory in environmental law: that a price tag can be put on natural resources harmed by pollution.
 
 The trial has been divided into three phases. In the first, the jury decided Exxon and the Valdez captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, were reckless. In the decisive third phase next month the jury will decide whether the $15 billion sought is an appropriate punitive damage award.
 In phase two, lawyers for fishermen argued that the Valdez disaster caused nearly $1 billion in economic injuries to fishing, the state's second-largest industry. At week's end, the jury was still out. KEITH SCHNEIDER

HEADLINE: A Sweetness Tempers South's Bitter Past

SERIES: New South and Old -- First of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SMITHDALE, Miss.

 BODY:
Black and white, they squeezed into the 150 seats in the refinished oak pews, stirring the air with hand-held fans, courtesy of the local funeral home. As more people filed in, they took up all the space along the freshly painted white walls, and then spilled into the aisles, into the new kitchen behind the pulpit, into the foyer and finally into the steamy air outside the Spring Hill Free Will Baptist Church.
"There's a sweet, sweet, spirit in this place," sang an exuberant interracial choir that gathered here in southwest Mississippi on May 15 for the rededication of Spring Hill Free Will, a small black church burned to the ground by three drunken white youths and rebuilt by some 325 black and white volunteers. "There are sweet expressions on each face." 
 It was indeed a sweet scene of racial harmony that would have been unimaginable 30 years ago. Back then, in the pitched battle for voting rights and human dignity known as Freedom Summer in Mississippi, church bombings, racial violence and murder were as much a part of life here as peach cobbler and cottonseed mills. To most whites in 1964, integration was as alien an idea as Marxism.
But across the South, where the past is so vivid and mythic it often obscures the present, what was unthinkable a generation ago is commonplace today.
Once the nation's economic laggard, the South is now its growth leader, home to 5 of the 6 states that added the most jobs over the last year and 8 of the top 10 in new manufacturing plants and plant expansions since 1991.
Between 1970 and 1990, the population of the 11 states of the old Confederacy plus Kentucky grew by 40 percent -- more than 20 million people -- twice the national growth rate. In 1970, the region accounted for about a quarter of the nation's population. By the end of this decade, it will be almost a third. The Census Bureau says that of the 10 states that will add the most residents between 1993 and 2020, 6 will be in the South.
Once a political pariah, the 11 states of the old Confederacy now make up the largest regional bloc of delegations in Congress, the first time in American history one region has had that much influence.
Once synonymous with George Wallace's defiant pledge of "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever," the South is now the undisputed center of black political power in America. Alabama and Mississippi have more black elected officials than any other states, accounting for 1,450 of the 8,015 black elected officials nationally. Ranked right behind them are Louisiana, Georgia, Texas and North Carolina.
Still, just as the South has always been defined by the polarities of gentility and violence, of a reverence for tradition and a history of convulsive change, of a biracial culture and institutionalized racism, the South remains a place of dizzying contradictions.
There is a Mississippi equally passionate about the moral virtues of prayer in school and the economic bonanza of legalized gambling. There are historic black electoral gains accompanied by momentous ones by conservative white Republicans.
There is the march of racial progress. There is the constant, wearying drumbeat of racial division. There is -- astonishingly -- nostalgia among many blacks for some aspects of segregation.
Look at it one way and you see a place miraculously transformed. Look at it another and you see a Potemkin village South, more impressive than ever before, but a place where old inequities are now cloaked in new forms.
What is indisputable, however, is that from race relations to country music to conservative values and politics, the dilemmas, divertissements and dogmas once thought to be distinctively Southern have become strikingly national.
Indeed, at a time when race is a national obsession and the nation is steadily moving south, to understand America it is necessary to make sense of the South.
 
The New South
Hospitable Place For Businesses
 Two decades ago, the armchair demographer and curveball artist Satchel Paige surveyed the American landscape and opined, "You give this country 20 or 30 more years, everybody's got any sense is moving down South." It looks as if he was right.
In 1990 alone, 129,000 more people moved from the Northeast to the South than the other way around. The region's economic output grew by 4.5 percent last year, compared with 3 percent for the nation. Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta led the nation in job creation.
With now-predictable regularity, the nation's most avidly sought industrial recruitment plums -- most strikingly high-employment, multimillion-dollar auto plants -- in recent years have come to the South. Among them are the $1.2 billion, 6,000-job Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn.; the $3 billion, 5,900-job Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.; the $2 billion, 4,000-job Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky.; the $450 million, 2,000-job BMW plant in Greer, S.C., and the $300 million, 1,500-job Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala.
Long before anyone came up with the term Sun Belt, the South's low wages and nonunion environment lured businesses, and its warm weather, low living costs and relaxed pace attracted migrants. And Jimmy Carter's election in 1976 simultaneously resurrected the South in a barrage of homey grits-and-gravy imagery and buried most of its old ghosts of segregation and Jim Crow.
 
A Dominant Force
 What is different now is that for the first time since the nation's founding, when Southerners wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and went on to occupy the Presidency for almost 50 of the nation's first 72 years, until Abraham Lincoln took office, the South has emerged as a dominant economic, political and cultural force in American life.
Suppose just 25 years ago that someone suggested that Atlanta would be home to the world's most influential television news network and would be host of the 1996 Olympics. That Charlotte would be the nation's third-largest banking center behind New York and San Francisco. That country music would be the nation's leading radio format and Nashville flooded with refugees from Los Angeles. That Fortune magazine would put Raleigh-Durham, N.C., on its cover as the nation's best city for business. That the main issue facing the Republican Party would be whether it should be dominated by evangelical Christians whose leaders are based in the South.
All of it would have seemed preposterous. All of it came true.
And in a nation where the news on race often seems unremittingly sour, the South is offering a different picture.
Seeking jobs and fleeing urban slums, blacks have been leaving Northern states in large numbers since the 1970's, reversing the historic migration patterns of midcentury. But in the 1980's, the favored destination changed from California to the South. Between 1985 and 1990, Georgia, largely because of Atlanta, had a net in-migration of 80,000 blacks, leading the nation by far.
 
Outpacing the North
 The South is also well ahead of the North in residential integration. A recent study by the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan found that all 10 of the most segregated metropolitan areas were in the North and Midwest, led by Gary, Ind., Detroit and Chicago. All 10 of the least segregated communities were in the South and West, led by Jacksonville, N.C., near Camp Lejeune.
"I've lived in eight states, and I'd rather be in the South than any place else," said Harold Jackson, who grew up in Savannah, Ga., heads his own public relations firm in Atlanta and lives in an all-black suburban subdivision of $270,000 homes that defines the good life for many Southern blacks. "My wife's from New York, and she never thought she would adapt, and now she says she'll never leave. It's not just that the opportunities are here. It's that the opportunities to solve the problems that exist are here, too."
 
The Old South
Steps Forward And Steps Back
 Not all the returning blacks have found homecoming so joyous.
George Peebles, who left Philadelphia, Miss., in 1972 to join the Navy, came home last year to bury his son, who was stabbed to death at the age of 20. He walked past the dilapidated frame houses, with their roofs sagging and their screen doors ajar, on the black side of town until he came to the Mount Nebo Baptist Church, with its monument out front to James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, the civil rights workers murdered by Klansmen 30 years ago last month.
"At the time I was coming up, you had freedom riders, you had integration, things were supposed to change," Mr. Peebles said disdainfully. "How much change do you see? They talk about great strides. To me, it's like an ant's steps when he has to travel 100 miles. Whites still own all the stores. Blacks still live here in the neighborhood behind the tracks. If anything, this state has regressed."
Indeed, vast stretches of the South, particularly those with the most blacks, remain a dismal kingdom of chicken-processing plants and catfish farms, of aging apparel mills full of black and white women working for subsistence wages. In places like the Alabama Black Belt and the Mississippi Delta, blacks have as much political power and as little economic opportunity as anywhere in America.
Even in metropolitan Atlanta, the epicenter of the Southern success story, the city itself is 70 percent black, the ninth poorest city in the United States, and, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the one with the most violent crime.
Black economic progress has been so spotty and the social backsliding in terms of crime and drugs so demoralizing since integration that a startling refrain is being heard among blacks in the South: Maybe segregation wasn't all bad.
 
A Black Nostalgia
 Of course, no blacks and very few whites want to go back to the vicious racism and institutionalized inequalities of Jim Crow. But there is a striking undercurrent of nostalgia among many blacks for the small black business, the black community school, the unified black community with lawyers and gravediggers living side by side that was lost when the South was forced to integrate.
The lament is heard even as the South is full of remembrances this year of the 30th anniversary of Freedom Summer and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and of the 40th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, in which the Supreme Court declared segregated schools unconstitutional. It is heard when blacks get together and reminisce about the old black R. B. Hudson High School in Selma, Ala., or Annie E. Colbert High School in Dayton, Tex., or Eureka High School in Hattiesburg, Miss. It is explored in books like "Colored People" by the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., or in more obscure memoirs like Clifton Taulbert's "Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored."
This spring, the Cape Fear Museum in Wilmington, N.C., in yellowed photos and tape-recorded reminiscences, paid tribute to Williston High School, the old black high school that closed its doors in 1968.
"Twenty-five years ago a death occurred in our family," one graduate, Linda Pearce, wrote in an "Anniversary Yearbook" put together last year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the school's closing. "Why? Why close our school?"
 
Loss of Community
 No one forgets the inequities in resources: the school system of the early 1950's in Wilmington that spent $65.72 a month on its black students while spending $168.73 on whites, the old school books that went to the black school after whites finished with them.
But as important to Williston graduates was a school at the heart of a unified community, where black teachers and principals demanded that children succeed, as opposed to white teachers who blacks feel often expect them to fail in integrated schools. They remember the community yard sales and cookouts and fish fries to raise money for the school, and the combination of discipline and real love they got from teachers. They remark at how every black person in town over 45, it seems, knows the prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, a bit of Middle English drummed into them at Williston.
"We were in a cocoon bathed in a warm fluid, where we were expected to excel," said Mrs. Pearce, a 1963 Williston graduate. "And then something called desegregation punctured it. We went from our own land to being tourists in someone else's. It never did come together, and I think it's on the verge of falling apart altogether now."
To many, the fond remembrances of segregation reflect the worst combination of selective nostalgia and selective amnesia.
 
The 'What If's'
 "What gets me now is that so many people are asking, 'Was integration the right thing to do?' " said Nelson Rivers, the N.A.A.C.P. regional director for the Southeast. "It's asinine. To this day I can remember bus drivers pulling off and blowing smoke in my mother's face. I can remember the back of the bus, colored water fountains. What makes it so real and dramatic now is that 40 years from now, if you were to ask people in South Africa was it worth it to end apartheid, their answer would have to be, 'Hell, yes, it was.' "
But even among the nostalgic, the issue is not whether integration should have come, but how.
"No one was willing to accept the desegregation process, so no planning was done," said Bertha Todd, a librarian at Williston and at the integrated schools afterward. "Everybody closed their eyes and said maybe this is just another thing that will go away. But it didn't go away. And we're still trying to figure out how to make it work."
 
The Future
'Beloved Home' Filled With Hope
 There is one change in race relations that is beyond dispute.
It is the degree to which so many blacks, in a logical extension of the civil rights battles of the past, are staking claim to their own vision of the South -- not as background figures on the mythic landscape of moonlight and magnolias, not as victims of oppression dragged here from Africa, but as Southerners, with as much stake in the region as any Mississippi planter or Virginia farmer.
It is Ralph Ellison, grandson of slaves and the author of "Invisible Man," saying shortly before his death this year, "You can't be Southern without being black, and you can't be a black Southerner without being white." It is Alex Haley, the author of "Roots," saying a few years back, "I don't know anything I treasure more as a writer than being a Southerner." It's John Hope Franklin, the great black historian, now at Duke University, talking at a conference this year about "our beloved South" as the nation's best hope for racial progress.
Such sentiments fuel the case for the South, one that draws as much on tradition as on change. On the one hand is the belief, shared by blacks and whites, that they live in a place still rooted in the best of its past -- in religion, in the land, in the compulsive cordiality that defines Southern life. On the other is the knowledge that for most people the South has become a better place in recent decades -- stronger economically, more racially tolerant and held in higher esteem by the rest of the nation.
It is a sense that is so strong that even Mr. Rivers, who smolders with anger at the South's racial history, suddenly sounds almost sanguine when asked to compare the South with the North.
"One thing you find more of in the South than the North is a four-letter word -- hope," he said. "Black folks in the South seem to believe things will get better here in a way you don't find amid the bitterness and frustration of cities outside the South. You don't find black folk longing to go to the North anymore, but up there they're always talking about wanting to go South, wanting to go home."
 
'People Began to Change'
 After the Baptist church service in Smithdale, after Jack Morgan had even the white folks hollering over his shouting, sweating, stomping gospel rendition of "The Little Country Church on the Hill," after a parade of black and white ministers had said that the service should be a beginning, not an end, everyone spilled outside.
In the afternoon heat, they milled about, Southerners, black and white, whose music, manners and mores flowed from the same stream, picking at paper plates full of fried chicken, biscuits, potato salad, chicken casserole and bread pudding.
There is plenty of racism left in southern Mississippi. Many of those on hand had neighbors who saw this little gathering as a festival of fools. But if the people sitting under the cedar tree at the edge of the church cemetery or on the hoods of cars felt good about themselves that day, it was easy to see why.
"We've had some bad times -- church burnings, whippings, beatings -- but when the Government began to enforce the law, people began to change," said the pastor of Spring Hill, Arelious Robinson, a tall black man in a black suit and a white straw hat who moved through the crowd exchanging greetings.
"I think this is something that will go on and on," he said. "This is a great day."

Ship Terminal At a Crossroads: Forecast Unclear

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, Mayor Abraham D. Beame proudly opened the new Passenger Ship Terminal as "the most modern available anywhere to ocean travelers." Planners hoped the terminal, on three Hudson River piers from 48th to 52d Streets, would fortify an ebbing industry that was once a local mainstay. Instead, passenger totals fell from 626,368 in 1973 to 495,451 in 1974, and the years since have been even worse.
Now the terminal is at a crossroads. Its $40 million in construction bonds are being paid off this year, and the Port Authority's operating lease is expiring. Because the terminal loses money -- earning $7 million and costing $12 million last year -- the authority says it will not stay, at least not under the current terms. "We can't continue this kind of loss," said Victoria Cross Kelly, the authority's acting general manager. 
 The city is negotiating with the authority for a two-year extension to keep the terminal open. If the authority chooses not to renew the lease, city officials say a new operator would be sought. Prospective candidates would include real-estate managers and maritime companies.
"It's vital for New York to be a cruise port," said Peter Arevalo, president of Regal Cruises.
The city plans to subsidize the terminal by inviting redevelopment of some pier space for other uses or increasing rentals of the 800-foot-long passenger buildings, where rents from trade shows and other exhibitions produce revenues rivaling ship fees.
The terminal is neither antique nor state of the art. Chris Ward, senior vice president of the City Economic Development Corporation, said it needs up to $12 million for piling repairs and upgrading to accommodate the new "mega-liners."
Passenger volume bounced back to 437,203 last year from its low, 271,157, in 1990.
"We're optimistic about the industry's strong signs of growing again," said Mr. Ward. Trips to Bermuda account for three-fourths of New York's cruises. There are also more cruises to nowhere and to New England and Canada. Most experts expect the Legionnaires' disease scare involving the Horizon to have limited effect.
The industry is unlikely to recapture its glory days, before and after World War II, when newspapers reported daily arrivals and departures. That era culminated three centuries of shipping that helped make New York a great city. Only a sliver of the once-thriving trans-Atlantic traffic remains.
Shipping was changed forever by cargo containers, jets and shorter vacations. "The pace of life has picked up," Ms. Kelly said. "People are in a hurry to reach their destination, spend a few days and return." B.L.

HEADLINE: PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: HARLEM;
Fashion Shows, Art and Music: Celebrating a Culture

 BODY:
Harlem Day, the celebration that started 20 years ago to change negative views of Harlem, is now called Harlem Week, but it actually spans three weeks -- starting tomorrow.
"We're still trying to change the image of the community," said Marko Nobles, a Harlem Week spokesman, "especially in the media." 
 Activities take place throughout Harlem and at City Hall. Events range from indoor and outdoor music concerts to economic development and youth conferences to sports, including a high school basketball tournament and tennis and basketball clinics.
On Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard between 125th and 155th Streets, there will be fashion shows, a farmers' market and a children's carnival.
On the last two days of the event, Aug. 20 and 21, there will be arts, crafts, books and antiques from African, Hispanic, Caribbean, American Indian and Asian cultures at the 369th Regimental Armory, on 142d Street at Fifth Avenue.
 On the final day of the event, called Harlem Day, there will be a petting farm, auto show, martial arts and boxing exhibitions, a black-college fair and a dance show.
"Our community is rich in culture, and this is the way we promote it," Mr. Nobles said.
Harlem Week, tomorrow through Aug. 21; for times and dates of events, (800) 558-7869.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MORRIS HEIGHTS;
Short on Services, Neighborhood Sees New Use for Old Building

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Shelby Dickson sat on a bench beside a basketball court littered with broken glass, next to an abandoned lot overgrown with weeds and strewn with garbage. Peering across Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, she looked at a four-story, white-brick building whose graffiti-covered facade incorporates two Stars of David and texts from the Talmud.
Ms. Dickson, who is 23 and grew up in Morris Heights, said she remembered passing in front of the building at No. 1835, before University Avenue was renamed, as a child. Jews from the area used to gather there at the Hebrew Institute to pray, to socialize, to play, but Hispanics and blacks long ago replaced the Jews and Irish; the institute has been shuttered for 17 years. 
 "What's so special about that building now?" Ms. Dickson asked.
If Community Board 5 has its way, the building will again serve as a neighborhood center, allowing people to take literacy courses or learn test-taking skills or simply play in safety.
The board has campaigned for a renovation for seven years, and the City Council earmarked $3.25 million two years ago. But the board could not find a nonprofit group to run the center and no funding was set aside in the recent city budget, said Ken Fogerty, the board's chairman.
The board is now pursuing two other sources of financing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development might have an interest in supporting the center because it is surrounded by Federally subsidized housing. And because of its crime-prevention potential, the project might receive support under the proposed Federal crime bill.
Mr. Fogarty, a mathematics professor at Bronx Community College, has lived most of his 54 years in the Bronx. Irish and Jewish flight depopulated the area in the 1970's, he said, but the construction of low-income residences starting in the early 1980's attracted new people. Now, he said, only two vacant apartment buildings remain, but there has been no corresponding rise in services.
Shelby Dickson's 20-year-old sister, Melanie, the mother of a 5-year-old, said the area's youngsters had nowhere to play. "The generation right below us -- kids 15, 16 -- all they're doing is smoking reefers," she said. N.O.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
On a Fashionable Avenue, an Old-Fashioned Style

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
THE number 654 has followed N. Anthony Rolfe around for more than 50 years, he says. He was assigned to an LST bearing that number as a young naval officer in 1943, and he served on it for three years.
But in and out in three years is not the way this real-estate broker and investor has operated as a civilian.
Last month he concluded a new 15-year lease with Calvin Klein for a 20,000-square-foot showcase store in a building at 654 Madison Avenue, at the northwest corner of 60th Street. Mr. Rolfe is the managing partner in the ownership group. 
 The lease will put Calvin Klein on the same block as Barney's, reinforcing the southern end of a high-fashion stretch of Madison Avenue that extends at least as far as the Ralph Lauren store at 72d Street. Along the way one passes such names as Valentino, Giorgio Armani, Versace and Gianfranco Ferre. Coming soon will be Prada, a leading leather-goods retailer, on the southeastern corner of 70th Street, and Crate & Barrel, the home furnishings retailer, at the northwest corner of 59th Street.
Mr. Rolfe's long tenure at 654 Madison Avenue and as the conversion sponsor at Imperial House, a large East Side co-op, make the case for patience, staying power and conservative financing as central elements of success in Manhattan real-estate investment.
At Imperial House, he and the late Edward Sulzberger sponsored a conversion under a noneviction plan in 1970. He sold apartments retail -- to individual tenants or to outsiders for occupancy when he had a vacancy -- but not in bulk to other investors.
"It has taken me 23 years to sell 290 apartments," Mr. Rolfe said. "We still own 46." About 100 of the sales were to tenants after the conversion took effect, made at various prices through the years.
He never pledged unsold shares to obtain new financing for other acquisitions. When the building was sold to the co-op corporation, the co-op received all the elements of the property -- the stores and the garage as well as the apartments. They provided income to strengthen the buiilding's finances, allowing it more resources for maintenance and improvements, and thereby enhancing resale values.
"It's no secret," Mr. Rolfe said. "Success in a deal is at the buy. You ask yourself, 'Can I carry it in the worst possible situation?' Staying power is the most important ingredient. You can't be overloaded with debt. You can't be looking for a quick turnaround. You don't look for liquidity.
"Harry Helmsley used to say that when things went bad in the city in the 70's the things he couldn't get rid of turned out to be the biggest bonanzas."
Mr. Rolfe, who is 70, was the brother-in-law as well as the partner of Mr. Sulzberger, who for 50 years headed the firm of Sulzberger Rolfe Inc. Mr. Sulzberger handled the management side of the business. He died in 1986. Four years later the company was sold to the Milstein family, owner of Douglas Elliman Gibbons & Ives.
Mr. Rolfe was the senior sales broker, the main dealmaker. In 1958 he represented Irving Brodsky, who was buying a small interest in the operating lease to 654 Madison as a minority partner of Mr. Helmsley and his associates. Eventually the Sulzberger-Rolfe interests bought out the other partners.
For many years Mr. Rolfe hoped to buy the land under the building -- the fee position -- which would free the owner as operating lessee from paying land rent. The fee was sold instead to a bank that was a tenant in the building. When the tenant was acquired by another bank and wanted to move, Mr. Rolfe released the bank -- Manufacturers & Traders Trust Company, based in Buffalo -- from eight remaining years on its lease as part of a deal to acquire the fee. The financial terms were not disclosed.
"OWNING the fee is the name of the game," Mr. Rolfe said. "It always was. An operating leasehold is like owning a stock. The fee is a bond. When inflation is going up you want the stock, and the bondholder is stuck. But the day comes . . ." His voice trailed off suggestively.
When "the day comes" for a co-op that happens to have been built or converted on leased land, many co-op owners are not prepared for the impact of a newly negotiated lease on their monthly maintenance charges. Long-term land leases are subject to periodic rent adjustments, sometimes as frequently as 10 years in leasehold co-ops, though usually much longer in commercial leases. The rent negotiation of renewals sometimes ends in a decision to arbitrate. The rent increase may still be drastic.
At Imperial House, the Sulzberger and Rolfe families bought (and sold to the co-op at the conversion) both the land and the building. The 29-story building consists of 378 apartments with stores on Third and Lexington Avenues, with underground parking, on the full block between 68th and 69th Streets. The seller was a partnership of Fisher Brothers, the building company, and Samuel Golding, a banker. Imperial House opened as an unregulated rental in 1961, eight years before the imposition of rent stabilization for postwar multifamily housing in New York City. Until 1969, only prewar housing was regulated.
Rent stabilization led many investor-builders to withdraw from rental development. Fisher Brothers was one of them. The Sulzberger-Rolfe group bought the property with the intention of converting it. Having paid a cash price of $12,000 a room for the 2,000 rooms, Mr. Rolfe said, they were hoping to resell to tenants at $15,000 to $20,000 a room.
But only 50 of the 378 tenants initially would buy. With rent stabilization in effect, the sponsors decided to pursue a noneviction conversion, selling vacancies and also selling to tenants if and when they decided to buy. Renewal leases were offered to renters who remained.
That meant 10 years of cash losses for the sponsor, since rents for unsold apartments were insufficient to cover the sponsor's carrying costs on those apartments. After that, sales income exceeded the maintenance shortfall, and at a growing rate, Mr. Rolfe said. "We were home free," he said.
IN 1970, the buyer of a 2,700-square-foot, 7-room apartment in the tower portion of the building (with 3 1/2 baths and 3 bedrooms) would have paid a cash price of $123,000. Twelve years later, in 1982, three such apartments sold. The prices were $625,000, $675,000 and $750,000.
In 1986 two sold, one for $1.6 million and the other for $1.25 million. In 1992 one was sold for $1.45 million. None in the line have been sold since.
At Imperial House the tower starts at the 21st floor. In the base, apartments are also large, with generous closet space. Original buyers in 1971 paid a cash price of $69,614 for a 1,756-square-foot five-room apartment on the 16th floor. The same apartment resold in 1981 for $360,000 and for $475,000 three years later. This year, the same apartment two floors lower sold for $580,000.
The underlying first mortgage on the building, allocated to these rooms, left shareholders with a mortgage burden amounting to $9,000 to $10,000 a room.
Investment by the co-op itself, and by individual owners in their apartments over the years, has helped sustain values. "A tremendous amount of money was spent by the co-op on preventive maintenance, electrical system, air-conditioning and the like," Mr. Rolfe said. Maintenance payments sustain an unusually large staff of 60. There are eight elevators, seven of them manned.
On Madison Avenue the Calvin Klein store will be on three levels plus a mezzanine on the double-height first floor, formerly used for banking. Company spokesmen declined to discuss the lease or how the space would be used, but the expectation is that it will carry Calvin Klein's full line of men's and women's clothing and also its furniture.
Most likely it won't carry the products that are merely licensed to use the Calvin Klein name, said C. Bradley Mendelson of Edward S. Gordon Company, who was the broker in the lease. "Not the underwear or the jeans," he said. "Not the socks."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Perspectives column last Sunday about the business strategies employed by N. Anthony Rolfe misstated his relationship to the late Edward Sulzberger. Mr. Rolfe was Mr. Sulzberger's son-in-law, not his brother-in-law. The article also misstated the year of Mr. Sulzberger's death. It was 1988, not 1986.

HEADLINE: Signs Of Life In County's Economy

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
NEWS this month that I.B.M. profits jumped during the second quarter of the year appeared to signal more than just a fresh start for the once-beleaguered Armonk-based computer giant. Analysts said the announcement from the county's largest private employer ended weeks of speculation that the economy in general in Westchester was finally pulling out of a slump.
There continued to be a growing list of indicators this summer that the recession -- which hit hard and lasted so long in Westchester -- was finally loosening its grip here, as it had much earlier in other parts of America. 
 Among other suggestions of better times to come for the county was a report this month from the Westchester County Board of Realtors that spring home sales hit the highest level for any quarter on record, despite rising interest rates.
Also, numbers released last week showed the county's unemployment rate for June was 5.5 percent, the lowest figure for June since 1991. Although the latest figure was up from the 4.4 jobless rate in May, the increase in June reflected a temporary influx of summer job seekers rather than a trend, the State Department of Labor reported.
There were more glad tidings in the Rostenberg-Doern Midyear Corporate Real Estate Report, which said that the June office-vacancy rate in the county dropped to 25.4 percent, from 27.1 percent at midyear in 1993. Moreover, close to 330,000 square feet of office space was absorbed in the last six months, the report said.
Also, Mastercard International, the credit card company, reported this month that it would relocate its world headquarters and 450 employees to the county by late 1995. In addition, there were queries from other big companies scouting relocation sites here, the county's Office of Economic Development reported, although it would not reveal the names of the other companies.
"Let's just say we're having lots and lots of good news lately," said Noreen L. Preston, an economist with that office. "It looks like the economy here is shifting into second gear."
Throughout the county, analysts reported stirrings of a recovery, although no one said that the economy had returned to full swing. Job recovery, especially, is expected to be slow as those companies that downsized during the recession remain cautious, along with consumers who were keeping a watchful eye on expenses, said Frank M. Surdey, an economist with the State Department of Labor.
 
Brighter Picture for I.B.M.
 For International Business Machines, its report on July 21 that second-quarter profits jumped to $689 million, or $1.14 a share, came in sharp contrast to the massive shortfall reported for the year-ago period, when the company announced an $8.9 billion restructuring charge to cover job and property reductions, among other things. Although the picture has brightened, I.B.M. has not completed its restructuring, and there are more staff reductions -- through retirements and layoffs -- to come, said Scott Brooks, a spokesman.
The company, which employs about 235,000 people worldwide, has set a target of 215,000. In 1986, I.B.M. employed 15,000 workers in Westchester; it now has only 7,300 employees here. Mr. Brooks said he did not know what the job losses would be locally during the rest the year.
I.B.M.'s most recent earnings report followed a corporate trend in many parts of the country, with companies finding that after years of downsizing, their efforts had begun to pay off in profits and earnings.
Some Westchester-based corporations, however, continued to struggle, Ms. Preston said. Among them, Texaco in Harrison announced last week that after restructuring costs and a loss on the sale of its chemicals business, earnings dropped sharply for the second quarter. Texaco reported earnings of $28 million, or 1 cent a share, a 90 percent drop from last year's $309 million, or $1.10 a share.
"Let's not isolate I.B.M.," Ms. Preston said. "We have a number of large employers in Westchester, and most of them had to downsize. What that has meant is that collectively they reduced the number of jobs available in the county."
But Mr. Surdey, at the State Department of Labor, said that the "steady erosion of jobs" in the last several years had at last begun to level off, and that 5,000 new jobs were added in June in Westchester, bringing the total to 378,700. That was the largest May-June increase in three years, he added.
"We've gone through a lot of pain, but it appears that we're on our way back," Mr. Surdey said. "Let's say we're on the runway waiting to take off.'
Although many companies were cautious about rehiring, Mr. Surdey called I.B.M.'s announcement "good news for Westchester County as a whole and hopeful for the future."
Lawrence E. Dwyer, president of the 800-member Westchester County Association, said the county, which has many big corporations within its borders, had been "a victim of all of its companies struggling to get to the right size for this economy."
He noted that while he welcomed good news about major companies -- Mastercard's relocation plans, for example -- "greater activity among small and medium-size companies was equally important."
"It's not just the outward signs of big businesses relocating here, it's a new enthusiasm from many parts of the economy that we're feeling," he said, adding that the banking community was joining in the economic optimism, specifically in terms of its growing willingness to help start-up companies and take on higher-risk loans.
At the Westchester County Board of Realtors, P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president, said sales of 1,900 homes were finalized during the second quarter of the year, which represented close to a 41 percent increase over the same period last year.
He said the the median sale price of a one-family house was $292,00. compared to the late 1980's, when prices soared above $300,000 -- making sale prices "flat now and affordable."
Realtors reported that the market appears to be dominated by first-time buyers who seem to feel secure in the current job market -- as opposed to "more senior employees who by and large are not as optimistic," Mr. Mercurio said.
 
$200 Million Shopping Mall
 Looking at the commercial real estate market, the Rostenberg-Doern Company, in its midyear report, noted that Greenburgh-based Ciba Corporation's decision earlier this year to remain in the county and to lease 425,000 square feet at the Tarrytown Corporate Center for its new headquarters -- including a 150,000 square-foot laboratory -- was "one of the largest lease deals in the county since the early 1980's."
Ciba, which has 1,000 employees, now occupies 59 acres in Ardsley and 6 acres in Hastings-on-Hudson.
In the county's central business district, downtown White Plains, the office-vacancy rate remained higher, and at the midyear point it had dropped only to 33.7 percent, compared with 34.9 percent a year ago.
But George J. Delaney, president of the Westchester Business Partnership, a nonprofit public-private venture promoting the county to prospective businesses, noted that despite the city's vacancy rate, it was thriving economically. He added that a $200 million shopping mall in the city will generate 2,500 full- and part-time jobs when completed.
 
Ripple Effect From Manhattan
 As the economy in general appeared to regenerate, the hotel industry, which has been hard hit by slowdowns in other business sectors, also noted stirrings of activity. Marcia Dmochowski, president of the Westchester Hotel Association, which represents 20 area hotels, said there had been a 2 percent growth rate in recent months. "Companies are having to feel optimistic before they plan product roll-out meetings or increase travel budgets," she said. "Traditionally, the hotel industry lags behind other sectors."
The state's elimination in September of the 5 percent tax on hotel rooms costing more than $100 a night is expected to further benefit the industry, Ms. Dmochowski said, although she added that it would "take some time for the word to get out."
While Westchester appeared to be emerging from the recession -- although "riding the crest later than the rest of the country," Ms. Preston said -- it was finally feeling a ripple effect, especially from Manhattan, where new jobs were being generated in financial and computer services.
Ms. Preston said Westchester lagged behind in large part because its job base was tied directly to the large companies situated here. "We've had all of our eggs in one basket," she said.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
A Summer Boot Camp For Budding Executives

BYLINE: By Deborah L. Jacobs; Deborah L. Jacobs, an independent journalist based in New York, specializes in legal and business topics.

 BODY:
WHILE her friends went to field hockey camp, baby-sat or worked as lifeguards this summer, Kacie Croson, 16, spent millions of dollars -- much of it borrowed -- in a struggle to turn a fledgling computer company into a profitable venture.
Thankfully, it was a hypothetical venture, the central challenge of a two-year-old all-girls program called Camp Entrepreneur, based at Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa. Kacie, who lives in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, was one of about 40 girls who signed up for the camp. At first, she recoiled at the idea. "It would be like a camp for geeks," she told her father, an engineer and owner of his own business. But by the end of the program, she had drafted a business plan, made a pitch for financing from venture capitalists and heard tips from bankers about how to apply for a business loan -- and she was enthusiastic. 
 "If you enjoy what you're doing and learn from it, then you can succeed," said Kacie, who thinks she might be the president of her father's company someday. For the moment, she is working her way up through the ranks, filing, typing and sorting mail.
Camp Entrepreneur is sponsored by the National Education Center for Women in Business, which studies and promotes opportunities for women business owners. The camp offers two one-week sessions for high school students -- one at the center's headquarters at Seton Hill, the other at the University of Denver -- as well as a new weeklong session for 10- to 14-year-olds at Seton Hill.
The enrollment in all three sessions is so far limited to girls, said Cynthia Iannarelli, director of the women's business center, because many of them "get shortchanged" in coed classrooms. While boys in coed classes learn competition, strategy and teamwork, she said, girls tend to sit back and listen. By the time they become teen-agers, girls "rate themselves as less smart than boys," she said.
At Camp Entrepreneur, girls meet role models like Ms. Iannarelli, who has helped to run her family's dry-cleaning business since her father died 15 years ago. At that turning point, the company's lawyer proposed putting all the stock for the family's five Pittsburgh stores in the name of Ms. Iannarelli's younger brother; the lawyer predicted Ms. Iannarelli would get married and lose interest. The family found a new lawyer.
At least half the girls who go to Camp Entrepreneur, which costs $490 for the week, including room and board, are children of business owners. Emme Barfield, 17, whose mother is a seamstress and owner of her own business in Macon, Ga., liked to play store as a little girl and hopes to own a restaurant. Kristen Kart, 16, from Pittsburgh, is editor of The Next Generation, a newspaper for teen-agers that her father, Harvey Kart, started.
Mr. Kart said he encouraged his daughter to attend the camp because he wants her to be better prepared than he was to enter the world of business. A former teacher, he said he was discharged from a variety of sales positions before settling upon his current career as a publisher. "I'm not trying to push her," he told friends who suggested Kristen might be happier this summer working as a lifeguard. "I'm just trying to be realistic."
After a teary farewell when her parents dropped her off at the camp, Kristen, like Kacie, became enthusiastic. "I learned that jobs can be exciting," said Kristen, who volunteered last summer in an occupational therapy program and said she found it boring. The guest speakers at Camp Entrepreneur, including Ms. Iannarelli, "loved their jobs," she said. What's more, the camp "teaches you how to work in a team with people you never met before and how to make decisions that could affect your life," she said.
The course relies heavily on a computer game called "The Marketplace," which simulates the steps of starting and running a computer company for two years. Students work in teams of three, making all decisions from coming up with a name to advertising and raising capital for expansion. Players must be mindful of income and expenses. If expenditures exceed revenues, a loan shark offers a bailout at 25 percent interest.
Students start the game with $2 million in capital, but soon exhaust it and must borrow, said Ernest R. Cadotte, a professor of marketing and author of the software. This forces them to answer loan officers' "tough questions," said Mr. Cadotte, who teaches at the University of Tennessee's College of Business Administration in Knoxville.
Some elements of the software grew out of Mr. Cadotte's own unsuccessful effort in the 1970's to market an electronic suggestion box for restaurant customers. After making an unprofitable licensing deal for the product, Mr. Cadotte left the business but wrote "The Marketplace" to help others learn from his mistakes.
Among the lessons for users at Camp Entrepreneur: don't be afraid to say what you think, be willing to take risks and "you have to spend money in order to make money," said Jennifer Oldham, 17, from Hilliard, Ohio. She worked with Kacie on the "New Era Computer Company," which doubled its sales after increasing spending for advertising.
What insights emerge from a single-sex program for high school students? Sarah Eichorn, 15, from Sayre, Pa., said that it "wasn't as competitive as it would have been if there had been boys there" -- and that that was good. Sometimes boys don't understand "you need to cooperate and not just be like the touchdown winner," she said.
Still, plans for Camp Entrepreneur include the possibility of a similar program for boys, Ms. Iannarelli said. In addition to teaching entrepreneurship, she said, the camp would prepare boys to do business with a growing number of women-owned enterprises.
